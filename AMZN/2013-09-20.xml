It has a record 240MM shares short at that massive misvaluation with respect to the marketplace. Even if/as the architecture is losing ground, it is still a full generation ahead of everyone else (which in the manufacturing economics of photolithography means it needs half the area to make the same chip and thus has high margins on EVERYTHING it manufactures, even ARM architectures). If the USD weakens LT as it loses sole global reserve, INTC is better positioned than anyone from its domestic manufacturing intensity. I deal in facts.

You never once had concern for the Fed's QE games the last year as you put up one trading short into higher parabolic prices after another. And now you find religion on their QE and constant "urging" -messages to cover. You're not just a slimey fraud, you're more annoying than Geegenjar, and that's saying alot.</Msg><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1379700593161</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 14:09:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379700640384-73</Id><Title>i am seeing 300 next week</Title><Msg>eom</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1379700640384</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 14:10:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379700730594-74</Id><Topic><Title>i am seeing 300 next week</Title><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1379700640384</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 14:10:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>XDON? didn't you call for S&amp;P 1560 last week?

I think all public markets are now a scam because very little of it is "investing" even though it is couched as such. It is glorified skimming. WS institutions skim assets from John Q. Public and his/her 401K and pension funds. But, within the broader scam, Amazon epitomizes what is wrong with "investing" in the markets today. It has only to do with institutional control of float and quant/algo option scalping. Nothing more.

Even if everything goes perfectly, it will be hard for Amazon to avoid raising new debt or equity. Most likely, the crooks that will be underwriting it are doing the same thing now as last time.
