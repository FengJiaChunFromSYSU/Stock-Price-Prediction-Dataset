Amazon and our financial structure are what is killing the velocity of money because money and financial wealth are constantly being centralized. Buy from local merchants who in turn reinvest locally. Invest in real estate and local entrepreneurs (not restaurants but those investing in innovations that could enhance our productivity and reduce our cost structure When we as individual start voting our values with our wallets (sell funds with large positions in trading scam stocks like this one, buy from local merchants rather than tax evading internet ones), the system will change. The collective effect of our individual actions can be significant. Tell your friends and family how distorted the market is. Help them to understand that Amazon's race to the bottom (subsidized by the US taxpayer first via online tax subsidy, now via evasion with "fulfilled by Amazon" and by via Benny #$%$ printfest) literally is destroying jobs everywhere. It is NOT because it is inherently more competitive (WMT and TGT have better long term cost structures), but simply because of the artificially low cost of capital and the incessant pumpfest from WS games. Make sure they sell all Amazon stock they have. This is a once in a lifetime exit opportunity -- low capital gains while there still are gains to be had. Start changing the way the system works, starting with your own financial decisions. It is time that our capital worked for us instead of against us...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354366854197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 08:00:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354367423480-4</Id><Topic><Title>theres the test your last chance to sell at the top</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1354308901486</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 15:55:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, the company that had to borrow $3B is going to push around those with $50 and $100B in cash and $15 and $50B in cash flow...

Geeg, NAS and Nem perpetually attack the shorts around here, quite personally and multiple times a day. Reflect on your post and consider the apparent irony to those of us who don't know you yet... I looked at some of your posts and you've added reasonable perspective on some stocks/companies and market mechanics in the past. I hope you choose to do so here as well rather than engaging in personal attacks. Trust me, we have enough that already (you can find a nearly unlimited number of posts attacking me, but I always try to stay focused on content. Admittedly, sarcasm got a little of the better of me earlier tonight). I find Sybs posts entertaining (I voted thumbs up for Sybs rather than thumbs down as that was an attack on Geeg). Sybs is actually a decent person who happens to have a very bearish view of the future. He brings some levity to the board. Take it for what it is...
