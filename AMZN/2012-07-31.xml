Cash balance will ultimately determine the stocks fate. Great companies produces lots of cash and companies like Apple have a hard time hiding the earnings because of all the cash generated by the organization. Amazon has the opposite problem - net cash declining every year, every quarter. Cash plus receivables less payables and accrued expenses last 5 quarters. Net Cash(3,959) (2,960) (2,749)(1,156) (252) More in the hole every quarter. But the gross margin is expanding - so everything will be okay right? Wrong. Taking short term working capital and investing in long term assets will not result in greater cash generation in the futures because of low return on investment of those invested assets. Same day delivery will be costly from every perspective and unless Walmart/Costco/myriad other on-line retailers/etc all decide to fold at once - pricing competition will be fierce. End result - consumers win and retailers and their stockholders loose. See airline industry for the playbook on how this works. After 2Q results for amzn we see a stock that is so far over its skis that a hard landing in not highly probable it is absolutely certain.</Msg><Username>dutchboyinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1343725740000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 05:09:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343731932000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Follow the Cash</Title><Username>dutchboyinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1343725740000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 05:09:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"End result - consumers win and retailers and their stockholders loose" I'll add a winner: insiders who get to sell at marvelous price multiples over the market on the heavy support of runnups.</Msg><Username>mets41us</Username><Timestamp>1343731932000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 06:52:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343734827000-8</Id><Title>AMZN will never stop building warehouses</Title><Msg>that's where AMZN will hide a prop up the accounting ....expect this for years to come , if AMZN needs to hold on .

Naturally cash flow drops when you are engaged in large spending programs. But those who realized that ROIC getting cut in half during that time also realized it would go up and by a lot after the investment cycle eased. Not only did ROIC go way up mere quarters later, but it exceeded the previous high (44%) by a relative 25%. Those who held onto their shares even as ROIC and cash flow was decreasing (shares were $35 then) saw a gain of 160% as the stock went over $91 in 4Q07. So what pays is not to know where the cash flow trend has been. When a company is investing and spending large we all know what that will be. It is to know where cash flow will be AFTER the spending eases, because most of the upside, as in the cycle I describe above, was baked in by the time knowledge of the record levels of cash flow were finally reported.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343737586000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 08:26:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343738206000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Follow the Cash</Title><Username>dutchboyinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1343725740000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 05:09:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good luck with that thesis.Law of large numbers,etc You had a great run.You've been nothing more than lucky and still you remain foolishly arrogant.Good luck.

But the company still grew a lot anyway. Blew away the shorts. As you will or have been blown away, too. They grew 32% last quarter. So much for the Law of Large Numbers. I guess once they make to a few trillion this Law will start to do with shorts keep hoping for. But then again, maybe not. "You had a great run." Still having a great one, too. And laughing at your dumb shorts on top of it. "I have been trading for 25 plus years. I have seen everything." Have you seen yourself go bankrupt, then? No? Then you may be about to see something that you have not seen yet soon. "Its stock price will halve at a minimum." If it halves from $1000 to $500 then how does this help the current shorts? "One false move and the stock collapses." I doubt that. But one false move by you and you lose your shirt. That I have little to no doubt about. "I say immediately following January." Can you post some links to your previous predictions on Amazon share prices. I'd like to see how reliable you've been or if you post nothing to know simply to laugh at your prediction and dismiss it.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343738788000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 08:46:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343738993000-19</Id><Title>swosh - major estimate cutting day</Title><Msg>13 cents to -7 cents for this quarter 72 cents to 56 cents next quarter (to be cut further, no doubt) 1.22 to 89 cents this year ?! good thing we're up 2.60 to 2.46 next year yeah, go AMZN... lets have another rally on this !?!</Msg><Username>anacon02</Username><Timestamp>1343738993000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 08:49:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343739098000-20</Id><Topic><Title>swosh - major estimate cutting day</Title><Username>anacon02</Username><Timestamp>1343738993000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 08:49:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow, AMZN will crush earnings again !!! no worries</Msg><Username>anacon02</Username><Timestamp>1343739098000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 08:51:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343739311000-21</Id><Topic><Title>swosh - major estimate cutting day</Title><Username>anacon02</Username><Timestamp>1343738993000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 08:49:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is why they are called Amazon ....

Amazon is doing just fine and all the companies that compete with it are in for trouble. So are the shorts. "Its aggressive CapEx heading into a tightening and likely competitive responses from the titans with whom it picked fights blah, blah..." Such companies are impotent to do squat. Apple proved this by stooping to breaking the law in a price fixing scam. And by flopping in their last earnings report missing estimates and being punished for it. With all their problems in the core business they have no time or energy to focus on the things shorts hope will save their money losing short positions from losing even more money. "blah, blah...is going to create real pain for shareholders stupid enough to hold into Q4..." Pretty funny coming from this short who was stupid enough to short from $180 or whatever sub-$200 figure he wishes to quote. And who became so frustrated he had to go away for months and "refocus". Back in the 180s he was also singing the same tune telling longs they were "stupid" to hold and would soon feel "pain" yet today the stock is nearly $240. The pain comes from laughing at his dumb prediction I guess and being up 44% from when he said we should get out. We can translate his "get out before 4Q in the same way". His broken algorithm must mean it will be up 44% by then.

You showed up hear around $180 and whatever the exact figure the stock then when you were telling me to sell, it is today closer to $240. Your algorithm was wrong. Admit it. "The people I care about on these boards know my track record" Which is that you got lucky on a couple of mediocre stocks way below the calibre of an Amazon by using an algorithm that proved to be broken here and went you scurrying away to "refocus" for the months you have been AWOL here. "AMZN's cash flow yield is blah, blah...makes AMZN inherently more risky than it was before..." Ah, cash flow usually is when a company is heavily investing. You have zero integrity by making such uniformed comments here. It also makes the upside much bigger than it was before ROIC: 3Q05 44% 3Q06 23% 4Q07 55% In other words Amazon has a track record of doubling ROIC mere quarters after slowing of an investment cycle where ROIC has temporarily dropped. A track record I'm sure much better than your gambling with broken algorithms on mediocre stocks. "Nemesis, spend your time trying to intimidate/BS someone else." I'm just trying to do you a favor and save you from losing all the lucky money that made you so arrogant using your fake algorithm on those mediocre stocks, not trying to intimidate anyone. "The times they are a changing..." Yes, your algorithm is broken for these times with Amazon and if you don't fix it you'll lose all your money quick.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343741663000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:34:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343741712000-40</Id><Title>AAPL +11...

The difference is that Apple is generating more in CASH FLOW a year than AMZN generates in revenues... In fact, Apple generates more cash flow from iTunes (content) than AMZN generates across all categories. "AMZN is simply expanding its mix" He thinks he is a genius for figuring this out. "and it will end up trending toward lower value density items" This is irrelevant. If I sell $100 of stuff at high density it can be dwarfed by selling $1 trillion at a density that is not as high. Amazon's business model is for a high dollar value, not a high density value, the latter of which which can be totally meaningless.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343742421000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:47:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343742428000-56</Id><Topic><Title>233.75 very critical.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1343655996000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 09:46:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooah!</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1343742428000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:47:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343742451000-57</Id><Topic><Title>233.75 very critical.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1343655996000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 09:46:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nonsense.</Msg><Username>racecap</Username><Timestamp>1343742451000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:47:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343742461000-58</Id><Topic><Title>buy here!</Title><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1343742411000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:46:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why hurry went you can get it for much less</Msg><Username>chalkdusttourture</Username><Timestamp>1343742461000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:47:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343742505000-59</Id><Title>buy buy buy</Title><Msg>.........</Msg><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1343742505000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:48:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343742542000-60</Id><Title>anyone hearing this stock is over ...and bear raid will commence</Title><Msg>shortly? herb G is writing his report up as i type will cover 10 years of the scam this is and point out some holders????</Msg><Username>notoriousbono</Username><Timestamp>1343742542000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:49:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343742622000-61</Id><Title>one upgrade and this would b over 240</Title><Msg>immediately.

All the badnwaggon shorts are going to get hurt. Piling in with too much too quickly. As a short, this has an extraordinary 12 month ROI. But, people are getting ahead of themselves and trying to recover from the earnings squeeze too quickly. Those that do will lose more and then lack the capital to profit from the real drop. Patience. I am at 25% of the position I would happily maintain for a year at $300. The ONLY thing that keeps AMZN up here is an open ended QE pegged to a higher inflation target and higher employment target (because unemployment rates drop from discouraged workers and it will be much harder to get employment ratios up). Having said that, there are other world class exporters that would benefit far more from such a policy. I'm long a couple of those names and will make more there than I lose here... Relax folks.

It's competitive set going forward is Apple, Google and Wal-Mart. The weakest have been pruned. Going forward, AMZN is going up against nimble, competitive tech companies (who live the "only the paranoid survive" mentality and ALWAYS innovate and improve the consumer value proposition) and WalMart (who has sufficient scale and world class logistics and has been doing just fine in an era with Amazon getting an artificial subsidy that is coming to an end...).

No, because no one, except for you and maybe one or two other clowns here seem to think margins will remain at investment cycle levels.

Shorts said precisely the same in 1999 and after that they made $billions in profit. Ho-hum. Robotics increase fulfillment speed per employee by 3 times. So the comparison simply goes from Revenue per Employee (Pre-Kiva): Amazon: $230,000 Walmart: $60,000 Revenue per Employee (est. Post-Kiva): Amazon: $690,000 Walmart: $60,000 (Not all employees are involved in fulfillment but a great deal of them are so the point is productivity is headed way up, not down.)

Apple is. iPhones. And it is one of their core businesses. As for iPads notice how the article said Apple's share "climbed back..." Each time new models are released share shifts back and forth. But for Apple they only have 4 products and when one fails to perform as expected that is such a cash cow it has a huge impact on the stock.

That is how they have changed. “I'm done wasting my time with someone who isn't smart enough to understands the differences between past investment cycles and this” The only differenc is that you had no skin in the game on the last one and you do for this one which accounts for your blindness and your bias which causes you in vain to rationalize your current losses.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343757232000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:53:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343757266000-238</Id><Topic><Title>Serious Question</Title><Username>d1synergeticpsi</Username><Timestamp>1343685785000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 18:03:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Because they have a better track record at generating huge profits " huh? in what measurement? they have traded publically since 1997 and have not paid a dividend yet have only $2 billion of retained earnings: where's the track record there of generating huge profits? retained earnings are a track record of profits: especially woeful when you consider they never paid a shareholder dividend. so again? where is the track record of huge profits: it's market cap is 50 times those lifetime profits: they are not close to a history of huge profits.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1343757266000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:54:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343757371000-239</Id><Topic><Title>Serious Question</Title><Username>d1synergeticpsi</Username><Timestamp>1343685785000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 18:03:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"shorts predicting bankruptcy and other kinds of disasters." never predicted that. doesn't mean it deserves a premium to 50 times retained earnings and multiples better than say an AAPL: that is actually paying out profits to shareholders: that's stability.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1343757371000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:56:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343757527000-240</Id><Topic><Title>Serious Question</Title><Username>d1synergeticpsi</Username><Timestamp>1343685785000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 18:03:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Do you think margins have anything to do with eps?"

Nothing I've seen rules that out either. To get to 10% you have to get back to over 5% first. We can take up that discussion at the appropriate time.

Couldn't I take the same criteria you are using today regarding Amazon and use that to tell someone when I my shares got cut in half during the tech crash that I ought to have sold my Apple shares and gotten out of the a stock which had little cash and tiny profits?</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343760347000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 14:45:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343760497000-270</Id><Topic><Title>Serious Question</Title><Username>d1synergeticpsi</Username><Timestamp>1343685785000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 18:03:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I've owned them since single digits" Oops.

But Bezos is the face and chief of Amazon, so Amazon is drawn in. Companies like JCP and Starbucks have been pro gay marriage, while Chic fil A is anti and may face boycott and pickets. While endorsing gay marriage may be correct (or not) and a brave move, it may have consequences for business. Will the right wing nuts still patronize Amazon? I'm not sure. Maybe Amazon doesn't need them or want them as customers. Maybe it won't be an issue for Amazon. Anyway, I think Bezos should be applauded for supporting gay rights and marriage.

I guess that tells you how much more cautious tech investors have to be and blows away the myth of high barriers. That goes for all of tech, since the tech bubble most never recovered and valuations have gone way down across the board. Tech is simply "out of fashion" as an investment. People don't understand the issues. And today's hot product can be easily replaced by a slew of second generation clones produced by Asian firms or whomever. The comparisons you make have more to do with the risks people perceive in the sectors you name. You might think that Apple will be as profitable a company forever but most of the market does not and hence the lower valuation.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343764309000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 15:51:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343764319000-295</Id><Topic><Title>market crash coming--225 next</Title><Username>km201300</Username><Timestamp>1343762379000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 15:19:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you have to admit a lot of people with greed out there. anyone buying a stock at 245 times earnings.

Compared to $7 million in net income. Classroom accounting has nothing to do with reality. Amazon under GAAP is allowed to take these charges within certain limits at their own discretion. You need to take a class in GAAP accounting. To me it looks as if they are going to take the charges over a roughly two year period or so which I think is about the most aggressive amortization allowable under GAAP but is pretty typical of Amazon and tends to drive shorts nuts since they erroneously believe the quarterly amortization amounts to be miniscule and hence immaterial.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343765494000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 16:11:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343765578000-317</Id><Topic><Title>market crash coming--225 next</Title><Username>km201300</Username><Timestamp>1343762379000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 15:19:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nemesis is an exper and everyone else is stupid, except that we understand what is capitalized and depreciated (or amortized as goodwill) and what is not.

It is only a joke if you can randomly make up a figure that makes you laugh right now. Anyone can do that. After the last investment cycle in the first holiday quarter (4Q07) the E doubled to bring it back to slightly over the pre-investment cycle level (4Q05) but then after that it exceeded the 4Q05 amount by about 13% (4Q08) and doubled the 4Q05 amount in 4Q09. So I guess the joke was on the short who thought it would be stuck at half of where it had been a year ago (4Q05). They got blown out as the stock rose from 35 to 90 when the E doubled from that level.

The highest your TTM shows is about $2.50. that is almost 100 times earnings in the best of times for them. To get down to just a PE of 30 they have to triple their best TTM EPS ever. As they grow their overhead grows. They also are in low margin AWS hosting business. Super competitive and commodity service. No margin. I love amazon as a customer but as an investor it has the wrong price tag on it. At best this is a $50 stock based on a 20x multiple off a hopeful earnings of 2.50 EPS someday. Who knows if that day will be 10 or 20 years away making this a waste of an investment at today's price. The market has priced in 20 years ahead so buying today and hoping for more gains is just a ponzi hope.

This country has been ruined by this so-called political correctness; sacificing the future of this country and sacrificing the rights of other people who still believe the traditional family value and the importance of that family value to our human society.

Bezos deserves to be punished for his flagrant expenditure supporting a sinful society. I say boycott Amazon big time. There are other ways to manage taxes, health benefits, etc. than to reduce the institution of Holy matrimony to this disgusting arrangement. The homosexuals are trying along with some liberals who just don't have a moral base to steal our instituion of marriage. I protest and you abnormal people can just stay abnormal as long as you don't push it on the rest of us and teach it in the government schools.</Msg><Username>prospec5</Username><Timestamp>1343780779000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 20:26:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343783679000-374</Id><Topic><Title>Am I dreaming?</Title><Username>elianoralpz811</Username><Timestamp>1343734946000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 07:42:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>brilliant analysis</Msg><Username>myrtiayow961</Username><Timestamp>1343783679000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 21:14:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343787745000-375</Id><Topic><Title>Good post on seekinalpha</Title><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1343776893000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 19:21:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So far increasing revenue has cost them earnings. Increasing them further will cost them more. The gross margin expansion is bogus, since most of the cost after gross margin is variable and goes up with sales. It goes up at a faster rate as we have seen, as they are buying sales with margin. That's not investment. If they buy a sale today, that's done. If they want more they have to buy more again.</Msg><Username>anacon02</Username><Timestamp>1343787745000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 22:22:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343790674000-376</Id><Topic><Title>Just said a little prayer that the bottom</Title><Username>liscftoo</Username><Timestamp>1343762380000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 15:19:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>may as well pray for religion not being bs</Msg><Username>overvaluation9</Username><Timestamp>1343790674000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 23:11:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343793310000-377</Id><Topic><Title>Serious Question</Title><Username>d1synergeticpsi</Username><Timestamp>1343685785000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 18:03:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What was it at the lows of the second day after earnings?</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343793310000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 23:55:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
