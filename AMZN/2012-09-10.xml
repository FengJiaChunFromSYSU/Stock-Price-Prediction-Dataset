Problem right now is that the government is printing $ to pump up stocks. This will stop in the future due to loss of confidence in the scam, and the bubble stocks will collapse because there is no real earning or dividend to support current stock value. Right now, Scamazon is acting like a lottery ticket. Millions of buyers but only one winner...the few who sold at the top. No stock in the history of the market can sustain absurd valuation. They all collapse when reality does not meet expectation. Traders and the average investors are conditioned to act to make them feel good "right now", even though 99% of these people are wrong in the long term. Successful people filter out these short term noises and stay focused on the big picture. This is a Marathon.

Last week in a legal finding, Judge Denise Cotes accepted the Ebook settlement with 3 publishers, which basically says that Amazon can go back to selling Ebooks at below cost. Jeff loves to go around telling everyone that they deserve low-cost Ebooks and I think he will have a customer revolt on his hands if he now tries to sell Ebooks for more the $9.99.

As stupid as they come. Just wrote an article how Amazon is going to crush Apple because Apple cannot match Amazon's prices, therefore AMZN will dominate the tablet market. A few points. 1) Apple has superior hardware unit economics. As the largest purchaser of electronic components in the world, it has pricing power with all suppliers. It also has superior marketing/promotion economics as it reaches a wider audience than Amazon with fewer SKUs to promote. 2) All of the "spin" on the ebook ruling is that it is great for Amazon because it can now cut prices. But, AMAZON'S MODEL IS NOW ENTIRELY DEPENDENT UPON REALIZING ITS PROFITS FROM CONTENT. The irony is priceless. Apple and Google can simply undercut Amazon's content pricing across the board by 10% and Amazon is hosed. The DOJ will have NO CASE against them because it forced the issue in the first place. It is a business model competition and one that Apple and Google will win by getting hardware costs relatively close to Amazon and then undercutting on content (plus, they should find some infringing IP and file a suit to boot). Apple's Pandora like play is just the beginning. Expect it and Google to launch a NFLX like service as well. When it is all said and done, Amazon will find that it can extract very little in the way of rents on digital content. And it will have burned insane cash on the experiment... The point is that Apple and Google have the cash to take the fight to Amazon on kick it in the #$%$ And, now that this is just good old business model competition that Amazon started, no one will be able to protect it...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347325334617</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 21:02:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347327201857-69</Id><Topic><Title>Rob Enderle is a complete #$%$..</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347325334617</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 21:02:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rob and most of the analyst community seems to be living in the past on this issue. Now, Apple and Google can attack Amazon's cash generating machine with impunity. Amazon sells hardware at a loss. They can sell content at cost, ensuring near zero content profit contribution for Amazon. How long will Amazon soar in that environment??? It's going to create a very interesting survival challenge over the next 2 years since it has exploding overhead/fixed costs and personnel costs (and when the stock stops going up, other compensation will have to increase to retain people since the valuation scam will no longer create wealth for top performing employees). The bottom line is whatever price Amazon can offer on content, Apple and Google can offer a better one because that it not where THEY make they majority of their money (and they generate 10's of billions in profits a year that they can afford to deploy strategically to blunt Amazon's consumer value proposition).</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347327201857</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 21:33:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347327513800-70</Id><Topic><Title>Rob Enderle is a complete #$%$..</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347325334617</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 21:02:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post - thumbs up dude....

A sign of a market turn is failed ipo's. there are plenty of other signs indicating these markets are fvcked as well.... So sybil asks why lose 50% on fb when you coulddivest of amzn and make 80%? Dont over think it into stoopidity tech... Just listen to sybil, and you'll be ok...

Sold some puts, so I might own it if it falls a lot. GMCR served me rather well but I am out again now (I take some pride in having pivoted to long at $17 and taking abuse from shorts on that board after having been short it at $110 while taking abuse from longs and having made the right call both times based upon fundamentals, although I have to admit that I think what drove it was the rumor of the day that Einhorn was covering...) Fundamentals do actually matter as AMZN longs will find out the hard way.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347331681904</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 22:48:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347331792518-79</Id><Title>Amzn is on the green mile</Title><Msg>Its about to get fried....</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1347331792518</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 22:49:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347333256443-80</Id><Topic><Title>NTWK $5.3 UP 33c....BREAKING OUT!! NEW TARGET $16...NEW CLOUD DIVISION ANNOUNCEMENT IS HUGE!!..September 6, 2012. NTWK created a new division, NetSolCloudVM, that will offer infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), initially targeting the North American market. Set to launch in September as a division of NetSol North America, NetSolCloudVM will provide clients with IT infrastructure on a monthly tiered subscription basis</Title><Username>nick.jr40</Username><Timestamp>1347287059697</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 10:24:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NTWK has been up every day after a minor post-record earnings profit taking. The stock is just starting to rally and with a 3 million share float $15 soon is just around the corner (see chart). That would make it a 12 forward PE which is conservative for a company expecting to deliver $1/share net income and grow revenues 40% in 2013.........still very cheap even at $15. More importantly it's cloud division Vroozi is growing exponentially and they just announced another North America cloud business unit. Larger companies are swallowing fast growing enterprise cloud providers with SAP and ORCL certification and compatibility. NTWK has a much greater upside than AMZN......NTWK will for sure double/triple or more. AMZN is maxed out and will NEVER reach $500 or higher</Msg><Username>nick.jr40</Username><Timestamp>1347333256443</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 23:14:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347334361387-81</Id><Title>#$%$ bought all the way to 260, every buyer today is a bagholder way to start my puts out in the green</Title><Msg>I told you, you should be loading in RENN long and getting oct jan apr puts on Scamazon The scamazon song will go something like this I loaded in Amazon because of the messiah kindle fire Soon amzn was suppose to go 350 and even me the crackhead can retire.
