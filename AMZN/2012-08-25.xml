Not for everyone. I have paid for shipping every time I use Amazon. I use Netflix, not Amazon Prime, but might switch as their video library builds up. I have purchased things, mostly books, that simply aren't available in local stores. I don't mind paying sales tax to reputable retailers. I enjoy getting emails from Amazon as opposed to some of the scams I get that I can't unsubscribe to because they use a different address each time.

And I also explained that many of the costs are capitalized cost to the balance sheet: distribution centers, liscensing of content etc. which flys in the face of earings being affected on operational income. So what are your assumptions based on? Sounds like out of thin air and complete puff assumptions. You sound like a pumper on that one.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1345909124339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 11:38:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345909596518-19</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN Gainded All of Best Buy Just Today</Title><Username>davecarneyinc</Username><Timestamp>1345839390166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 16:16:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Unlimited permanent QE coming!" with crude oil flirting with $100 and gas prices $4.10 here on 87 and climbing: it's gonna be interesting to see what this force does as the Fed builds an asset bubble further on leveraging their balance sheet: it's not a riskless proposition for them to lever up with bonds if a bond blowup comes down the road, along with increased stagflationary forces from printing too much money for malinvestment. they've done this twice in 12 years already and in 2008, $150 oil put the economy in a deer in headlights situation.

Just like the insider selling here is when insiders have sold some AMZN stock for 11 years, or ....sales tax collection is gonna affect AMZN. What's next shorts? B/c AMZN is right at new all time highs despite all these sky is falling assumptions none of them are new except this Android one now! Won't matter a hill beans to AMZN . In fact, it will most likely rally on the back of the strong move up in AAPL Monday. next excuse shorts?</Msg><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1345931962416</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 17:59:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345935397908-23</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN real PE = 8</Title><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1345867325335</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 00:02:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>party: I am an options trader who has been burned 3 times out of 4 shorting AMZN. I pulled the 25% margin estimate out of thin air. Its a reasonable assumption. Most retailers use 50%. What the AMZN bears fail to realize is that even massive capital costs spread out over 30 years can still wipe out current earnings. So the official PE is meaningless. Other methods must be used. Also, I have read many stock market books that warn against shorting high PE stocks unless a downtrend is already underway. Some of these books were written before Amazon even existed. This is why I warn, now is not the time to short AMZN. Maybe after January 1, at the earliest.</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1345935397908</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 18:56:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345935685643-24</Id><Topic><Title>Apple sueing amazon soon.
