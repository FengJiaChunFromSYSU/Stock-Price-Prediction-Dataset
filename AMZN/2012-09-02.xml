Sybs been dribbling into the short side of this pig for roughly 6 weeks ... On pops sybil takes a sheit on this gimmick by betting a small amount relative to sybils bank ... These pumper clowns are all the same, it works the same way on the long side of a dog too... They make up whatever numbers that are convenient for their delusuional stories and fill in a final number in hindsight. For example, as sybil is covering the last of nflx shorts at 120 from 280 averages they have sybil "shorted at 180 and covered at a wipe out loss of 304.61... Syb s pops up on the next stol, repeat process... This idiot was pumping nflx north of 280, just like this Stupid stok... Sybs will be making an absolute arsload on this stupid sheity manipubot stok play and this nasdaq idiot will be jerking off filling in sybils numbers for all those "losses"</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1346589799370</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 08:43:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346590513886-8</Id><Topic><Title>Sybil has an awesome prediction for monday..</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1346519504824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 13:11:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are wrooooong on many of your points...
