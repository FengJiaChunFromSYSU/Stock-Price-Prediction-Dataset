If things started to go bad then all Amazon would have to do is shed one of their many initiatives and generate cash. The street recognizes that 17 billion is a BIG DEAL. Shorts that have been trained to look at traditional valuations do not understand. This is not a "flash in the pan" this is a real company (a big company) that is changing the game. At some point in the future the price will become stagnant like all big companies but this will not happen until after profitability has been reached and growth has been slowed. Also, it will not lead to a 100 point drop like many shorts are hoping. It is a gradual metamorphosis (see microsoft, dell and apple).</Msg><Username>cospringboard</Username><Timestamp>1382701143301</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 07:39:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382701610006-55</Id><Topic><Title>What shorts are forgetting</Title><Username>cospringboard</Username><Timestamp>1382701143301</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 07:39:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that why the box is delayed to after the holidays, so they could at least meet the .09 loss?</Msg><Username>one_smooth_stone</Username><Timestamp>1382701610006</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 07:46:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382701619428-56</Id><Topic><Title>What shorts are forgetting</Title><Username>cospringboard</Username><Timestamp>1382701143301</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 07:39:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not that is matters right now, but one might take a counter stance to the long run investment in AMZN based on what you say: yes, $17 billion is not a small deal? but the question is : why has AMZN not been able to get "scale" to the bottom line as they increased sales to $70 billion +? 5 years ago, that was the story analysts were implying as sales increased. Sure ,some is spending initiatives, but many of those are capitalized, blance sheet items: cash to PPE, or cash to equipment) etc, and they still have negative real cash flow. Of course the consumer likes AMZN, they get more out of them then they have to pay for their services, in order for AMZN to show those $17 billion numbers. But's it's still,as an investor, not gonna be able to increase equity, that can used to pay you in the future. It's all in apprecation of the stock on a moving target: which is now qtrs upon qtrs of negative cash flow and earnings, while the stock goes parabolic. So an investor is relying on that condtion continuing. As an investor, you'd like to see them start to build up stockholder equity at some point. For a trader, it's different: they'll chase it until the stock doesn't work going up anymore: two different scenarios.</Msg><Username>im_too_hipp</Username><Timestamp>1382701619428</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 07:46:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382702030277-57</Id><Topic><Title>Accounting Change for Revenue? &amp; lower guidance?</Title><Username>bloop2456</Username><Timestamp>1382659932399</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 20:12:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"you should be on the phone with your broker " - are you living in stone age?

They say they like to focus on GM$ (which has to goes up faster than revenue due to AMZN accounting for service revenue at 100% margin, all costs are in opex) - even though Opex $ go up faster than GM$ (hence why CSOI missed estimates).

I'ts always been that way. It just evolves to more egregious reasoning as the bull market matures, such as justifying out AMZN's price based on a 2015 multiple to today discounted. 5 years ago AMZN was supposed to get scale dropping to the bottom line. That's reasoning is long out the window. Of course they are scam analysts, they want any potential business from any potential customer(corporation) that may have to come to the Capital Markets in the future. good luck</Msg><Username>homeytheclown03</Username><Timestamp>1382704481321</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 08:34:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382704528994-79</Id><Topic><Title>A clear gap, here....

Of course I am not sad that the stock is making increasing in price as well. What does this mean? I have odd reading habits. Most of what I want will not be in the average book store, and it would be a chore to search for the titles in used book stores. Now I can sit back, order what I want used, pay almost nothing for it (usually), and get it in 7-10 days. The site is also good when I want something odd in the house. I don't know where else I would have found a new head for my electric shaver when the old own wore out. Or stop-leak power steering fluid that wasn't in my local auto-supply store. I have no idea why can't make a profit putting books in boxes and selling them. My guess they are trying too hard to be big rather than profitable. I also think they should fry in hell for "patenting" the one-click sing-on, and the American justice system should at least to go purgatory for giving their claim some credibility. As for the pricing, I think our society has too much money and not enough real investment opportunities. I am glad the money is chasing stocks, of which I own some, rather than making things I buy more expensive. But this may change.</Msg><Username>garyfloam</Username><Timestamp>1382707047657</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 09:17:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382707055006-117</Id><Title>YES!!!

GRO's 80.81% owned Agria Asia subsidiary owns a controlling 50.22% stake in PGG Wrightson (PGW.NZ), the largest agriculture company in New Zealand. PGG Wrightson is projecting EBITDA this fiscal year of NZ$52-$56mm (USD$44-$47mm), which will equal huge growth of 14%-22%. Agria Asia's 50.22% of PGG Wrightson's projected EBITDA is USD$22.1-$23.6mm. GRO's 80.81% of Agria Asia's projected EBITDA is USD$17.85-$19.07mm. GRO also owns a China seeds business which will likely add about USD$2 million to GRO's EBITDA, which could give GRO total EBITDA of $19.85-$21.07mm. A valuation of just 10X EBITDA could give GRO a market cap of $198.5mm-$210.7mm. With 55.38mm shares outstanding, this would equal a GRO share price of $3.58-$3.80. GRO just reduced its debt to $75mm, with short-term debt of $43mm and $32mm that matures in May 2008. GRO has $26.8mm in pledged restricted cash deposits that can be used towards paying off its debt plus another $42.7 million in unrestricted cash. Therefore, GRO's net debt is only $5.5mm and GRO will likely receive over $10mm in cash dividend payments from PGW.NZ next year. Disclaimer: We own 550,000 shares of GRO and intend to sell these shares at much higher prices.</Msg><Username>skylr55</Username><Timestamp>1382707352057</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 09:22:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382707384391-125</Id><Topic><Title>how about making this prediction techstrategy? how high does AMZN stock go today?</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1382706883468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 09:14:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and I just told you again you were about to get reamed again and you did.

Though I can't figure out how they can ever make money, when they two day UPS ship a bottle of shampoo for $1.00! As an investor, I'm baffled. Great growth stocks (like WMT) didn't have any losing quarters when they went up 10000%, especially retailers. If a retailer loses money, it's common shares will get hammered. Tech stocks like GOOG and MSFT have, to the best of my knowledge, NEVER had a losing quarter while public. AMZN doesn't break down it's sales and profits, so we really don't know what is going on - it's a black box. Assuming that most of their "profits" get plowed back into the company for new warehouses, technology, businesses - when will that ever end? Or even slowdown? With all the other retailers online, AMZN doesn't really have any pricing power. Not sure how any wall street analyst (whom I have little to no respect for) can make estimates and price targets for this stock, when they don't know the details. I'm not a frustrated investor (there are many other stocks I've owned and sold that are up MUCH more than AMZN the last year, on a percentage basis), but rather an RIA...I have clients who ask me about this stock or own it and want advice. This isn't 1999, when EVERY tech stock was soaring. This is one of the top 20 stocks by markep cap in the USA, yet the only one that is not profitable in the top 200?

Crooks in WS continue to raise price targets based on hope of great earning next quarter. In the case of Scamazon, forward guidance is down on both revenue and profit. But then they justify these upgrades with logic like Scamazon is always conservative with estimate. Hell yeah...managements are so great that they were able to nail down 4th quarter earning between a loss of 26 cents and a gain of 26 cents.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1382714411439</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 11:20:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382714415687-293</Id><Title>AMZN may go Red by EOD</Title><Msg>If you recall what happened after Amazon reported last quarter, it popped and then went deep into the red.

I do not agree with this statement. Those crooks have been longer in this game and know the game better. So they are NOT expecting anything great from this company. For a fact, super dooper is already priced in. They just want to squeeze the shorts and wants us to believe that they are expecting something great from the company. They did that recently in 2000 and again in 2007.</Msg><Username>dowto6k</Username><Timestamp>1382714718427</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 11:25:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382714726694-297</Id><Title>It's doing a netflex reverse.</Title><Msg>What's happened?</Msg><Username>dslmantl</Username><Timestamp>1382714726694</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 11:25:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382714771120-298</Id><Topic><Title>SONG ROAR THEME FOR TODAY" DUMP DUMP SCAMAZON TOILET PAPER AND SING THIS SONG BY DEPLOYING LEAP PUTS</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1382710435434</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 10:13:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DUMP DUMP DUMP OR GET SLAUGHTERED BY BANKSTERS</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1382714771120</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 11:26:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382714853680-299</Id><Title>Maybe I covered my $367 short too soon.

Hopefully, I can sell around 17 billion of my dollar bills this coming qtr. so that I can go public and get my company valued at $160B. What a joke these WS analysts are!! Do they not understand that as soon as you start selling the dollar bill at more than a dollar, your revenue declines rapidly? People use Amazon because they sell things at a loss (after all costs are considered). As soon as they focus on making profits, their top line revenue will suffer. Consumers aren't idiots. They will quickly figure out that WMT, TGT, BBY, etc. are just as competitive on pricing when AMZN raises their item and/or shipping prices. Additionally, neighborhood brick and mortar stores have a better (and cheaper) mechanism to return items. Who wants to spend $20 to return a $50 item when they could just stop by a store on the way home from work. Again, these WS analysts are book smart, but lack common sense imo.</Msg><Username>rxcount</Username><Timestamp>1382717617799</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 12:13:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382717628085-343</Id><Topic><Title>Audit</Title><Username>come_on_jeffb</Username><Timestamp>1382713338313</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 11:02:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just want real-time net working capital disclosures before the next offering.

The only problem is nobody holding this stock wants to sell when they think it will go to $1000. I wish I could run my business like Amazon. It would be so easy to get customers if I sold at a loss every year. Since I am a small business owner it is easy for me to grow at 20% a year and still make a few dollars. But yes I have a very small margin unlike Ebay which also grows almost 20% a year. By the way Amazon is fairly priced if you can assume a 22% growth rate for 10 years. That would make it as large as Walmart in sales is today. And Walmart has a market cap 50% higher. So this stock could move another 50% between now and 2023. And it would still be fairly valued.</Msg><Username>it_all_goood</Username><Timestamp>1382717648819</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 12:14:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382717692000-346</Id><Topic><Title>I know I timed it wrong but I am NOT wrong!</Title><Username>dowto6k</Username><Timestamp>1382712971502</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 10:56:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Perhaps.

Paul Getty (whom I also quoted in 2000, and at the May highs, a few percent from current levels). Getty wrote: “For as long as I can remember, veteran businessmen and investors – I among them – have been warning about the dangers of irrational stock speculation and hammering away at the theme that stock certificates are deeds of ownership and not betting slips… The professional investor has no choice but to sit by quietly while the mob has its day, until the enthusiasm or panic of the speculators and non-professionals has been spent. He is not impatient, nor is he even in a very great hurry, for he is an investor, not a gambler or a speculator. The seeds of any bust are inherent in any boom that outstrips the pace of whatever solid factors gave it its impetus in the first place. There are no safeguards that can protect the emotional investor from himself.”</Msg><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1382719074523</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 12:37:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382719151172-359</Id><Topic><Title>I'll say this . in all of the years of amazon</Title><Username>adavidson_nyc</Username><Timestamp>1382719033338</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 12:37:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What earnings?</Msg><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1382719151172</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 12:39:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382719175046-360</Id><Title>WHAT fools are buying anything at these prices</Title><Msg>This is exactly why these markets will crash world wide.

Where I come from that's called a bubble. Bubbles can last a long time as the housing market demonstrated for years. The weak link for Amazon shareholders is how unlikely the company can achieve pricing power over and above other dominant retailers. Adding physical locations won't work, Wal-Mart has more locations than anyone. Selling digital media is a margin race to the bottom. Cloud hosting is a low-margin business with low barriers to entry that already includes Microsoft(MSFT_), Google(GOOG_), Rackspace(RAX_), IBM(IBM_) and countless others. Good luck trying to achieve outsized margins in that space. If it's so obvious that at some point the music will stop -- without enough chairs for everyone, why do investors continue to hold and buy more shares? Because what makes a bubble a bubble is investors ignore everything negative and focus on anything that supports the bull case. It literally becomes an investment supposedly worth buying simply because the price continues to climb. Why did tulips trade for more than a year's pay, Molycorp(MCP_) (another company I warned about) or Crocs(CROX_) for over $70? For the same reason a company can trade for $350 that may not generate a profit next year, the mob doesn't care why it's appreciating, until it's not. Hopefully, you care enough not to get caught up in the euphoria and avoid the Amazon musical chair game, or at least be quick enough to grab a chair when the music stops.

WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF YOUR CHILDREN IN USA? “I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.” – Thomas Jefferson If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs. – Thomas Jefferson in the debate over the Re-charter of the Bank Bill (1809) Andrew Jackson : Gentlemen, I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter, I shall ruin ten thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and thieves.

Walmart shipping has free ship for over $50 orders OR free site-to-store OR buy today in-store Amazon ship has free ship for over $35 (on some items) or pay a fee for Prime Option (prime available on some items) Those are the facts!! Amazon will lose a lot of mommentum this holiday season and still not make a profit. Long-game and Walmart wins again.</Msg><Username>jaywishman</Username><Timestamp>1382741599196</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 18:53:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382741842272-507</Id><Topic><Title>By the way, techstrategy? let me clue you in on analysts: they upgrade near tops, and downgrade near bottoms</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1382740840443</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 18:40:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah, why don't you bet me you fool or are you a wuss?

One fellow even dreamed: "Now, what we need from WMT Investment Portfolio Management department, for the extra cash that they hold, is to deploy all that cash shorting AMZN first, and then launch a Holiday Customer Switch-over Campaign from AMZN to WMT: You get $10 (gift-card) just to become a WMT customer (again). And when you visit a WMT store in January, you'll be willing to sign an affidavit to cash in the gift-card, that assures that you did not make a single purchase from AMZN in Nov-Dec months! A cashier-manager can temporarily be assigned to manage this verification process and signing off of the paper! Talk about putting a squeeze on a competitor! And all the money they give out in gift-cards, they'll gain back from the AMZN short! Plus, win zillions of customers and other business!

A lot of the so-called revenue "growth" in Europe comes from favorable currency conversion rate, as dollar reached a 8-month low , not organic growth, on top of selling stuff at or below cost; this will not sustain. 2. Now it has spread itself too thin, trying to cover different businesses, but none of which is Amazon's proprietary territory. The history is that when a business try to do everything (but none of which is its proprietary property), it will end up gradually losing its edge in all fronts. With now Amazon having built Warehouses everywhere, there is no difference between Amazon and Walmart, etc any more. In fact, those Brick-and-Mortar companies actually have more advantages by having those physical stores already be in presence. 3. in the 1990s to early 2000s, Microsoft tried to take the "world", acted aggressively to weed out other competing companies, exactly the same way as Amazon has been doing for sometimes now. Then what happened? The Government stepped in, took on the company(Microsoft) with Anti-trust suits and killed it from there, for fear that type of suppressing competition behavior would hurt consumers' best interest. Amazon's aggressive behavior toward competition simply can not continue. 4. With Twitter, Alibaba IPOs coming soon, far more greener pasture elsewhere with far far less risk., hence, I say "sell" your investment positions now before others taking the action (but never short it). By the way, today the fund managers pushed and held this up for Window dressing, as expected.</Msg><Username>newmarketpro2002</Username><Timestamp>1382744937328</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-25 19:48:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382744976283-517</Id><Topic><Title>Walmart Web-prices Exactly Match Amazon!!
