In truth, I've lost some $$$ but hope to make asymmetrical returns when AMZN tanks. Every time I hear someone take about making money being long AMZN I think of the housing market in 2006 - 2007. I had friends that bought way above their means. Before the crash, they encouraged me to do the same. According to them, this was easy money as the housing market was going up 10% to 20%. Well I never did buy over my means and I still have my home. I know a lot of people who don't. Just because you've made money in the past doesn't mean you're going to make money in the future off of AMZN. Ask yourself why you're long. If its based on fundamentals, stay long. If its based on the stock price rising in the past, you're going to get burned.

So, if AMZN goes below $43, I'll be in the red. Now, I'm not bragging. I should have done MUCH better than I have. I've never traded so actively before, and I'm still learning. But if a dumb hillbilly like me can make money trading AMZN, anyone can. During the time I've made over $200 per share, you've lost money. I'm not much of a believer in charts, who knows how accurate the numbers are.

With additional shipping costs for ALL retailers AMZN can now charge the same and be even more competitive with the likes of walmart. Sales will go thru the roof and thus drive the stock price to 400. They should still be able to earn 7 cents per share thus proving that they CAN be profitable no matter what. With increase in costs lets hod that line and SELL SELL SELL.</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1357518153812</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 19:22:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357518520274-70</Id><Title>Nikkei down huge now!</Title><Msg>Opened about 5.2% higher.

It will become clear this year that Amazon's profitability issue is not the result of very high levels of investment, but rather some fundamental business model flaws that derive from the cost drivers. Amazon knows this. It's why it dropped monthly Prime and why it began financing 3P vendors... I'm just waiting for the day somebody like Gov. Rick Snyder says either you collect tax in our state, or we (via all state and local pension funds) divest any Amazon related assets. All it takes is one smart Governor (and Rick is very smart) and a tsunami will follow. State revenues go up, local purchases go up, velocity of money in the local economy goes up (further reinforcing the positive impact on state sales tax). Only Amazon loses.
