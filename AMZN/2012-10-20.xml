I'm pretty negative on AMZN prospects going forward but never considered bankruptcy a likely near-term possibility. Given that there are likely a number of places where they could clearly dial back spending, possibly at the risk of curtailing revenue growth but probably without risking revenue decline, how do you see bankruptcy as a real possibility?</Msg><Username>philtmcnasty8</Username><Timestamp>1350754306994</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 13:31:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350755489804-7</Id><Topic><Title>Just like sybs been saying for the last month....</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1350679300816</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 16:41:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I heard from the PCLN board that you're flat broke.

That will hit a combination of gross margins and revenue growth. But, amazon is going to face vastly greater competition in AWS and digital content (when it had an book monopoly). Plus, Amazon has taken on many semi fixed costs. Yes.

It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, "the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better." ~ Senator Barack H.
