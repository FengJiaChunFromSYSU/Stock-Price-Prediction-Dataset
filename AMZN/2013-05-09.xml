No, but it doesnt suprize sybs. Its easy to win 100% of the time when flipping a 2-headed coin, or dealing from the bottom of the deck. It will all come out in the light eventually, but only after the sheeple get slaughtered . Privately held Fido iz still flying under the newz radar, but by the end of this crash they will be known and viewed as the scam GS was from '80-'00 before the partnerz cashed in and they went public. You see tech? You see how the entire ponzi scheme bit coin stok system of capital raise, compensation, derivativez, and robot trading iz entirely fvck ed up from soup to nuts? Its become an efficient wealth stripping machine, and will remain so until the s&amp;p prints its true intrinsic value of 450-575, posibly lower. This will institute structural changez, in a midst of fear and hate, the system will be purged and reset, and barring any global war or zombie attack - we will come out of ashez very slowly but healed . There will be mucho pain getting there though, including breach of contracts on derivativez.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368107777381</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 09:56:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368108253341-11</Id><Topic><Title>Yo tech, how those leaps hold'in up?</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368048584286</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 17:29:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There really is still a path to bring the system back into balance without a catastrophic failure.

Daily advanced issues consistently exceed declined issues and $TICK stay over 0 a large percentage of the time. The SPX is now trading at the top end of its ascending channel. Although I cannot tell if the upside is caused by squeezing shorts or genuine buying longs, and boy the bulls are so damn strong everyday it is un-freaking believable! Today is the first time in days I've seen a crack in the ES, but the risk is still on the upside simply because the SPX closed yet another higher low. Making it only an inside day. SPX can still creep along the upper channel and cause bears to feel pain. I am still cautiously optimistic that there will be a pull back soon. It is hard to fight an $85B/month un-natural market using a natural economic mindset. I'd be more optimistic if SPY pops above the upper channel which causes it to over extended, or evidence in a really pull back. As for now, AMZN trades along with SPX in rhythmic through out the day. I'd be cautious that the overall market is setting up a bear trap with this enormous QE pumping.

At some point, the risk will be too great that QE will do very little to pump the market. So they either has to continue or do more QE, or admit defeat and stop QE. The latter is very unlikely, so I genuinely believe that any dip in prices should be bought. I can't see how it will be good for the little guy, on one hand you have high inflation and on the other hand you have a nasty recession/depression.

This assumez that the markets a functioning properly, free of corcuit breakerz, phlash crashez, financial hax, broker lockouts, telecom / fiber optic coms interruptionz, and material acts of god. this excludez nights, weekendz, and holidayz. During any of theze timez a stox value iz 0.00. You cant eat em, drink em, fuel macinery, or seek shelter under them and you cant sell them to do any of these thingz. The sole purpose of an unsecured, uninsured stok iz to serve az a proxy to transfer financial wealth from the many to the few az efficiently az possible.

Stawks are only good at what ever the next buyer is willing to pay for. There are still a lot of people who "missed the boat". Guess what, they will buy any dip and this trend should continues to run a little bit longer until the risk tolerance start to wear thin and then the FED will do their usual BS to "calm the markets". Than all is well and stawks will continue the normal direction as usual detached from fundamentals. Only time I will be very worry is when the market stop reacting to the FED which means they're reacting to reality. Ain't that a b**ch.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1368145644110</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 20:27:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368148423201-70</Id><Topic><Title>Every Scam POS Stock Had a Headfake Rally Today</Title><Username>jeffpmpccea</Username><Timestamp>1368141799233</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 19:23:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As the the physical gold for sale dries up (and BB try to settle in fiat rather than gold), QE will not matter anymore. Everyone will know that the banks have been running a ponzi (which is why nominal asset values cannot be allowed to fall, else the bank "earnings" which are primarily reductions in loan loss reserves will crater and banks will fail) across the board and financial assets will crater. The only thing supporting them is trust and trust will have been the casualty of the high stakes game the TBTF/SIFI/PD banks have been playing with Fed money. WS will see its "wealth" evaporate.

When money is essentially free and meaningless lots of very strange things can happen. Nobody cares about valuation, money is free to borrow and there's a glut of it. The markets are flooded with this funny money and it moves it to astronomical heights with very little fundamental support. This ends with the loss of the dollar as the world's currency. When that happens it's going to be quite a spectacular fall. We're talking sub 4000 Dow in a hearbeat. Don't think it can happen? Watch what happens when the rest of the world stops taking dollars in exchange, except by the wheelbarrel full.
