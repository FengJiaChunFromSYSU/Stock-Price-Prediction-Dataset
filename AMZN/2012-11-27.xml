"What of stock sales from option exercises?", just wanted to point out that Amazon issues RSUs which are like no-cost options and no money is received by Amazon at award nor at exercise. However, a contingent compensation expense is recorded at fair value at time of award and is expensed at time of exercise. RSUs being exercised have actually been contributing to declining cash flow as Amazon has been mopping up the dilution with share buybacks.</Msg><Username>krk_krk</Username><Timestamp>1353994696081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 00:38:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353995760337-2</Id><Title>Oh,Oh, California sales down roughly 30% because of sales tax</Title><Msg>Management says the sales growth for taxing states is no different than growth in no-tax states.

They grow the same after that point, but from a much smaller base.

The Bond will mask the losses from kndle and in Mr. Bezo's approach will hopefully distract market makers from adjusting stock valuation based on total earnings. I see a very red flag with this issuance and would stay away.

It approaching the next technical level of 247.50. I don't understand just ecause of holiday sales is it running os hard or there is something else. Because every year online sales has grown exponential. Anyways AMZN has to grow 27.5% annually.Last year also there would record break online sales and when the results came it was below expectation. This year AMZN has sold kindle at $129 which was at the low end category, so people must has bought for their kids use, but point is they already loose money on that. Euro is getting stronger, this quarter there was substantial loss on foreign exchange. And now for thier international operations revenue will decline unless they have hedged the currency. The more i look the more reasons i find the pointers are not so great, but fact remains it has gine $25 straight up and MM's can do anything to crush shorts. The biggest problem is S&amp;P is at 1406 and AMZN at $244.

The EPS uncertainly looks like that of a startup rather than the 22nd biggest market cap in the world. Don't tell me this is becuase they are investing - they can forecast that to the investment community like everyone else. They choose not to because they get higher valuation this way. By definition this means the price targets, reports, and analysis is meaningless. Let's compare AMZN EPS estimates with top competitors: AAPL: 43.63 (low) - 68.69 (High), Mean = $57.95 (-25%, +19% from mean), 44% spread GOOG: $42.24 (low) - $51.20 (high), Mean = $46.72 (-9%, +10% from mean), 19% spread eBAY: $2.29 (low) - $2.96 (high), Mean = $2.73 (-16%, +8% from mean), 24% spread AMZN: $0.45 (low) - $3.73 (high), Mean = $1.76 (-74%, +112% from mean), 186% spread What a joke ... basically the street has no idea what AMZN will do next year and yet this deserves a FWD P/E range of 65 to 540 on 5Q's from now earnings? Note that AMZN also has a significant skew where are some outliers in the high-end of the range that are pulling up the Mean significantly. That means the AMZN is only stock above where the median estimate is well below mean. More to the scam.</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1354023824610</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 08:43:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354024397530-25</Id><Title>Bear Market</Title><Msg>Bear market started when the election money stopped stimulating the economy. Don't let this Santa Claus rally fool you. In January Amazon will start heading down because everything is going down (except Apple which is grossly under valued). It has nothing to do with sales taxes or the fiscal cliff. The American way of life is currently unsustainable. Main culprit is higher cost of education. Maybe these tablets are the solution or just a new form of entertainment. Obamacare (which I favor) is a tax increase, in the form of higher insurance deductibles (which sick people will pay) and will lead to a middle class tax cut after the 2014 election.

Somehow the investment community seems to think AMZN can keep growing sales forever and eventually will become profitable. I don't think so!! Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the underwriters of the bond offering, so they knew...along with their clients this was coming and probably assisted in the price rise.. If the market heats up, they could take this to new highs, but that will be a better position to short or buy puts (Feb/Mar 13) for the eventual fall. There is only so many people that will buy online consistently and I think eventually the revenue growth will slow and wall street will punish this stock and drop it to where it belongs...somewhere way south of $90.</Msg><Username>wuwuwu3</Username><Timestamp>1354025665665</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:14:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354025839767-29</Id><Title>AMZN will be down huge today.</Title><Msg>Will close down $1.28.

Amzn sells a whole lot of kindles (wink wink..trust them), doesn't make any $$$ on the devices, but wall street crooks run the price up on the stock. This is truly sad and ridiculous that wall street has propped this stock up so long and on nothing but hope for profits at some point in the future.</Msg><Username>wuwuwu3</Username><Timestamp>1354027114713</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:38:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354027129409-37</Id><Title>amzn sells more kindles?</Title><Msg>amzn is always to pump its stock to compensate its employee. it has no chance to make money to sell its kindles. its online sale faces the stiff competition from all sides. it will go to tens soon.</Msg><Username>freeland001</Username><Timestamp>1354027129409</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:38:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354027391391-38</Id><Title>#$%$, 12 min. in the stock is down 2 already?</Title><Msg>holy F</Msg><Username>causinginflation</Username><Timestamp>1354027391391</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:43:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354027447884-39</Id><Title>jesus, were 246 a minutes ago</Title><Msg>................</Msg><Username>causinginflation</Username><Timestamp>1354027447884</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:44:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354027464565-40</Id><Topic><Title>Cyber Monday was the biggest day ever for Kindle Sales...

This is EXACTLY why the trading games of the capital markets are undermining our national competitiveness (rewarding malinvestment and punishing companies like INTC that focus on productive investment). They've artificially lowered the cost of capital for domestic consumer facing companies... So, we invest in consumption instead of productivity and production. The MOST IMPORTANT change that should be made to tax law is changing the LT capital gains holding period (increasing it normal income rates under 2-3 years, holding it at 20% for up to 5 years and keeping it at 15% or better yet TAKING IT TO ZERO for 5 years or more). That will lead to a return to investing by institutional longs and it will end the algo premium scalping / short squeeze games in the process. With that, capital will return to the market (and to the start ups and small companies that create jobs). Be patient. Amazon has some major weaknesses which will become apparent as stress increases...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354036290920</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 12:11:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354036324361-130</Id><Topic><Title>just added 20,000 shares at 241.8 my average is $231</Title><Username>italiaole</Username><Timestamp>1354029173463</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 10:12:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$60,000 profit for the day not bad not bad.
