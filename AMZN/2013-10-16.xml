And The Rest Of The World Knows It" The only thing exceptional about the USA is "its the largest debtor nation in the history of the world" is how Jim Rogers begins this brief interview with RT and he doesnt back away from the rhetoric. The sad truth, he notes, is that the US "has been kicking the can down the road for years..." how do you think we got so much debt, he chides. "Every year that goes by we go deeper and deeper into debt," adding, rather ominously, that it "will be solved one way or another." They will kick the can once more; then next week, we will be told that the problem is fixed and compromise is here. However, Rogers warns, eventually the market is going to turn away; "this is going to end badly... and the rest of the world knows it."</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1381897592554</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 00:26:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381926508368-3</Id><Title>the giant has wake up!!</Title><Msg>WMT declared war against the duck... http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/15/us-walmart-meeting-idUSBRE99E0FO20131015?type=companyNews</Msg><Username>emanuel_dabah</Username><Timestamp>1381926508368</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 08:28:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381928306717-4</Id><Title>if you want to make money then click here right now</Title><Msg>These tips are really good.

The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs. – Thomas Jefferson in the debate over the Re-charter of the Bank Bill (1809) Andrew Jackson : Gentlemen, I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter, I shall ruin ten thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin!

Amazon's sales are slowing, albeit from plus 20% growth levels. I guess they can try and act like revenues are higher based on the change in how the e-publishing business is accounted for. Of course if they do this they will be left with even lower margins so there should still be a price to pay. Of course we all know that the cartel will stay deaf and dumb which is absurd considering how well educated they are.

IBM's miss is AMZN's gain (small gain though) I heard from ORCL's last conference call that smaller rivals (such as Tableau Software: DATA) are taking market share from the big guys (ORCL, IBM, SAP, ACN), these more innovative "small rivals" in the space also include Amazon Web Services. I believe AMZN will bounce back tomorrow because it presents very good buying opportunities for dip buyers still on the sidelines.

Speak the truth, don't make up bunk. Amazon will most likely miss their estimates on both the top and bottom line (apples to apples not counting the fact that the e-publishing business may show a $1B increase just because of the way the business is now accounted for, i.e. the $1B would not be growth just a new way of accounting) and then they'll guide down and since we are still in the QE forever world and this is a very much protected stock, the sell side analysts will come out in support no matter what. That's how the game works here and if QE were ending I would say the cartel might turn tail but with no end in sight the same baloney will most likely be bandied about.

I warned you then, and warn you again: it hasn't nothing to do with AMZN as a trading scam: it has to do with the easy QE money given to the banks/WS players,as we have competitive devaluations in the G7 countries going on around the world. It's devaluing money and purchasing power, and sending stocks like AMZN to the moon. Do you see that not continuing? Do you see how much the Fed is gonna have to support increased debt ceiling Obama spending going foward? This isnt' even close to ending. If you want to see a microcosm of wha's really going on, look at the Venezuelen stock market as they kill their purchasing power, in that scenario , stocks go up , and up big.
