A number of your earlier posts have shown that, and this latest tirade is just the most blatant. And though I have no interest nor the need to refute your inborn hatred with facts, one could if one wanted to simply ask you if you bothered to ask all of the floor traders and fund managers who run the stock market bid-ask system how many of them are Jewish. I venture to guess that the vast majority are of other religious persuasions. But no matter because facts don't change inbred haters like yourself. Second of all, as far as AMZN is concerned you really don't present anything novel here with all of your posts that I've read. You portray yourself as one who knows something that nobody else knows is true as far as the company's fundamental situation is concerned. Third of all, as far as the performance of the stock is concerned, nobody other than the funds who control most of the shares and cumulative monies knows where the stock is going to go at any moment. Yet, you post here and imply that you know what is happening or what is going to happen right now or "soon." But wait! When challenged, you then claim that you don't really know. But if so, why all the posts about what you claim is going to happen in a matter-of-fact style? Finally, you flat our lie. You said you were going to stop posting until the stock went to $245, but you came back and posted relentlessly anyhow. What is your point in lying like that? And why should anyone believe you if you can't keep your word?</Msg><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1372863089862</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:51:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372863305620-26</Id><Title>Do you know what the real problem in this economy is?</Title><Msg>From Time US article: San Francisco Bay Area Transit Strike Snarls Commute Again [7/2/2013] San Francisco Bay area commuters endured another tough morning commute on Tuesday, as a strike on one of the region’s heavily used train systems entered its second day. . . . Workers representing two of BART’s largest unions went on strike after talks with management broke down on Sunday. No new talks have been scheduled. The striking unions and management reported being far apart on key sticking points that included salary, pensions, health care and safety. “Our members aren’t interested in disrupting the Bay Area, but management has put us in a position where we have no choice,” said Antonette Bryant, president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555. The unions, which represent nearly 2,400 train operators, station agents, mechanics, maintenance workers and professional staff, want a 5 percent raise each year over the next three years. BART said train operators and station agents in the unions average about $71,000 in base salary and $11,000 in overtime annually. The workers also pay a flat $92 monthly fee for health insurance. I thought train operators and station agents were earning wages close to the minimum wage. (BART system is highly automated. Train operators do almost nothing most of the time. You don't really think these workers deserve $71,000 a year as their base salary, do you? See, the whole economy is based on the Ponzi scheme. So, what are you complaining about, shorts?

However, you flatly deny that you are capable of doing so, which means that you are in fact not the "master of the trade." What you are in reality is someone who analyzes the fundamental financials of a company and then conclude that it is overvalued, and then you short the stock at a random price level. You then hope that "eventually" the stock will tank and you can then realize a profit. However, that might take years (if ever). You also short in what you say for you is "small increments" on the way up. All that being said, you are no different than anyone who follows the same strategy. No rocket science, and no reason to try to dub oneself as some kind of "trading guru.". Aside from that, you are a racist with an agenda to say, "You see I was right about 'stocks' and the 'stock market' And since I was right about that stuff, then my forthcoming racism that I am going to spew also must be right."</Msg><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1372867576618</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 12:06:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372867698755-44</Id><Topic><Title>Look at Bollinger Bands...</Title><Username>indexplus2001</Username><Timestamp>1372865373946</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:29:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hope your right think close Friday 275</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1372867698755</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 12:08:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372868075818-45</Id><Topic><Title>Look at Bollinger Bands...</Title><Username>indexplus2001</Username><Timestamp>1372865373946</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:29:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It has as much reason to close at $275 as it does to close at $290.

Aapl actually makes money. And yes sybil still shorted aapl at 680. This stock iz much worse for longz and much better for shorts than aapl. You just gotta not short it by proxy of crackhead put optionz... Optionz are shorts or longz, they are simply crackhead optionz taken on by those with the mentality of a suicide bomber.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1372880750826</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 15:45:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372880862783-71</Id><Topic><Title>amazon is like aapl</Title><Username>efratyrafael</Username><Timestamp>1372872319838</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 13:25:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can't justify the 285 price or even a 200 price. Unfortunately a lot of institutions and individuals are willing to pay 285. Applying all "common sense" valuation measures and AMZN is so overpriced that I want to immediately short the stock and/or buy lots of PUTS. Imagine how many people have applied this common sense logic and lost a fortune over that last six months. I still plan to buy AMZN Puts if a see a certain chart pattern arise but until the I'll sit this short out.</Msg><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1372880862783</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 15:47:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372883226124-72</Id><Topic><Title>Sybs cant tell if sammy iz an agravated short thats covering or a baggie long thats buying</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1372875401636</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 14:16:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he is long an wrong</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1372883226124</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 16:27:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372883729900-73</Id><Topic><Title>One last thought re.

Anyone one that ownz this turd here iz a MASSIVE bagholder unless they are capable of a phat phingur unload in 6 millisecondz. Bots that are directly plugged in to the nyse while everyone else iz locked out on circuit breakerz are gaurunteed a seat when the muzak stops, heck they are the onez paying the fiddle player who will que them with a wink so they can quick grab a seat. Garaunteed that those without a seat wont only be left standing, they will be immediately cut in half by razor wire that iz rigged in the fun and gamez hall which will rip through the room at lightening speed just clearing above the headz of those fortunate enough to be seated (which iz rigged, luck haz nothing to do woth it in this game) .
