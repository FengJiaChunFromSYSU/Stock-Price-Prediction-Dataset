What's with mid-December? If AMZN keeps going up, she could be hitting an all-time high then. I know you're in pain, but you still have about 2/3 of your money. Just liquidate and wait for the next trading opportunity. Look at how the short camp is crowded with clueless people like techstrategy and philandjoel1e. Do you really believe we have people who are dumber than they are are out there en masse? They have to come in and sell in order for AMZN to drop sharply again, you know? Don't you think for now all dumb people have shorted? For AMZN to go down hard, somebody (or robots) must sell. Do you know for sure somebody will anytime soon? I don't. Again, AMZN always fluctuates a few bucks every day, up or down, and AMZN has gone up for four days in a row. A little pullback here is very likely. So, she can test 235-236 this Friday. If that happens, don't think and just liquidate your position, take a rest and wait for the next trading opportunity.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1353561395609</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 00:16:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353567689644-2</Id><Topic><Title>Anybody long anything other than for a 'day trade' iz an absolute retard</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1353557512154</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 23:11:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybs: You are a very good trader, but I think you are very wrong on how this plays out. The real safety trade IS large cap tech (AAPL, CSCO, ORCL, GOOG and mostly INTC). Bonds aren't safe (but Benny B won't let the bond vigilantes operate over here, so there won't be a flash crash in bonds as that is the only real Bernanke put, just negative real returns). "Growth" stocks are priced for growth and margins that will never materialize. Companies like Amazon lack the cash to withstand a shock and price war. But, INTC will obliterate all others.

Because everyone was convinced it was going to zero a week ago... How bad was that call Sybs? I see opportunities and real sustainable value as well as anyone. I also see scams as well as anyone. Ironically, GRPN has been framed as a scam and AMZN the growth opportunity when it is precisely the reverse. As I've said, GRPN has a unique niche. INTC has a far more important one. Absent complete financial collapse (in which case my shorts make a killing), INTC is going MUCH higher long term. And Baby Boomers will gladly hold its almost 5% yield. The key is to own distinctive or unique assets or capabilities. They will increase in value, not only on a relative basis, but in nominal terms. How many other companies are scaling 14nm by 2014? AMD died. Global Foundies is losing financial support. UMC is struggling to continue scaling. The world (and certainly not the DOD) will not trust to have the brains of our electronic world all made by TSMC and Samsung (let alone ZTE and Huwaei). Ain't gonna happen. The semi manufacturing shakeout is much further along and INTC is winning. Amazon, however, does little that is unique. If Amazon ceased to exist tomorrow, the country and the world would barely be impacted. Everything can be bought somewhere else for virtually the same price. UPS/FDX can ship and deliver everything. What happens if INTC (and all its fabs...) are gone tomorrow? Here's just one: Cloud growth would grind to a halt (INTC ships dominate servers). Don't be a fuzzy thinker like the pumper longs Sybs. There is fundamental economic value embedded in many companies, particularly those with distinct productive capabilities. PJ, INTC was almost 30 earlier this year. Capitulation happened awhile ago.

Losing a roughly 10% advantage over brick and mortar stores, for them to make even a penny, a penny they cant even make now, will take this stock south in my eyes. AMZN was supposed make $.14 in the 3rd quarter that $.14 was posted at the start of the 3rd quarter, and as we know they came in at minus -$.60 according to Ameritrade. Next earning 4th (holiday season) was posted at $.53 on 10/24/2012 and has been revised down to $.28, almost 50% less in one month time 2009 4th it was +$.85 2010 4th it was +$.91 20114th it was +$.38 I have bought AMZN only at earnings time, since whatever they announce will be viewed as positive, and resold ASAP. AMZN has a P/E of 3100 and more, yes 3100x put that in to perspective if AAPL had a P/E of 3100 it would trade for roughly $150,000.00 a share, yep $150,000. Wall Street is starting to pick on AAPL whereas AMZN can't do wrong. Again somebody tell me why AMZN deserves such a high price and P/E trying to educate myself.</Msg><Username>rdhrolf</Username><Timestamp>1353609640910</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 13:40:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353610969707-31</Id><Topic><Title>I am so stressed------with just 4% AMZN i lost 40% on options with no positive in sight</Title><Username>viking.trader</Username><Timestamp>1353603863230</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 12:04:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks Nasdaq 6000 baby, i deserved to be bashed</Msg><Username>viking.trader</Username><Timestamp>1353610969707</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 14:02:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353613033448-32</Id><Topic><Title>I am so stressed------with just 4% AMZN i lost 40% on options with no positive in sight</Title><Username>viking.trader</Username><Timestamp>1353603863230</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 12:04:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"last place to complain or try to get sympathy for you trading actions gone wrong is a Yahoo message board." 1st accurate statement ever uttered by retarded nasdaq_6000</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1353613033448</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 14:37:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353613612780-33</Id><Topic><Title>why ??</Title><Username>rdhrolf</Username><Timestamp>1353597519197</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 10:18:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some day someone will blow the whistle and when they do it will be a fire alarm with a real fire.

I remain hopeful that they will do the right thing and just continue selling through it. Better to let the air out slowly than a monstrous drop and time is running out on doing the right thing. I'll ride this up as far as it goes.

Not a chance... Once this market rolls over its gonna fvcken get blistered - the drop will be harder, and more abrupt then '08... It will only happen when the greatest amount of sheeple least expect it, and the maximum amount willing are roped in for the wealth tranfer to occure (again).
