Sybil told you - now you are going to have to sit out and watch this pig tank by 30.00 withouf your involvement... Sybil will think of you and be sort of sad, but then remember that sybil told you so and you had a chance to reopen yesterday.... The hard part for you iz yet to come, for upon tanking 30.00 to the 1st OK support you will have to wrestle internally with the decision " do I hop on what could be a bot driven bonifide momo crash, or will i be toasted by a ritious bounce even if only for a week or 3 if i pile on here?". Sybil cant attest for you, but sybil HATES chasing a bus down the street.... The feeling in your stomach, the effort, the sweat, the panting, the fear of missing it.... Man that sux, bro..... Anyway, sybil iz doing fine - covered 800 sharez at 242.50 yesterday, just incase you're on to something, and have 7300 left to ride sybbys hunch that this pig is bent over and has a spit inserted in its ars and iz ready to roast alive.... Btw all the the action waz flat yesterday, we did put in a lower low. Just so youre aware... Sybil iz here to help those in need, much like that caddy 'helping' out his golfer on that finance comercial " ohhh tough putt, not many could pull that off. Lots of pressure for you to make this shot from your contender" (clapping sounds from the hole behind) "thaaats an eagle. Good luck with your putt"</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1350124933966</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 06:42:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350127099014-2</Id><Title>Jeff Bezos Stake worth over $20 Billion / Amazon Book value $5 Billion</Title><Msg>Think about that for a moment.

The fiddy day simple iz somwhere around 250... Set your limits to reshort at 247.50 and up... You have next week at the most... Let this be a lesson not to overtrade a pig... Sybil hates to see a fellow short get left behind.... If you must swing trade, then do so with NO MORE then 30% of your sesired position... In this instance, sybs has decided to move 10% while waiting for the crash... Sybil will be "ALL IN SHORT" by earnings the week after next.... What you did getting out for a 2% bounce up vs a 30% collapse down was foolhearty....

I had the computer all set to short an #$%$ load of NFLX at 175 as it free fell and those same thoughts flew around in my head for what seemed like hours....never pulled the trigger and have regretted ever since. I have only been hunting momos for a few years so I respect Sybs' experience and I only hope to some day see the carnage the she has seen....or be in such good standing with the trading gods. But, one thing that I have noticed, is that on these crazy run ups zombie longs are lulled to a sense of invincibility. They are conditioned to believe that it will always bounce back "buy the dips". It works every time...until it doesn't. The transfer of wealth is not just for the cynical shorts but the hopeful longs too. So the longs must be played and max extraction of their cash will ensue. I played GMCR poorly. Jumped out as it spiked up only to jump back in as it had already dropped $10 Then covering again on a squeeze. I learned and played CMG much better. I believe you are right the summit have been reached but with 2 weeks to go before earning there is much time to distribute and it will take volatility. Cramer and CNBC were hard at work yesterday. Expect some analyst to pound the table this week. We will see a pop and greed longs crowd into the burning building. I will wait patiently. And yes....249-255 I will be adding a boat load. - PJ</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1350132326566</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 08:45:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350134567401-6</Id><Title>breakdown ALERT!

Sybil knows theze issuez of bus chasing only from experience - all sybs thoughts come from the School of Hard Knox from which sybil proudly holdz a doctorates degree... Sybil iz not endowed with amaaaaazing insights and knowledge on optionz scamz, peaks, valleyz, contrain tradez, momo tradez, technical analysis, balance sheet scamz, economic scamz, bond mkt scamz, derivatives scamz, etc etc etc.. Without learning them the hard way 1st.. The most important lesson to remember behind respect the trading gods is that people are stupid (including sybil), and when given the opportunity to reach into your pocket for their own benefit they will happily take advantage of that opportunity and execute the task of doing so with maximum efficiency...

CNBC is for political junkies and pseudo-educated retirees. Does anyone really think the Nteenth interview with Eric Cantor is going to give them an edge in trading? Or another tirade from that clown Santelli? Amazon has problems with Prime which is why you will never see a paid prime figure out there. They have plenty of people on free trials and Mom program, but they understandably have a hard time getting people to renew an expensive paid shipping program with an annual fee. They are simply not making money on the program right now, which is why you see they view it as "marketing." Secular trends will guarantee a good business on "marketplace" and web services, but the actual business of retailing stuff they inventory themselves is going to get tougher, not easier. eCommerce is becoming easier to do, not harder, but the logistics of mass-inventory retailing are well known by a number of big companies already. The kindle eBook platform will continue to grow, but the tablet-platform is going to be obsoleted which will make Amazon turn toward more pro-active support of other platforms. As someone has mentioned here, Fire is a defensive strategy. The same-day delivery concept is a great idea, but no one should expect it to hit a home run without a bunch of strike outs first.</Msg><Username>americanuspublius</Username><Timestamp>1350139426986</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 10:43:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350142503547-13</Id><Topic><Title>I love free money.</Title><Username>beauty90210211</Username><Timestamp>1350070476838</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:34:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Every major bank on the planet is making money selling reverse convertibles on Amazon because it's overvalued.
