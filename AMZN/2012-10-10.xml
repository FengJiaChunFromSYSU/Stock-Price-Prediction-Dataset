I've documented on this board many (but not all) of the clearly foreseeable competitive risks and macroeconomic risks. Fund managers are getting paid handsomely to be responsible stewards of others' money. Failing to take profits at these absurd valuations with the macroeconomic headwinds we face is grossly negligent. They will find it increasingly difficult to get out and at much lower prices.

Without being nasty or anything, AMZN is "spinach" in your portfolio. There's no way this ends well for longs who try to ride this out. It's up huge for the year, going from a p/e of 180 to 300+ after last earnings announcement. Cash in. Take profit. This stock isn't going to go up to a p/e of 500. AMZN may be a good company, but the stock is "priced to perfection". If Apple were to offer a $50 in-store credit on iPad mini's for everyone exchanging a Kindle, this stock would be at $200 overnight. Crusty old WMT offers same day shipping and the stock tanks? This stock's price is extremely vulnerable. Facebook now wants to be a part of e-commerce. States want a piece of all the action with their fair share of taxes. At $250, the AMZN world is Unicorns and Rainbows. Is AMZN going out of business? no. Will AMZN keep a p/e of 300? No way! The last thing Cramer said about AMZN was prescient the other night. Something to the effect of "when the anointed ones (i.e. stocks loved by hedgies) fall out of favor, watch out!" Plus Greece and Cyprus are having new difficulties. Spain's woes are being understated and under-reported. War could break between Syria and Turkey, or Iran and Israel, at any time. At its current levels, AMZN will be one of the first stocks sold in a unforeseen market crash. The 3 month upward trendline has clearly been breached. When this stock has a 3% down day, more are likely to follow. (Check out a 1 year chart.) I've also noticed the recent trend toward low volatility in AMZN. If it goes back into the mode of wild swings like in early 2012, we could all be in for a wild ride. My friendly advice, take your profits and look for the next great company.</Msg><Username>bartman330</Username><Timestamp>1349845243062</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 01:00:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349848586389-7</Id><Title>AMZN is in a trading range: 250 - 260.</Title><Msg>Give or take a couple of bucks.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1349848586389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 01:56:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349850803506-8</Id><Title>pe over 300. peg almost 10.0</Title><Msg>amzn is going to crash hard. what a pig.</Msg><Username>pumpyourpiston</Username><Timestamp>1349850803506</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 02:33:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349867427253-9</Id><Title>AMZN's pre-premartket indication: 251.06</Title><Msg>Not quite over 215.25 . . . yet.

AMD Radeon RAMDisk loading times are expected to be 525% higher than those offered by conventional products</Title><Msg>Dataram Corporation (NASDAQ: DRAM) has announced a huge deal with AMD on September 8. 2012 that is sure to take it to the next level in terms of revenues and net income. The stock is completely under the radar and a reason why its 0.2 X sales valuation giving it a $6.5 million market cap. The company is already almost break-even even before the upcoming AMD-related windfall. DRAM has a strong balance sheet with ZERO long tem debt. Per the agreement, DRAM will develop a special edition RAMDisk utility, which will be called AMD Radeon RAMDisk. AMD Radeon RAMDisk loading times are expected to be 525% higher than those offered by conventional products, increasing performance, eliminating bottlenecks and improving the gaming experience on the PC as well as other applications requiring fast processing like complex engineering simulation models. AMD Radeon RAMDisk utility will be available from October to December this year. DRAM develops, manufactures, and markets large capacity memory products primarily used in high performance network servers and workstations worldwide. The company has more than 70 Fortune 100 customers and it’s been in business since 1967. On September 8, 2012 TechNews Science and Technology published the following article about Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) plans to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage all editions of its AMD Memory modules for desktops, and to achieve this has made an agreement with Dataram (NASDAQ: DRAM) known developer of memory modules for servers, workstations and desktops, plus other solutions and associated services; agreement that will develop a special edition RAMDisk utility, which will be called AMD Radeon RAMDisk and come free with AMD Memory memory modules. AMD Radeon RAMDisk loading times offer up to 525% higher in games and applications (better than that offered by SSDs), increasing performance, eliminating bottlenecks and improving the gaming experience on the PC. AMD Radeon RAMDisk utility will be available from October to December this year, and although AMD or Dataram gave more details on its operation, we assume that this utility to create a RAM disk to use by way of a fast disk cache, based on the Game and application profiles present in the Catalyst Control Center utility, which comes bundled with graphics cards, motherboards (chipset) and AMD APUs. On September 14, 2012, DRAM stated the following in its fiscal 1Q 2013 earnings report: During this quarter the Company entered into two agreements which we expect will generate growth and profits for Dataram in 2013 and beyond: - An agreement with AMD provides for Dataram to develop and sell AMD licensed and branded versions of its RAMDisk software. AMD’s Radeon RAMDisk will target the gaming enthusiast community. - An agreement with Shoreline Memory Inc. ("Shoreline") and the other with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ("AMD") for the purpose of expanding our customer base and product offerings. The Shoreline Agreement provides for Dataram to fulfill 50% of the orders Shoreline receives from its primary customers. Management believes these agreements will provide new revenue sources and expanded markets for the Company's products. Mr. Freeman concluded, “These recent agreements and other new opportunities we are currently pursuing should provide new sources of revenue, profit and growth for Dataram in 2013 and beyond. The experience, knowledge and assets we have gained from our current RAMDisk product, in the development of caching software and in solid state products are building a strong foundation for growth.” DRAM is also an unrecognized cloud play. DRAM makes the XcelaSAN memory/storage family of products for cloud and all other applications. The company recently received $5 million from a Japanese company to allow the non-exclusive right to manufacture products using the XcelaSAN technology.

Amazon is priced for perfection with too many opportunities to go wrong. Again, I love this company in the long run, but the valuation is not justified right now. We're seeing the downtrend begin and the Amazon Press Release Machine is trying to keep the hype up prior to the earnings release-- which will probably be disappointing on a Revenue basis if the economy is any judge. I'd expect this to keep going down. All it takes is one downgrade from one of the nervous analysts or one of the banks ready to profit from their Reverse Convertibles. Then poof. Good luck to all, but long AMZN is not an investment at this level. It's a very risky trade.</Msg><Username>americanuspublius</Username><Timestamp>1349882125871</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 11:15:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349882258888-50</Id><Title>Sell AMZN and buy WMT</Title><Msg>Pretty soon you will be able to trade share for share at same price.

This guy presses the borderline abou whether he should be thrown in jail for gross financial negligence time and time again: he told everyone to get out in 08-09 and after a big run in the markt recently, get into the same kind of bubble valued stocks as he rec. in year 2000. Yes, otther than bubble valuations created by the Fed printing, gas prices going through the roof, the MIdddle East on fire and escallating, and total broken "Centallized WS PLanning system" that cater to banker via Fed printing, that nobody trusts anymore, thre's no reason for the selloff in the markets. Rediculous that we still have a broken system with clowns lke this not taken off the TV after the carnage of this decade and broken system. Why didn't Cramer just say: "buy AMZn from my buds who just ran int up to over 300 times earnings that were declining on the past two earnings and buy GOOG now that my buds have ran it from 565 to 771, so they can sell to you fools" .

I remember laughing last year as analysts were arguing that Google couldn't survive the multifront war with Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, despite the $50B in cash, $15B in cash flow and huge margins. Not ONE has raised the issue on Amazon yet (which shows you the state of intellectual rigor and honesty on WS), despite it having a few billion in cash and competing simultaneously against Apple ($100B+), Google ($45B+), MSFT ($75B+), ORCL ($30B), WMT ($8B).
