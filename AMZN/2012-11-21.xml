These big short term moves are OPTIMAL for my approach, even when they seem to be "killing me" near term. Good luck. The big short is trying to prevent retail shorts from joining on for the ride.

That's a big reason I believe you've seen sales grow but profits shrink to negative: the inflation that Bernanke brings doesn't help the profits of companies like AMZN.

And they have profits at least compared to questioning the profit models of others. What's the model for AMZN? Will it make money on selling all this content? Losing money can be strain when you still have to pay quarterly liscensing for content costs etc that are growing compared to the cash pile. It's called expaneded liablilities versus cash.

And yes, in the late '90s and early 2000's INTC was in a bubble (though nowhere close to AMZN's current bubble, which gives you a sense for the downside here). All of the fundamentals on INTC are strong now. The fear is at a feverish pitch (largely driven by WS media that doesn't understand the first thing about the underlying manufacturing economics). I'll be more than fine. And, I will make a killing here. I used this afternoon squeeze to adjust my LT strikes on AMZN and I used the morning long squeeze to adjust strikes there... Keep pumping. I'm not talking about a slight trade reversal. I am asking you point blank. Year end 2013. You have the "advantage" right now because AMZN is worth more than INTC. C'mon stud.

It's perceived overvaluation is used to allure in shorts while the float is very small with Bezos owning a huge amount to keep it that way. Then bamm!! shorts killed again and again. It's a short killer plain and simple and many rules that other stocks have to live with don't apply to AMZN. I wouldn't get caught up in minute details like sales taxes, hi PE, etc and understand there is more suppport and love for this stock with power awaiting to pounce and kill shorts at every juncture. just look at today as an example.. straight up. Jus one's vewi and opinion who's seen AMZN for years. How do you think it gets to 100's of times earnings and not only holds it, but expands it.

AMZN/CRM mght as well be that hamburger now. The values or the care of the values are so far gone that the traders could be trading that hamburger at 238/shr or 159/shr and not a piece of a compnay. Now AMZN goes up $9 bllion on whether it has earnings or not. At 60/shr, it has scrutiny of being expensive at 50 times earnings. Years later , it gets no scrutiny at almost 240/shre earnings. Easy money has a way of doing that and we've had aload of it from the Fed. CRM? forgot about it. even worse excpept that AMZN is a $100 +++ billion compnay doing it now.</Msg><Username>mets41us</Username><Timestamp>1353532091635</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 16:08:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353532257833-189</Id><Title>AMAZON is a site to coounterfiet goods , knockoffs , this site will be shut down its already in the talks</Title><Msg>Theres alot of people selling counterfiet goods here</Msg><Username>trader5632</Username><Timestamp>1353532257833</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 16:10:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353532266824-190</Id><Topic><Title>Another kick to the ribs for this pig before sybil gives thanks to the powerful trading gods</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1353530982366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:49:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I adjusted all LT strikes today.

Lost respect for Brian Kelley, who I usually think is sharp. The assertion that consumers do not care about taxes is NOT supported by the facts. Significant front loading of purchases occurred in California before tax collection started. The run rate sales are skewed by the release of multiple new product platforms and slightly delayed launch of AAPL/GOOG competitive tablet offerings. And, Amazon's marketing budget is shooting through the roof (the number of Amazon ads on TV is crazy right now...), so if revenues AREN'T ramping hard, it is in DEEP trouble. While "gross margin" is higher on 3rd party sales, "gross profit" is lower. Amazon's "Fulfilled by Amazon" may drive up "gross margin" but it also drives up capital intensity in a big way. It essentially makes Amazon not a retailer, but a logistics competitor to UPS. Unlike UPS (which has built its facilities and fleets over decades out of cash flow), Amazon's scale in that arena is tiny. The reality is also that Google will encroach on Amazon's space with far greater cash and cash flow. Google is best positioned to reinvent retail/shopping because of the size of its ecosystem and the alignment of incentives amongst all of the players in the ecosystem... Watch the evolution of Google shopping, retailer/inventory integration and location based services. Google will offer more value to both consumers (via geographic inventory availability) and retailers (at a lower cost and in a wildly more capital efficient manner) and siphon "consumer purchase" traffic from Amazon over time. But, Amazon will be stuck amortizing all those investments in unnecessary facilities anyway... I'm in this for the long haul. I don't care if it runs back to 260. Google's approach here is simply superior. It's ecosystem is better positioned. Amazon already reached peak advantage. The financial media is doing EVERYTHING IT CAN to pump Amazon, but the reality is that most people like to purchase in person. If Google can ensure local product availability and competitive pricing with its approach, it will win and do so without #$%$ away billions in facilities that never should have been built anyway... Amazon already killed enough retail jobs with its predatory pricing abetted by fundamentally flawed tax structure. It is about to get payback from all retailers matching it on price and Google helping them to provide a superior solution to consumers in terms of convenience...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353540424643</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 18:27:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353540472900-201</Id><Topic><Title>problem with AMZN /CRM is WS thinks/or sells that revenue growth can montizied to earnings growth:</Title><Username>mets41us</Username><Timestamp>1353532421110</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 16:13:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not a Wall Street problem .It's a fund manager game.Period.

See my post on Google's approach and ecosystem. Trust me, Google is focused on Amazon, not Apple as its #1 target. The hundreds of millions of devices for Google were simply a means to extend its search/advertising dominance. Google Now and Shopping are going to provide a whole new level of value to advertisers and consumers alike. The bottom line is that Amazon has competed (with an unjust tax subsidy) with retailers. The vast majority will align behind a Google centric solution that minimizes channel conflict (Wal-Mart and Target would be wise to take the lead on such integration, as should category dominant big box players with big geographic footprints). Given their huge existing footprint and relative ease / leverage in connecting their systems to Google Shopping / Now, they could put a HUGE dent in Amazon's business and growth. Matter of (not too much) time before the next wave kicks in. Despite what everyone is saying, Amazon IS NOT very well positioned for it.

I have the cash to wait it out as it sounds like you do as well. There is no price that can squeeze me. Bring it on, Goog will dominate going forward, more so than apple. Google will be the biggest cap when all is said and done, and fair value sits somewhere around $1,100. So $665 right now looks pretty good. Here again we have to patient, as the economy is going to be awful next year which will lower the markets off its bernake high. AMZN will collapse before GOOG rises I suspect (so my short on AMZN is much, much larger than my long in Goog right now).</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1353551362165</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 21:29:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353551899912-219</Id><Topic><Title>Shorted at $ 230-- Need some input ( I had bought Jan 220 puts at 6.55, now at 4.20 in 2 days)</Title><Username>viking.trader</Username><Timestamp>1353524150787</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 13:55:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks nje457, my only worry is it almost took out the previous high og Oct 26th when results were announced and S&amp;P is at 1390, my worry is i think S&amp;P might go till 1400-1410 range and than the fear of fiscal cliff will coincide with your dates also.

Also - $238 is short-term technical resistance that it did not break through today solidly, so more reason for a decent drop on Friday. There could be trouble though if market good news works in by Fri that pushes overall market up, as next technical stop for AMZN is not until $247.50. If AMZN starts down below $238 and no real good news in MKT, you can make money on a short Fri down to under $235 I woudl think. But if it breaks strong over $238 on good volume early, it could float up into low to mid $240's. So don;t short on temp weakness much above $238.</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1353551973190</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 21:39:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353553802984-221</Id><Title>Cash...</Title><Msg>To quote Jimmy Chitwood from Hoosiers: "I think it's about time I started playing ball."

Once the momo stops this pulls back hard. We are at a major resistance point, 3rd time at this level. Unlike last time we are on a down trend. Failed to break it today.

Some times the tax savings is enough to place the order. With that gone....I will order much less than I have in the past. I assume i'm not the only one.

Even where it agreed to collect the taxes, it is trying to avoid collection on items financed, advertised and fulfilled by Amazon. Given all the California budget issues, I wonder what would happen if Calpers were to divest (both directly and indirectly). FMR wouldn't matter. With the necessary pension cuts that will be coming to state employees around the country, state Pension funds like Calpers have a fiduciary obligation to cut exposure to scams like this and level the playing field for retail businesses that collect sales tax, rather than creating an artificially low cost of capital for businesses that evade state sales tax, even after agreeing to collect it... after all, those taxes are needed to meet future pension obligations.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353558968430</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 23:36:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
