For the most part, technical analysis is pure BS. I won't get into explaining why. It's only valuable from time to time, and over a very short time period -- minutes really -- and is a little different than pure momentum which this stock just caught. If AMZN jumps a few more buck Monday AM then I will call a top there for sure and short it. Recent buyers will panic out when a dip emerges out of the woodwork -- guaranteed. This is not technical analysis, it is behavioral analysis. People who get caught up lose sight of the fear associated with profit protection.

All doesn't matter right now as you've see two huge gapup celebrations the last two earnings on making 17 cents/shr total : that has been worth taking the stock from 196 to 237 and change so far: so on making about $100 million to the bottom line the last two qtrs , Jeff Bezos has increased his shareholder holding wealth alone by $3.7 billion in value in his holdings of about 19 % of AMZN.com. Not a bad gain in your wealth for making such little money based off two shaky assumptions above. No wonder the US is tunred off by the stock market. This Country isn't investing in the future, it's perpetuating scams today on faulty future assumptions. Bernanke should be vilified as well as his money is being used once again to perpetuate these kind scams like the housing bubble and tech bubble before. These scams are reaching new heights when you are running money into triple multiple stocks with crooked numbers in front of that first multiple now , huge market cap stocks , with little earnings: that's when the scam has reached bubble proportions. Where it ends and how, will be interesting. Bernanke is an idiot for using easy money again , leveraging up the Fed balance sheet to use that money for this stuff.

Yet, it's reaching new heights in the scam now that you have a crooked number triple digit mutliple combined with a triple billion market cap, along with little earnings. Becoming a huge misalloction on easy money. Make the Nifty Fifty values of the early 1970's look like value stocks. Another thing is how much big funds own of it, a company with no dividend, huge market cap, no earnings, scary stuff now that AMZN is one of the biggest companies in America by market cap measure.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1343479191000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 08:39:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343480712000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon.com 'The fantacy keeps growing'</Title><Username>sangmani_2000</Username><Timestamp>1343431608000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 19:26:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>totally agree, the only true analysis or this scam, no way the fundamentals anywhere are good and this stock is heavily manipulated by all the analysts firms on the call shett and their largest hedge fund clients.

Any talk about same-day shipping is pure BS because the cost of shipping will put Scamazon deeper in the RED.

These centers are very expensive to maintain and run. They will only save money on shipping if these centers run at 100% capacity. At 85-90% capacity, their shipping costs would be equal to the ones they are paying right now. If capacity falls below 85% (since the cost of maintenance and operation is fixed)their shipping costs actually increase over the current ones. So during the 3 months, during the holiday season, they will be saving on shipping costs. The rest of the year, they will be paying current to higher shipping costs then they do now. If the economy slows down and/or competition from other online retailers takes a bite out of AMZN's sales, then these centers are going to become a major liability.</Msg><Username>frtgrdn21</Username><Timestamp>1343482656000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 09:37:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343482691000-23</Id><Title>Buffett on EBITDA</Title><Msg>Does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures?</Msg><Username>jxkchicago</Username><Timestamp>1343482691000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 09:38:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343483346000-24</Id><Topic><Title>Seeking ALpha guy has uncovered a buy and squeeze/cancel trade scam in AMZN</Title><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1343448645000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 00:10:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Any doubt that yesterdays price action came about because of a major short squeeze? Shorts have been punished the whole week by EU and the general market. Everyone and their mother margined out their accounts to short AMZN because everyone knew that their earnings would stink. This was the big play for shorts to recover their losses. It just took a few big players to hold the stock up and take it a little higher to cause the shorts to panic. With the market up 200pts, margin calls for shorts were calling. Margin calls need to be met by Fridays close. Shorts were forced to cover at any cost to cover their margin calls, hence the 8% gain in AMZN on crappy earnings. Some big players came out with some major $$$ out of this and probably a huge short position into next week.</Msg><Username>frtgrdn21</Username><Timestamp>1343483346000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 09:49:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343483984000-25</Id><Topic><Title>Seeking ALpha guy has uncovered a buy and squeeze/cancel trade scam in AMZN</Title><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1343448645000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 00:10:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"soros was a part of this? are their unmarked vatican accounts involved with this too?"

I don't own AMZN long or short. I day trade it occasionly because of the volatility. Just looking for insight because I don't understand the logic behind it.

That's all you need to know. Until, the float holders sell and get out, they hold the cards in blowing out the balloon. Looks at the funds that hold it it big amounts. Took a long time until Bill Miller of Legg Mason was forced to puke it up in 2008. He used to squeeze the crap out of retail with his big holding until it turned on him.

If your volumes increase by 30% annually, you have to increase your warehouse space by approximately that much in order to store and process everything. And it might have to be even more if new orders are coming from things that are more voluminous per dollar of revenue than the historic product--i.e. diapers instead of DVD's. Of course, if you are selling cereal, dog food and diapers, you might well want to have it in warehouses near the customers.</Msg><Username>amzn_skeptic</Username><Timestamp>1343517418000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 19:16:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343518894000-55</Id><Title>Cracks starting to appear in amzn model</Title><Msg>Institutions will be taking profits soon.

That helped partially offset the losses on the October 300 puts as the price kept going up on Friday (I am long more puts than calls).
