Just as Siri had a big impact on the phone space, so too will it on the tablet space, especially smaller form factor tablets where typing is more difficult. People will happily pay up for a Siri enabled 7" iPad over the Kindle Fire. And now that DOJ has cleared the way for Apple to attack Kindle books on price, Amazon will feel some real pain as it continues to invest while getting squeezed on cash flow.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347510937904</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 00:35:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347511197863-3</Id><Topic><Title>Apple PE:15.

Why would a robot blink, You ask? Because a bot owner programz it to blink.... What makes a robot blink, you querry? Almost anything: a market top, the robot has had enough and is down for maintenance, it thought it saw another robot blink, bernanke prints one dollar too little, the london whale, and one phat phingered trade (a joke of an excuse).... Yep, you cant ask when a robot will blink, or what will make it do so you just have to know that it will, and trade responsibly with that knowledge.... You also have to hope that when a robot blinks that the marjets continue to function afterward so that you can make your trade... Funny things happen when robots blink, and if the markets dont funcrion properly as a result then BOTH sides of the trade are fvcked: The "buy to cover" cant buy, and the panik "sell" cant sell, yet life would still go on, amazingly enough (think weekends, nights and holidayz here). This brings sybil full circle to the premise that scam stok markets are comprised of stox denominated in worthless digital credits who's only dollar value is what the knucklehead or robot on the other end of the wire will pay for them during market hours and when the market is functioning properly... The stok markets sole purpose has been retasked over the last 30 years from a reasonable way to raise equity capital to fund a really good idea to be a wealth stripping machine whose primary function is to tranfer wealth from the many and redistribute it to the few as efficiently as possible.... The end.

Also new ear pods. Why would someone want a $300 4 inch iPod when they could buy a 7 inch Kindle Fire for half the price? One word: Games. Side note. I'am very surprised Amazon did not announce a TV set top box. The Apple TV will dominate video streaming and will never support Amazon Prime. I also have a Roku which does support AP. But in almost every other way, the Apple is superior. The only thing Apple lacks is support for non-HDMI TVs, but as people buy new TVs, this advantage goes away. The closed captions on Apple are much clearer than Roku. The remote control can be programmed to use the original remote that came with the TV.</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1347537927504</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 08:05:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347538839212-16</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon Going Higher!!</Title><Username>mr_cantfixit</Username><Timestamp>1347535535277</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 07:25:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mr: I agree with you that people will buy on Amazon even with sales tax.

I used to love the movies on the site, and the $1.00 movie deals, but while you may get HD movie rentals(too expensive especially for the older movies), none of the purchases are HD, and even then, not good quality and shaky connection....imo. And lately not any good one buck movies. I have recently switched to all iTunes movies all the time, either rent some or buy the ones I like. That way, I have them all together on iTunes and the quality never decreases and I can depend on Apple to have them and move them to other devices very easily. Now even Apple has discounts on some rentals and buys too. I am very surprised that so many love Amazon stock here. I like buying alot on the site, but I always check other sites, and I have even made some better/cheaper cost buys on high end things on Ebay, with great satisfaction.</Msg><Username>michael_d_angelo</Username><Timestamp>1347553188426</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 12:19:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347553320530-48</Id><Topic><Title>Why does Mossberg's Review Even Matter?</Title><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1347549488790</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 11:18:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's see.

The recent decision to charge for listings in Google Shopping is consistent with that thrust. Google is upgrading the quality of the the Shopping results / content. "Google Shopping has one attractive feature that Amazon lacks: a button labeled "In Stock Nearby," which filters results for matching products in and around the user's zip code. That's a great feature for Google local advertisers, and Amazon is unlikely to add it." Google is about to compete by enabling consumers to access products at the best prices proximate to the consumer -- delivering value to the consumer without taking on excessive and redundant low value added low ROIC warehousing and distribution infrastructure. If you remember what I said it was that Google would enable existing retailers to better service consumers without adopting Amazon's ridiculously capital intensive (malinvestment) approach. Google will ultimately end up leapfrogging Amazon because Amazon is still in the business of competing with mainstream brick and mortar retailers... Amazon is burning more cash all the time. Lots of new TV ads = more overhead...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347588257190</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 22:04:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347589953977-136</Id><Topic><Title>IPod</Title><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1347537927504</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 08:05:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Edison: Honestly, I didn't think Ben would be stupid enough to do it. A false sense of security is dangerous. Now, when something goes wrong the crisis of confidence will be much worse if not irreparable. But, it is also why I have been short mainly consumer/retail stories. The commodity/oil/gas inflation will hit the consumer hard and negate the Fed's money printing. Take Amazon. Shipping costs will go up. Even with Amazon's investment in more local warehousing, fuel costs will hit Amazon harder than traditional bricks and mortar retail because consumers simply do not calculate the fuel costs of driving to the store. Amazon, pays for the "last mile". Gas price increases favor Costco, WalMart and Target which service a broad array of consumer needs.
