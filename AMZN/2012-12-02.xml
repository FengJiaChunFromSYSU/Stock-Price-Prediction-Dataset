Amazon needs to buy Boss immediately and keep it going, they did not even have the courtesy to make one more season to end it, though you could make 3 more seasons, and sign that assistant on Kaines Kitty as one of your actresses, she is awesome. The series would drive more traffic and new shoppers to Amazon every time one of Amazons series is mentioned for an award or hype about whats going to happen next, how it is going to finish. Another way Sony could help its cause is instead of making a few movies each year, cut a couple movies off the yearly budget and make series like Dexter, Californication, Shameless, Boss, Boardwalk Empire, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones etc. You make one about Blues, oxycodone 30 mg and Dilaidid 8's, Opana 10's .... it will focus on the street dealing of these pills, the dirtydoctors, what the girls do with older doctors for these pills, the people dead from them, the crooked cops paid off that let heroin be sold all day in broad daylight, the dealers have no fear because they pay the cops off weekly like they do in St. Pete and Tampa Florida, How Georgia is taking over as the next hot spot because Gov. Scott of Florida put the prescription monitoring in place. I guarantee you get 7 seasons out of it... And you make one like True blood but different, less love story more battles, with more focus on the council. Ok enough free ideas for you sony. You wanna pay me, I have 10 more ideas for series that will sell and rescue your failing stock and company. Realistically you should go private instead of embarrassing yourself being listed publicly, but all my puts would be worthless if you did that. Elecronic Arts, Take two, THQ, Valve, Steam told Microsoft years ago that they have already maxed out their processor and GPU, they have been demanding and begging for a new console for over 3 years. Microsoft is suppose to be a leader, because they are located in the USA they have a reputation to uphold and are suppose to be the first out with a console, that being said Playstation needs a hit so quick and bad I think they will release before Microsoft. Sony has discovered it is very hard to sell tv's nowadays with everybody already having a nice tv and the others waiting for the smart tv to be perfected or apple tv to come out before they buy. If I was sony I would put 80% of the compabies research into the Playsation 4 with 20% of that into research and development, they need to get into Artificial reality heavy also. Before the last of the shareholders who are now bagholders in Sony decide to sell the stock and the bonds, they need to do a secondary like yesterday before sony stock is cut in half again. They should approach Amazon to get money then allow amzn to get some exclusive games for their kindle customers that ipad users can't get. Amazon could also rent Sony movies, both Amazon and Sony need to start producing series the way Showtime does Dexter and HBO does Boardwalk Empire, Shameless, Californication etc, Boss just got cancelled for no reason, AMZN needs to buy the rights and continue the show. Please issue a press release saying the new playstation is coming as your stock approaches 5 because if it falls below 4 all bets are off for your systems future outlook. Sony SNE is a stock going to 5, AMZN is a stock going to 300 by Jan 15th and maybe 350 after record earnings if you ask me. I am long AMZN and short bidu and sne.</Msg><Username>classactionlawsuitsonnakedshrts</Username><Timestamp>1354458117494</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 09:21:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354461057506-2</Id><Title>AMZN lslashes prices on AWS ... another short signial</Title><Msg>You don;t lower prices on your growth &amp; margin driver if you aren;t having growth issues.

Everytime AMZm loweres prices in anything, it's thought to be bullish as today's bottom line numbers don't matter. I would think this price slashing in AWS is no different. Hedge fund performance chasing such as Soros funds is the reason AMZN is going parabolic here. Those funds couldn't care less what AMZN earns, as long as they can move the stock price up and lock in gains. Why else would a fund like Soros have been buying into this 4th qtr? I'm sure other funds are doing the same.</Msg><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1354468159644</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 12:09:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354470580648-4</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN lslashes prices on AWS ... another short signial</Title><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1354461057506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 10:10:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Hedge fund performance chasing....

I hope you can see where this ultimately leads, and it won't be pretty. Also "locking in gains" by definition means selling. When more hedge funds decide to lock in gains than performance chase by adding to positions this will reverse in spectacular fashion.</Msg><Username>philtmcnasty8</Username><Timestamp>1354470580648</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 12:49:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354479438804-5</Id><Topic><Title>Living Social could hurt this patent of Local Corp</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1354042958472</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 14:02:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not only Living Social alone - a lot of other companies, too.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1354479438804</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 15:17:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354483969253-6</Id><Topic><Title>Living Social could hurt this patent of Local Corp</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1354042958472</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 14:02:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GrapeSeed Spa at South Coast Winery Resort &amp; Spa $89 - Resort Spa Day: Massage or Facial w/Wine &amp; Pool Value $185 Savings $96 (52%) Time Remaining 22 days, 1 hr, 52 mins 592 Bought Deal Partner Travelzoo DeVine Tours $69 - Temecula: Chauffeured Wine Tour w/Tastings, Reg. $140 Time Remaining 7 days, 1 hr, 51 mins 70 Bought Deal Parnter: Travelzoo</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1354483969253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:32:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354484111015-7</Id><Topic><Title>Living Social could hurt this patent of Local Corp</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1354042958472</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 14:02:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Six $45 - The Six: 'Must-Try' Dinner for 2 w/Drinks, Reg. $92 12650 Ventura Boulevard Studio City, CA 91604 Time Remaining 5 days, 9 hrs, 52 mins 373 Bought Deal Partner Travelzoo Waterproof Spy Watch $32 for One 8GB Waterproof Spy Sports Watch OR $35 for One Stainless Steel Spy Watch (Up to $245 Value) Time Remaining 4 days, 9 hrs, 51 mins 108 Bought Kalologie Spa $89 - Elle Pick: Massage, Facial &amp; Holiday Tea, Save $95 Time Remaining 2 days, 9 hrs, 37 mins 155 Bought Deal Partner Travelzoo</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1354484111015</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:35:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354491424789-8</Id><Title>Techstrategy may be right about INTC--recommended in latest Barrons (Dec. 3 issue)</Title><Msg>Sell Amazon.

I no longer buy anything on Amazon. I also take time to educate others around me that any money spent their leaves the local economy, mostly never to return whereas purchase from local retailers create more jobs here. People are just starting to get their hands around the direct effect, but the indirect effect of centralizing money in non financial corporations is having an even larger impact because the velocity of money is monotically decreasing as more money goes to fewer corporations... Change will emerge from the bottom up. We can either leverage market forces to move in a more sustainable direction, or we will find ourselves reacting to much more profound and socially disruptive change. I'm simply encouraging you to vote your values with your wallet on a daily basis, not just once every 2 or 4 years in a nearly binary, two party dominated world. The market based system affords us an opportunity to effect profound change, little by little. But, few of us actually make the conscious decision to direct our financial resources to shape the world we want. Your views may be (and probably are) different than mine. Nonetheless, I encourage you to embed your values in your daily purchase and investing activity. At least it will increase signal amongst the noise for corporations to do more than just engage in a value destroying race to the bottom...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354505815120</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 22:36:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
