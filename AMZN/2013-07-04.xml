At this kind of debt, every person on the fvck en globe, including gitmo detaineez, snowden, the biotch with the "N" word, every chynk, every hindi, every poor african slob thats eating dirt, and the dude on trial in FLA for pretending to be a cop, should have a net worth of 3,000. No debt, just $3,000 in their pocket. The US fvck in debt could pur 3,000 in every personz pocket on the entire over populated globe.
