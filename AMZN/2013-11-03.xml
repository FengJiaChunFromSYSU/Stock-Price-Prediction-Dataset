I'm not part of the financial 1% anymore, but I can hold my own intellectually with most anyone (and certainly crush most of the Scamalyst making millions promoting this scam), so if I have to restart, so be it (try reading If again and see if you can make it all the way through to where starting again is discussed...). And, I have what most aholes like you don't -- an amazing family and happy marriage. I choose to be an entrepreneur, to focus on technology that has the potential to address our greatest societal challenges (and which will be very profitable because they deal with that which is truly scarce in the modern world). Unlike you, I think critically and try to help people recognize what is really happening beneath the surface. You are a parasitic lower life form of no use to the world. As I said, the future will be very bleak for you.

Does it embed THE EQUIVALENT OF free 2 day shipping? Yes. Costoc offering a deep discount on all of its merchandise has the same NET EFFECT as Amazon offering special shipping benefits to Prime members. For online retail, the cost of the product to the consumer is the entire amount he pays in the transaction INCLUDING SHIPPING shipping.

And it is true that a large percent of shares short is a catalyst to future stock price increases (since those shares must ultimately be bought back).

Actually you dont NEED to do any of those thingz, but when you go broke being a numbskull knowitall by not taking sybby's suggestioz then you NEED NOT wonder why you went BUST. Sorry, but you need to hear something besidez "that techstrategy iz really smart".

Those technologies help mitigate the underlying physics of depletion based energy production, but the physics still applies. Further, the unit economics have changed and depletion rates are very high in tight oil/shale, which alters the nature of the intermediate term supply curve. I'm very willing to consider alternatives and test/reject my hypothesis. Buy, I do so based upon FACTS, not high level assertions that don't stand up to the facts. Keep having at me. But try doing so with actual facts (MMBOE production increase compared to net imorts, deplation rates, required investment to exploit these technologies globally, etc). Energy will play a very critical role in the evolution of global finance. You are misunderstanding how that plays out IMHO...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1383526399263</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-11-03 19:53:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383528805253-54</Id><Topic><Title>The more you boneheadz argue and bet short amzn's sheiotty fundiez - the higher it will go, stupidz</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1383490110587</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-11-03 09:48:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybs, the reason I have at you is that I realize you are intelligent and thoughtful. Dissent and differing POVs are great -- that's how one gets to the right answer faster. I could never have an exchange with the board pumpers like this because they are incapable of critical thought. Seriously, have at me. I'm happy to be proven wrong. FWIW, I think you are conflating multiple energy markets that are not direct substitutes because unlike solar, transporting energy to where it is consumed is a material problem. By now you should know that I analyze things quite carefully, particularly technologies... Try to get a view into how much exploration and drilling costs have increased compared to the increase in production. It isn't all roses on the energy front and the propaganda people are being fed about our unconventional resources....</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1383528805253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-11-03 20:33:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383529425334-55</Id><Title>Mayday!

HDX has been floundering mid pack, always behind lower cost FireHD platforms. But now, all of the iPad Air accessories are catching and collectively passing HDX (despite AMZN being basically the only material channel for HDX). I guess people aren't so excited about Amazon having direct access to everything after signing the 10 year $600MM CIA contract in light of all the Snowden revelations... Besides, when it gets hacked (and it will), it could become a major tool to swindle people... Amazon overreached with Mayday and it is going to backfire.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1383529425334</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-11-03 20:43:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383540002746-56</Id><Topic><Title>Mayday!

Expect Q4 to disappoint across the board. Macro forces are very negative including Obamacare, sequestration and EBT reductions. The fed's QE is even more ineffective now because the $4T balance sheet is a gorilla. The most healthy thing would be a reset correction now. It's time one way or the other.</Msg><Username>jaywishman</Username><Timestamp>1383540002746</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-11-03 23:40:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
