They would figure out how to run goverment more efficiently. Fed+state+local US gvt now spend 42% of GDP (not even counting inter-gvt transfers)!!!! Politicians and Media only discuss the 24% FED spending - you have to also include the state and local (18%) as this also causes a massive drag. We are getting taxed at 34% total, so hence the 8% total deficit. If taxes were raised to wipe out total borrowing (fed+state+local), they would need to be raised 8/34 = 23.5%. That would crush the economy, and ultimatly lower overall tax receipts even with higher marginal rates.</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1356267093007</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 07:51:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356272072338-8</Id><Title>fiscal cliff will destroy retail shopping</Title><Msg>fiscal cliff will destroy retail shopping. hold on to your cash and dont spend!!! tell your children and friends that they will not be getting anything this year...</Msg><Username>pupu0495</Username><Timestamp>1356272072338</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:14:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356272216796-9</Id><Topic><Title>fiscal cliff will destroy retail shopping</Title><Username>pupu0495</Username><Timestamp>1356272072338</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:14:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fiscal cliff will also end food stamp. time to short any food stores. sell sell sell!!!</Msg><Username>pupu0495</Username><Timestamp>1356272216796</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:16:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356272793959-10</Id><Topic><Title>fiscal cliff will destroy retail shopping</Title><Username>pupu0495</Username><Timestamp>1356272072338</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:14:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no need to spend on Christmas present. tell your children and friends no present this year and hold on to your cash. you will need it when fiscal cliff hit next week. anyone on unemployment or food stamp already doomed next week. the ripple effect will hurt you too.</Msg><Username>pupu0495</Username><Timestamp>1356272793959</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:26:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356272936480-11</Id><Topic><Title>Lost over $25,000 shorting this awhile back</Title><Username>duydnih_t</Username><Timestamp>1356240092103</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 00:21:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"One day your lost of 25,000 will be worth 50,000 gain."

The purchase was little more than financial engineering to take advantage of low interest rates to eliminate some office expense to pad forward earnings. Amazon has little net cash. It doesn't get nearly the CapEx leverage everyone claims (I'll highlight that in a future post) because most of the truly long lived stuff is off balance sheet operating leases. AWS upgrade cycles are fast and about to be more competitive, necessitating higher investment and lower margins (see 25% price cut to match Google). It canceled monthly Prime. Why? Seriously. The stated reason was that consumers weren't taking to it. But, why cancel? I thought Jeff wanted everyone to pay when they used something. So why not allow the consumer to continue to have the choice of monthly versus annual? Who cares if only a small subset of customers wanted that choice... That wasn't a consumer friendly move... BruceTheBezosSycophant, Bezos is smart. Page is smarter. A lot smarter. Bezos is in the big leagues now. He isn't competing against B&amp;N or Best Buy. And Page has more than 10X the cash and true FCF of Amazon for this fight. For now, I will simply assert that Google has far more critical strategic assets to truly dominate the cloud enabled future than Amazon. What Amazon has, Google can replicate quickly and relatively cheaply. What Google has, Amazon simply cannot ever afford to build or acquire...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1356285829458</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 13:03:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356287518763-26</Id><Topic><Title>Pumperz are getting slathered with sweet barbeeque sauce and they will be</Title><Username>yhoosuxkox</Username><Timestamp>1356282778108</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 12:12:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I'm long and strong, getting stronger by the day."

Similarly, the Clinton tax hike in 1993 did nothing to harm the economy, in fact (contrary to predictions of Steve Forbes, Newt Gingrich et al) the stock market and total employment shortly rose to record highs. Don't forget that the Government has needed to borrow (either in the bond market or from SS trust fund) every single dollar of the Bush tax cuts. If Govt expenditures aren't taxed they must be borrowed thereby dragging down the economy, which explains the utter and total failure of Bush tax cuts (similarly contrary to expectations of Larry Kudlow, Fax News, et al).

We were essentially the only industrial economy untouched by the war. In favt, we had built out massive industrial capacity in the process. That's why the Marshall Plan and "laissez fair" free trade was so good for us. It was really Neo mercantilist policy under the disguise of free trade... The reality is that we can no longer afford the welfare state, nor can we afford the adverse societal and economic imoact of ever growing concentration of wealth and income -- history shows it is wildly destabiliizing, although we have avoided those issues for now through the welfare state. Pain is going to hit for everyone until we come back into balance. The Fed is trying to allow that to happen slowly in a controlled way, but it really isn't clear it will work, even if the correct way to rebalance the system for all parties is clear (at least to those who understands systems and flows / feedback loops).</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1356304891045</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 18:21:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356306990384-35</Id><Topic><Title>Jump off cliff, and get those 50 million off food stamps for starters:)</Title><Username>fig_plucker</Username><Timestamp>1356105904061</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 11:05:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tech, Essentailly said the same thing sybz has been saying for yearz: we were the only industrialized nation to emerge from WW I and more importantly WW II whose industrial base wasn't nuked like japan's or turned to rubble the whole of europe.

The reason I left McKinsey was to help usher in the next generation of productive investment -- nanotechnology. Yes, a buzzword. But, the essence of it is learning to manufacture with the finesse of biological systems from the bottom up. If you think about the chemical value of you, it approximates a few bucks... maybe. But, like the Visa commercial, you are priceless (entertaining at the least)... We will drive down the minimum efficient scale of production and increase the diversity and robustness of the economy and social stability in the process as we master nanotechnology based manufacturing (nanoengineering if you will). The modern top down manufacturing paradigm has been deflationary standards based diversity killing innovation that ultimately reduces the robustness of all of our systems developing fault intolerant high fixed cost winner take all systems. We have an opportunity to reinvent the way that we invent. And we will. I will give but one example of how innovation can change the future. Everyone bashed solar energy investment. They couldn't be more wrong. All extraction based industries will, over the longer haul, see increases cost per unit of energy (a simply corollary of the declining energy return on energy invested). In contrast, solar energy cost per peak watt has been decreasing exponentially over time (the first solar cells were designed for space and not cheap....). Unlike extraction based industries, human ingenuity and innovation continues to develop new material systems and new structures to optimize absorption efficiency and production economics (think of it as Moore's law for energy). WHEN, not if, the cost curves cross (because they most certainly will in time), the world changes in profoundly positive ways (solar is unique in that is it point of use energy generation without mass transport issues -- which will greatly enhance the robustness of our energy/economic systems). Your bearishness on the US is misplaced. One needs to distinguish between total wealth / income / QOL and median or average wealth / income / QOL. Europe is hosed. Demographics suck. Natural resources suck. Solar insolation sucks. Arable land per capita sucks. Japan is even worse... We think China is kicking tail, but run all the numbers on a per capita basis and you get a different view. The reality is that North America (including our largest trading partner to the North...) is very well situated for the future. We have large resource bases per capita on every metric. We still have significant industry and innvoation. We just simply need to stop pretending that trading creates value, wealth or improve quality of life and start investing in ourselves and in productive assets again. Sure, the next 3-5 years is going to be very painful across the globe. Maybe the next 10 years. But, I am convinced that this country will be the most attractive place to for the next generation to live...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1356309348624</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 19:35:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356311950448-37</Id><Topic><Title>Bought An Amazon Paperwhite Kindle</Title><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1356162445378</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 02:47:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ny times article only 1 in 3 bought books in the last year. i heard from a big e book user that people are now exchanging the media amongst themselves so few actually buy any media. nexus machines are now priced at $99 per unit.
