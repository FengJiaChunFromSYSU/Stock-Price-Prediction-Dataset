No, AMZN will not have "a gentle glide back into "normal" ranges." She will suddenly doubling, tripling, and quadrupling violently to reduce her P/E to more "reasonable" level.

You hit the nail on the head. Geegenjar must be smoking whatever it is that the funds buying this dog are smoking.. I presume the logic is that at some point AMZN will be able to somehow magically increase margins, but I thought the AMZN business model was built around low margins to generate revenues in the first place. AMZN earned $0.81/share in the past year, and is expected to LOSE money the current quarter. There's a very good reason that PE is a highly respected valuation measure, based on common sense... Who in their right mind would pay out $250 to get back $0.81/year, other than in an FDIC insured bank savings account? AMZN earnings estimate for next year is $2.38... At that rate it would still take over 100 years to get your money back based on earnings and current share price. AAPL is expected to earn $44/share this year and $52/share next year. This means only 15 years to get your money back based on earnings, plus you get back over 1% CASH in the form of a dividend... There is just no comparison between the two companies. I think this is bandwagon thinking and tacit agreement among fund managers to hold onto this dog and let it run, lest their returns get decimated and they lose their jobs... Why should this company be awarded with a 300 times earnings valuation? It makes just no sense, and is exactly like the dot com era when people bid up companies until they woke up and realized that a company needs to make money in order to be really worth something.. Everybody got sold on the story that we need to come up with new valuation metrics for these companies, which is pure #$%$.. If there were prospects in place for big margin growth, then ok, I can understand, but as it is, I just don't see it.</Msg><Username>lehman_bros</Username><Timestamp>1346178989554</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:36:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346179200327-88</Id><Topic><Title>4000- sybil is now short 4000 sharez of this trash...</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1346177789395</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:16:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LMAO!!!

You will not get an earnings release before your options expire. The earnings release could be helpful as the company's Q3 quidance was broad. Also the company should announce 4Q guidance at that time which also might help your investment. I believe the current stock price is just silly...so I would think the company will over correct in any market correction...so that is a plus for your investment.
