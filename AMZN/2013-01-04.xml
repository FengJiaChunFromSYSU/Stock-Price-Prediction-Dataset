There is a reason that Amazon has built more distribution centers as it has expanded the breadth of product offering. There is a reason that it canceled monthly Prime. There is a reason that it is offering 3P financing. Jeff knows the economics. He just has no incentive to make everyone else aware of the limitations...

The Prime Minister said he was going to make “damn sure” that foreign companies like Starbucks and Amazon which have been found to avoid legally paying a large corporation tax in the UK paid their fair share. Mr Cameron was speaking weeks after MPs on the Public Accounts Committee accused Starbucks, Google and Amazon in a high profile report of “immorally” minimising their UK tax bills. Last year Treasury minister David Gauke caused a row when he told The Daily Telegraph that people who paid cash in hand to tradesmen, allowing them to avoid VAT, were "morally wrong". Mr Cameron was asked by a business audience in the north west of England on Thursday why “Starbucks and Amazon” were allowed to avoid paying large corporation tax bills, given that they have a large presence in the UK.</Msg><Username>davecarneyinc</Username><Timestamp>1357312308238</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:11:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357312374337-13</Id><Topic><Title>options expiring activity</Title><Username>imalwaysright123</Username><Timestamp>1357311760892</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:02:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If not for the freaking weekly options on this garbage, this will be in 225 for the anemic volume it sees in the recent days.</Msg><Username>netcrox</Username><Timestamp>1357312374337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:12:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357312387855-14</Id><Title>amzn in licensing deal with a &amp; e</Title><Msg>Looks like They Have found Another way To Burn through more cash with no increase to bottom line.

All this Fed printing that is suppose to be trickling down to the consumer via banks, which it is not, has to be going somewhere. The money that is not being lend out cheaply to AMZN and INTC etc. is being used by banks/hedgefunds/investment houses etc. to buy stocks. I assume from the amount of money printed these outfits have to be leveraged to the max...no? Once the rates go up or the trades start going against them or Fed printing stops taking the floor out from under the market they will have to liquidate in droves or they'll go insolvent. Am I wrong in this thinking? Selling will lead to more selling and more selling. Anyone with a 401k in stocks won't ride it all the way down again like the did in '08 which leads to more selling.

I am just trying to have a little fun. Here is my prediction for AMZN over the next few months. In the next 10 trading days AMZN breaks out to a new all time high on slightly greater than normal volume. Several trading days later it closes below 260. Right before earnings it trades back up to its all time high. Earnings are announced and it craters. The rest of the year it trades lower (see also: AAPL late 2011). AMZN will be down 40% at some point this year. One thing I strongly believe is that all high flyers eventually crater. They don't fade or trade flat...they crater. This one will too and it will be even harder than AAPL. Nobody wants to be left holding the bag on a stock where management doesn't care about investors or profits and spends endlessly on expansion for profits that will never come. You can walk on the edge of a razor for only so long. It is coming. It is just fun for me to guess when.</Msg><Username>disfiguredskating</Username><Timestamp>1357335867976</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 16:44:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357336142835-107</Id><Topic><Title>Action: Sell Short.

This means AMZN would have to earn 632 million in profits for the next 170+ years to realize the value people are placing on it now. Absolutely crazy. This stock is worth about $23.

They are bleeding and the institutional longs are playing along rather than rebalancing, probably because they are afraid of the impact on investor sentiment (although they didn't worry about that when AAPL dropped 15% in a week in Dec). They protect scams rather than investments, which is why retail will keep scaling out and money outflows will continue despite this latest attempt to persuade everyone that the great rotation is on...

Sales might be thru the roof but profits must explode this quarter to make it work. The current PE of 3000 looks at best to be down to a trailing 1000 not 100. Cloud is starting to get really competitive will SAP-IBM-ORCL-CRM and many more starting to get a good foot hold. Selling razor blades on line won't get you anywhere. A real time PE of 1000 becoming the new number in place of the hyped 100 will be great fun to watch. so many sellers so few doors.</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1357352545930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 21:22:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357354204926-171</Id><Topic><Title>If AMZN</Title><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1357352545930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 21:22:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TGT has telegraphed that profit is Xmas will not be all that hot. I would be surprised to see Scamazon making more than 15 cents in the 4th quarter. Forward guidance for this quarter will be cut by 70%, to less than 10 cents per share.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1357354204926</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 21:50:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357358799149-172</Id><Topic><Title>If AMZN</Title><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1357352545930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 21:22:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you are even close to right the PE will be in the range of 950.</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1357358799149</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 23:06:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
