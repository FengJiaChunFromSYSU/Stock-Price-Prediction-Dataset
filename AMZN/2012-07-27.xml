If the decline doesn't start next week, then what? The week after the next? Like I've been saying, you shorts are like jellyfish drifting in the ocean without any real sense of purpose or goals.

Apple does not need it high and neither does Google." This is a lie. It was Apple who approached the publishers and hatched the scheme to control prices and they currently charge very aggressive commissions on ebooks and apps the former of which drives prices up and keep Apple from gaining anything but a tiny share of that market. "Apple makes its money from hardware..." Which shows you why they are adept at dealing with Amazon and ebooks. "Google makes money from Ads." I see. This makes the money different somehow I guess. It means they can burn shareholder's cash digitizing all the books in the world and then being unable to monetize it. Yeah, a lot of good their "money" has done them. "Neither needs to charge a penny above the royalty fees on digital content. They shouldn't. They should sink Amazon quickly and harshly." But instead they (Apple) do the opposite of what you say. Apple not only charges more than a penny, they charge 30%. Theirs is a culture of high margins, even if that marginalizes them to a minor player (ebooks). That culture does not tolerate your notion of "not charging a penny for blah, blah..." "Amazon is trying to sell their products as loss leaders..." So does Walmart, what's wrong with that? "Google and Apple will port the content to their respective clouds (Google already does it with music). Sure, legacy books will still be in Amazon's proprietary format, but books aren't like music. People don't typically read them many times." Actually, reading them has nothing to do with. The greatest consumers of books like to keep a library of them to be re-read from time to time and to share with others. For reference. But most of all because most consumers do not read books in serial fashion. They tend to accumulate many books that go unfinished which they hope to come back to later. Shorts don't realize this because many are non-book people so they don't understand how books are used or really much of anything about the business. "It is the FLOW that matters... This will all become clear by the end of 2013, but probably much sooner...." Yes, that should be about the time that shorts really start to feel the pain as the recent investments begin generating levels of profit no current short could begin to imagine.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343362404000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 00:13:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343362593000-6</Id><Topic><Title>There's NO-one Left To Squeeze</Title><Username>tryinman11</Username><Timestamp>1343356534000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 22:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"'they'll let it go and it will be a 30-45 degree slope down."

The quarter's numbers and guidance weren't horrible but weren't great either. Kinda mixed bag. However, there are some warning signs: 1) Revenue growth continues to decelerate, probably due to a larger base each quarter. 32% is the slowest revenue growth we've seen over the past 5 quarters. This comes despite higher CapEx so more CapEx is having a smaller bang for the buck. 2) The balance sheet is starting to show signs of cracking. Shareholders equity is down. Cash and cash equivalents are down due to the high CapEx spend rate. 3) They do a tricky thing IMHO by reporting numbers excluding foreign currency translation. This is not typical of way most companies report and suggests that they are trying to "manufacture" the best numbers possible. The actual 10-Q will have the proper numbers but most investors won't take the time to dig up anything more than the press release. Anyway, if you include FX translation, the comprehensive net loss is $0.32 a share. Since ultimately, shareholders care about income in $ rather than income in Euros or other currencies, this loss isn't a good sign.</Msg><Username>aapl1000</Username><Timestamp>1343365697000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 01:08:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343366119000-21</Id><Title>Full of wishful thinking and speculation ...</Title><Msg>lacking in cost control and effective bottom line management.

You are obviously well read in the retail sector. I heard some interesting comment's today before &amp; after amzn earning's. One was an interview with a guy from nuveen-I believe his name was goldstein. While he had a sizable position in amzn he acknowledged investor's had reason to be skeptical about the business plan. I believe he described it as "A permanent state of profit impairment"! Frankly I was a little suprised at his honesty since he held the stock HaHa I noticed you had some question about just what difference a sales tax change would have as compared to the competition. That's also a question I have had for month's. There was a number thrown out today on one of CNBC segment's by a guy that seemed well informed. He claimed WMT &amp; cosco would actually have approx. a 2-3% price advantage over amzn if that internet tax get's past. Frankly I was not shocked, it just confirmed what I had suspected all along. We hear a lot about amzn's low cost but it just point's out that this tax change, if not a game changer, would certainly be a serious headwind to already razor thin margin's! Anyway thank's again for the informative post's! As a side note-I noticed heavy call buying in FB today obviously looking for a pop, funny how the same folk's were also bullish on amzn!By tomm. close they might wish they had passed on both. In the meantime the zuker lad talk's like he might be another "beez" somday when it comes to FB, "not worried about making WS happy with bottom line earning's number's" Invest Invest spend spend build the company for tomm.--or maybe 20yrs. out!

Besides, they don't just construct a building and get done with it. The center must be stocked with equipement, inventory, powered, cooled/heated, and actually managed and operated by folks on payroll. Since those expense hit before the new infrastructure gets fully utilized, but would stay relatively stable as utilization rate goes up, so the operating margin gets hit at first and then improves over time. In AMZN's case though, it's not just fulfillment/data centers. They are also greatly increasing spending on content licensing and Kindle engineering/marketing. AMZN's goal seems to be becoming the platform for delivering both hard and soft products over the internet, which would turn it into something of an utility company for e-commerce, and they are essentially putting all the profit they generate toward that goal.</Msg><Username>jbk_id</Username><Timestamp>1343380069000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 05:07:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343380247000-37</Id><Topic><Title>Simple answer for amzn being up in AH</Title><Username>shivering_gums</Username><Timestamp>1343345944000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 19:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And making you much wealthier over the years, if you had been long.</Msg><Username>jbk_id</Username><Timestamp>1343380247000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 05:10:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343381097000-38</Id><Topic><Title>Simple answer for amzn being up in AH</Title><Username>shivering_gums</Username><Timestamp>1343345944000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 19:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I prefer to do what I believe is true then making money by going long on AMZN AMZN will crash like all bubbles</Msg><Username>magiv_hegyoni</Username><Timestamp>1343381097000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 05:24:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343381726000-39</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon is in a Trading Range 175-235 for options</Title><Username>johnnov22</Username><Timestamp>1343358204000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 23:03:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then you are clueless.</Msg><Username>timberlane_99</Username><Timestamp>1343381726000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 05:35:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343382114000-40</Id><Topic><Title>Simple answer for amzn being up in AH</Title><Username>shivering_gums</Username><Timestamp>1343345944000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 19:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" You will first see a prolonged period of higher profit " Define "prolonged"</Msg><Username>timberlane_99</Username><Timestamp>1343382114000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 05:41:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343383045000-41</Id><Topic><Title>Simple answer for amzn being up in AH</Title><Username>shivering_gums</Username><Timestamp>1343345944000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 19:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" In 2009 compared to this revenues were huge and profits were huge" $2.52 proftis are huge? ok, but when you compare those profits to some of their competitiors: AAPL , GOOG , EBAY etc. those profits are very small.

In addition they warned on future profits and revenues and now expect a loss of 11 cents for the next quarter which means they will have no pe. They sweet talked the cc as though the current and future numbers don't matter! and since some have made a big deal of the margins again acting as though the actual revenues and profits (profits tumbled 96%) don't matter! I don't know why the stock was up over a buck after the markets yesterday. I've seen thousands of earnings over many years and this is one of the worse ever for a company with such a huge valuation. From my experience the share needs to go down at least 25% or more to reflect this earning report filled with misses and warnings.

You have a hot dog stand in NYC on the corner of Wall Street and Willam Street. You have been lucky enough to have that location for 40 years. You buy the best hot dogs for 80 cents each, with the fixings your average dog costs you $1. You sell your dogs for $4. So you make $3 a dog and have a gross margin of 300%. You work daily (you do take off market holidays) from 10 - 6. At 5:30 one day you have 20 dogs left which you will have to throw away...remember you've been there 40 years, you are an institution, no one wants stale hot dogs the next day. So do you reduce your price of those last 20 dogs which will lower your gross margin. Or do you just throw those dogs away? Sometimes we make business a lot more complicated than it is.</Msg><Username>michaelnicolettict</Username><Timestamp>1343392469000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 08:34:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343392505000-79</Id><Topic><Title>BAC Merrill says gross margins were key, reiterate BUY</Title><Username>dillonofohio</Username><Timestamp>1343392362000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 08:32:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just what are the real gross margins: what they show, or where they decide to put the costs: below the cost of goods line: then they were not so good and it's just an accounting game. lol!</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1343392505000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 08:35:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343392557000-80</Id><Title>AMZN preparing for record 4th Quarter</Title><Msg>Citing that more money needs to be spent in q3 to make q4 record busting!

Amazon's Gross Margins on 1st party sales has averaged 22%. Amazon's Gross Margins on 3rd party sales is 100%. However, Amazon charges a 12% seller's fee. 3rd Party sellers cannibalize 1st Party sales. Instead of buying directly from Amazon with a 22% margin, Amazon is getting a 12% fee. That's why you see revenue figures slowing while gross margins improving. I think slowing Kindle sales also help gross margins since they are selling for a breakeven or loss. It is pretty clear to me that Amazon's strategy is to go after everything. Their Sales Tax Advantage strategy has been torpedoed so they are being forced to build more warehouses locally to reduce shipping costs to compensate. Building out logistics is clearly increasing operating expenses with more leases, headcount, etc.. Forecasts are for a loss next quarter as this expansion continues. This is a negative. If it was more profitable to build more warehouses, Amazon would have done this a decade ago. It remains to be see what Amazon's operating margins will be after this expansion is completed. Walmart right now is the leader in this area. Third Party Sales are increasing. This obviously helps margins, but it also cannibalizes first party sales. Amazon does not want to turn into another EBAY. Media sales. There is a lot of competition here, but this is a high margin business and Amazon needs to build market share. However, I think it is a really dumb move to drive growth through Kindles and potentially Phones. Amazon has not done a good job historically building it's own hardware and keeping up with product refresh cycles is very expensive. Amazon is growing in all different directions, but there are a lot of clouds on the horizon especially when their primary business is going to get hit with Sales Taxes requirements. Amazon needs to push a nationwide internet sales tax through Congress ASAP. Once California sales start getting charged sales tax in September, there is going to be a flood of sales going to other online retailers like Abe's of Maine for electronics or 5th Ave of New York. Amazon's tax advantage is going to shift to other online retailers which California hasn't targeted yet. I think the picture will become more clear after this holiday season and whether Amazon deserves a PE of 300.</Msg><Username>davlee1972</Username><Timestamp>1343397228000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 09:53:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343397355000-191</Id><Title>sell it now!</Title><Msg>..............</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1343397355000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 09:55:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343397372000-192</Id><Topic><Title>SSH @ 226.37</Title><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1343395868000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 09:31:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think so too.

What would you say if AMZN showed $0.00 eps? That its stock price should be $0? That is so naive it defies any logic and makes the people harping about P/E look very foolish. The guy who says "30 is a fair PE" is dreaming. This company has annual sales of 57B and you're saying the market cap should be 6B. That is beyond ludicrous and shows a total lack of understanding of company valuations. AMZN is priced at a low 1.8x sales when in my mind it should be closer to 3x giving a target price of $383/share. This is still cheap compared to companies like AAPL (3.6x sales) or even MSFT (3.2x sales) or the crazy 4.3x for EBAY or 4.6x for GOOG. Even non-tech companies like MCD and KO trade at over 3x sales. When selling private companies people start the conversations at 3x sales, its a good rule-of-thumb starting point for valuation and its a bit surprising that AMZN is trading at just 1.8x sales along with companies like GE or PM or CSCO when in my mind it should see faster growth than those three. PE is a really poor measure for a company willing to zero out its bottom line by dumping all available money into growth both in its existing markets and by trying to enter new ones. If you're looking for high valuations start with P/S and go from there, P/E can be extremely misleading.</Msg><Username>mythicwarfare</Username><Timestamp>1343398466000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:14:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343398473000-243</Id><Title>PWJ YOU HAVE THE GUTS TO SHOW YOUR FACE?</Title><Msg>BAD KARMA FROM YOU!

Furthermore- I really don't even think the analysts are calculating "Gross Margin" correctly in this situation. Amazon doesn't supply us with a "gross profit" line item as most companies do, thus analysts are falling back on total revenue - cost of goods. The problem is, for Amazon the cost of goods line item is only impacted by direct product sales- the service sales are treated as 100% gross margin. But that's not right, when you look at direct competitors - Ebay doesn't have 100% gross margin and neither does Netflix or Rackspace. Cost of services should be taken into gross margin consideration when you're a services company. For Amazon those cost of services are lumped in to the fulfillment, marketing, technology and content line items. They aren't broken out so we can't figure out gross margin for the services sector.</Msg><Username>popnfresh100</Username><Timestamp>1343398918000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:21:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343398966000-255</Id><Topic><Title>A P/E of 193! you have to be kidding.</Title><Username>rb15301</Username><Timestamp>1343398875000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:21:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Precisely what I was thinking.

I find it truly amazing the focus being given to gross margin figure. Amazon itself doesn't consider this measure meaningful and reiterated in the latest 10-Q: "Gross margin increased in Q2 2012 and for the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the comparable prior year periods primarily due to service sales increasing as a percentage of total sales. We believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services."</Msg><Username>philtmcnasty8</Username><Timestamp>1343399475000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:31:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343399507000-270</Id><Topic><Title>WHERE'S SINGHLION, AND SYBS?

Wrong. Apple did attempt to enter into that competition by fixing prices so they could skim 30% off the top of all digital content sales from every one. They failed as this turned out to have been a criminal act. Google had wanted to do something but chose also to do it by breaking the law i.e., digitizing all that content without author permission so the government essentially shut down the project. "When Apple and Google do blah, blah..." Nonsense. If they were going to do anything remotely resembling what you describe they would have done it by now. They're either too inept or too distracted by the near term demands of their own core businesses to ever get involved in a price war with Amazon. This reminds me of dumb shorts swearing to me that Walmart was willing to sacrifice margins and even run negative margins in order to put Amazon out of business. Before that they told me BKS was going to do this. Now you tell me it will be these other companies. Why won't your predictions turn out to be just as wrong?</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343400305000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:45:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343400351000-297</Id><Title>collin Gillis negative on this, has a much lower price target than there.</Title><Msg>He says books are their strong point, still</Msg><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1343400351000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:45:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343400411000-298</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN is in trouble because many states start collecting sales tax !</Title><Username>yuwei56</Username><Timestamp>1343399802000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:36:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In Italy they have opened local whare houses and their domain "amazon.it" just last year.

But Amazon is up for a serious problem now. We are running on the last wheel now where pumpers refer to a gross margin that is not even reported by Amazon. The slight increase in third party sales might contribute to increased margins and no, I don't think it is positive to offer a website for less then committed business partners that are searching for ways to skip the Amazon sales fee as soon as they see any opportunity But the real bang is probably the shift of costs to Selling General and Administrative and other fixed costs (say brick and mortar fulfillment centers, increased headcount in this and other areas and some Kiva robots in the future...) what was variable costs (cost of sales in form of shipping costs) until now. The fun part is, Amazon is still a very seasonal business, so they have to build out warehouses, so that they can keep the inventory to serve Q4 demand as they said and have a lot of overcapacity for the rest of the year. Say slack even in normal business environments due to seasonality. So, look for improving gross margins (that, I say it again, have never been reported by Amazon), in exchange for ever decreasing operating margin and negative earnings. Only imagine that the Online sales tax bill will not be passed on the national level and see Amazon going into a downward spiral. This is particularly important, because their own products, the Kindle line, will even make them more losses as they have to collect sales tax on their Kindles in the of the biggest US states, California and Texas, as of Q4 and Q3 2012. Means increase the price of the Kindle or take the bigger loss to compete with the Google Nexus, iPad Mini etc. Amazon is ready for a lot of trouble. Their CFO even admitted it openly. Operating cost will increase faster than revenue for the foreseeable future. Prepare for one of the biggest short stories in history!!! I see evaporation of anything from 30 to 70 billion in market cap in a couple of weeks to months when this starts. They are starting to drain their cash now. They will even have problems to even build out the inventory they need in front of the higher demand season...</Msg><Username>neoe0</Username><Timestamp>1343400800000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:53:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343400825000-306</Id><Topic><Title>We all know Kindle to Ipad which is a big joke</Title><Username>cityhomemaker</Username><Timestamp>1343400224000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:43:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just read a book?

Attack? Kindle and Fire are not comparable to iPad. They serve different market segments. Don't know where this fantasy of yours got started from. They're simply a way for Amazon to deliver its content. Amazon had been waiting for someone else to develop the device end of the market but no one stepped up to do it in the right way so they were forced to develop a skill set they did not have and bring their own delivery device to market. Apple wasn't going to do anything. Jobs famously said no one reads anymore. So this was actually the opposite of "attacking" Apple, it was entering into a vacuum which Apple had decided at first was not something they thought they would ever get into. They only got into it later after Amazon had proved that people do still read and that the highly educated and high income consumer reads quite a lot. "Nemesis, we'll see this through over the next 12 months. AMZN will crater." These are the famous last words of many a bankrupt short. Welcome to your doom. "AMZN has an enterprise value to EBITDA of over 50! Margins only matter insofar as they enable leverage to generate cash flow. It isn't happening and ironically, it's scale leverage is DECLINING as it expands its geographic footprint." Same pattern for every investment cycle; then the spending eases and huge profits, $billions are produced and shorts like you go broke and are left scratching your heads at where all the profits came from. "Traders can make anything happen..." Stop blaming your poor timing on traders. Own up and admit you did and do not know what you are getting yourself into. "I've profited hugely off NFLX..." Easy come easy go then. If you think Amazon is NFLX you're in for a rude awakening and have found the ideal way to lose your shirt and give back all those gains. "Einhorn in August and early Sept, before his was made public)" Einhorn is clueless in this business. "I'll be here pal. This probably will not break for another 6 months. Doesn't matter to me because I will be here and make huge money when it does..." Or if it doesn't you can go on blaming the "traders" until you give up and cover for a whopping loss. Most shorts do exactly this. Why would I think you were any different?</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343403661000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 11:41:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343403930000-347</Id><Topic><Title>100 Times FY 2013 earnings.

AAPL and GOOG backed off ebook business because in order to compete with AMZN, they’d have to eat into their margin and it’s just waste of effort and time. What’s the point to buy $1 product from supplier and sell at $1 to customer? But his is what AMZN is doing. That tells you why AMZN always had good revenue. Yes they are spending to cut shipping cost and all that. But this price war can’t go on forever. Once they decided to start taking profit and when tax rule kick in, they won’t be the special one and will lose customers. I agree the questions in conference call are jokes. There was no question how they’re going to sustain profitability in the future while keeping the revenue growth.</Msg><Username>howo3579</Username><Timestamp>1343405033000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:03:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343405077000-361</Id><Title>bezos' "stock going higher"</Title><Msg>says Jeff.</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1343405077000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:04:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343405080000-362</Id><Title>CNBC: Bezos was WallStreet banker</Title><Msg>You know what those people are .</Msg><Username>Nasdaqi</Username><Timestamp>1343405080000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:04:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343405114000-363</Id><Title>Wow, even AAPL now getting a bid: guess the bleeding has stopped there</Title><Msg>AMZN benefited from their miss, added to negative sentiment for a great setup.

Once they decided to start taking profit and when tax rule kick in, they won’t be the special one and will lose customers." Funny. Never happened with paper books before once they'd either vanquished or marginalized all the incumbents. They raised margins and made $billions in profit even while increasing the customer base by many millions of new customers. "I agree the questions in conference call are jokes. There was no question how they’re going to sustain profitability in the future while keeping the revenue growth." It was already obvious to those analyst because it is their job to know the company's history and their record on cycles of investment and post-cycles of higher profitability. Shorts have shown me that they do no research at all and so don't know all these things that those analysts do and so obvious. So the joke is on the ignorant shorts. When the huge profits are reported all will be laughing. At them.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343405800000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:16:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343405949000-374</Id><Topic><Title>What the analysts should have asked...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1343358275000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 23:04:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Actually, my timing is great" Well, since you originally opened shorting from $180 and are sitting on a huge loss now I guess it is great in the sense that you did not short from $170 or $160 or lower.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343405949000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:19:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343405980000-375</Id><Topic><Title>What the analysts should have asked...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1343358275000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 23:04:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tech, You are wasting time with nemesis, this guy has been lucky with AMZN, I know from his posts from 2007 when AMZN was at $50s.

But I own many more shares at much lower cost basis. How can I be "lucky" so many times? "He just got lucky that the big investors continue to believe in the AMZN story, even though no profits ever seem to be produced." They've produced $billions in profit in between investment cycles. Why should they settle for smaller profits now when they can build for much bigger profits in the future? "Patience will pay off with AMZN eventually, earnings always, always matter eventually, and AMZN is not going to be delivering any significant profits." That is what every short says just before Amazon DOES produce record profits and before those shorts go broke and go away.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343406253000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:24:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343406256000-382</Id><Topic><Title>How in the effing heck did this go up</Title><Username>pjwi875</Username><Timestamp>1343404701000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 11:58:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is now in the hands of momentum traders.

The only reason that this beotch is running. I have personally spoken to Collin Gillis and he is much more bearish then he appeared on CNBC. 1) Losing share in Europe 2) Losing share in Digital Media 3) Losing in devices like Kindle and making bogus expenses in phones 4) Costs are increasing in all fronts. Negative margins, not just negative earnings and CEO dont care 5) Most important, the effect of sales tax especially in Texas and California on this quarter. Shorts need to push. I have now 9000 shares short. Longs, I highly recommend that you sell shares or write upside calls.

At that time pretty much only AMZN and EBAY sold books online. They had the benefit of not having to cost anything. They just took some commissions. AMZN made a good move to sell the books itself online which killed all the physical stores. Now with ebooks AMZN no longer have the edge because others like AAPL and GOOG also have the devise and capability. Only thing AMZN can do to keep the business is to sacrifice the margin. To compare back then and right now is just silly.</Msg><Username>howo3579</Username><Timestamp>1343407484000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:44:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343407531000-415</Id><Title>Do not understand!

Rice, like Kopelman, thinks the operating profit outlook is not a big deal, writing that “we believe investors have become indifferent to Amazon’s high investment levels. Instead of leading the dialogue with sound fundamental research, it sounds to me like many analysts are following the lemmings, saying in effect, if the stock is up it must be ok. Here's another: Kevin Kopelman, Cowen &amp; Co.: Reiterates an Outperform rating, noting the company’s “strong growth” in North America, helped by sales of media. Kopelman is not concerned about the lower operating profit outlook, writing “Amazon’s Q3 non-GAAP operating profit guidance of $(75)-225 million was below our expectations as the company builds out ahead of the Q4 holiday season” but “Amazon has also beaten the high end of its profit guidance for three straight quarters.” Kopelman raised his year revenue outlook to $61.87 billion from $61.07 billion, while cutting his EPS estimate to $1.37 from $2.11 One question: if its a good thing to invest and build out ahead of Q4 holiday season, why is he cutting EPS estimates for the full year (which naturally includes Q4) and cutting them dramatically?</Msg><Username>philtmcnasty8</Username><Timestamp>1343409314000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 13:15:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343409316000-463</Id><Topic><Title>This is a momentum stock</Title><Username>Pinnacle01</Username><Timestamp>1343406876000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:34:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>except your trades are hindsight: everyone of 'em.

I "get it". But it is all set off by Apple not "getting" that people still read, until it was too later and they had to resort to illegal price fixing. If you have cash but don't know how to use it in dealing with Amazon then the "advantage" is illusory. All Google has done with this and many other projects is burn away cash. If all you do with your cash is burn in away on useless projects as Google has how is this supposed to amount to any kind of advantage. If I have a loaded machine gun but fire all the bullets into the air (the equivalent of what Google does in the media space) how is that going to hurt anyone. "I guarantee you Apple and Google will be more aggressive blah, blah..." Yada yada... Shorts also assured me BKS and BGP would be "more aggressive" but they are going or have gone bankrupt trying. Shorts said Walmart would "get more aggressive" but this hasn't done any good for shorts either. Google Books was a flop. The CEO during that project was fired. Apple doesn't exist to save your dumb short from closing at a big loss. They have their own agenda and if that does not include being able to compete successfully with Amazon on those fronts that are not its core business then I just don't understand why you keep bringing them up. "I added 50% today at $235." So how does it feel to have added even more to your heavy losses already. Is the object for you to lose as much money as possible?</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343413913000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:31:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343413945000-550</Id><Topic><Title>SORRY!

No, but to not see the parallel is silly. "others like AAPL and GOOG also have the devise and capability." Sure, and Walmart, BKS, BGP and Mom and Pops were said by shorts to have "capability", too. Shorts told me there was no barrier to entry. What happened with that? Capability is worth zero if you don't have an appropriate business plan to succeed against Amazon. Why would Apple have broken the law (price fixing) if it had some legal viable plan in mind? (Hint: they were desperate and did not know what else to do.) "Only thing AMZN can do to keep the business is to sacrifice the margin" This is exactly what shorts said about paper books, too, however. Amazon made $billions while "sacrificing margins" while driving the competition out of business. If you were Apple or Google then why would you want to be in a low margin business? Would your shareholders support that kind of move? How does this benefit either company? Shorts think all these companies will come and rescue their short positions when in reality they simply have their own agenda which may have little or nothing to do with selling e-books at low margins.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343416172000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 15:09:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343416259000-595</Id><Title>240 240 240 240 240 240 240 240</Title><Msg>then 420 for wall street!</Msg><Username>condork2001us</Username><Timestamp>1343416259000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 15:10:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343416302000-596</Id><Topic><Title>Ridiculous</Title><Username>jshmyhrn</Username><Timestamp>1343415760000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 15:02:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It a MM engineered short squeeze.

Good, then statistically his turn at being wrong is more likely to finally come up. Many shorts come here having been "right" about 2nd tier and lower companies before being crushed by Amazon. He sounds just like them. "Might do you some good to take the off the blinders and consider some of the arguments from the other side........." I have. But he continues to show his ignorance of the company's filings that don't fit the timeframe he keeps cherry picking to rationalize his losses here. He shorted Amazon at $180. How can you call that smart or his being "right"? You speak of love.

I'm a long term investor. " the environment is changing." Yes, your losses changed from big, to bigger today. "Amazon will be a supernova sized failure over the next 2 years." More likely your short position will be supernova sized failure over the next 2 months. Then implode into a black hole by 2 years. "Those that have followed me over the past 2 years know that I always make sure I can see anything through and that I've always been proven right (profitable) within a year (although CMG took 9 months)." There he goes bragging about some other 13th rate stock he got lucky on. That has nothing to do with Amazon. You've more than met your match and need to go home and shut down your short for a whopping loss before it gets too big. Cracks me up these clueless clowns who come over here having shorted some little feeble company like NFLX or RIMM and think Amazon isn't going to take all those lucky winning away from them and then some.

He lays out why we are in such a messed up situation, that all these interest rates so low is actually really bad for an economy,and he is right because we have the best example in Japan. From his column "This does not reflect a well-functioning economy. To the contrary, if you look across history and across nations, strong prospects for sustained economic growth are typically accompanied by high real interest rates, because the demand for capital is robust and good ideas have to compete for funding. Interest rates are an indication of both the demand for loans and the incentive to save. It is not “stimulative” to depress interest rates in an environment where households, businesses and governments are desperately trying to reduce debt. That policy may insult the value of time enough to deter people from saving, and to reduce the immediate penalty for assuming even larger amounts of debt (as the U.S. government continues to do), but it should be clear that these actions move the economy further from a sustainable equilibrium, not closer to it.

At the time, the earnings estimates for the quarter I was referring to were north of $0.40 per share, and those for the quarter that Amazon.com just reported were north of $0.50 share. Amazon.com has just reported $0.01 per share for that quarter, and guided towards a loss for the next one. So the losses really are about to arrive. Meanwhile, at that time the theory for Amazon.com's continuous earnings underperformance was that it was investing in its future, and in more and more warehouses to bring about that future. So the story went that as soon as this investment stabilized, the earnings would flow. However, even then there were several reasons to believe Amazon.com was telling a bogus story, such as: Investments are mostly capitalized and depreciated over time, so the earnings impact is not as large as Amazon.com paints it; Other growth companies in the past didn't have to excuse poor profitability with ongoing investments. This is true even of companies in sectors similar to Amazon.com's, such as Wal-Mart (WMT). Anyone can check Wal-Mart's history and confirm that in spite of strong growth and investment, earnings never flagged; More glaringly, most of Amazon.com's infrastructure investment is taking place in the U.S., yet most of the margin compression is taking place internationally, as can be seen from the imploding earnings contribution from the international segment. As I said at the time, "Having arrived here, it should be perfectly clear to anyone that the reason being advanced for Amazon.com's margin compression is bogus. And it being bogus means it will persist.". As we know today - but wasn't the consensus expectation back then - the margin compression persisted, confirming the misleading nature of the story. http://seekingalpha.com/article/757641-amazon-com-the-fantasy-keeps-growing?source=email_rt_article_readmore&amp;ifp=0</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1343420343000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 16:19:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343420428000-661</Id><Topic><Title>Nasdaq_6000 reminds me of panicbuying</Title><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1343420050000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 16:14:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am good, I posted my position what is your position?

This practice results in much higher gross margin as a percent of revenue and is allowed under a little understood accounting guideline called EITF Abstract Issue No. 99-19: Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent.&gt;&gt;&gt; And the question on the call from the woman at Golman confirmed it. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Question on the gross margin, continues to climb up, and I was wondering if you could give any commentary there around how agency versus wholesale and eBooks is contributing to that? Tom Szkutak Yeah, the bigger issue is not that, it’s related to overall 3P, a number of factors of different factors certainly driving the improvement in product gross margins that you are referring to. But as it relates to 3P, it’s on the broader 3P. So if you take a look at from a units perspective, third party was 40% of our total units in Q2. That’s up from 36%. So it’s approximately 400 basis points increase as a percentage of total units which is certainly one of the factors that you are seeing there. For me this is just playing with some very insignificant numbers.</Msg><Username>michaelnicolettict</Username><Timestamp>1343423404000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 17:10:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343423679000-679</Id><Topic><Title>What the analysts should have asked...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1343358275000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 23:04:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You'll find out the hard way that I'm no chump." And you'll find out that your past random luck has made you unable to see just how big a chump Amazon will make of you. "I can hold my own with anyone in this lifetime. Up 1400% in 3 years. Will double again this year." Anyone can write down numbers. How will you double anything when your short Amazon at $180 and even more recently for losses? "I do it through hard work, fundamental research and most importantly strategic analysis." No you don't actually. You simply skip the cycles where Amazon proves your theory wrong and cherry pick selective periods that justify your losing short position. "My strategic analysis has been right every last time. It will be here as well." Well, you picked the wrong stock this time. Amazon takes chumps like you and spits them out. You will be no different I can assure you. Your predictions have already flopped. Google has been about flat since you predicted such great things from them. "FWIW, I'm still up on AMZN." Sure you are. "I was up big from the drop from 240 to 175." Ah, what about the losses from before that when you shorted around $180. Did you cover those at 240? "The more this gets overextended, the more I will make when it crashes...

After CMG cratered, I kept a small position there and bought the 100 options here (actually I also held 10 August 210s and 10 220's, which I also sold for a profit while at 217). So, yes. I am up on AMZN and a lot. As to Google, it will break out over the next year while AMZN craters. Actual investors understand that even at scale with improved margins, AMZN's cash flow will pale compared to Google's. The facts are quite clear. Amazon's ROIC, ROA, ROE, inventory turns, EBITDA and FCF all are declining as it overbuilds low value, high capital intensity physical infrastructure... Gross margin means nothing if it requires excessive fixed asset investment to increase margins... Amazon will end up losing ground in electronics once taxes are charged. It will end up with a purchasing bias toward lower value density goods, reducing revenue growth and increasing shipping/logistics as a % of revenue. Save this post. We'll see how it turns out.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1343427280000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 18:14:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343427396000-700</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone holding their short positions over the weekend</Title><Username>tradetheseknuts</Username><Timestamp>1343421716000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 16:41:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Added 50% today.

"Actually, I was out from 175 because I decided to focus on LULU and CMG which were more overextended." Sure you were. And when you cover for a loss here and go away I'm sure it will be to "concentrate" on some other minor companies like those again we'll hear after the fact how you were conveniently "out" too. "You'll note I had almost no posts here (nor positions between then and 228)." Don't you see the pattern? Amazon doesn't behave as you thought it would so you wander away and lose interest and short much weaker companies. So your choices seem to be to either lose money or go away and short other companies that you can make some money on.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343427972000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 18:26:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343428016000-704</Id><Topic><Title>Nasdaq_6000 reminds me of panicbuying</Title><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1343420050000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 16:14:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"100% same person. check the ip.

You'll also find that I almost universally treat people with respect and never relish their losses. You might learn from that... AMZN's cash flow yield is abysmal. It is taking on greater fixed and semi-fixed cost all the time while generating less cash flow to cover it (negative cash flow of late). That makes AMZN inherently more risky than it was before... Macro weakness, tax collection and competitive responses are going to make this a train wreck over the next 12 months. Nemesis, spend your time trying to intimidate/BS someone else. This company has been valued based upon how its stock trades rather than the underlying future economic value capture from the business for a long time. The times they are a changing... Shorts, understand that this could look like CMG's chart from Nov though this July. If you cannot take that kind of squeeze, you are too deeply committed and will get washed out at some point by one of the BS moves like today. Short fewer shares. Buy fewer put contracts, deeper in the money and longer term. You can always adjust strikes / extend duration AS THE situation/economy evolves.

The fact that the story keeps changing and the rationale for higher stock prices is the inept analyst community attempt to shut the barn door after the horses are out. They can not conceive of any real reason for AMZN to be trading north of 100 billion, but like magic, the stock keeps levitating. So they search for some kernel of a story, even though they can barely keep a straight face while shoveling their drivel. The only explanation for the AMZN levitation is limitless buying in the face of short bank accounts being exposed to the trade. The only real money entering the AMZN trade is short money. By any metric, AMZN seems ripe for a fall, so shorts continually enter the fray. The HFT machines and their hedge fund owners have figured out a way to buy and cancel their trades with one another, giving them limitless buying power without any real cash needed for settlement. It's the reason AMZN trades the way it does, gapping in the face of obvious short news, when shorts "rationally" enter the pool. Last night and this morning are perfect examples. AMZN shorts sell the stock, and then the HFT machines take over. They push the stock higher in rapid fire fashion, trading with each other, and then cancelling the trades at the end of the day. The short pain becomes real, and the money transfer from short bank accounts is the fuel that keeps the trade working. As long as there is new short money, the pattern continues. There is no regulatory body to look at cancelled trades. If you could continually rob a bank and never get caught, wouldn't most people? I know you dispute this theory, but the tic data and the trading charts are the compelling evidence. What other explanation for the repeated trading pattern can you provide?</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1343436911000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 20:55:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343437278000-734</Id><Topic><Title>It might not just be about earnings and valuation</Title><Username>incognitusfn2</Username><Timestamp>1343434925000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 20:22:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMZN is not about valuation.

If and when the US heads into recession (we are simply 1 years behind because we are the world reserve currency and Ben has printed aggressively from the get go...), AMZN is SCREWED. Look at the European growth rate. Look at the losses. The problem with overbuilding capacity is that if aggregate demand softens, it is not easy to scale back. Costs are fixed and semi fixed. This is going to be a REALLY fun year for AMZN shorts. Probably squeeze this to 52 weeks highs first and weed out the bandwaggon shorts, but those that plan appropriately are going to do very well..</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1343446804000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 23:40:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
