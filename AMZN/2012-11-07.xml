Meltup is likely over since not many greedy bears will risk turning into a long at these levels, and since money got sidelined from Sandy,, the margin clerks were busy last night and calculated the next path of least resistance is DOWN,, all them bulls bought calls hand over fist thanks to TD who appeared on bloomberg and cnbc 2 weeks ago making aburd pattern calls based upon history,, yet he didn't consider Sandy. They probably got upset at fact Monday had zero bulls buying the dip let alone last friday traders sat on hands after the morning pop, so THEY got out the red phones overnight and said "oh well" lets crash it now upon the Dems.

Its right under everyone's red noses. What many don't know is that when they buy QLD UPRO SSO QQQ let alone SPY or TQQQ and the countless other tech and target market ETFs (imagine all the mutual funds let alone iShares Direxion etc) that AMZN is almost always a component. Even when a raunchy bear has "switched sides" and gone bull for an hour here and there they unknowingly contributed to buying overvalued AMZN rising on that hour or day as the case might be. Not on their life would they ever think to be long AMZN at such crazy valuation, but the banks created this lack of trust on the liquidity side by NOT HAVING TRANSPARENCY from the getgo. If the shadow banking system told society at large the truth - that they planned (in synch) to buy the market at 666 and hold for a few years, then people could've put the real mob criminals away on the biggest insider trading scandal in market history. They have no unwinding plan, so this could go down $10 today and won't surprise me the least. Shorts mostly gave up so there exists little to hold this pig up hereon.</Msg><Username>tj_shanks</Username><Timestamp>1352295710790</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 08:41:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352295894513-19</Id><Topic><Title>Ohhhh no !

No wonder AMZN constantly puts out press releases: not one is ever questioned and it's "buy buy buy" . Thus, today's valuation metric differences more glaring than ever b/t AAPL and AMZN. Even if AAPL were to stumble, they are so much more cushioned after their spectacular execution the last few years to gain a strong balance sheet? who knows with AMZN: it doesn't compute to the values given, even if they executed to AAPL: which they can't b/c their businesses are much lower margin or no margin the way they give things away. AAPL should be the last company standing in the latest bull market, not AMZN: but AAPL is below it's July 2012 lows while AMZN is over their's by about 30 points while losing money. incredible stuff.</Msg><Username>im_too_hipp</Username><Timestamp>1352304605921</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 11:10:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352304819693-51</Id><Topic><Title>Wow, AAPL is heading towards $380.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1351690856813</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 09:40:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It works until it doesn't...

How long have i been saying this? Wait for the 17th my friends. They could still squeeze you like last friday. Call the sec, it will do no good. these criminals. There is no price discovery in this market, just churn and manipulation. Stop trading until January or fiscal cliff deal, euro resolution. You have little to lose by watching the fakeouts. Up 150, down 300, they are playing games with real peoples' 401ks and pensions. This is American, not JPM's casino. 232.5 is the magic number, they won't let it fall past there significantly, and they will abandon it on or after options day. Weak guidance and unbelievable PE, but they are leveraged into their calls so will play with it. TRUST ME. I am cash, want short shares, but waiting for the next tape painting churn short squeeze. Analysts are being paid handsomely and likely extorted, so will find any dumb thing to say to coax your money in. #$%$.</Msg><Username>shakagenghis</Username><Timestamp>1352320078176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:27:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352320083200-120</Id><Title>LMFAO!!!

One day soon they will give us an idea how many Kindles are selling. My guess is that it is a lot and Amazon will make money off of a high% of those kindles. When Amazon starts making money the shorts will need to come up with another reason to short the stock besides its PE, linked in has a crazy pe, so do a few others. People that enjoy trading and like to trade, they trade Amazon stock. I trade in and out of it a couple times a week, the option premiums spike and decline rapidly, that makes for an awesome trading environment.

Selling Amazon is a robust strategy for virtually every realistic macroeconomic scenario.... Those that think otherwise should read Ray Dalio's primer on how the economy works. You might come to understand why... Good luck with your 52 week high...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1352346551969</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 22:49:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352350364163-155</Id><Topic><Title>By the way techstrategy: INTC as new 52 week lows now, AMZN's was what? 167? lol!!</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1352323790772</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 16:29:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For those of you who are investors, I will connect a dot or two on INTC. Most of the worlds FPGA chips (used extensively for signal processing and communications technology) are manufactured in Taiwan. It is a massive national security issue (see Panetta's comments on Huwaei and ZTE hardware, which is a separate, but related issue). The TCO of using foreign made chips in is too high. DOD (and domestic companies with a clue that care about corporate espionage) realize we need domestic foundries. Guess who has the most advanced and secure foundries with excess capacity that will soon be upgraded to 14nm? Google "FPGA foundries" and read the article "The Hunt for the Kill Switch". It should scare the crap out of you. It should also make you realize why investing in INTC is very wise in light of recent comments about communications security.... More to come. Selling AMZN and buying INTC at these levels will price to be the best investment decision you ever make.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1352350364163</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 23:52:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352350406267-156</Id><Topic><Title>236.25 very critical.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1351689661158</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 09:21:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok so it made well below the very critical 236.2500 today. And even stayed there at the close. So Greenie does that mean it is still very critical or never changed from very critical.

As in Nov 8? 2012? Did you put a margin trade in? Buy/see some options? Mortgage the house? You are that sure? Or maybe another guess?
