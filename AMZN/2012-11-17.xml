It knows the Titanic is sinking. It unloaded the most critical passenger on the rise up via the upper deck (selling calls and getting called away). Once Q4 hit, it knew this was gonna sink cap'n. So, it started unloading via every available avenue IMHO. That's why GeegGee's desperate pleas for squeezes have been unrequited. It knows it has to sell through the squeeze, or somebody is going to do to it was happened to GMCR (remember when it got cut from 50 to 25 after having already dropped from 110, all while FMR half something like 15-20MM shares...). Some large holders are going to see their stuff cut in half minimum. Probably a bigger haircut than that. I'm in no hurry. As time passes, I keep making more elsewhere and am able to increase my position here because this is, by virtue of the scale, the biggest scam in the market and one of the biggest in history. Is Amazon a retailer? Find me another retailer with valuation metrics close to this. A consumer electronics company... find a large cap one with anything like this? A fulfillment company (which is probably the most apt analogy for 3rd party). Again, can't get close. Break Amazon's into its constituent pieces and value each of them is based upon the industry norms rather than as a story (or rather a strategically unfocused morass) and you'll find that it should get cut by somewhere in the neighborhood of 80%. That's where it will end up when the story starts to fall apart. And that starts next earnings release. So, the big boys gotta use every exit in sight basically all the time if they don't want to be GMCR'd... (I wonder if the Fidelity funds that pared back were the ones that learned the lesson from GMCR, while those that added missed that episode). Good night and good weekend.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353129208692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 00:13:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353130730376-2</Id><Topic><Title>This pig iz dead money to the institutionz and their bots are trapped</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1353115806228</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 20:30:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This tablet is killing me.

All its biz units except is core retail website are halfarrsed competing with companies who do a better specialized job. This mile wide and 2 inches deep strategy cant work.....when have you ever seen it work? the vix has yet to pump up so the fear hasn't set in. Its ldenial. Reminds me of hurricane sandy, the pundits were saying the damage was gonna be 1 billion one week before it hit shore, now its north of of 100 billion in damage. when the vix pierces 20 watch, if it breaks 25 then it almost certain we get at least a 20% market correction. the politicos may kick the can down the road, but if they kick it into mid 2013 then we got the sword of damacles hanging over our heads for months. Don't see how thats gonna help. Also if they kick it into mid 2013, then how does anyone plan their tax strategy? I could be locked into a mid year tax policy with no ability to adjust my selling/gains. Could be caught in a trap midyear with the guberment giving me the high hard one without any recourse. Thats not gonna go over well.</Msg><Username>erbium_doper</Username><Timestamp>1353164271756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 09:57:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353164774560-5</Id><Title>Anyone have TDAmeritrade?</Title><Msg>Spent some time this morning doing some research on AMZN. TD Ameritrade has a reports and ratings section so I decided to read thru all the "buy" and "recommend" reports to see if my short thesis is flawed in some way....maybe I'm missing something. I found the Credit Swiss report to be of interest. Besides the big pump job and the avoidance of the elephant in the room they do a great job collecting all the key data. On page 10 there is the actual income statements from 2010-2012 as was as the estimates for 2013 -2017 (how you can predict earnings that far in advance is beyond me) But in a nutshell: 2010 2012 2014 2017 sales $34.2B 62.5B 103B 185.5B dil. EPS $2.53 .10 3.76 11.14 Now assuming that AZMN can triple it's sales in the next 5 years, which I find impossible considering that it has increased it's sales by 30B the last 2 years getting into all these new ventures and it must increase sales by 24B annually to achieve these estimates. And assuming that the profit margins increase to 3.7, as stated on the report and assuming that EPS can hit 11.14 in 2017 and assuming the stock price doesn't change.....the pe will be 20. That is one hell of an investment if you ask me. - PJ</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1353164774560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 10:06:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353165239919-6</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone have TDAmeritrade?</Title><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1353164774560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 10:06:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"2010 2012 2014 2017 sales $34.2B 62.5B 103B 185.5B" a double every two years.....pretty soon the entire world will by all their stuff from Amazon. after that they release a product that does cold fusion, invent the cure for cancer and we all fly around in Jet packs.</Msg><Username>erbium_doper</Username><Timestamp>1353165239919</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 10:13:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353168469247-7</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone have TDAmeritrade?</Title><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1353164774560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 10:06:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PJ: Send me a copy. I'm going to have some fun with that analyst over the next few months. Seriously. The funny thing is that VC's laugh at hockystick projections from entrepreneurs even with game changing or category defining innovations early in their life cycle. Amazon simply doesn't do anything that other companies do not do. Whose going to cede that $120B when the retail sales are stagnant (and that will prove optimistic when our massively leveraged and indebted household see austerity because the savings rate cannot continue to decline with interest rates this low and debt ratios this high -- there just isn't more debt capacity in most US households)? The dominant mass market / multi line retailers are just really starting to take amazon head on (price matching, booting Kindle to force Amazon to ramp marketing expenses) and while the consumer value proposition has diminished on its non 3rd party do to collecting tax in many (soon to be most) of the most populous and highest income states. And at some point, they'll figure out the real economics of 3rd party versus Amazon sales... Gross margin is NOT the right metric. If a consumer if definitely going to buy a large ticket item from the Amazon website, would Amazon rather have it bought from Amazon or 3rd party? Why? At some point and soon channel conflict is a coming... Right now, it is really just the continuation of sales tax arbitrage under a different banner (and I suspect Amazon will end itself on shaky PR ground, if not legal, when it becomes clear that it is financing inventory for sellers in states where it is fighting payment of taxes on "Fulfilled by Amazon" product). I'll be making sure the California retail association understands the real motivation behind Amazon funding 3P inventory and how they can look for biases in its funding that would limit competition with Amazon product (opening the channel conflict Pandora's box) and sales tax collection (disporportionately funding sellers in tax collecting states)... I cannot wait for the stories on 3rd party financing tax evasion and 3rd party favoritism for those that are in tax collecting states because they are going to cut through the #$%$ and do real damage to Amazon's last remaining differentiated asset -- it's brand.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353168469247</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 11:07:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353169780598-8</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone have TDAmeritrade?</Title><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1353164774560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 10:06:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bla bla bla....
