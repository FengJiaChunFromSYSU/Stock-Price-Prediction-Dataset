FB is a value play and growth story at the same time that has low expectations built in. Unlike AMZN, FB actually turns a profit while it invests and expands. It has true untapped potential it is sitting on - unlike AMZN which has any sliver of hope for profit blown out of proportion to support the ponzi scheme. FB has actual profits. Let's compare a few facts: 2013: FB is growing at 35%, AMZN 20% 2013 FCT: FB operating margin is 30%, AMZN 1% 2013 Operating Profit: FB = $2.0B, AMZN = $0.7B (while AMZN revs are 10x bigger!!!) Who should get the higher P/E??? Here is what the market thinks the answer to that question is: FB 2014 fwd P/E = 34 AMZN 2014 fwd P/E = 83 With a growth rate higher than its fwd P/E coupled with expanding margins not sure why you would short FB. AMZN on the other hand, has a P/E 4x is revenue growth, on shrinking revenue and an operating margin so low, that if the economy sneezes it will bleed cash.</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1368884051551</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 09:34:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368897616710-4</Id><Topic><Title>10% rally for amzn</Title><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1368822101787</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 16:21:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Once: It's hopeless to educate those who are true believers. Never mind that Facebook truly does have network effects where Amazon's core business does not. FB and Google invest strategically in high ROIC assets. Amazon is rewarded for doing the opposite... This trading scam will be exposed in time... can't fight the diminishing true FCF and simultaneously increasing leverage into a weakening consumer for much longer. If not for the $3B in Q4 (on the back of less than forthright disclosures), Amazon would already be in trouble.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1368897616710</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 13:20:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368897942268-5</Id><Title>Tech and once - yiu talk findie this and cash flow that, when in reality...</Title><Msg>Stox, all stox, are merely bitcoinz</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368897942268</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 13:25:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368901990018-6</Id><Topic><Title>Tech and once - yiu talk findie this and cash flow that, when in reality...</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368897942268</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 13:25:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Imagine this scene in the not too distant future. The retail police roll up to your house. They work for an arm of the Fed. After the usual niceties, they point out that you haven't ordered a dress shirt online for the past 10 months. You aren't holding up your civic responsibility to consume maximally. They know everything about you, your family, your patterns of consumption, etc.. Paranoia, maybe. This frenzied full court press by the Fed, with a moribund self-centered Congress is going to have bad consequences.</Msg><Username>clearsighted1</Username><Timestamp>1368901990018</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 14:33:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368913503494-7</Id><Topic><Title>Tech and once - yiu talk findie this and cash flow that, when in reality...</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368897942268</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 13:25:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The problem is that WS has tranformed capitalism into a consumption ponzi.
