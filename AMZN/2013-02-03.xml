Its growth story near end. Its revenue growth ration year/year will be less than 20% in the current quarter. Profit growth is negative. Its stock performance will be similar to CSCO when it's $65. Basically will keep going down when it has smaller and smaller growth. Most likely next year its growth will be single digital year over year due to big sales tax impact and serious competition from local retails.</Msg><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1359868072079</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 00:07:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359868172407-2</Id><Topic><Title>Welcome to new shorts here.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1359863439302</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 22:50:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>u are a child who only paper trades</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1359868172407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 00:09:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359868897685-3</Id><Topic><Title>Sybs is a fantasy freak</Title><Username>arkie_golfer</Username><Timestamp>1359842812200</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 17:06:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1359868897685</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 00:21:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359872509565-4</Id><Title>Actually amzn pumperz....</Title><Msg>this pig led the market 'rally' by 3-6 months, and it will lead themarket crash by 3-6 months...

No one cares about profit. The only thing that matters is revenue, and revenue growth. It literally does not matter if AMZN loses 1, 2, 5, 10 billion a quarter as long as they post a revenue gain. If they lose too much money in a given quarter, they can simply raise capital in a variety of ways. This is no problem for AMZN to do. Here is an example of how it would work: AMZN lost 10 billion, so they borrow 10 billion today, and pay back 11 billion two years from now. In theory, the 10 billion from the loan today can even be counted as revenue and revenue growth (the only two things that really matter to investors anyways), and propel this stock up even higher! AMZN is going to do great things. And I mean great. It is one of the few companies that has sustained a P/E of over 3000. It is such a good company, that I can see it sustaining this multiple for years to come. With the great management team AMZN has, I can see this multiple getting upwards of 10'000 and sustained. All these pitiful shorts on this board keep complaining that AMZN needs to make profit. Why? Look at the stock price. That is really the only thing that matters more than revenue and revenue growth. If AMZN stock price keeps going up, and we all buy and hold stock, then who cares about profits? Not I. AMZN is able, and will continue to be able to break the unwritten rule of the stock market and have its stock price continue to go up without ever making a profit. I mentioned earlier about the great management team this company has. That is the reason why it can and will be done. I know this all sounds improbable that management can pull this off, but they know exactly what they need to do. I am confident that they will put a lot of money into R&amp;D for new products to sell (at cost, or course - we do not want to actually start generating profits). Ideas such as selling pills that you add water to and put in the microwave to become full meals, flying cars, and anti-gravity machines come to mind. AMZN can probably pull that off. Also, things such as time travel and space warp machines are probable, but much less likely. Second, AMZN's management is likely to make some amazing discoveries in the animal kingdom. Bigfoot, a Liger, and a Unicorn are most definitely going to join the board of directors some time soon - this should send the company up even further. Last but not least, AMZN has a trick up it's sleave to make investors forget that it doesn't make any money and will never make any money. It plans to raise the island of atlantis and use that as a headquarters for their operations. This will cause some logistical trouble with shipping, and at first they will have to rely on their flying jet packs for shipping. However, within a few years, AMZN will unveil the world's first teleportation device for shipping directly to a person's home. These teleportation devices will be for sale to anyone, but will be sold exclusively at or below cost as to negate the stigma associated with companies that generate profits. How can anyone possibly think that this stock will EVER go down?</Msg><Username>kevin.grygiel</Username><Timestamp>1359880735402</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 03:38:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359882572081-8</Id><Topic><Title>The REAL bullish case behind AMZN's amazing growth - and why it will continue to grow!</Title><Username>kevin.grygiel</Username><Timestamp>1359880735402</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 03:38:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You like mental masturbation?</Msg><Username>stock_lol</Username><Timestamp>1359882572081</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 04:09:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359882695481-9</Id><Topic><Title>The REAL bullish case behind AMZN's amazing growth - and why it will continue to grow!</Title><Username>kevin.grygiel</Username><Timestamp>1359880735402</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 03:38:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL I am simply explaining the position that longs have!!!

Essentially, what AMZN does is "leveraging". The danger with leveraging is when the balance of premises (sales tax, income tax, competition paying attention, regulations, laws, etc) start to change and the leveraging start to go against AMZN, the effects can be devastating. People mistake Bezos trying to hit every market as a visionary move, but in reality, he is just trying to outrun his shadows and in doing so, he may very well blow AMZN the company, not just its stock, up. There is a reason that other major highly profitable corporations with an abundance of cash don't attempt to do what AMZN does because, well, it does not make sense. And, we have already seen the leveraging start to move against AMZN. Their last quarter (traditionally their best) and their guidance were hit badly on both earnings and revenue growth.</Msg><Username>stock_lol</Username><Timestamp>1359883696289</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 04:28:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359894697805-11</Id><Topic><Title>Another Barron's article mentions AMZN as a top holding of the fund manager: at the bottom as well, bullish in Barron's this weekend.</Title><Username>ayahtolla2003</Username><Timestamp>1359807890837</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 07:24:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe they could sell stock or take a loan ( 3 billion to get into that business for a couple of years)</Msg><Username>rocketman2001ab</Username><Timestamp>1359894697805</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 07:31:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359894954394-12</Id><Title>AMZN to go down to 180</Title><Msg>Overpriced stock.

Like any successful stock the general direction has been up. Like Berkshire Hathaway's Buffett, Amazon's Bezos is a respected figure, and, more importantly, a success story. I don't want to say the comparisons are on all fours, but they're more evident than the differences. In my opinion, I see their growth philosophies in the balance sheets of their respective companies. That's my opinion. What's yours.

The margin improvement is far less when factoring that in... gross shipping cost are increasing as a percent of net sales.

Cover and wait for a better opportunity. You need to wait for a catalyst to go short and that time is not here yet. It might go down but it could also sit here or go up again.

It will be interesting to see if the s&amp;p continues to rise and 'climb the wall of worry'. Sybil thinks that 3-5 weeks more good weeks on the s&amp;p should ring all those doubters out to and make them 'succum' to the bullish side. When the pundits run out of doubters, sybil will be taking them all to the woodshed in the markets... Funny thing iz that, despite the s&amp;p rising and roping in the remaining svckerz sybil sees scamazon going nowhere fast... Theres just too many dogs left to top off with 20-30% gainz for any real money to flow to scamazon.... Bezos best dayz are here, all that iz left for scamazon pusherz iz to sell and move some money into a dog like microsoft, rimm, csco, intc, or yahoo to catch a last wave before the markets collapse entirely.</Msg><Username>sybil_lives</Username><Timestamp>1359951680352</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 23:21:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359953331791-74</Id><Topic><Title>can someone here state an opinion without bashing?

First, forget about the p/e. As you have suspected, the p/e does not matter for non-dividend paying companies' stocks. Compare LNKD's and FB's market capitalization: LNKD: $13 billion. FB: $70 billion. If Facebook is "worth" (in investors' minds) over $70 billion, then Linkedln at $13 billion is too low. I think Linkedln should be "worth" about $15 - 20 billion. It's all about perception of their footprints in our society. FB weakened last Friday after their latest earnings, so both FB and LNKD may meander this week. I think you have a decent chance to see a little pullback of LNKD this week. Again, if you see one, just thank god and get out. You can always reshort if you still want to short after getting out. You don't want to end up like Sybil and techstrategy, holding losing short positions on AMZN for almost a year.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1359953331791</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 23:48:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
