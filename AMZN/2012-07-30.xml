Like good little Pavlovian dogs, we ran back into the markets last week when Mario Draghi rang the stimulus bill – increasing the $60Tn global markets by 5% – that's $3Tn of valuation added in 48 hours on the say-so of a former GS executive that has been put in charge of the European Central bank. What could possibly go wrong with this scenario? If we can't trust the Investment Bankers who are taking over our Government, who can we trust? So we'll assume that everything WILL be fixed this week and that the ECB, Fed, PBOC, BOE, BOJ and all the little Central Banksters will be pumping enough money into the system to justify a $3,000,000,000,000 increase in Global Equity prices – even though that means, at an average p/e of 15, that all this expected stimulus somehow drops an additional $200Bn to the bottom line of Big Business to justify the bump in valuation. How many Dollars, Yen, Euros and Yuan do we have to give to Corporations to turn into $200Bn? Well, if it's AMZN – the answer is $15Tn because it takes $50Bn in sales for AMZN to make $600M so figure 75x in sales to make 1x in earnings. Why use AMZN? Well because AMZN is almost 5% of the Nasdaq and it was their amazing run last week, on what rational people would consider poor earnings, that reversed the downtrend initiates by AAPL's (who are 15% of the Nasdaq) miss. I guess it's obvious why we're short AMZN but let's look at AAPL now, who are quite a bit more efficient at dropping Dollars to the bottom line. Last year, AAPL took in $108Bn and made a profit of $26Bn – now THAT'S a good company! So let's pretend that all companies are as good as AAPL and nowhere near as bad as AMZN at converting sales to profits. Now to get that additional $200Bn in Corporate Profits we only need about $800Bn in stimulus – assuming, of course, that money actually went to people who would spend it and not to Banksters who are still trying to back-fill multi-Trillion Dollar holes in their mark-to-fantasy balance sheets. $800Bn is a doable number so let's pretend it is enough to justify a 5% bump in the market and now we know what we'll be needing this week…</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1343653894000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 09:11:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343654347000-24</Id><Topic><Title>Longer term AMZN is good but</Title><Username>cybercash28</Username><Timestamp>1343592489000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 16:08:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Am I the only dingbat who thinks in 1 year when much more states are going to tax them just like best buy and sears that this pig will fall hard.

These costs are real and will not go away like the argument about capital investments declining after years of heavy investments. So one could argue that the cost to do a dollar of sales has gone up and not down despite getting closer to the customer with the new warehouses. There is also a need to question what all these dollars spent on acquisitions are really providing. Can they be maintenance capex to really keep the business up to date? There is always the excuse about Europe slowing down, but this is just part of doing business, so I really don't understand how Wall Street is not more skeptical about these results which basically show declines in almost every metric.

And lets say they grown their sales from 64B to 72B. Then you thing the stock should go up to $500 for sure, right?? Well, what you would have is Target...presently with $4.40 in earning, paying a respectable dividend with 72B in sales and a market cap of 40M.

Called taking advantage of what's presented to them as the future expectations get built up huge as shown by the market cap/retained earnings ratio. Means at some point AMZN owes alot of earnings to add to the denominator built up by WS pumping. Funny reading about investing in the future when the value already has been built up huge for those expectations. cheers.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1343658668000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:31:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343658892000-48</Id><Topic><Title>Nasdaq 6000 is an idiot boomerbtrying to relive the 90's glory days</Title><Username>philandjoelie</Username><Timestamp>1343651369000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 08:29:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Your in a 20 year secular bear market with a 1975 - type, nyc bond market failure (except this one is nation wide" good post Sybs: amazing thing is how Bernanke money is still being printed and used to create misallocations of captial when it it is urgently needed to be used wisely. interesting times.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1343658892000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:34:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343659181000-49</Id><Title>Going below $100</Title><Msg>Wait and see</Msg><Username>jxkchicago</Username><Timestamp>1343659181000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:39:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343659253000-50</Id><Topic><Title>Going below $100</Title><Username>jxkchicago</Username><Timestamp>1343659181000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:39:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I also believe this will utimately trade below $100.</Msg><Username>incognitusfn2</Username><Timestamp>1343659253000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:40:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343659291000-51</Id><Title>Buy it, ride it to test that 240-247</Title><Msg>area.</Msg><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1343659291000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:41:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343659389000-52</Id><Title>1 hr ago we were at 240.70</Title><Msg>the risk is still upside</Msg><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1343659389000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:43:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343659493000-53</Id><Topic><Title>1 hr ago we were at 240.70</Title><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1343659389000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:43:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that is true, but LT hou have alot of bubble risk in this stock vs almost every other on it's multiple comparisons.

Maybe this run up is a way of getting some of his first large order.Its valuable information,keeps his cash under management potentially and decent commission dollars to boot.</Msg><Username>racecap</Username><Timestamp>1343676804000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 15:33:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343677115000-111</Id><Topic><Title>If AMZn is building warehouses</Title><Username>bradnikto</Username><Timestamp>1343675603000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 15:13:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a very lousy excuse for not delivering profits.

To build a warehouse I think you need 3 items 1) a building, ; 2) inventory and 3) employees. Item 1 is a capital cost, which does not impact earnings. Items 2 and 3 are expenses that do impact current earnings. So, if Amazon has been spending money adding warehouses, why have the 'Inventories' on the Balance sheet dropped from $4,992MM on Dec 31, 2011 to $4,380MM on June 31,2012?

If the USD didn't go up in a big way, Amazon would of reported a losss in Q2.</Msg><Username>davlee1972</Username><Timestamp>1343681936000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 16:58:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343682102000-146</Id><Topic><Title>Does AMZN make 16c or 1c this quarter?</Title><Username>stockpro119</Username><Timestamp>1343430324000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 19:05:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, you cook books the way you can do it......</Msg><Username>optionstrader008</Username><Timestamp>1343682102000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 17:01:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343683701000-147</Id><Topic><Title>One sale from Bezos and all major fund longs begin selling</Title><Username>racecap</Username><Timestamp>1343676804000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 15:33:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bozo is writing so many puts..... why should he sal any share ???

If the economy gets really ugly, CMG will still generate cash (simply slow expansion).

I'm going use 4 blocks of puts, buying at certain levels and get out at others. While leaving the last block in case it craters. Even plan on selling OTM puts (weeklys) on big dips. Long GMCR too. Good luck on Wed. And long MNST because the 'bots still need to work and I see them moving in on that one. - PJ</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1343706310000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 23:45:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
