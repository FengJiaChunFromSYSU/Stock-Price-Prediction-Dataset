So how on earth will the transition from growth to mature market be smooth??? Who will buy more useless goods if the sales tax is in place???

The shadow bankers are just saying in reality that there really is no exit plan, but instead a USTreasury default will happen soon. They always warn in advance of what will come, but they don't want the markets to react until the day comes where the dollar will be virtually worthless. Another signal is the best of shadow bankers Jamie Dimon is in the news lately, so to limit his CEO banking powers is just away for him to exit too. A vote Tue to limit Dimons powers is just propaganda for him to get out before the markets gets crushed. Maybe the smart players and CEO's like Google and AMZN are already insider selling knowing that fiat currency and stocks are for the birds. The clues are right in front of all but the markets ignore it.</Msg><Username>jtilagasca</Username><Timestamp>1368469541623</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:25:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368470308170-22</Id><Title>AMZN IN HURRY TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM RETAIL BIZ...</Title><Msg>Bezos attempting to pull a GOOGLE.

QE does not bring job growth nor reduce unemployment. All it does it juice the stock market make the US government even more fiscally irresponsible by keeping treasury rates at record low. There is no stopping since if they do than it could trigger the big reset and rates will fly higher due to the market "functioning" correctly destroying the ability of the govt to borrow or service debt. If they keep printing, than more and more money will go into pockets of the elites and trickle down it just a pipe dream because the elites know we're at the cross road of a multi decade bull run and economies are actually deleveraging due to lower future growth even with all the CB printing. It is absurd to think that they can remedy the results of several decades of leveraging or the product of the changing demographic and future that call for reduced consumption and production and more evenly spread of wealth across the globe. This time it's different. True. The problems we're facing it's different and money printing is so 20th century.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1368477768074</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:42:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368477865691-46</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon entered digital currency while everyone was sleeping!!</Title><Username>chetak</Username><Timestamp>1368472798604</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 15:19:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your welcome.

It is possible that rates could shoot up, but the FED can still ramp up more QE as emergency. Problem is America is national debt, corporate, and private debt is so big that a spike in rates will instantaneous kill the economy due to the interest payments and the difficult money access. Rate increase will kill the RE prices and made many bag holders out off the current RE investors, yet again. Many will also default on their loans and slip to the underground economy equal less tax revenue. ZIRP has been a dismal failure, in nominal terms as it failed to stimulate anything meaningful other than creating asset bubbles and stagflations. Even with all the Fed POMO buying, treasury yield has gone up in the last few days. Maybe the bond market is sensing that the ez monez will end soon or cannot be ramped up much more and is pricing in risk. Yet another warning sign of a stock market top.

They're not getting blasted because everyone else is doing it (Europe is thinking about it) and the consequences of not doing QE is politically suicidal. It's obvious that the current path is not sustainable but they have no other choice. The kicker will be the perceived risk of default or actual default of debts, that is why car loans, student loans are being written with longer terms and are more back-loaded to keep the debtor paying. This will squeeze more and more money from actually spending/growth so there could be a crash and then great stagnation for equities as everybody is too busy paying debt and high prices which will kill corp earnings. Who will buy the T-bonds/MBS if pomo ends? You're talking about an event where interest rate is so high that govt will probably thinking to default on the debt or seriously cut spendings and that will be the end game of the dollar or growth. Please note, the dollar is still the king of the fiats despite all of its problems and can actually take much more printing than imagined. There's a breaking point of course but IMO we're not there yet.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1368493560939</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 21:06:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368494705079-60</Id><Topic><Title>Well, so much for a housing 'recovery' on low interest rates for 'extended period of time'</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368485707412</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 18:55:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lame duck ob presidency, low approvalrating for congressional hax, geitner - gone, baird - gone, Paulson - history, qe's average 700 bil a pop - spent, and bernanke put jan 1, 2014.
