Maybe this is too optimistic but I feel that NFLX has some bull sentiment and AMZN is gaining bear sentiment, so I am just betting that AMZN will be down more than NFLX.</Msg><Username>kevin.grygiel</Username><Timestamp>1360530440882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 16:07:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360533511219-11</Id><Title>Living Social's smaller competitor Spreebird doing well</Title><Msg>6 ft.
