I may of course be mistaken but amazon seems to be stuck in the 260-270 range for the time being. It is one dangerous stock to bet the 'ranch' on because either long or short you could lose your shirt and more, the house and most of your capital.gains. Avoid.

You would have to assume the slowdown would accelerate, based on what?" Based upon your doubt that it will and the doubt of many.... The most staunch of shorts and the most determined of optionz buying crackheadz have been murdered and capitulated. Sybil strivez and thrivez on being the last short standing in a bubble, and the last long standing in the case of a crash. Sybil cannot predict EXACTLY when these points are hit, and therefore bets responsibly and shoots with a 12 guage shot gun rather than an AR 15 assualt rifle with a laser scope. Judging from the doubt cast in your response to the sybil call and the dramatic drop in optionz open interest, we are close to a decision point... Az alwayz, time will tell.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1369829744013</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 08:15:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369833595513-8</Id><Title>Another day, shorts here . . .</Title><Msg>. . . don't make any money.

Almost 940,000 additional shares are now short, a rise of 15%. Short interest in Amazon still represents a small portion of the float, just 2%, but this is a sharp rise in short interest. Will it continue going forward? That may depend on how you view Amazon. I've been telling investors for some time now that Amazon should be valued on a price to sales basis. This is because Amazon continually tries to increase sales, which has cost them a lot on the bottom line lately. The company has even lost money in some recent quarters, and Amazon usually disappoints when it comes to guidance. The price to sales argument could explain why Amazon is less than $20 from its 52-week daily trading high, despite a stock trading at 200 times this year's expected earnings. Those earnings forecasts continue to be cut, as Amazon invests more in itself. Their recent Prime Instant Video milestone is one example of that. As long as Amazon's revenues continue to grow as a somewhat decent pace, expect short sellers to be few and far between.</Msg><Username>bprasad_y</Username><Timestamp>1369835748850</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:55:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369835848809-12</Id><Title>Looks like crackhead option buyerz cant get enough amzn crack</Title><Msg>Open interest shot back up....
