What would the return look like it INTC raised $50B in 30 year debt at say 5% (it was 4.8% in the last raise and would likely be lower now). If it could buyback at these prices (which it couldn't... you'll see as we do some napkin math), it would reduce the share count by about 50%. The interest cost would be $2.5B a year. Hit to earnings per share would be about 15%, net of tax effect before reducing share count by factor of 2. Thus, levering up (not saying it should go this far, but just for illustration) to a level that is EASILY serviceable for a company with $23B in EBITDA, it could boost EPS by 70%. It's trading at a multiple of less than 9 now with a 4.5% dividend yield. It would be closer to a multiple of 5.3 and a 7.5% dividend yield there.... I'm hoping INTC was buying back lots of shares by selling puts over the past 6 months, particularly the past 3. It would be a very good use of capital. And, then INTC can issue new debt to replace any cash consumed in the transactions... It is a less levered and more conservative approach to accomplish a similar objective to what I described above. Did I mention TI wants out of OMAP because it cannot make money? How many other chip makers will suffer a similar fate. "Startup" Global Foundries is losing money (but has Middle East oil money behind it so maybe it can be a permanent loss leader...). Samsung just passed 20% price increases onto Apple for its processor. Intel is a generation ahead in production and while it is significantly more complicated than just being an area game (wafer size, ramp to production yield, etc), 14 nm feature size will fit 2X number of devices as 20nm which is 2x as 28nm.... It puts INTC in a dominant position. That "margin hit" it got beat up for was actually INTC playing to dominate the future by shuttering old capacity and upgrading to 14nm when no one else can... Be patient and stay with the 2015s.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353048812311</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 01:53:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353049344897-3</Id><Title>227 tomorrow 227 or higher you'll see bounced hard off 200 day moving average</Title><Msg>Amazon is the future, soon even the doubters will be convinced, 275-296 on the way by Jan imho</Msg><Username>dramatic_move_up</Username><Timestamp>1353049344897</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 02:02:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353053306774-4</Id><Title>Taxes on Amazon</Title><Msg>When is Amazon going to begin collecting taxes?

Look for foundries thrust, particularly focused around FPGA and other signal processing chips critical to communications (why I think CSCO will do foundry deal with INTC, especially after Panetta's comments), to gain traction as well. If INTC gets that done, it gets the best of proprietary and foundry model (like dual use in the military back when we made stuff here...). Seriously, INTC chips will have differentiated performance over the next few years, having closed the power gap with 3D architectures. Apple is not going to want to save a few bucks and essentially have the same stuff as everyone else when its App Store and other ecosystem advantages are shrinking. INTC can provide a critical source of continued differentiation and the 14nm capacity timing just "happens" to line up with the end of the Samsung/Apple contract ending....</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353072119162</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 08:21:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353072947463-9</Id><Title>fiscal cliff photo op at 10:15 est</Title><Msg>meeting should be pretty quick, gonna sell some long postions into the hopium. gonna take the proceeds and go shorter once the meeting adjourns and the hopium buzz wears off.</Msg><Username>erbium_doper</Username><Timestamp>1353072947463</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 08:35:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353073931884-10</Id><Topic><Title>Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Techstrategy is having fun...</Title><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1353040513925</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 23:35:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bla bla bla tech....

GDP is only growing because we've run a fiscal deficit of 8-10% of GDP over the past 3 years, while growing NOMINALLY at 2-3%. When the gov't spending ceases to grow proportionately to GDP, GDP will stagnate (or could decline because people underestimate the fiscal multipliers for things like Defense spending where more of the value is internalized within our borders relative to other categories. One can almost think of defense $ as having higher velocity of money for the domestic economy, but that is another discussion). The key is to unlock the capital on non-financial balance sheets, which means to rewrite the tax code to favor investment in productive assets rather than financial ones. It will bolster US competitiveness, increase hiring and do great things for the real economy. It will also seal the fate of the "financialization" period of the US economy. Financial assets will lose value and the financial sector will bear much of the cost. It's the only way to restore long term growth (productivity through investment in productive assets rather than financial/speculative ones). It's coming because it is the only way to unlock the capital in non-financial companies, without which there isn't a solution to the crisis...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353090792289</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 13:33:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353090873537-87</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL in big trouble, SIII is selling for $149 and Iphone 5 not selling like it should Iphone 5 not the cool phone anymore</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1353081784843</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 11:03:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what you think.

I'm naive/altruistic/stupid that way. The real problem is that we've been living on the investment, innovation and productivity of the WWII generation, amplified by the fact that we were the only industrial power left standing post WWII. The reality is that all good strategy is context dependent. Many of the "free market" policies have been an epic disaster for us (allowing currency manipulation, predatory trade/pricing by Chinese SOEs) and have gutted our productive enterprises. The "solar" plays that everyone bashes would be in a dramatically different position if Chinese SOE didn't flood the market with polycrystalline solar capacity to destroy their economics. If you look at the cost per peak watt of solar cells, it has been dropping in a Moore's law way and will eventually cross the critical threshold because ALL fossil/depletion based fuels suffer from declining energy return on energy invested. We just cannot think beyond a few years and everyone is ready to pile on as failure what can and will someday be completely transformation (just as wireless was to wireline... solar is point of use energy generation and will enable progress, especially in less developed countries that will enhance QOL and stability in profound ways). Mostly, the markets are all screwed up. The "momentum trading/investing" has created massive societal misallocation of resources and malinvestment. Consumption DOES NOT CREATE WEALTH. EVER. Yet, it is consumer fad companies that the market has systematically rewarded with uber high multiples and artificially low equity risk premium, while it has systematically penalized real companies engaged in R&amp;D and innovation that DOES create wealth and improve our long term prospects. I've worked with hundreds of nanotech companies that basically were shunned as investments because it was hard and would take a little longer. Real innovation does. #$%$ (societal) wealth destroying consumption plays attract the capital so that WS traders can esentially (mis)appropriate wealth from less sophisticated investors who get caught up in the story and fall prey to cognitive biases and behavorial investing. Candidly, that's why I've gotten active investing and posting real financial and strategic analysis of these scams. I am hoping that over time, in my small little way, I can help break the scams so that capital gets reallocated to productive uses... Gov't can do what it wants. Until the culture in the financial sector changes, we are screwed. Enough for today's soap box...

If you hold from more than a day to 1 year, regular income tax, and reward with lower and lower rates as you hold longer out. Yes, I do believe the focus is way out of whack to where WS is not doing their job for the economy. I think there's nothing wrong with trading but trading outfits should be separated from investment banking and consumer saving instututions. In other words, break up the "too big to fail after 2008. The problem is the US is so out of whack with what is prioritized: Banks with their leveraged trading were a big cause of the 2008 fiasco housing bubble and got bailed out with trilllions by the Fed, and that money has been used to do the same thing withou penalty, jailtime or real change. Thus no loans and no real capital formation . We never cleared the slate and let capitalism work b/c Bernanke defended the way things have been and while doing it, has left the Country with high prices and a leveraged Central Bank balance sheet. We've burnt the wick here at too ends: big bailout by the Fed to the banks while Obama has bailout and spent way beyond our means on the other side: those policies have squeezed the Middle Class and created an even greater bifurcated structure in the USA. We didn't let the destruction phase of Captialism work which includes letting prices fall so people can afford things in everyday life.

People can/do use multiples of sales. But, profits for mature companies tend to correlate well with sales... I haven't seen a principal components analysis or anything that would suggest P/S is the dominant predictor vis a vis earnings, earnings growth, etc... Funny thing about P/S. In relatively high fixed cost industries, gross margins tend to collapse as categories shrink... Sellers move toward marginal cost pricing to cover as much fixed cost as possible and the share war breaks out. Eventually, companies fail and capacity is rationalized. But, not before everyone takes a nice little hit. Certain segments of the semi business (DRAM, Displays) are famous for this. It's also why airlines have more or less failed to earn the cost of capital since deregulation... That dynamic is coming to the retail sector. All the analysts/investors believe that Amazon will be LT winner. They need to do a little more reading on path dependence... And, they need to think a little harder about how relative cost structures will evolve over time in different monetary scenarios, if you will.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353103399953</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 17:03:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353107288569-148</Id><Topic><Title>If AMZN was valued as conservative as AAPL, it would be worth $33 dollars</Title><Username>radiotex501</Username><Timestamp>1353006481262</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 14:08:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At the end of the day, who give a rats #$%$ about sales!
