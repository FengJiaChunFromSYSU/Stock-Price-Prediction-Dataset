IDCC seems like a logical place for Amazon to pick up a nice chunk of the limited 3G, 4G, and LTE patent pool. Interdigital isnt the only company with patents. But they do have a variety patents. Some of the remaining ones might be useful to amazon. IDCC has told the market they are getting ready to sell another batch of non core patents in the near future. Idcc has several notebook manufacturers licensed, and also boasts some M2M patents, and these are the kind of things a company like amazon would probably be interested in. Maybe Amazon is bidding on the next batch and IDCC has told us several groups are interested in major batch 2. And once major batch 2 goes, the company will have jettisoned about 25% of their patents. IDCC has told us during the failed company sale, several companies were interested in groups of patents, but not everything. After batch 2 goes, it more likely a big player might be interested in buying IDCC and the remaining core business. Adding patents would help Amazon protect itself against lawsuits alleging illegal use of technology. Amazon has been involved in five patent-related cases this year, and 20 cases last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Demand for mobile patents has increased, as shown recently by Google’s $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. and its thousands of patents, which closed this year. I bet IDCC would accept $75-$80/share. The company has a huge short interest about 14% of share float and is near to breaking out the 36 resistance level. We could a huge squeeze on Interdigital today or next week, so keep it in your screens !!! The stock could skyrocket !</Msg><Username>patentsaddicted</Username><Timestamp>1347618322402</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 06:25:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347625711837-4</Id><Title>How many knuckleheaded dopes could possibly be left buying these levelz</Title><Msg>After the crashes of 1987, 2000, 2007, and with crash of 2013 just around the corner to deflate a massive 30 year qe bubble?

Benny B basically said there is a liquidity/collateral crisis and if we don't print massively, it will be exposed. Like LTRO, it kicks the can a few months. But, also as Benny B said, it cannot begin to offset the fiscal cliff. In the meanwhile, the consumer will get slammed on food and energy and Amazon's cost structure will increase...

Not a great solution, but I did forget." It's a "good enough" solution for the time being for millions of consumers nevertheless who do not wish to be locked into Apple's closed system. I used to bring along my ipod and use it for some personal things and work related things too to play video from and show photos, you used to be able to run a slideshow onto a large TV monitor with just the most generic of cables that might be on-hand, already so no extra cost or prep or packing. I'd buy numerous third-party peripherals (Belkin and others, microphones, cables, etc.) since Apple was always too "minimalist" to focus on these kinds of things and Apple would constantly include changes in later software updates that would make peripherals once compatible worthless. I started building a library of iTunes movies only to find that Apple would keep cutting off my ability to use these peripherals. At first they'd work, but months later they would not. There's a reason Apple has high margins. They overcharge customers and as described above they're extremely aggressive in trying to bilk customers for not only their main products but also for many overpriced peripherals. "The Apple TV is currently a $99 module that is continuously being (software) upgraded." But why do you think everyone (millions apparently don't) wants to pay an extra toll to Apple? Apple is all about setting up numerous toll gates at each of which they bilk the passive consumer for more and more money. An iPad you buy for $1000 for (hardware plus connection plan) doesn't really cost $1000, it costs $1100 because you can't just use your cable that you already have, you have to go through the Apple toll gate and pay an extra $100 for some extraneous module. "Apple is working on other set top box ideas, but most of the rumors have proven untrue." It will fail. People are on to Apple, now. They don't want to pay Apple for all these extra things like modules. Suckers that do will probably find Apple will render the module un-usable after a couple of years ("we will stop supporting the module with updates starting next month...") so they can bilk customers for another $99. They have already stopped supporting the original iPad, for example. "I got stopped out of my short today" I don't know why you use stops. Techstrategy assured me that this stock is going way, way below $230 in a few months, guaranteed. He says his analysis has never lost and this implies that you should have doubled down at $260 instead.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1347634794001</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 10:59:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347635072924-31</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts here are completely demoralized . . .</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1347545471161</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 10:11:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>don't be so silly.

Why not? You were stupid enough to short Amazon at $230 and to say Google would outperform but was only up 5% year-to-date as of last week. "when something goes wrong the crisis of confidence will be much worse if not irreparable." Or nothing goes that wrong at all and you get to bite the dust twice as badly as you already are. Or something goes wrong but the impact is nothing near as bad as the dismal shorts say it will be just as Google has performed much worse than you predicted. "But, it is also why I have been short mainly consumer/retail stories. The commodity/oil/gas inflation will hit the consumer hard and negate the Fed's money printing." Or the government gets more money by forcing Amazon to collect sales taxes, albeit at the state level and then pays it back out to consumers in the form of stimulus. This is a win for customers, an win for Amazon, a win for the government, a big fat punch in the gut to the shorts. "consumers simply do not calculate the fuel costs of driving to the store." Shorts have said this for years and it has made no difference. Obviously enough consumers do care about spending on fuel these days. But this is also connected to your next point... "Amazon, pays for the "last mile". Gas price increases favor Costco, WalMart and Target which service a broad array of consumer needs." So why is it that with every spike in fuel prices in the past Amazon's business results and share price always far outperformed those retailers and shorts got wiped out?</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1347636017173</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 11:20:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347636237144-39</Id><Topic><Title>PE of 320 rules!!!</Title><Username>bogdanmiltchev</Username><Timestamp>1347631522029</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 10:05:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"More sheep lured into the trap !!!"

Cannot imagine what could possibly go wrong while wages are stagnant and necessities shoot through the roof... It all depends upon one's time horizon. I'm sticking with my long GOOG short AMZN investment. No question in my mind that it will pay off handsomely. Amazon had a tax subsidy in the past that effectively gave it 5-10% towards the incremental transportation cost. It doesn't have that now. And, when fuel prices increase, transportation cost become a larger share of the total, structurally disadvantaging AMZN. All good strategy and all good investing is content dependent.

"Amazon will find itself under assault from Apple, Google..." You have no idea what is going with Google. You never read the reports. Otherwise you'd know how poorly they are doing on the e-commerce front: "According to a report released by Forrester Research in late July, about 30% of shoppers at least started their last online purchase by searching on Amazon, compared with 13% who turned first to Google. Only three years before, just 18% started their searches on Amazon, while nearly 25% used Google first."

Pretty soon, sales prior to tax collection in CA can be compared (ex-kindle/Prime launch) to the results for the rest of Sept. If anything, the rest of Sept should have Benny Boy's QE pump and should help... Yet, I bet (again, ex-Kindle and bundled Prime) sales per day will slow in the latter half of the month. Regardless, I'll be here to test my hypothesis and see if I am right. Looking forward to the Apple iPad announcements. I'll be surprised if Siri isn't running on the new iPads, which will differentiate them from other 7" tablets. A nice $249-$299 entry price and Apple will create pain for AMZN. It will be interesting to see if people are flocking to the Kindle (as pumpers would have you believe) or if they are waiting to see what Apple is going to do. I suspect more are doing the latter right now... There just really isn't a compelling reason to buy a tablet until the playing field is set for this year.

Solve for X... Now for the serious part, congratulations. People like you are why I spent time posting fundamental and strategic analysis despite all the taunting from JA's lime Nemesis and Geeg.
