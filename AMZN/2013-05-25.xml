Weak handed shorts got rattled out a week ago under bone crunching bot squuuuueeeeezez. So sybs stepped over the bodiez of the dead shorts and borrowed some idiot's sharez that recently got covered by some dead short az a last passage. Sybil cleaned the blood and guts of those razor sharp sharez that have killed so many to spit shine and sheathed them away for safe keeping. Sybil will wing them at some poor bag holder like a ninja throwing star and plant them into the head of some poor baggie with a $120 cover and a bruce lee yell "ooooooyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1369494600694</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 11:10:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369495925966-3</Id><Title>Sybil shorts momo pig stox like goog, pcln, azo, and nflx into strength because ......</Title><Msg>Thats when robots like to DUMP (also refered to az 'distribute') them . Sybs iz a true contrarian short trader of the timez. Where sybs shorted aapl at 680 at the top of a HUGE fvken run , you wont see sybs hog pile short aapl without jobz at 385 only to get burnt to a crisp on a bounce. Sybil iz a 'sell the rips and hold divestor for the long term' of pig stox in pig markets. While Sybil haz alwayz been a contrain trader, never one to listen to the noise of jibber jabber, sybs haz not alwayz been a contrain short trader. In fact sybil waz bullish in nov 2008-may 2010 until the s&amp;p hit 1250 and sybs haz gradulually turned more, and more, and ever more bearish until reaching the hieght of bearishness - of grizzly bear proprtionz - az the s&amp;p crossed north of 1600. Now old sybs iz fix'in to compound short gainz into 2015 az the s&amp;p gets fvck in SPANKED to 500 levelz with opportunistic bouncez to cover some and then double them down</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1369495925966</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 11:32:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369497887256-4</Id><Topic><Title>Another optionz expiry friday where optionz buying crackheadz will be murdered by fido bots</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1369394953648</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 07:29:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If it's not going well, step back and stop trading. The more you play it like a casino, i.e. randomly, the more the house wins. You are better off finding some investments you believe in with reasoning and some conviction. 5 minute investing will have you broke in 4 minutes. Sometimes less and sometimes much less is more. We are now in a market where good results are good and bad results are good until the computers or those behind them decide differently. Most sell-offs are being bought so very short term bets are exactly that. Be careful, step away from short term bets.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1369497887256</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 12:04:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369500927961-5</Id><Title>Trying to log on to buy an item isn't worth the effort , AMZN keeps changing my password</Title><Msg>I give up , so I'll buy it at my nearby STORE , Brilliant Bezos</Msg><Username>joe_gbrt</Username><Timestamp>1369500927961</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 12:55:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369519561854-6</Id><Title>Everyone have a good holiday weekend!--even GeeGee, Skiidady &amp; Nasdaq6000</Title><Msg>Back in action again Tuesday.</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1369519561854</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 18:06:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369519699216-7</Id><Topic><Title>Another optionz expiry friday where optionz buying crackheadz will be murdered by fido bots</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1369394953648</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 07:29:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybil, if you are so certain all options strategies lose, why not sell them, both puts and calls?</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1369519699216</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 18:08:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369519848003-8</Id><Topic><Title>Another optionz expiry friday where optionz buying crackheadz will be murdered by fido bots</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1369394953648</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 07:29:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you know why not--there are a few weeks when it is unwise to be short calls and especially puts.
