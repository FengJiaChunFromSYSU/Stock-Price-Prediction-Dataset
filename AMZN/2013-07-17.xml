I agree that AMZN could do what you say but I'm not sure PCLN would diverge from that as Bernanke liquidity/HFT is playing the same game with both. Bernanke's money is building a huge asset bubble in these areas and , ur right, the last move could be epic. Bernanke's made it all a #$%$ shoot with debasing money and AMZN being chased on no earnings is a big symptom of the speculative excess at the moement.

Even with bad news it probably will shake it off. This is not a rational market especially with AMZN. Even if it doesn't make money, it will still be up there as people is buying the growth and the future story. I quit shorting this a month a ago as there are better games out there. I will put no price tag for shorting Amazon. Investors can be incredibly patient especially if there's a greater fool out there. For this to go down, I believe there must be a fundamental shift in thinking among the players that maybe the risk is too great that they will sell to reduce the risk.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1374072188069</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 10:43:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374072447370-34</Id><Title>AMZN is a momentum stock.

It's already a given that earnings will be maybe OK but it doesn't matter. It's obvious that the biggest risk to this stock is the end of QE which I still don't think is in sight. Everyone knows, even the analysts that won't say so, that AMZN's metrics are horrible across the board but how many ETF's is this stock tied to? How many funds? Didn't Bezos work at a hedge fund? Probably knows a lot about setting a stock to move up wouldn't you say? It's the stock of the future, the golden goose that keeps on giving. By the time it turns over and I still believe it will, it could be $100 north of here before it gets cut in half. Not much would surprise me with this stock. Whether I remain in it or not I have to see what happens because it defies logic. If you short have a long time horizon and don't go nuts. If you buy puts, far out ones (Jan 2014) at the $310 level do not have as much premium and the BE price is about $284. I have not look at 2015 puts.
