I'm surprised the folks you front for are still willing to pay for your pumping. It's pretty embarrassing to have the entire board undress you publicly... I think Amazon's target market is spoiled WS Scamalysts who are used to playing with other people's money. The most humorous thing is hearing everyone who appears on CNBC say they buy everything from Amazon (they only drive to the Hamptons). The great power of reflexive/self referential systems.
