Because in every cycle their are shorts like you who say the exact same thing. If as you say most expenses are mostly recurring then as subsequent years go by expense levels should rise or flatten out. So in this first case, would you predict this percentage to rise or fall? Certainly it should not go down by much and certainly not over multiple years. What figure would you expect in Years 3 to 5?

Translation: nanotechU's previous claim was not true. Spending ratios have gone down before and not as many of the recurring expenses recur as often as claimed. "with something that was only 2% of sales" In a word it's all about L-E-V-E-R-A-G-E. Don't you see?. That's the whole beauty of Amazon's business model and management of these cycles. Such a tiny investment generating such huge returns. With only that much of a temporary acceleration of investment ratio. Those investments helped annual sales to triple by Year 5 and produce return in that year alone equal to 13% of those annual sales. Also impressive returns in Years 3 and 4 for that matter and even beyond Year 5. So it isn't simply slowing spending, spending will continue to rise in fact, just not by as much as a % of sales, but the quality of the returns they bring.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1376071561680</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-09 14:06:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376071725418-41</Id><Topic><Title>Question do any of you think that GOOG is going into the DOW 30? and if it does what company will it replace ?</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1376070378139</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-09 13:46:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>anyone?</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1376071725418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-09 14:08:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376072931233-42</Id><Title>SYBIL IS ON THE PCLN BOARD...PUMPING PCLN!!!</Title><Msg>He was posting 100 times a day to short PCLN at $600 a year ago and now that he's been shamed off the AMZN board...he's gone back to the board he was shamed off of a year ago???

You pumpers love the "it's gone up" argument to all of us who correctly have said economic model and the valuation are completely unsustainable. Even though Meredith Whitney was correct about Detroit years ago (when the haircut probably would have been 60% and the city might have recovered), Detroit kicked the can to a 90% loss. Amazon is setting up for a similar move here by becoming massively overleveraged (operationally) into a weakening consumer environment with no discretionary cash buffer.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1376081404421</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-09 16:50:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376081528390-71</Id><Topic><Title>Nemo,face it, you don't even know or understand the simplest of making long term shorts foam at the mouth</Title><Username>skiidady</Username><Timestamp>1376006806255</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 20:06:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"My grade school kids understand more blah, blah..." Well, they've probably had the benefit of being able to read it upside down longer than I have. Especially, the part says "A short from $244 will not get pulverized by the market". (Translation, when turned upside down: He will get very, very pulverized beyond all recognition, even to his own children, by the market).</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1376081528390</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-09 16:52:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376081810210-72</Id><Topic><Title>Nemo,face it, you don't even know or understand the simplest of making long term shorts foam at the mouth</Title><Username>skiidady</Username><Timestamp>1376006806255</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 20:06:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And nanotechU teaches it is OK if your short was from $244 and the stock goes $300 or $400 because you were "right" about FCF, even if you did end up losing your shirt, you were "right!.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1376081810210</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-09 16:56:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376084523021-73</Id><Topic><Title>Nemo,face it, you don't even know or understand the simplest of making long term shorts foam at the mouth</Title><Username>skiidady</Username><Timestamp>1376006806255</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 20:06:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The pumpers are all huff and puff, relying on greater fool theory to find bigger suckers.

Plays around with numbers. Gets schooled by tech and than says look at the stock price, he thinks he is obviously right about the fundamentals. Ultimately he's right about the trading of the stock and where it's been and where it is but please spare us the phony fundamental analysis where we just have to get our eyes out of focus to see the magic of the financials. There is no there there. Bezos has created a giant retailer that makes little to no money and he has the wherewithal to know how to use his market/ hedge fund past and dare i say relationships to know what it takes to manipulate the stock up. He cashed in for a paltry $300M over the last week and without him selling today (I think) walla this stock is up just as many of the pain trade MOMO scam stocks were well defended and mostly up today. Marc Faber is always calling for crashes and one of these times he'll be right.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1376086036315</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-09 18:07:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376089925060-75</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN web site still broken?</Title><Username>ben.franklin36</Username><Timestamp>1375898508848</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 14:01:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Customer service in the united states is only open until 10 pm, after that you get someone in india or some other outsource company.
