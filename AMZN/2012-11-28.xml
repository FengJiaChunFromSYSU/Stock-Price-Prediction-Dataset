I had picked up 40 Jan 24 calls a few weeks ago when it dipped to 23. Was sitting on a 100% return this morning and sold them late morning. I couldn't stomach the thought of having it miss and go to 20 and give it all back. I was so sure they were going to post great numbers but I wasn't going to take that chance. Last I saw it was over 36! great play for all that had the courage to hold. I got a nice gain ( could of been nicer) and now gives me enough capital to get aggressive if AMZN makes a run at 250. I do think it heads lower, tried to get over 245 several times the last few days and couldn't hold. Black Friday over, Cyber Monday over, bond buying over, extremely over bought. Everything point down, short turn anyway. I didn't study economics but I think I know enough to think that AMZN selling a bond isn't good for the bottom line....am I wrong??? Why is this viewed as a good thing?? - PJ</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1354080928728</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 00:35:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354093853611-3</Id><Title>The History lesson I use to remind shorts - Stay the Course!</Title><Msg>In 1998, Ray Dirks, made famous in 1974 for exposing the Equity Funding fraud, wrote a 45 page single spaced report on Conseco in which he offered over 100 detailed reasons Conseco was a $1 stock in a $45 jumpsuit. It seemed rock solid to me. One week after the report, I listened to a CC with perhaps 20 big Wall Street analysts asking questions. The questions were all soft balls. That year, about $200MM just appeared on the balance sheet out of nowhere, and not one person on the CC asked where it came from. Dirks was an Island of One, telling people to run from the stock. 18 months later, Conseco stock was roughly $1.

Yet in today’s fiercely competitive global economy, before a company can produce something to sell, it needs to patent the idea. Otherwise, it’s too easy for competitors to knock off the product and steal market share. In other words, being first to market is no longer enough of a competitive advantage. Companies need to be first to market and have patents protecting their products to ensure sales and profit longevity. Groupon (Nasdaq: GRPN) and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) serve as good examples of this new paradigm at work. As you’re well aware, Groupon invented the daily deals market in 2008. All it took was a novel idea to connect consumers and businesses in a new way – via coupons over email. But guess what? Groupon didn’t have even one patent protecting its novel business model. And within four years, over 300 competitors emerged. Now, Groupon doesn’t stand a chance to keep booking higher profits, let alone survive. Contrast Groupon’s experience with the details behind the meteoric rise of Apple and you’ll definitely get the connection between patent filings and stock price performance. We can all agree that Apple took the world by storm with its iPhone launch in June 2007. Before it sold a single one, though, it secured as many patents as possible. And it continued to do the same thing on every next generation device."

After paying for the HQ real estate purchase, the company should have roughly $1B in working capital. The Moody's analyst did everything but apologize for the Baa1 rating. It's rare to see an investment grade rating based almost entirely on future potential earnings driven by future market share gains and future new product offerings. Moody's would downgrade the bonds "should Debt to EBITDA remain above 3.25x." If you factor in AMZN's operating lease obligations, the leverage is already at 3.2x. (Debt+op lease obligations)/(EBITDA +rent expense) It's amazing to see an investment grade rating on an issuer leveraged over 3x and a rating rationale based on future this and that. Just goes to show you; in the ratings world, you still get what you pay for.

Short-term EPS spread is a measure of not only risk in a stock, but a measure of how well analysts as a whole understand the company through company transparency and the markets they serve. For a company with $110B market cap (22nd largest in the S&amp;P500) and more than $60B in revenue, this company and its markets should be well understood. The reason for the large spread is that AMZN tells investors nothing and analysts are left to speculate. This has been a successful strategy for AMZN as the analysts are so blinded by the brilliance of Bezos that they imagine a better future than any pumping the company could do on its own. So AMZN continues to be vague and not answer q’s and they continue to get rewarded. Compare the spread of AMZN 2013 EPS vs the competition below. Their EPS spread is 4 to 9 times higher than their comp. Their EPS range for next year delivers a P/E range of 65 to 542 (even with the most optimistic assessment the FWD P/E is still 65). Because analysts cannot justify the P/E for next year, they go out to 2017 to look at EPS of $11 and state that the P/E is only 22 on those earnings. And they have a job? They are asking to me to base a stock price on 2017 EPS when the variance for 2013 is 186%? Even if they are right on 2017, do they expect me to pay 2012 dollars for a 2017 P/E? With a 2017 P/E of 22, a 2012 dollar is only worth $0.29. That means AMZN should be valued at $244*29% = $71 in 2012 $.

I am a #$%$ trader, but I am usually right on the strategic position and evolution of cost structures. With respect to your earlier question, the bond offering itself is a sham. It's just another example of how/why our capital markets are damaging our country. With less than that amount of capital, GRPN could execute the transaction I alluded to last night and create enormous shareholder value that actually does create value through enhanced utilization of existing infrastructure/assets/capabilities/people. With Amazon, it will instead be used to build more (redundant in the macro sense) distribution facilities and fund share buybacks when the stock is trading at a 1% true FCF yield (even real EBITDA yield rather than "adjusted" is less than 3%)... Amazon is uniquely vulnerable to event risk, but it is more likely to suffer from a series of changes in the competitive landscape and gradual erosion of the economics. People (investors) rarely synthesize the collective effects of the micro changes. The emergent behavior of systems is often quite different than we expect. That's where I focus my investment thinking because algorithms cannot do it and very few investors do it... We'll see. Just stay LT and patient. Amazon is not going to grow into its valuation. It will get pressure from all sides (Google with shopping listings to aid traditional bricks and mortar, FB with direct to consumer from manufacturer, macro drivers that will alter the components of the TCO, etc)...

Please Amazon, make another stupid move that would simply require Apple to hit back hard in the interest of shareholder value...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354111604860</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 09:06:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354111613548-58</Id><Title>paging gee-gee: let us know on the next call buying timing/opp</Title><Msg>thank you!</Msg><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1354111613548</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 09:06:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354111651752-59</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN finally turned yesterday</Title><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1354111167952</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 08:59:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Once on, i am woried because there was 6 days up with every day almost 2% and yesterday it went just 16 cents???

Short-term EPS spread is a measure of not only risk in a stock, but a measure of how well analysts as a whole understand the company through company transparency and the markets they serve. For a company with $110B market cap (22nd largest in the S&amp;P500) and more than $60B in revenue, this company and its markets should be well understood. The reason for the large spread is that AMZN tells investors nothing and analysts are left to speculate. This has been a successful strategy for AMZN as the analysts are so blinded by the brilliance of Bezos that they imagine a better future than any pumping the company could do on its own. So AMZN continues to be vague and not answer q’s and they continue to get rewarded. Compare the spread of AMZN 2013 EPS vs the competition below. Their EPS spread is 4 to 9 times higher than their comp. Their EPS range for next year delivers a P/E range of 65 to 542 (even with the most optimistic assessment the FWD P/E is still 65).

They need capital when things are going "well". Wait until consumers stop paying any of their "debts" because they've been conditioned that there is no need to pay student loans, car loans or home loans. The housing price lift will end soon enough (especially if deductions are capped). Then, the HELOC growth ends and the consumer lift ends. This doesn't end well for Amazon. Matter of time. But, next time NO ONE but the Fed will buy the bonds and equity holders will have already run for the exits.

Nothing changed there from 2008. Nothing b/c you bought the easy money policies back into the fray. but the cost is time when the Fed Reserve balance sheet possibly blows up as they add to their balances of buying paper at stupid prices. The % of ownship of that paper on tiheir ballance sheet is now back toward $3 trillion, a huge % of the US GDP. And to add to that risk, they have used this paper expasion to send stocks like AMZN 240/shr with no earnings. So you have a $3 trillion Fed balance sheet where any adverse interest rates reaction causes huge loses after they have becom "the market" to hold stocks like AMZN at infinity. That's over the top gambling by a Central Bank. that's why you start to see stocks puke if interest rates back up enough b/c rates blow up the whole thing at lower and lower spiking levels.

Kroger is notably the largest grocery store chain in the country. This chain was recently named the 36th most reputable company in the country by Forbes Magazine. Kroger not only operates the stores carrying their name, but also is proud of the "nearly two dozen banners" representing the 'family of stores' that operate within the Kroger system, nationwide. Phase III(R) will be available in select grocery stores through Kroger in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina and Kentucky. Specifically, these Kroger stores within the above mentioned states are located in the greater Huntsville area in northern Alabama, statewide within Georgia and Tennessee, as well as Columbia and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Phase III(R) will be available in the sports nutrition sections of the chain in these locations. Jack Shea, EVP of Sales for Attitude Drinks, commented, "The placement of Phase III(R) Recovery in the Sports Nutrition sections of Kroger supermarkets provides recognition of the brand's growing popularity." Additionally, Robert "Bob" A. Hearn Jr. recently joined Attitude as a Regional Sales Manager to represent Attitude Drinks throughout the southeast section of the country. The states included within his territory are Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina to date. A graduate of the University of Georgia, Bob was a developer of the Q Water brand and most recently, launched White Quartz Distribution, offering an innovative approach to combination pallet distribution as relates to freight with new beverages. "Recovery drinks are one of the beverage industry's hottest categories. Phase III(R) is a great product and I am very excited to be associated with the Attitude organization. My goal is to make real milk recovery readily available to consumers throughout the southeast," commented Bob Hearn, Regional Sales Manager at Attitude Drinks, Inc.</Msg><Username>pennysbull</Username><Timestamp>1354136524016</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 16:02:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354136575761-264</Id><Topic><Title>SELLLLLLLLLL</Title><Username>causinginflation</Username><Timestamp>1354136383955</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 15:59:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>unbelievable! lol!</Msg><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1354136575761</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 16:02:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354137085367-265</Id><Title>I sel on amazon and think that they are a bunch of smart crooks!!! their stock will sink!</Title><Msg>The are essentially a retail cpompany.

Well said. Because as an investment for a long only fund manager, it sucks. Massively asymmetric risk/return. Today's price cuts on AWS simply show that Amazon will be unable to extract the economic rents that have been assumed. Price competition in the core from (e.g. GOOG) folks who generate massive cash elsewhere. I am honestly a little surprised that the long only funds have let the games go to this extreme (thus more record outflows...). It really does undermine investor faith in the market.

In 2013, Amazon will face a massive brand hit as the public better understands the wealth transfer via tax evasion...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354155761837</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 21:22:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354158339870-313</Id><Topic><Title>jeff the bozo...doesn't pay the small little guy</Title><Username>friulliguy</Username><Timestamp>1354155223375</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 21:13:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buying and investing locally is a critical part of the solution to our problems. When you do so, the money gets recirculated in the local economy -- and increases the velocity of money because most locals in most economies have a higher marginal propensity to consume than Jeff Bezos and those that own Scamazon...That in turn leads to a real multiplier rather than a leakage to the system. Once state pension funds like Calpers truly understand that Amazon's "fulfilled by Amazon" model is really hurting them first and foremost -- not just via the direct effect of lost taxes, but the indirect effect via the multiplier effect of lower local monetary velocity -- Amazon will have one helluva shareholder and branding issue...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354158339870</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 22:05:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354159738249-314</Id><Topic><Title>Here's why you dont hear emphasis on the producer:</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1354155482175</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 21:18:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The sad part is bad accounting led companies to outsource a lot of the most financially attractive items to produce -- the cash cows. Back in the day of standard cost accounting, we allocated cost by labor hours, even when the real cost drivers were CapEx etc. That led assigning higher production cost on high volume items than was the case in reality. We outsourced "simple" / high volume items because emerging markets could do it more "cheaply", but the CapEx related costs didn't do away, making us "less competitive" on the remaining product lines, in turn leading to more outsourcing... We became producers of the low volume, high mix intensive product portfolio. We screwed ourselves trying to save the last dime and instead undermined our own cost competitiveness in many areas by taking on the higher relative overhead product portfolios... Having said that, we absolutely can compete, despite the incessant brainwashing to the contrary by WS (most of whom have never been in a plant that manufactures anything). Domestic chemicals manufacturers will be well positioned because of low natural gas prices. Intel still does kick everyone's butt (and will do so even more in the future as flows come into balance)... Shipping cost is going to continue growing as a share of the TCO (a significant reason I am short AMZN) of products and as it does, the balance will shift toward domestic production again... I really wish institutional longs would do the right thing and just sell through this... It only undermines trust in the market when they let predatory stop hunting algo funds squeeze shorts or put buyers, just like the long side. Stocks being valued on how they trade (function of float manipulation) rather than the value the companies create and capture (fundamentals) is what is ultimately chasing retail investors from the market... Benny B isn't the cause. The same short term mindset on WS that undermined our manufacturing base is... Having said that, I have complete conviction that Amazon will see 125 within a year and am prepared to ride through whatever comes my way between now and then... Now back to your regularly scheduled pumper taunting...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354159738249</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 22:28:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
