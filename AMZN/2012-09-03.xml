In other words, AMZN has $5B in cash only because, at 6/30/12, it owed vendors and employees $11B. 2.) the CAPEX is way UNDERSTATED because the company has been using operating leases to fund fixed asset investment. I believe at June 30, 2012, AMZN has some $4B in operating lease obligations. I'm not saying the company is broke but the stock price is definitely way ahead of its underlying value and is facing headwinds: A) Working Capital issues can be solved with 1) free net cash flow which is good for the stock 2) or the issuance of debt or equity which is not good for the stock. B.) Operating Leases: I'm sure the AMZN treasury dept. is receiving ridiculously favorable lease terms from the knuckle heads in the bank leasing groups - so it probably makes sense for AMZN to lease finance fixed assets; however, don't underestimate how this manipulates the accounting and financial metrics. The $4B operating lease obligation is not on the balance sheet nor are the fixed assets. These additions to service centers, warehouse &amp; distribution centers, servers, etc... do not run through CAPEX in the statement of cash flows. The operating leases are fully spelled-out in the 10Q notes along with the other $2B in debt obligations. So, arguably at 6/30/12, the company has $0 cash and $4B of off balance sheet fixed assets and liabilities.</Msg><Username>darv49</Username><Timestamp>1346677735356</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 09:08:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346680587149-5</Id><Topic><Title>CapEx revenue leverage...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1346451972981</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 18:26:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Could be summed up in 3 concise words: It's a pig....</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1346680587149</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 09:56:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346680733911-6</Id><Title>Geegee is spanking his monkey wondering why this pig is flat today</Title><Msg>Idiot....</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1346680733911</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 09:58:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346681105769-7</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts, AMZN is heading towards 280.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1346677681078</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 09:08:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dont follow geegee the pumptard, take a little short and thank sybil several months down the road....</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1346681105769</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 10:05:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346681857241-8</Id><Title>Pay Attention</Title><Msg>to insiders who have been selling at a fast pace.
