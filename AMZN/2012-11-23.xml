You short a stock out of favor. Right now Amazon was always already in favor but todays news and the weekends and Monday will be how this was the best sales season in a long time and the best for online sellers and a record breaker by far as it relates to Amazon. Close your entire position of puts, then buy the Jan 310 calls, grab 100 or 1000, whatever you can afford, the mm has not raised them in 5 days, he is sleeping! Protests for Wal Mart leads to smart people saying Wal Mart has ruined many parts of the country with their Chinese junk, this will cause them to just stay home and avoid the hassle of protesters yelling in Wal Mart and the extra traffic. The reason I am telling you to grab the Jan 310's is because until Jan 19th 2013 you have all those shares locked up for you. MOMO traders will come in as Amzn slices right through 264 like butter steamrolling shorts to 290-295....not to mention sales #'s released after Christmas by Amazon as well as a chitload of Kindle Fires sold.... All will be records and silence all the skeptics.... Then after that I am grabbing 20,000 dollars in calls for Amazons next earnings report. Hope this helps you. Like I said, I short often, looking for 70-75 for Bidu in next 30 days but I will cover if Bidu crosses 100... that said I would never ever short AMZN when it is manipulation free between black friday and christmas unless it was play money, but not even then in that time period.</Msg><Username>classactionlawsuitsonnakedshrts</Username><Timestamp>1353668628956</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 06:03:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353669115315-11</Id><Title>600 Billions Black Friday Sales this year.

If a stock of a company keeps going up when it makes no money in anicpation of making some ahead that they have no clue to what it will be: then who knows what will bring change? They are now supporting this stock at almost it's highest share price ever and it's never been held to making money as a pressure less. That's AMZN stands today. I think alot thought that sales taxes or an earnings decline would affect the love for the shares but not only hasn't it: the stock continues to rally ahead of others. The ultimate head scatcher: scam or not.</Msg><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1353697519337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 14:05:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353697680504-115</Id><Topic><Title>What was the close?</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353693765201</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:02:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the AMZN business model has been flawed forever yet it hasn't mattered: the retained earnings/ AMZN market cap tell you that: it's about a low as I've ever seen one for a compnay trading 17 years public.</Msg><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1353697680504</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 14:08:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353700151399-116</Id><Topic><Title>What was the close?</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353693765201</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:02:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tech, Did you ever get those report I sent you?

It has broken previous 26th Oct high of 238.34, which is Ugly. While it seems to me that AMZN might touch 247 next week and S&amp;P 1433 if the market continues to roar. However usually market takes a break for 1 or and so might AMZN which may touch 235-236. Next week is very crucial as if market trade sideways as well as AMZN trade sideways, from first week of Dec things might again take a hit and S&amp;P may touch in 1365-1380 range by mid dec.Market rallied 66 points in 5 trading days which is almost 5 % (from 1343-1409) Long or Shorts i would like to listen view point , i am stuck in my short position, but i am not bullish at all now at this stage, though i beleive the correction may not be big. I am looking at 230 where my loss would be 10-15% it if toches by mid dec. Because monday greece might get next tranche of money. But global markets have rallied very strong this week and it needs breather, but during this period market. I really hope that we get 3-4% correction on 10% gain of AMZN in 5 days. I am convinced that 232 will be printed by 3rd week of Dec but this roaring market today has made me think little cautious. Why was market so strong?? One good thing is there was low volume. I am sure AMZN will 100% see below 200 next year, but since i have put options which expires in Jan, i am much concerned. Sales Tax will be a big dampener and other factor is that all Retailers have good Online prence and every retalier has started free shippping or pick up at store. Capital Gain tax will be increased , ther is no option Instead of bashing either shorts and longs share your thoughts. I know for AMZN fundamentals doesn't matte much, but it will matter eventually . Remember this stock has gone from $37 in 2008 to $264 in 2012, every year new highs. i think this 4 year cycle will end next year with no new highs and AMZN between $150-$200 next year most of the time.

Last quarter results were not that great, Fisacl cliff wil make markets more volatile in Dec. Further AMZN has been continously rising 5 days in a row with 10% gain along with S&amp;P gains of 5% in a row. S&amp;P and Amazon both are very strong resistence level of $247 for amazon and S&amp;P at 1433. I don't say on monday there isn't a possibility of upside, i don't have the money but any upside on monday in AMZN would be a perfect short opportunity even for a short term perspective.
