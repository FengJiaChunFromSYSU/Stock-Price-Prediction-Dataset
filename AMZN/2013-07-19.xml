But, when the economy heads south, people tend to look to use "found money" like gift cards before spending new money. So, if and when the psychology of the real state of the economy changes, redemptions will begin to exceed new purchases of gift cards. That's up to a $5.4B draw on cash (more likely to be about half of that...). Then, there is the issue of greater inventory obsolescence because of more redundant inventory in the many new fulfillment centers... All of these issue compound as locations expand, demand drops and utilization goes down (many operating cost do not scale down linearly with GMV...). I'll be waiting patiently. New revenue recognition plus 3P/FBA rate hikes will help this quarter. But, Amazon is already pushing the limits on days payable (as soon as a few vendors go out of business from its abuse of working capital terms, it will have an epic PR nightmare on its hands...). Not much more cash to squeeze there....

This stock is much more insanely valued than GMCR was ~$110 when I posted my short thesis there (before Einhorn released his), after which GMCR fell to $17. What would Amazon's cash position be if it didn't increase days payable by 10% (62 to 69) over the past 12 months, if it didn't increase pre-paid/gifts cards by what $1.8B and if it didn't raise $3B in LT debt?

Shorting TSLA is stupid. PCLN, CMG etc. have earnings, unlike Amazon. I think Amazon is the best stock to short right now, although you are right, it does seem to be "held up" by some powers that be. Lets see what happens after earnings.</Msg><Username>bob.bull99</Username><Timestamp>1374268145925</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 17:09:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374268270832-76</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN is the bubble of this bubble market</Title><Username>emanuel_dabah</Username><Timestamp>1374264895549</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 16:14:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and when I say "earnings" I'm using the term loosely.

If you recall the markets original intention was to efficeintly raise and provide a source of capital for good business and allow investorz of those businessez equity ownership in the success of the businessez in which they invested. Now the capital goez to overpaid equity stripping ceo'z and execs that pay themselvez with free stoks, 'fat cat' banker underwriterz and pumperz, politicianz through donationz and pacs, robot runnerz that fvck retailerz witg panic buy and panick sell schemez., and individualz connecyed to wall street that 'bring stox public' while cashing in their 100's of thousandz of intial private equity investment for BILLIONZ of public dollarz in legalized pump n dumps.

Terrible fundamentals but the brand is the valuation, must be. Still wanting to get puts but I agree witht he above poster, much better shorts unfortunately, the premium to get something even after a 300% drop on this with any time value is as crazy as the stocks PE. Call it right and time it nicely and you still only looking at a ten bagger versus puts that would give you 100 fold plus on the same kind of market wide crash. Record highs for the market and nothing changed in so long makes me think its about due. Eventually the market will stop being all about bernanke and all about fundamentals again. However I believe a sold "pricing" of the fed being impotent before things go back to being a market is required. I'm curious if GS is selling and building a net short of the whole shoot and match after their 1750 S&amp;P call for year end. Just saying October may get real interesting if not sooner imo.

The bots trade mechanics, then will hold it up to exit slowly feeding out shares if allowed, BUT, those bots make up most of the trade many days, but when volume kicks in they can't manipulate. The hedges trade back and forth until a real seller gets between them, they are not going to buy outside shares in blocks at these levels. They'll take a few thousand to play the game but not serious selling. There are massive positions in funds to unwind and it will happen, this is a $35 stock then, but your point that the market can play longer than the average person can hold is valid. It will be like AAPL when it's apparent the model going forward is flawed, like CMG will be, like NFLX. No one actually thinks they're worth half the price, it's a game to toll in more than sell and most of the action and bids are fake or tiny.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1374275230331</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:07:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374275550049-86</Id><Topic><Title>What is actual P/E of this pie in the sky garbage?</Title><Username>rockymtn50</Username><Timestamp>1374269027198</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 17:23:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PE 236 iz a mark to make believe pe of furture earningz which will never materialize.

I few billion over the lifetime of Scamazon? I think Jeff Bezos knows well how to play the scam momentum game of the WS casino. Much of what he has done is value destroying (maybe now that Detroit has gone bankrupt now maybe the Muni and State pension funds can/will pull all direct and indirect investment in Amazon since it has been destroying the local economies and velocity of money through its avoidance of state sales taxes. N.B. for the for my conservative colleagues, Laffeur himself said an online tax would grow GDP). The backlash that will eventually come will be epic. Pensioners will realize that Amazon has effectively been stealing from them for years and using it to engage in predatory behavior to knock competitors out of business in the hopes of eventually raising prices as a monopoly (yet the DOJ pathetically backed the ebooks monopoly against the agency business model...). Amazon will be facing anti-trust scrutiny, pensioner anger and vendor backlash (the extension of days payable is hitting the point of lunacy...). Jeff is a great salesman, but he knows the underlying economic tradeoff embedded in the business model has moved against Amazon in both profound and permanent ways.
