There's not enough people to process all the tasks required to bring the product into distribution. Very low morale and very highly stressed environment. I know friends who worked in such an environment (the now defunct CNXT). Engineers, unlike warehouse workers, do not put out a quality product when subjected to a meat grinder environment. This is why GOOG allows Asus to do most of the build on the Nexus 7. Scamazon doesn't have the deep pocket to go this route. And soon, both will have to deal with the Microsoft surface tablet, with seamless integration between desktop, notebook, and tablet. Windows 8 can also handle existing applications written for older versions of Windows. No more fuss about Android and the threat of an Apple lawsuit. MSFT can afford to take a loss to get the Surface tablet off the ground.

However, since yesterday's launch event it has emerged that all three models of Kindle Fire (the Kindle Fire, and both sizes of Kindle Fire HD) will be ad-supported. This means you'll see special offers or deals as a screensaver on your device. The descriptions of the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD both include the following: "Includes special offers and sponsored screensavers." When you click 'Learn More,' Amazon explains that these offers will appear on the lock screen and lower left hand corner of the home screen but won't interrupt use of the device. A note at the end of this pop-up reveals that only U.S. customers will be subjected to ad-supported Kindle Fires. "Kindle with Special Offers &amp; Sponsored Screensavers is only available in the U.S.," it reads. So, when the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD launch in Europe on October 25, users won't have to put up with sponsored screensavers. Unfortunately, it looks like U.S. customers may have to buy their Kindle Fires overseas if they want to avoid sponsored screensavers.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347110871772</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 09:27:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347111606949-19</Id><Topic><Title>All of Amazon's Kindle Fire Tablets Are Ad-supported</Title><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347110871772</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 09:27:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's unknown is how much background bandwidth these ads will be competing with your browser.

The advantages to Amazon are obvious: Special Offers let the company introduce devices at lower price points than they would have been otherwise, and the ads drive more revenue to sales of other products on its website, since it's still first and foremost an online retailer. The advantages to consumers, however, are much less certain. I don't want mandatory ads on a device I own. It's different on the Web; if you don't like the way a site shows ads, you can visit another site. It's different on TV; you can change the channel, or you can watch public television, or not watch broadcast TV and instead view DVDs. Instead, imagine your PC or Mac had ads built into the desktop and the screensavers, and that you couldn't remove them. A few low-tier PC manufacturers even tried this many years ago, in an effort to bring down the base price of the PC. They were quickly buried and forgotten.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347112794071</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 09:59:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347112869081-21</Id><Topic><Title>All of Amazon's Kindle Fire Tablets Are Ad-supported</Title><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347110871772</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 09:27:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More info at pcmag...

That effectively made my $79 Kindle a $109 Kindle, or $10 more than the ad-free Barnes &amp; Noble Nook Simple Touch, which has a touch screen—my Kindle didn't. If I had bought the $99 Kindle Touch, and then wanted to disable ads, it would have been $40, not $30, raising the price to $139. Last year, when I first reviewed the 4th generation Kindle and Kindle Touch for PCMag, I dinged them pretty hard for Special Offers, although we still awarded the lower-priced device Editors' Choice. In a subsequent email to me, an Amazon spokesperson defended the ads, saying they were "really so unobtrusive" and that they're "never in your reading experience."</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347113135137</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 10:05:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347113539955-23</Id><Topic><Title>All of Amazon's Kindle Fire Tablets Are Ad-supported</Title><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347110871772</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 09:27:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The thing is, part of the reading experience is picking up the book. Each time you pick up the Kindle to start reading, you'll have to click through an ad. Go get a cup of coffee, come back to the book, and you'll see another one. When your child picks up the ebook reader, that's the first thing she sees. How is that not part of the reading experience? Another one of Amazon's defenses is that Special Offers are really just that—they're not straight ads, but offers that let you save money on products that you normally wouldn't have access to otherwise. That's great; if I want them, let me sign up for them. Don't force them on me, and then charge me $30 or $40 to disable them. It's as if we're all letting Amazon get away with something. By not making a bigger deal about it, it's a tacit acknowledgement that Amazon's business practices are just fine, even though it gives the company an easy and unfair way to undercut its competitors at our expense. Barnes &amp; Noble doesn't do this with any of the Nooks. Sony doesn't do this with any of its Readers. If Apple suddenly said its new iPad included Special Offers, people would go ballistic. Google's Nexus 7 doesn't contain ads. What if those vendors started doing it too, in order to even the playing field? What's bothering me most as a tech journalist is that when you compare tablets or ebook readers across the board, people are going to see that the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD and the Google Nexus 7 both cost $199. Or that the Kindle Paperwhite costs $119, or $20 less than the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook Simple Touch With GlowLight. But the Amazon product is the only one forcing ads on you; none of the competing vendors resort to such deceptive tactics. (If you want the Paperwhite model without ads, it's $20 more, of course.) The fact that the Kindle Fire HD will also have Special Offers built in is the ultimate disgrace. Imagine spending $500 for a brand new tablet computer, one that rivals the Apple iPad with Retina display, and being forced to endure ads while using it the entire time. As far as I can see, Amazon isn't offering any way to disable the ads on the Kindle Fire HD even by paying more. You can bet someone's going to figure out how to root this thing and disable the ads almost immediately. In modern society, advertising is an unfortunate fact of life. But we still have ultimate control over how much we're exposed to them. When it gets to the point that I'm forced to see ads just by using a gadget—for any task, at any time, no matter what—that's where I draw the line. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go get more coffee from a machine that won't show me any advertising—at any point during the process.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347113539955</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 10:12:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347114324148-24</Id><Topic><Title>All of Amazon's Kindle Fire Tablets Are Ad-supported</Title><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347110871772</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 09:27:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To date, Scamazon is the only company offering ads supported tablet!

Shorts need to use their brains for once and figure that in the last iteration Amazon offered both with and without ads and probably what happened is that overwhelmingly most users chose with ads to get the cheaper price so they simply dispensed with giving the few who are allergic to screen saver ads a choice. If that minority really wants one with no ads so badly they can simply order one of the older models which is still being sold and at a lower price now.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1347116069885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 10:54:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347116437954-26</Id><Topic><Title>Kindle Fire HD Wireless is not FCC approve yet !</Title><Username>me_novice</Username><Timestamp>1347071828727</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 22:37:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Classic example of a poster that does not have a deep pool of brain power to understand that Amazon is leading tech company.

Try again..... You are theone chasing sybil around with your 'crackers', but what is funny is that your mouth is stuffed with pcln crow, you douchbag.... Sybs made a fortune from pcln, and will soon be re-entering that stinky play with fresh new shorts....Hopefully amzn will crash so sybil can parlay some short coin right back into pcln.... Sybs iz going to hold scamazon short for a good long time though.... Too funny....

Stupid stok kids.... All stox are stupid, but this one in particular is really stupid.... Infact, sybil would presume it to be robostupid as the institutional fidelity, trow, et al bots run it up stupidly and dump it into the baggie "2030" 401k mutual fund.... Too funny the sec still lets this sheit go on.... Maybe there will be some "change" after the next crash... Yes - about 25 cents of "change" on every dollar 'Invested'. Follow the fidelity green line boyz and girls... Get your margin and your optionz pump on for 'em.... This is the last bubble to slaughter that we'll see in a while... Sybil thinks 30 years or so.... Remember - it took from 1932 to 1954 plus being 'the last man standing' in WW II to break even with your 1929 'investments' (assuming that your stok was still alive after the 90% drop in the fraud mkts)... Sybs figures that it will be 2035 before stox rise to these levelz again....

What it left out is that those megabytes aren’t likely to go very far. Watching a single two-hour HD movie would use up 614 megabytes, according to AT&amp;T’s data calculator. A 1.5 hour HD movie would use up 461 megabytes. What happens if you go over? AT&amp;T turns off the service until the next month – which means a long intermission. Kindle users who know they’ll want more data will have to pay a lot more than $50 a year: $30 a month for 3 gigabytes or $50 for 5 gigabytes – plus a $36 activation fee (which isn’t charged with the Amazon promotional plan, but will apply to any upgrades)." So it is not going to save you $410 comparing to iPad !! Not truth... Also the Kindle tablet are AD supported ! The screen saver shows ad continuously and it is using a lot of data bandwidth too ! The 250Megabyte per month may be just enough to display the Amazon Ad !! Why would I spend $50/year to display their ad ? They should tell us the truth...</Msg><Username>me_novice</Username><Timestamp>1347154665826</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 21:37:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347157926050-41</Id><Title>Sweet koolaid attracts lots of fruit flies</Title><Msg>They multiply az the koolaid flows....

Keep giving me really cheap puts, ignore the valuation downgrades, lack of earnings, 315 pe and how much money they burn if they can't sell these like they thought. ALSO FCC has not approved these so even longer to wait possibly. THIS WILL HAVE A NFLX GMCR type 80 points in 2 or 3 days drop, maybe more. You were warned, research and think for yourself.
