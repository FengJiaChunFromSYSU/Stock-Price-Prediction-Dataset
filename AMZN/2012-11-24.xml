In a shift, more people now start product searches on Amazon instead of Google, according to Forrester data. That is a problem for Google for a few reasons, the biggest of which is that retail searches and search ads are among its biggest businesses. Their strongest play is clearly to customize android and put out a full color tablet that more directly competes with ipad. If they're smart, they'll do what no one else has done: create an android games division optimized and branded for their own hardware. They can start with the casual stuff and move on from there. Then, a well-done wifi-based music player, the most glaring hole in the android line-up. And then, finally, a smartphone.</Msg><Username>twizzquake</Username><Timestamp>1353806011259</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 20:13:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353809505984-15</Id><Title>AMZN price makes no sense</Title><Msg>It is trading on emotion, not concrete numbers.
