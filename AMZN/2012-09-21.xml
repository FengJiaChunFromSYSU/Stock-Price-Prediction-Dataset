Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

Again sybs figures the majority actually didnt have a position, they simply were there to bash the oposition of over done momo to the downside. Very few recognize what sybil knows to be true - parabolic peaks and valleys represent little more than a setup for wealth to be transfered from the many to the few. The few use stox as a ligitimized mechanism for their robotic tools to transfer the wealth. stok credits are manipulated to favor of the few, and then reconstituted to bernanke bux as quickly and effeciently as possible.... You just have to think like a robot, not try to trade like one.... If you try to trade like a robot then you will lose everytime....

That's why it held up on yesterday's quick sell. Any move will be controlled. Much as every CNBC pundit would like everyoneto believe the market is strong, it is outrageously vulnerable. Privately, people now reallize that the equity redemptions are structural, that the boomers are not day traders and will continue pulling funds until it corrects and becomes investable again. But, they need to manage the S&amp;P drop else it could get ugly (and I'm not talking about the Presidential race). Reality is that cash and ST bonds are the best place to put money right now. All the talking heads say bonds are expensive (but it is a stupid and completely false claims since no one but the Fed is buying 30YR except for MBS and that will prove to be stupid in time), but if yields/inflation go up, ST bonds will still only lose a little.

Longs have to buy and sell to make money. Shorts have to buy and sell to make money. But why the invective when someone else does something different.? In fact you wouldn't have a market if everyone thought the same. It's different judgements and calculations of value that produce the market. So you should welcome someone who has a different view.

Why not? It was good news 15 years ago when Walmart could do nothing to blunt Amazon huge success when it was a company of a fraction of the size it is today so 15 years later it should be 15 times as much the good news it was back then. Walmart will not be able to stop Amazon shorts from being steamrolled over and over. "Folks want to touch this thing and without Walmart and Target putting on their floors."

I don't see how this could be possible. If shorts are correct then nobody buys Kindle products because iPads have received such glowing reviews. How can Amazon then destroy Apple's profits if their own Kindle product sells in no significant numbers? Oh, unless shorts are wrong, of course, about the success level of Kindle. Anger? We saw their anger already. They got emotional and broke the law (collusion). I think they learned their lesson. They are helpless to do anything (legally) to prevent Amazon from doing anything they want. All Apple can do now is sit back and suck it up. "We've already seen that it is matching prices on eBooks (at least for some publishers and I expect all publishers eventually)." Really? When was the last time you bought an Apple eBook? People want to read their e-books across every platform they own, not just on one device which is the way many Apple e-products work. Besides, if Apple is so "angry" and has so much cash, then how come they don't just undercut Amazon's pricing? "There will absolutely be a price sensitive segment consumers who choose to purchase the Kindle. It expect it to sell north of 10MM tablets a year. But, it still won't generate any meaningful cash flow... " Huh? You just said Apple wants to cut off Amazon's cashflow. Now you're saying it is not meaningful?

Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America.

Huh? Not punish? That would mean the stock would be flat. What the street did was applaud Amazon, increasing the share price by 20% and raising many of the price targets. You can tout Google all you like but I don't hear of them doubling or tripling the size of their N7 design center. gmail? Who cares, who needs it. If you want to get to your account so badly there's a browser to do that. Maps? Maps are generic, they're rolling out a map feature to take care of that. Why would you need a wall adapter if you already own another device, Amazon is just trying to save the consumer money instead of selling them a bunch of useless stuff like the Apple adapters I have and never use since the original one does just fine for my ipods, etc. The street punishes Google on the other hand with a low PE multiple.

But here's my guess. AMZN dropped on news that Walmart was dropping the Amazon Kindle. No reason given. Truth is, most Amazon customers hate shopping at Walmart and Walmart probably didn't sell a lot of Kindles anyway. Amazon is clearly out to destroy Walmart, so why help them? As you can see, this won't affect Amazons sales or revenue. So most likely the stock will drop on Monday (trend continuation) and pop on Tuesday. What will happen on Wednesday is the real question. Technically the up trend hasn't been broken. AMZN could drop to 247 and still be in an uptrend. 247 is half way between 230 and 264. Another positive indicator is Stochastic RSI, which is screaming BUY. Another positive indicator is the short sales ratio is very low (2%). Another positive indicator is the general tone of this board is bearish. This is an institutional stock. Few retail customers own it. The only negative indication is that I'am bullish and I am wrong 80% of the time.</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1348277922036</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 21:38:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348280623595-92</Id><Topic><Title>an education please</Title><Username>beauty90210211</Username><Timestamp>1348258712352</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 16:18:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The only negative indication is that I'am bullish and I am wrong 80% of the time."

Now a #$%$ head basher like you is too stupid too research and look up the name of the billionaire, possibly trillionaire very soon and the richest in the entire country of China, who just happens out of all the companies listed in China, he is on the Renn board of directors with Master Chen graduate of Yale and genuis. Ceo of RENN RENN Master Chen has the 11-29 yr olds all locked up with another 5 billion in that age group to come online in the next 5 years! You think facebook gets some eyeballs! Now a Chinese stimulus is days away unless they are stupid in China! Oct is the month for RENN and the specialist can open RENN at 8 monday with very little selling and those that do sell will just see renn trade to 10 that day or a couple days later! Citi not covering yesterday is moronic. Now one thing that is saving the stupid shorts, you can hear about by downloading Max Keiser last radio and television youtube program. He says that after they looked at the flash crash data. They caught them giving the data feeds of the stocks trading to their proprietory institutions and the retail longs and shorts got the same date 4.9-14.6 seconds later, after that much of the money was skimmed off or drained, the retail traders were left to fight over crumbs. With nasdaq the computer sets the price, it is 10 times a more fair exchange. Now the NYSE is a #$%$ exchange who placed a former Goldman Sachs yes man as the ceo of the NYSE rotflmfao, so now he probably gets all cok ed up calls up Goldman Sachs scared and they tell him to chill and forget about it. You see if the market demand can sustain say 12 or 15 dollars a share for RENN right now, then that is where it trades on a fair exchange like Nasdaq but on the NYSE if the specialist wants to buy or sell or force down and keep leaning on the bid, he can move it to 4 for a really big order, even if the stock can handle 12 or 15 all day long such as RENN can handle. All one has to do is compare the 1st 2 years chart of RENN to the 1st 2 years of BIDU, then see the Kaboom and the same players involved in the underwriting and on the level 2 you will see the same market maker doing the same routine and tricks. If you saw the Sina go up about 30 points in 5 days or so just recently, that was the Triads that move that China White, they don't just move stocks! $$$$$$</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1348282401090</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 22:53:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348284446035-94</Id><Topic><Title>Down on double the volume</Title><Username>marktoukan</Username><Timestamp>1348263893067</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 17:44:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's possible that Bozo the Clown is trying to unload another 1M shares of Scamazon. This POS is like a bloated balloon filled with swamp air. The only unknown is when this bubble will pop. Usually, this happens when valuation metrics don't matter, and folks are jumping on-board only because the stock is on an uptrend. As the DOW approaches 14K, I'm a motivated seller of stocks to lock in 15% capital gain. The goal is to hit 98% cash at DOW 14K and use this cash to SSH Scamazon.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1348284446035</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 23:27:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348285484677-95</Id><Title>Shorts are realizing this weekend . . .</Title><Msg>. . . after today's steady, all-day erosion, they're still deeply in the red, and they don't know how they got here.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1348285484677</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 23:44:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
