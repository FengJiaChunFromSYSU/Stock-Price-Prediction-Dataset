I like Amazon but Ebay seems pretty well organized with more variety and almost never "down." I use both but I hope Amazon gets a larger variety of items. It's great they sell all new stuff usually unlike Ebay which has lots of new and used stuff. I look at both for whichever has a reliable seller and good price. Both have pretty good return policies. Thanks again for all the responses.</Msg><Username>ben.franklin36</Username><Timestamp>1375983033847</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 13:30:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375983383198-73</Id><Topic><Title>back in with 150 weekly $295 calls</Title><Username>bg_rox2001</Username><Timestamp>1375973464193</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 10:51:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting considering they expire tomorrow.........l2play</Msg><Username>bg_rox2001</Username><Timestamp>1375983383198</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 13:36:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375984605448-74</Id><Topic><Title>a CEO should make hundreds of millions of dollars so they concentrate 100% on the company's business</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1375792748547</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-06 08:39:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's nonnense: you don't expense the building of warehouses and technology in it as it's incurred youi idiot.

Capital expenditures were $3.8 billion, $1.8 billion, and $979 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, with the increases primarily reflecting the purchase of property in 2012, and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, including AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations during all three periods. We expect this trend to continue over time. The purchase of property in 2012 included the acquisition of 11 buildings comprising 1.8 million square feet of our previously leased corporate office space and three city blocks in Seattle, Washington for $1.4 billion. Capital expenditures included $381 million, $256 million, and $176 million for internal-use software and website development during 2012, 2011, and 2010. Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $745 million, $705 million, and $352 million. Internal-use Software and Website Development Costs incurred to develop software for internal use and our websites are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. Costs related to design or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are expensed as incurred. For the years ended 2012, 2011, and 2010, we capitalized $454 million (including $74 million of stock-based compensation), $307 million (including $51 million of stock-based compensation), and $213 million (including $38 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $327 million, $236 million, and $184 million for 2012, 2011, and 2010.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1376001658052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 18:40:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376001722955-108</Id><Topic><Title>Nemesis, face it, you don't even know or understand the simplest of making an accounint entry</Title><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1375992774634</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 16:12:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Continued.... Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit, financing, and capital lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as furniture and fixtures, heavy equipment, servers and networking equipment, and internal-use software and website development. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, two years for assets such as internal-use software, three years for our servers, five years for networking equipment, five years for furniture and fixtures, and ten years for heavy equipment). Depreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1376001722955</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 18:42:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376002179792-109</Id><Topic><Title>Nemesis, face it, you don't even know or understand the simplest of making an accounint entry</Title><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1375992774634</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 16:12:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, you have demonstrated that you know how to cut and paste.

We reduce the liability for a gift certificate when redeemed by a customer. If a gift certificate is not redeemed, we recognize revenue when it expires or, for a certificate without an expiration date, when the likelihood of its redemption becomes remote, generally two years from the date of issuance. (better hope is stays remote and that people would rather use new cash than pre-paid unexpired gift cards even in a recession...) Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to Amazon Prime memberships and AWS services. Current unearned revenue is included in “Accrued expenses and other” and non-current unearned revenue is included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets. Current unearned revenue was $792 million and $462 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Non-current unearned revenue was $108 million and $87 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1376002263951</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 18:51:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376002651719-111</Id><Topic><Title>Nemesis, face it, you don't even know or understand the simplest of making an accounint entry</Title><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1375992774634</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 16:12:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Content Costs We obtain digital video content through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions and are generally from one to five years with fixed payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific movie or television title is determinable or reasonably estimable and available for streaming, we recognize an asset representing the fee per title and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We amortize the asset on a straight-line basis over each title’s contractual window of availability, which typically ranges from six months to five years. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. Technology and Content Technology and content expenses consist principally of technology infrastructure expenses and payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application, product, and platform development, category expansion, editorial content, buying, merchandising selection, systems support, and digital initiatives, as well as costs associated with the compute, storage, and telecommunications infrastructure used internally and supporting AWS. Technology and content costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain costs relating to the development of internal-use software and website development, including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and applications supporting our business, which are capitalized and amortized over two years.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1376002651719</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 18:57:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376002746884-112</Id><Topic><Title>Nemesis, face it, you don't even know or understand the simplest of making an accounint entry</Title><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1375992774634</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 16:12:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yet the largest element of the build you conveniently fail to note.
