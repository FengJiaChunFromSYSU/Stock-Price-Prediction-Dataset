If they ever were to extend LT capital gains threshold to 2 or 3 years, these MOMO stocks would crash in a heartbeat. No one would be willing to hold the risk that long...

I am investing for that pathway, while setting myself up to make huge money if we do crash. All the short term folks cannot see the flows and what must happen to get to a stable equilibrium....

Wiped out because unlike other people's merchandise, it doesn't get the benefit of negative working capital because it sells its own stuff at cost? Wiped out because it is undermining its own content sales with Prime? Wiped out because it undermined its own cash flow heading into a period of tightening by offering monthly Prime? Look, it has no service and support. Best Buy will make big headway this holiday season on big ticket item electronic goods. I'm all for Amazon shipping as much low density stuff for free as possible this holiday season, including its loss leading Kindle platform (although Nexus and iPad will still dominate and people are wildly underestimating the popularity of Chromebooks... my kids all use Google Apps / Drive at school and I'm getting each of them a Chromebook). Google has the model right. GRPN also has it right. Amazon has it wrong. And this supernova will be EPIC. Just don't try to time it. Don't buy short term puts because on any ST horizon, the quants will successfully scalp the premium. But, as time passes it will get harder every day because this scam is going to run into real problems in 2013.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1352933439405</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 17:50:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352933717342-117</Id><Topic><Title>Sybs will be covering some more shorts and selling some more bear etfs right into margin call monday</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1352927352140</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 16:09:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's cool.

I had planned on rolling back yesterday from my Jan '15 25 calls. I sold them in the late morning and waited to buy the 20's. I held off all day and then waited all day today. Finally picked them up at the close for $1.20 more than what I sold the 25s for! To make it even better it's didn't cost me a dime because I made the difference on my AMZN short. I love it when a plan comes together! Speaking of B.A. ... glad to see Sybs in the INTC trade. At some point, if this market continues to sell off, money will pour into INTC. Low pe, high dividend, great cash flow, tons of cash, best of breed.
