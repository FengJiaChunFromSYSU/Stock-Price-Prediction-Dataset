That's why I win on all of these. The market cannot stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent. Ask Sybs. He saw me ride through a 50% gain for 9 months on CMG and I didn't come close to blinking. I don't short stocks (actually, I use a short replacement strategy) where the odds not stacked massively in my favor for an asymmetric return. And, I don't bite more than I can chew for a LONG time. 1) AWS -- Google Cloud and Rackspace OpenStack offerings will provide more competition, require continuous technology infrastructure spend and declining margins. Google is clearly opening a front here and the RackSpace/HPQ OpenStack play is basically going to make this even more competitive moving forward. 2) 3P sales... Looks like eBay is having a bit of a rennaisance. In fact, now getting more traction with traditional retailer storefronts (who are aligned AGAINST AMZN), which will shift the consumer mindset more to looking at eBay as well as AMZN for internet purchases, particularly in the coming holiday season. Plus, eBay has MORE CASH and BETTER cash flow (which it can deploy to build/rent/acquire/partner more local operations WHEN asset values reset to reality). And eBay owns that payment thingy... And, eBay's EV is half of AMZN... 3) AMZN sales... The biggest difference between shorts and longs. Longs believe that AMZN getting product to people more quickly will somehow be game changing for sales. Shorts think collecting taxes on high value density/high ticket items will adversely affect sales growth. Time will tell. Of course, analysts could have gotten at these on the last call by asking about relative sales intensity (AMZN share of retail total on ECG total) in areas where tax is collected versus uncollected, but chose not to... And, they could have gotten a sense of how much people value faster delivery by getting at the percent of shipments choosing to pay for 1 day, 2 day versus regular ground. My wife and I buy plenty of stuff from Amazon. It is rarely time sensitive. We almost always go with free ground. Further, many categories of product tend to be more spontaneous/impulse purchases in the physical world and AMZN's build out just isn't going to make a dent there. We're still shopping at Dominick's (Safeway), Costco and Target for most things we need and we do it on the way home from work. The vision of laying waste to all retail is BS. That will become clear soon enough. I hope AMZN finds itself in a cash squeeze (with Google, Rackspace, Apple, WalMart and Best Buy all coming after it hard, each targeting a different area to beat AMZN on price) in the coming year. It would be poetic justice to see it need to raise cash in a challenging environment after all the retailers it put out of business based upon a tax subsidy that it is now trying to eliminate. Typical big company BS to write the rules to its advantage.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1345182953000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 01:55:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345183770000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Goldman just said S&amp;P would plunge.</Title><Username>rimmdiva</Username><Timestamp>1345150149000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 16:49:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Excellent analysis.

It's how they treat their customers. There was a time when Best Buy was packed on weekends and near Christmas. Now they're empty and some stores have closed. Why? Well for starters, they push their worthless warranties and over priced cables on you. Then they advertise great prices but are sold out when you go to buy it. I remember one time I went to see a new computer they were advertising and they didn't even have a demo. So I started window shopping at Worst Buy and buying at Abt.

Those products generally require a contractor service/installation network like Home Depot has developed. HD has attractive unit economics itself (purchasing scale, inv turns, etc) so AMZN has no major cost advantage. When people start segmenting the opportunity critically, they'll see the hype is way overblown: inherently offline purchases (gas, dining, etc), already migrated online and dominated by others (travel), spontaneous/impulsive real time purchases (most food and groceries), those requiring extensive local service networks (large appliances or even paint...). The bottom line is that AMZN's model is well suited to certain categories of goods with relatively high value density that are not perishable and don't require on the ground service. It's much smaller than is being hyped...

(RIMM) have fallen roughly 22% in the past two weeks. Weakness in the financial services sector and fears that this will hurt BlackBerry sales are taking some of the blame. But Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek thinks the concerns are overdone and the lower share price represents a buying opportunity. He says RIM’s exposure to the financial services sector is only through 10% to 15% of its subscriber base, much lower than a year or two ago. Mr. Misek also looked back to the last slowdown in financial services between 2000 and July 2002 when Wall Street firms reduced jobs by roughly 7%, or just over 25,000 people. If the same thing were to occur today, it would be equivalent to just one day of net subscriber additions for RIM, he told clients in a note. RIM saw consumer segment subscriber growth of nearly 50% last quarter, a trend Mr. Misek thinks will continue this quarter and one that signals its diversification. The analyst also expects RIM’s net subscriber additions will be strong this quarter due to demand in Europe and Latin America, as well as with Verizon (VZ) and AT&amp;T (T) in the U.S. He forecasts shipments of 4.1 million BlackBerrys and 1.8 million net subscriber additions for the quarter, versus the consensus at 3.7 million and 1.7 million, respectively. Mr. Misek maintained his “buy” recommendation and US$160 price target on RIM shares.</Msg><Username>racecap</Username><Timestamp>1345210677000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:37:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345210693000-57</Id><Topic><Title>SSH @ 234</Title><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1345037476000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 09:31:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SSH 1K @ 242.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1345210693000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:38:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345210785000-58</Id><Title>selllllllllllllll</Title><Msg>lllllllllllllllll</Msg><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1345210785000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:39:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345210812000-59</Id><Title>sub 240! get out</Title><Msg>...............</Msg><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1345210812000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:40:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345210835000-60</Id><Title>looks like Diego sold too low: congrats to him anyway</Title><Msg>as the computers and momo goons chase stocks up, some with limitied or no earnings, never a bad idea to lock into real cash for the rainy day: congrats to these insiders doing it on the back of the momo chasing up: Larry Page got 668, more than 100 off the lows, Diego could have gotton over 240 and counting. lol! http://wallstcheatsheet.com/investing/jpmorgan-chase-managing-director-sells-30k-shares-and-4-insider-trades-to-recognize.html/?ref=YF</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1345210835000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:40:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345210837000-61</Id><Title>next Q EPS -0.18 and they will lost 300-500 Millions</Title><Msg>Why not own some $190 puts for next year</Msg><Username>cityautomaker</Username><Timestamp>1345210837000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:40:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345210900000-62</Id><Title>AMZN is a Jack of all trades and the master of none.</Title><Msg>Groupon ia making more money than amzn.</Msg><Username>freeland001</Username><Timestamp>1345210900000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:41:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345210929000-63</Id><Topic><Title>Goldman just said S&amp;P would plunge.</Title><Username>rimmdiva</Username><Timestamp>1345150149000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 16:49:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Quite simply, the market has become about the bigger fish eating the smaller fish who see the prey and get there first.

From Zerohedge: VIX is nothing more than the market's implied 'factor' that makes the supply-demand of options prices fit with model-based parameters. In simple terms it measures the market's expectations for volatility (up or down moves - not just down) going forward. Empirically it has a relationship with realized volatility - how much the market actually moved up or down relative to what VIX expected - and professionals will use various 'scalping' techniques to lock in day-to-day gains from the difference between the market's actual movement and what options prices expected. To wit: the current expectations of central bank action, just as it did in 11/2011 (global CB action) and 1/2012 (LTRO1), has caused a slow steady leak higher in stocks which crushes realized volatility - currently at record lows. This in turn drags implied vol lower as the 'scalpers' sell vol to capture the difference. With September 'events' around the corner, we suspect there are only a few more days before realized vol picks up and implicitly implied vol momentum scalpers are squeezed out again (and despite a low absolute VIX, the market IS pricing for a pick-up in risk).</Msg><Username>rimmdiva</Username><Timestamp>1345225143000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 13:39:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345225339000-189</Id><Topic><Title>puts will go up 10 x money</Title><Username>cityautomaker</Username><Timestamp>1345213387000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:23:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's why I called it this morning Triple sell</Msg><Username>cityautomaker</Username><Timestamp>1345225339000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 13:42:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345225423000-190</Id><Topic><Title>Volatility Lowest in a Decade!</Title><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1345220870000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 12:27:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, but that was before this worldwide crisis and huge deleveraging grabbing hold.

That being said, I think it has been exposed to reality and they don't care as long as the Fed is supporting the market, they will play the games as if it's got the same earnings as one of the better earning companies in the NAZ. Yes, AMZN has ballooned here to top shelf bubble values that I've seen since year 2000, but the liquidity that the Fed provides still chases it. The last two earnings reports were horrible and exposed AMZN and the players of it havn't cared. That's where we are now. Reality didn't set in yet with those awful earnless reports so it will take something bigger to stop it from being used to trade against retail who think it's a pig, which it is, don't get me wrong.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1345238090000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 17:14:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345240603000-272</Id><Topic><Title>The P/E and PEG is insane</Title><Username>cjmaranto</Username><Timestamp>1345230545000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:09:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We'll see.

But neither one of those companies worry Google executives as much as another that is actively taking money out of their pockets. This company is from Washington, but no, it's not Microsoft. Google's real rival, and real competition to watch over the next few years is Amazon. Google is a search company, but the searches that it actually makes money from are the searches people do before they are about to buy something online. These commercial searches make up about 20 percent of total Google searches. Those searches are where the ads are. What Googlers worry about in private is a growing trend among consumers to skip Google altogether, and to just go ahead and search for the product they would like to buy on Amazon.com, or, on mobile in an Amazon app. There's data to prove this trend is real. According to ComScore, Amazon search queries are up 73 percent in the last year. But it makes intuitive sense doesn't it? Why go through these steps … •Google search "rubber galoshes," •Analyze some text links, •Click on one to go to a product page on some e-commerce store, •Click to add the item to your cart, •Input your credit card, •Input your address, … when you can just … •Search amazon for "rubber galoshes," •Click one button to buy the product with your usual credit card and have it shipped to your normal address. On mobile, where Amazon has its own app and Google is just a search bar for a smaller-screened browser, the equation tips further in Amazon's balance. The scenario gets even scarier for Google if Kindle phones and Kindle tablets gain ubiquity. If you have a Kindle phone, which comes with free movies and books because you have an Amazon Prime account, which also gives you free shipping, why in the WORLD would you ever search to buy something through anything but Amazon? You wouldn't. That's why Amazon is practically giving its hardware away. It's also why Amazon scares Google more than anything Facebook or Apple are up to.</Msg><Username>vjack68</Username><Timestamp>1345255893000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 22:11:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345256753000-287</Id><Topic><Title>The P/E and PEG is insane</Title><Username>cjmaranto</Username><Timestamp>1345230545000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:09:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The low short interest shows that shorts have for the most part given up on shorting AMZN. The time when they threw in the towel was at the tail end of 2010, when Bernanke pushed QE2. Short interest stood at 16 million shares or so then, now it's down to 7.5 million.</Msg><Username>incognitusfn2</Username><Timestamp>1345256753000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 22:25:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345261062000-288</Id><Topic><Title>The P/E and PEG is insane</Title><Username>cjmaranto</Username><Timestamp>1345230545000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:09:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just another part of the framing scam. Multiples used to mean TTM because that was FACT. Companies got rewarded for what they delivered in actual profit growth, not what some starry eyed analyst dreams might happen in 2015. Last I checked, virtually no one saw the financial crisis happening in 2008 at the start of 2007. But, these analyst are suggesting to buy a stock trading at 36X EBITDA because gross margins are expanding and they hope it might make more money in 2015? This one is going to be epic. CMG was a few billion hit. This ponzi is BIG. The losses for those that don't get out before we fall into recession or suffer from a shock will be huge and material. And, it will all have been knowable with robust due diligence (if you have billions invested here, you better be damned sure that AMZN's share and profitability are just as high where it does collect taxes -- that its growth and profitability will not fall off when it starts collecting everywhere... hoping is flat out negligent in this macro climate with these multiples).</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1345261062000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 23:37:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345261583000-289</Id><Topic><Title>Is this true or a pump</Title><Username>vjack68</Username><Timestamp>1345255893000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 22:11:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is the most b.s. pump article I have even read! 1st, who just goes on Amazon to buy something without Googling to see if they can get a better deal elsewhere? It's not like your driving to another store!? Open another tab and search it! 2nd, The Kindle sucks, no one is buying it. Sales were down 13% last month. 3rd, Kindle phone??? The iPhone and Droid will kill the Kindle phone I don't care if you can watch The Hunger Games on it. Shame on you for bringing this one up now, that was used for the squeeze job this week. You need to turn to the future. Look up your boy Cramer's website... "The Street" for an interesting take on why AMZN is a great short candidate. This one is just about out of gas. Gravity will soon take hold. - PJ</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1345261583000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 23:46:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345262072000-290</Id><Topic><Title>Is this true or a pump</Title><Username>vjack68</Username><Timestamp>1345255893000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 22:11:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just in case your interested... good read. http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/08/17/2012/two-take-short?puc=quo - PJ</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1345262072000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 23:54:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
