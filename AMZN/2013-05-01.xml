The only risks will be facing implied volatility explosion, and possibly become a bag holder should the stock tanks. I think that selling AAPL puts makes much more sense because (1) IV at AAPL is still high and (2) AAPL seems to be at least has found a footing after the prolonged drop. AMZN is in a very different environment. My research shows me that AMZN is about to roll over, so selling puts here at $253 area can make you a bag holder perhaps for a very long time. I have been selling AAPL puts with pretty good success because it bounces up everything time I sold and close out a day or two later. AAPL is a stock I don't mind owning. AMZN on the other hand, is a very different stock in a very different environment in which not very favorable to puts selling.</Msg><Username>hb5fa_2</Username><Timestamp>1367383177118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 00:39:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367383307458-3</Id><Topic><Title>Selling puts</Title><Username>pamannw</Username><Timestamp>1367361585782</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 18:39:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pa has a long position.

The powerful almighty Yahoo message board filter deleted my post with an embedded url. Here is the definition of "Death Cross" from Investopedia: Investopedia explains 'Death Cross' A crossover resulting from a security's long-term moving average breaking above its short-term moving average or support level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, this trend indicates a bear market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes. Additionally, the long-term moving average becomes the new resistance level in the rising market.

No one dare to buy at this level to catch the falling knife. It's just beginning. Now it is the race for the funds to dump shares at higher price. Whoever dumped early will be the winner. This is similar to the situation that some funds started dumping AAPL at around $650(not even at the top of $700). I am sure many funds purchased shares at lower price, may be much lower price, but they don't want their gain to be wiped out if it drops like what AAPL did in terms of percentage. Actually, I think it will drop more than AAPL in terms of percentage because AAPL made enough money to do the buy back and dividend to help stabilize its stock price. AMZN doesn't have money to do any of these two. Only can keep selling its non-profitable growth story, which becomes less and less convincing. Some hedge funds will come attack this to make money. They are looking for this kind of opportunity to make big money because they know now no one dareto buy at this level. Now $250 will be a big resistant.</Msg><Username>leland_chen</Username><Timestamp>1367428782648</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:19:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367428859128-117</Id><Topic><Title>Bounce?</Title><Username>algaebb</Username><Timestamp>1367427925549</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:05:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's go for it right NOW.

I've always thought Gillis was the most intellectually honest. It seems he's done some of the proper analysis of Amazon's shipping cost. Most still are perpetuating the lies... No one seems to see what is coming. There's only 1 path out of this macro mess unless the Fed is suddenly willing to risk cascading default. In that scenario, Amazon's relative competitiveness continue to decline.

We will likely bounce from there to the 1530-1560 range on the s&amp;p with amzn remaining flat at the 175 level to possibly bouncing to the 227 high end (short this if it happenz) by the end of july, august will be choppy, but you'll find that the market highz are a fading memory az we move into 2014 with markets getting dicier bur hanging between 1275 and the 1400 range until in mid to late 2014, all heeeellllll breaks lose where markets, muniez and banks fail with no bailout protectionz . Repubs will point at demz, both will point at the fed, and the globe will point at the US az markets drop to 450-575 on the S&amp;P.... It will be uuugly.

Bitcoin stocks, 2 mini flash crashes, the global search for anything with a yield, and the incessant reckless printing of the FED and the global central banks, I believe the AMZN scam has started to unwind, as evidenced mostly by the break in money flow, and may hit 175 in the next 6 - 8 weeks. But I am not so sure as to your timing and overall levels for the SPX as a whole. The central banks are all in. If not 85 billion a month, then why not 200 billion a month. Until there is a major commodity shock to the markets that forces the central banks to stop printing, I do not think we will see the doomsday scenario as a whole. Individual stocks like AMZN will fall out of favor, but a new scam will be the recipient.

"Charts" become what they are due to the one's who have the money to move the stock up and down at their own discretion, period. These same folks can arbitrarily change how the "chart" looks on a dime. You are thus claiming to be capable of reading their minds based upon some mumbo jumbo interpretations of what "the chart" looks like until this moment. Again, "how it looks" can change on the whim of the moment based strictly upon the thoughts of the one's who move the stock. Thus, your "technical analysis" comments (as well as everyone else's) should be thrown in the toilet since you have no clue what the "chart makers" are thinking. My read on what you are trying to do is to try to prove to your readers here that you are the #1 stock timing guru who knows how to read into charts and thus predict what's going to happen "soon" (however one defines "soon."). Reality: You have no clue and neither does anyone else posting here. Just look at some of your recent similar comments that made similar claims whereupon the stock did not follow your so-called analytical conclusions. Did you ever have the humility to come back on here and say "Well, I was wrong about that 'chart read' interpretation of mine..." No, of course not. You just fagetaboutit and move onto your next new chart-call. The question is, why does one such as yourself have a desire to try to paint yourself as some kind of chart-gazing guru to a bunch of total strangers on a message board? What is your end goal in making such silly chart-read calls to the message board folks?</Msg><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1367465662988</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:34:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367466693183-238</Id><Topic><Title>"FB haz more value than amzn", and stok X iz worth more than stok Y....

However, there are a couple of things to add. First of all, if you believe as you do about stocks in general, why did you admit to purchasing shares of AA? If you believe the entire stock trading system is a set-up rigged scam scheme game, why did you buy shares? By doing so, you are implyinf that you want to be part of something that you believe is a scam and that you hope to eventually unload your shares to some poor greater fool. Not a very positive implication about yourself. Second, while it is true that those who own just shares of stock can't do anything with them, and thus their "investment" is henceforth under the total control of the those who make an ongoing market in said shares, which means that you must rely on someone else to bid up your shares for you; and it's also true that dividends are subject to reduction or withdrawl without advanced warning, still there is some net asset value to the underlying company. Which can eventually translate into a buy out at a price that could be higher than what you paid for your shares and end up netting you a profit. Of course, that is extremely chancy and iffy. Because there's always the chance that said company will never get bought out, and there's always a chance that even if they do get bought out the buy out price per share will be at a level that is lower than what you paid for your shares.</Msg><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1367466693183</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:51:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367467122840-239</Id><Topic><Title>"FB haz more value than amzn", and stok X iz worth more than stok Y....

In fact, it seems clear that the very concept of "stock charts" was created as part of the scamming process that you speak about. Yet, you imply that "stock chart reading" is "legit" while stocks themselves are not. Hmmmm.</Msg><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1367467122840</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:58:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
