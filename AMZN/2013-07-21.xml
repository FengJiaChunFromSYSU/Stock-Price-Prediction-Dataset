Wait a second tail, didnt you justpost that 'wealth from the collapse of the housing market waz DESTROYED"????? If many lost their life saving and/or their housez while a few "made billionz" then that Sure looks like a transfer of wealth from the many to the few that you just identified above using unpublished meanz methodz and techniques Lets face the retail pistion of "short worthless pos scamazon stok for the collapse" iz a popular one amongst the sheeple.... One only has to read SA, and common public boardz to see this. For this reason, people are betting short bigger than what they should be in the midst of a wealth transferring parabola (which used to include sybby until sybs scaled back amzn at a realized loss and diversified to other more 'quiet shorts' like pcln). Dont worry, 'ol sybby will be ready to carefully scooope up more shorts from the slack jawed populous sheeple az they get gitted like fish ove the next week or 3 or 7....

Earnings don't matter because there is a steady stream of money coming in next month to pump up the Fat Pig. If you believe in QE Forever, then cover your short positions and move on. But if you believe that QE is about to end in the next few months, then hang tight with your short positions by selling your winners so you can ride out the storm. There will be a repeat of 1999 when Scamazon's stock price was cut by 90%. I always keep 2x cash for each share short to avoid forced liquidation. Remember that big $ is made by doing the unexpected. When people pile into housing...time to get out. When people buy Scamazon because it will never go down...time to short. Not many can short at the top, but at current valuation, all will make at least $200 on the downside. The crooks tout AWS as the great $ maker, but one only need to look at the other big competitors like IBM to see the true earning potential. Intense competition between the big dogs will keep margins at low level, forever. In summary, Scamazon is a giant bubble fueled by QE. Once there is confirmation of the end of QE, the rats will jump ship...fast because no one wants to be the last to sell a bubble stock. The smart funds will probably anticipate the end of QE by a quarter or two by scaling back this Pig. The best time to short a bubble stock is when there is so much uncertainty about going shot because the tape is showing that the longs are in total control.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1374419497985</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 11:11:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374422946354-21</Id><Topic><Title>sybil.... question</Title><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1374415704141</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 10:08:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they simply buy more and more till the big crash</Msg><Username>efratyrafael</Username><Timestamp>1374422946354</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 12:09:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374423933220-22</Id><Topic><Title>sybil.... question</Title><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1374415704141</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 10:08:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you may be right.</Msg><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1374423933220</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 12:25:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374425465407-23</Id><Title>tech, so can u do some two dimensional thing</Title><Msg>like X and Y. then lets look at the price stability issue. the whole issue was designed for one reason and it is to prove to the sheeple that investment is safe to enter. now give some numbers like earnings price and afterwards. btw, what would cause a black swan other than execution of some important big shot, maybe a banker</Msg><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1374425465407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 12:51:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374430636698-24</Id><Topic><Title>tech, so can u do some two dimensional thing</Title><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1374425465407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 12:51:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cash, yes the entire QE/money printing thing is about providing the appearance of stability while imposing negative real returns to deflate the system (while allowing the banks to use their information advantage slowly unload more toxic assets to the taxpayers/Fed and, these days, retail investing public via passive ETFs...).
