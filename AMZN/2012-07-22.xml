When options are bought, if there are no sellers, the MM must write the option. The MM may not want to establish a position, so they will hedge to remain nuetral. The stock price changes as the expiration approaches. The MM will need to adjust the hedges to remain neutral. This re-balancing action in the stock drives the stock price toward max pain.</Msg><Username>scriptcalendar</Username><Timestamp>1342961119000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 08:45:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342963083000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Sounds crazy but I went long AMZN &amp; shorted AAPL</Title><Username>hamburg55555</Username><Timestamp>1342836796000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-20 22:13:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I buy deeper in the money calls to lessen premium and same for puts, buy deeper in the money puts so as to lessen premium.

If third party sales soften just don't report their numbers it doesn't belong to Amzoom anyway.

Sales taxes no problem here either they will pass them along to the loyal base who use Safeway as their showroom. Next it will be Walgreens and GM show Rooms.

We ran a poll asking readers whether they plan to buy the budget priced Asus built device. "Yes" scored a landslide victory, with 90 per cent of respondents saying that they're planning to buy a Nexus 7 tablet. Interestingly, 71 per cent of readers said they will buy the tablet because of its Google Play integration, which sees apps, books and films placed at the center of the tablet's functionality. A further 19 per cent said they will buy the tablet simply because of its cheap and cheerful price, which sees the 8GB and 16GB models selling for £159 and £199, respectively. Just 10 per cent of INQUIRER readers said they don't plan to buy the device, with six per cent answering that they'll stick with their Ipad and two per cent saying that they are holding out for the Amazon Kindle Fire. This matches up nicely with Currys' prediction that the Nexus 7 will outsell the Kindle Fire over the holidays. A further two per cent said they will hold out for a Google Chrome tablet instead. µ</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1342982889000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 14:48:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342983500000-11</Id><Topic><Title>will amzn follow cmg and other overvalued stocks</Title><Username>howo3579</Username><Timestamp>1342819783000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-20 17:29:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Options that deep in the money usually trade at the same as what they are worth on excersize.

The next 7 days should be the wildest in many years. That's how I see the U.S. stock market charts and all world market charts. The world markets really are about to CRASH. I'm in no way exagerrating. If you're just throwing darts and then buying puts on the names those darts land on- you'll do fine. If you really want to make money - secretly pray one of those darts lands on Amzn. And if you are trying to maximize gains- here's my lineup. Tuesday night - BWLD and AAPL. Wednesday night - EQIX. Thursday night -AMZN and LNKD ( based on the FB drop I see coming, Lnkd will be the better play, though obviously FB should get clobbered). Whether or not the overall markets have a true crash event over the next 7 days into July 30th/July 31st, or not, those companies should drop tremendously. If an actual Crash event does occur over that time (and I will be positioned with that expectation) , those stocks will each go into freefall. Cmg projects to $285 by August expiration ( as I've stated while it was trading at $415.00 three weeks ago and , as usual, being called crazy by everyone except a few). Aapl still projects below $500.00 by Labor Day ( of course everyone continues to laugh at that call that I made on Memorial Day with Aapl at $560, they are laughing even harder now with 7 weeks gone by and Aapl up another $40 and now over $600. Remember what happens to 'he who laughs last'), Lnkd to high $70s by August expiration. And Amzn- I'll be very conservative and state "a minimum fall" to the $170s by August expiration (my goal is the $150s). Crm - I'm only in November puts (but will likely add Sept puts soon) and will take profits within a couple dollars of $100.00 in that time frame and then reposition prior to their earnings release for an expected fall into the $70s after the earnings report. Pcln easily below $600 ( $540s is my estimation in the crash scenario, and most definately after earnings in Aug ). RL $120s by Aug expiration. Yum - nothing has changed- $55.00-$57.50 by Aug expiration. If Bidu is down tomorrow intraday ( I expect), I'll take profits on bidu, and look for a bounce to near $112-$115 area after earnings and reenter Aug $115 puts (small position) on Tuesday morning. If somehow Bidu up to $112-$115 area intraday tomorrow, I'll sit tight and let earnings come out. You each now know my gameplan over next 7 days and into Aug expiration. I think what's about to unfold is going to be extraordinary - and that is an understatement. All based on how I read the charts. Be smart. Don't gamble. Yet now's the time to be aggressive. Best wishes.</Msg><Username>focusedtrading</Username><Timestamp>1343010334000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 22:25:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343010777000-22</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts, are you sad?</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1343009715000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 22:15:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There's always a couple of daytraders with core long positions who talk smack and are obnoxious and abusive.
