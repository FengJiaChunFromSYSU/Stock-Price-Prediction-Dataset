You will way more often then not find your crackhead option trade a day late and/or a dollar (or many dollarz) short of profit if you havent realized that already yet. You would have more success in tracking down a unicorn drinking from the fountaon of yourh located in The Land of Fariez and Dragonz then you would with finding a 'decent put option strategy". This Continued quest of crackheadz only works to keep it profitable for a stock scam to rise and platue repeatedly in a seemingly endless obliteration of optionz crackheadz. Sybs hopes this information helps.

Your simple mind equates that az long az interest rates stay low, borrowerz will borrow without regard - implying that low intrest rates with regard to nothing else.... at this time we are in the following situation: Bernanke iz making lots of capital available today at the expense of tomorrow Credit worthiness iz in the tank amongst the massez and az whole a country az muni bondz default and sheeple leverage up in student loanz, new carz, and sheiot from china and japan. But the ratingz dont reflect this -yet. Rates are being held artificially low, while those that need to borrow at these low rates cant, and those that dont need the money can get it if they want it. Lenderz 'banks' are taking on more and more risk in a search for yeild, except they are not loaning money to anyone that needz it, instead they are buying pig stox with it. The dollar iz being devalued to accomplish this Rates can either skyrocket and then we crash, a dynamic we are used to, or stay low az the market collapsez and willing ness to loan and borrow goez into the tank ... Sybil thinks that rates, although rizing will run post crash (ie 1978 carter after the 74-75 crash), despite what your simple mind iz able to process While home mortgagez and corporate bondz are low for those that 'qualify' , inflation in food, fertilizer and commoditiez iz high. Rates are high for those that need money, or they cant get it at all... So here'z whats gonna happen - rates are gonna swing wildly relative to their historical swingz az they have in the past 6 months, bernanke and the next fed will keep printing in attempt to 'calm' the markets. The yeild curve will invert az short term yeildz being bought by long term notes spike, and the markets will crash followed by high interest rates due to limited borrowing and lending</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1380996901948</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 14:15:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380999005556-23</Id><Topic><Title>Today, Barrons tries to punch a hole in the Amazon Bubble</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1380987707476</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 11:41:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>People have been bearish on these momentum stocks all year - and there has not been any pullback. AMZN, NFLX, TSLA - these are all going up not because of fundamentals, but because people continue to expect price increases. It is a self-fulfilling bubble, until the buying stops. There are some deep pockets throwing money at these stocks on the daily - I don't think it is the retail investor. Just a matter of when they have had their fill, these guys will back off and go in the opposite direction. These things can't go up forever, that is a fact. The question is how far are they going to stretch these valuations before some big players start dumping enough shares to offset their algorithms.
