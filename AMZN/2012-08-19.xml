The market relies on people simplifying trends, and it also relies on contrarians overthinking them and doing the opposite... Whoever outweighs each other is the group that gets screwed because mr. Market is a dirty old pervert that likes to ph'u'ck the largest number of people possible... Sybil Has it planned both ways..... sybil is a short.... The sybil call - The markets will continue to rally on short covering into the fall where sybil continues to short all the way up - sybil holds a possibility of s&amp;p 1700, but considers such leves obsurd (which didnt prevent it from happening in 1999-2000.... Sybil is ready if this happens..... Conversly sybil has the market crashing to 666 to 450 at the end of this particular run, wherever it ends from here to 1700.... Sooooooo Sybil is betting short on the following: 0 to 20% upside from current levels to s&amp;p 1700 (avg 10% upside left in the market) Vs 54 to 68% downside level risk from current 1420 to 450 on the s&amp;p... Its an easy bet to make.... And the higher the market and bs stox go, the easier the short bet becomes to hold and to make. Remember boys and girls money lost is veeeerrrrry hard to win back.... Todaus 50% loss is tommorows 100% gain to break even again...... A 70% hit takes a triple to win it back.... Good luck ph'u'ckers - sybil is one retailer that will be skulking around in tge shadows of robots trying to take the money of those idiots betting opposite of sybils bet.</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1345384079000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 09:47:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345386300000-8</Id><Topic><Title>Here Comes Traditional Sept-Oct Crash Season</Title><Username>grandapa.clampett</Username><Timestamp>1345360598000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 03:16:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybil: the 2008 bear market started in January.

All you bashing FB (showing the nonexistent spine of Jim Cramer), watch as FB develops 2 transactional revenue streams. First, it will compete with LNKD. I suspect it will buy MWW for about $1B in cash. The transaction would be accretive and would give FB the largest database of employers/job openings, job seekers/CVs and THE HISTORY of both which it will be able to mine and monetize. Second, and relevant to this board, it will get involved with transactional commerce. The Want button has been discussed a little, but what it is really leading to is leveraging social networksboth for trusted product recommendations and for group purchasing (the latter FB is absolutely uniquely positioned to enable). Both of those developments will gradually disintermediate AMZN as the FB network will aggregate demand and retailers and manufacturers will bid on it... That's the strategic direction I expect FB to follow. And, it will be REALLY funny when AMZN has built out this massive infrastructure only to face state taxes and yet lose control of the consumer as they band together in trusted groups to maximize leverage. Lots of malinestment while FB focuses on leverage network effects to concentrate value for users and captures a significant share of it without investing tons in low ROIC projects... FB may not head in that direction (even though it should). Regardless, that is the direction things will evolve. Retailers selling the same stuff simply don't have leverage... Talk all the smack you want. We'll see how it pkays out over the next few years. Don't worry. AMZN multiple will be down to 100 or so if it stops over investing AND knocks it out of the park during that timeframe....</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1345432558000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 23:15:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345434206000-38</Id><Title>Next shoe to drop . . .</Title><Msg>. . .

With sales tax advantage gone, Amazon.com has no incentive NOT to have "physical presence" in many states. It will morph into the world's largest brick and mortar store chain and e-tailer in the next several years. The growth will continue for decades. As I've been saying, "You ain't seen nothing yet." Good luck to all. (On the other hand, FB will be a couple of bucks a share by 2014 if it doesn't go bankrupt.)</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1345434882000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 23:54:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
