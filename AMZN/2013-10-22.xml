That hasn't mattered and probably still won't quite yet but that does not mean it won't get the treatment that NFLX is receiving today. Of course Bezos will never say this is a MOMO pain trade stock but with QE that's exactly what this is. They'll run it up to an artificial high and maybe it gets brought down a bit for some consolidation of the MOMO post earnings.

They need more gizmos to sell. now usually that doesn't matter in Amazon but given the run-up I think we will get some pullback here but the question is from where. They want to run this up into earnings and I plan on shorting more after hours. I got extremely lucky on NFLX last night. I'm trying to stay away for options with lots of premium so I shorted some shares late yesterday and an equal amount in after hours at 393. I was actually trying to cover those last night but my price never hit and even this morning I had a trade that should have went off but DID NOT.

Very well stated. The thing with AMZN dynamics at this juncture is this: If AMZN declares losses again, it will be status quo, as in the last 5 years and the pps will zoom up to 375 in a heart bit! But, God forbid, and if AMZN declares a profit some day, the stock will instantly loose 25%... such is the convoluted-state of affairs here now. Many parties are involved, many parties interests are inter-tangled at this juncture here ... so, AMZN will declare another loss and the pps will zoom-up again IMHO! Extremely counter-intuitive I know, but that's what has been working here for last 20 quarters! If you like this post, please reco it!
