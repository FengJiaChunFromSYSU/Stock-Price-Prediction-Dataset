I do have a short history here so maybe you just got fed up dealing with people on the boards which I could understand. With people like mytek apparently stalking me and lying on this board if your experience is the same I could certainly understand it. I had even told at least one or more NFLX shorts and whoever else read my posts that I was out as of Friday of my NFLX puts and I had not been short there for a while.. Why risk it there when even the biggest bear, Webush's Michael Pachter, thought NFLX would beat their numbers. Do I think NFLX is sustainable as is, No, they have negative free cash flow. They will eventually have to do better or it will simply be a replay of 2011. While I am net long mostly because a few long term holds and recent value buys I have I fear this will all end badly. The global economy is not good and QE infinity is not a good idea.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1366737150128</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:12:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366737491437-46</Id><Topic><Title>ANY TECHSTRATEGY SIGHTINGS?

They are used az a proxy to transfer real wealth from the many to the few az efficiently az possible. You cant eat them, drink them, heat with them, or build shelter with them. Assuming that the market iz functioning during market hourz (a BIG assumption in this flashy crashy robot hacky world we live in), a stox ONLY value iz what the robot or greater fool knucklehead on the other end of the wire will pay you for them at the particular nano second that you attempt a sale. When you think of stox, think of them az a notch below bitcoin. Bit coin would be a notch below AAA bond debt, which iz just a scad below greek debt, which iz minutely below us treasury notes.
