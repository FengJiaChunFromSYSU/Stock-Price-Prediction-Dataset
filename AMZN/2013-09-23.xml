Previously, it was a violation of securities law to publicly raise funds without registering the securities and complying with SEC regulations, so much fundraising was limited to pre-existing relationships and private networks. The new ability, however, comes with the possibility of complicated filing requirements that could trip up startups, some legal experts warn. Lifting the 80-year-old general solicitation ban was approved in July following the JOBS Act, which was passed by Congress in April 2012 and designed to make capital raising easier for small businesses. The idea is that under the resulting new regulations, the investor pool expands for companies and investors now allowed to openly raise funds by advertising in newspapers and social media.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1379979771860</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 19:42:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
