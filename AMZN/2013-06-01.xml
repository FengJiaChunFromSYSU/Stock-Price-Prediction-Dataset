Do you think you can outsmart "conmen" who manipulate this stock? That's the problem all shorts here have, you know. You guys think you're smarter than "conmen" with a staggering amount of financial resources.

Why ? Simple , retail investor needs and wants to be in the game . Now looking at the markets and stocks , the investor sees stocks at high levels , not to mention that the markets have been up up and away as of the last 7 months . What to do ? Have a healthy pullback of say 7% to 10 % at which point , people will be told , see now is the time to buy , we are in a bull market territory and you must take advantage of this pullback in prices. Thus , what better reason to have a pullback . It is time for a healthy pullback . Amzn will be a play in this pullback to say $225 level to $195 in a extreme pullback and then back up again . same with goog , aapl , nflx , pcln . This being said , place your bets.
