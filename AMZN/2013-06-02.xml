I will say this though, if we get no correction soon and just continue to melt up it will be ugly when the "correction" comes. I keep hearing how cheap stocks are yet most that come my way for any analysis are not what I would call cheap. They mostly appear fairly valued to over valued with a few exceptions here and there. And then you have the MOMOs which usually have little to no earnings and are valued to the moon on their way to Saturn.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1370171638851</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 07:13:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370172182742-3</Id><Topic><Title>Barron's article</Title><Username>buterjohn</Username><Timestamp>1370135012646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 21:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sybs sometimes I think you are extreme in your analysis but what you say is true, no doubt. One of the worst case offenders of this is CRM. Take a look at how much of the farm they give away to themselves. They do a lot of overpriced acquisitions and keep paying themselves in more and more shares and then took a $1B loan to pay for more growth, partially because they are giving away the free cash flow to insiders in the form of free shares. It's like the money's coming in the front door and they are taking out the bag door. The game works for as long as the stock is going up and as long as the cartel stays in line and stays mum on their aggressive accounting.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1370172182742</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 07:23:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370180436449-4</Id><Topic><Title>Barron's article</Title><Username>buterjohn</Username><Timestamp>1370135012646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 21:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its simple. Its mothing that anyone else, including sybil, wouldn't do with the same connectionz and access to financial markets. Rediculous compensation and wealth transferz are perfectly legal, but makes no less a scam with the haves having far greater advantage built into lawz and acceptance of practice (even admiration) over the have nots and the wealth gaps never being greater. And the sad fact iz that people that want out by way of saving money instead are being punished by fed fiscal policy with 0% interest rates 'for an extended period of time' and bailouts for the 'fat cats', leaving them little alternative but to puke and theough their hard earned coin into the casino markets for it to be skimmed, sodomized, hammered and stripped from them while being told its the right thing to do... "Buy and hold stox for the long term. Start your 401k early. Stox go up on average 8% / year for ever. Follow the green line. Fidelity, turn here." Its a 40 year old system as we know it of conditioned wealth stripping - never being more efficient then present time.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1370180436449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 09:40:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370181701897-5</Id><Title>Would the world end az we know it if sheeple had a viable option to pay down debt, save money, and build their own small businessez?</Title><Msg>Sybil thinks not....</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1370181701897</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 10:01:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370189108252-6</Id><Topic><Title>I see Sybil the Clown has all these fake tickets of shorting today: the greatest bull in our lifetime and this clown acts like he's</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1368818058032</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:14:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>stinky Jr., don't you remember pumping PKI before the end of year drop???????
