He ended up missing the run to $260. If you're so worried about losing your gain just sell after you have a profit above 5% or above a CD. $300 is not a magic number, nor is $300. If you will be happy with just a small gain that is fine, sell at anytime. A lot of people say the will be "happy". Only thing is that after they see the stock double right after they sold they turn out not to be so happy after all. Also, I don't see how one can set a price in advance. By the time the stock is at $300 or $350 we may have all kinds of new data and issues to consider; there's no way to "set a price" today unless you are just playing a game. If it is a game, just flip a coin and let heads be $300 and tails be $350.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348067534270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 11:12:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348067896584-16</Id><Topic><Title>261.25 somewhat critical.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1348066801368</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 11:00:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooah!</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1348067896584</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 11:18:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348067983159-17</Id><Topic><Title>261.25 somewhat critical.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1348066801368</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 11:00:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Time to blow the whistle!!!</Msg><Username>iluv2short</Username><Timestamp>1348067983159</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 11:19:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348068494091-18</Id><Title>264.11 and beyond.</Title><Msg>Shorts here will take us to yet another uncharted territory.

It is obvious that Apple settled because they broke the law and they know it. Breaking the law was a defensive move on their part, to buy some time, but their time is now up. Anyone who doesn't see that (you) must be desperate to make up some #$%$and-bull spin story about how Apple and publishers now being forced to compensate consumers they had cheated into a "positive" thing for shorts.

Must be off your rocker. Music companies were devastated by the system Apple forced on them. It was not to the "benefit" of everyone. Only someone ignorant of the history of online music could say such a silly thing. In addition Apple's policy with music was to LOWER prices as low as possible. For e-books, it was to RAISE prices. You need to get your story straight and stop making up REVISIONIST nonsense. "If the publishers are smart, they will increase prices for digital content across the board" They'd like to but it is against the law to do so. It's called price fixing.

You make no sense. Under the agency pricing publishers got the same amount of money as they did when Amazon was selling books for $9.99. Whatever price Amazon sold e-books for had zero, I repeat, zero effect on the revenue publishers received per e-book. Before Apple got involved with music you are saying music companies got 0%. On the other hand, before Apple got involved in raising prices, publishers got 100% of what publishers always got for e-books. AFTER Apple got involved publishers got the SAME 100%. The only difference was that Apple got more of the revenue that was over and above the cost of the e-book. Who's "schooling" how? "I did not suggest that they collude." So how do they do this? Randomly price content? People never are able to do this. The only way it would work is by colluding by ESP. Unless a standard price is decided one company will always be worried about being underpriced by another. The only way a standard can decided is by collusion. "Amazon would see it's profits and leverage sink...." You'd like to see this happen, but fantasies about collusion without colluding is not gonna get you there.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348094046112</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 18:34:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348094487086-97</Id><Title>Ad Spending?

Of course, AMZN actually HAS a PE (grossly overpriced as it surely is), whereas some of the "gems" back then sporting $500+ per share valuations didn't even have earnings, just a price. Really? Do AMZN investors expect this path to continue indefinitely? The cascading crash in AMZN's stock value will be a site to behold once the delusions of the crowds face up to the reality that AMZN now has a "fantasyland" valuation (just like a LEGIT stock such as Qualcomm had about 12 years ago) that can never EVER be achieved.</Msg><Username>ershon911</Username><Timestamp>1348107515565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 22:18:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348108823523-110</Id><Topic><Title>Why Amazon Did Not Go Local Before 2012</Title><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348092867540</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 18:14:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Billions to fund? they have $5B in cash however with over $7B in AP and $4B in accrued expenses and sales of what we are told will be $63B this year - not exactly a cash cow. They have $1.4B less than last year and certainly this upcoming quarter will be worse. They're going to need a lot more cash than they have to chase the same day delivery goal which is why they will probably need to issue debt sometime in 2014. Everyday amzns' balance sheet looks more ike a target or best buy. Which is perfectly fine however stock is priced on future cash flow that will never materialize.</Msg><Username>dutchboyinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1348108823523</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 22:40:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348109679415-111</Id><Topic><Title>The Top</Title><Username>panichomo2</Username><Timestamp>1348098187605</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 19:43:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone shorting this market is insane, AMZN goin much higher.

It is much worse than that $2.3B in cash, $2.4B in receivables, $4.4B in inventory and $2.6B in ST investments against $10.9B in payable. It literally bet the farm on Kindle Fire HD and moving local. If Apple and Google attack its cash flow via price competition on its core digital content (books), amazon is gonna feel some serious hurt.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1348110856061</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 23:14:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348111123199-113</Id><Topic><Title>The Top</Title><Username>panichomo2</Username><Timestamp>1348098187605</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 19:43:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We understand the part where almost none of that money actually makes it into the hands of the people with the highest marginal propensity to consume.
