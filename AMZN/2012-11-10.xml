I enjoy the back and forth. You know light more than I do about AZO and industry dynamics there. That was just my quick/initial reaction. Havind said that, storms cause damage and require repairs. While some will be total losses, even those won't necessarily lead to new car fleets as people may pocket the insurance and buy a used car. Of course, in the macro/longer term, it leads to purchases elsewhere and a newer fleet. But, the effect is likely to be significantly lagged whereas incremental repair will hit faster. On to FSLR (where I know much more). Crystalline silicon used to be way more expensive until the chinese essentially decided to kill all emerging solar technologies with state subsidies of capacity. That's what has changed the economics of thin film solar. Silicon is plentiful, but cystalline silicon is highly pure and more costly. I argued with Stan Williams (HP's nano guru) years ago about nano based solar. He insisted that the solution with be silicon based because it is so plentiful. I tend to believe absorption efficiency will drive the winning material system because installation costs depend upon required area which in turn depends upon conversion efficiency. BOP is significant portion of TCO. I'm more given toward CIGS than CdTe. And, I think the winning approach will truly be reel to reel. At that point, the economics will be far more compelling. I've been very involved with an organic solar company that is getting to the very high single digits, but significant breakthroughs are still needed to get those above 10% and lifetime still is likely to be problematic given installation costs. I think we'll get more creative over time using hybrid photo/thermal system (hot water and electricity) to gain leverage and improve economics. All I'm saying is that FSLR is in dangerous middling territory and highly vulnerable to a new CIGS R2R or similar approach that will have better LT economics. Have a great weekend Huck. Always enjoy your posts.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1352525429711</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 00:30:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352529745139-2</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN is DEAD MONEY.

I have inside knowledge (not inside information) from former GRPN salesmen that GRPN will be bankrupt within a year. They have no moat and the novelty is wearing off. Most discounts are on restaurants which will be negatively impacted by Obamacare. In fact, my favorite short is still CMG which will hit $80 and has Already outperformed AMZN on the downside. You are also wrong about INTC. I am a former INTC executive. The x86 franchise is in big trouble. The ARM is a superior processor. The only reason to stick with the x86 is Microsoft, And MSFT is talking about moving away from the x86. I still own some INTC but will br selling it on the Santa Claus rally. My favorite stock is AAPL, which might break to new highs Next Spring. I'll be selling that too if it does. The main reason the US is going into a recession is simply Lack of stimulus spending. Same thing happened after FDR got re-elected. I cant believe history is repeating, but it appears That so called conservatives dont understand economics. Balanced budgets do not stimulate the economy. Economic activity only happens when somebody produces something.</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1352539354987</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 04:22:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352552860391-5</Id><Title>markets gonna vote with its feet...black swan event</Title><Msg>so we know that at least some of the dividends and market gains are gonna be taxed, which just don't know how much and how many....either way, its not gonna be pretty. so if i know that Joe Hampton Mr. 1% is gonna sell, then i'm gonna sell before him, which causes others to sell as the market breaks thru supports.

I am a fraud. I tried shorting AMZN 5 times. Hit it big once and then gave it all back. I then turned bullish near the top but didnt act on it. I correctly concluded that there are far better stocks to short than AMZN. I own a huge portfolio of AAPL at 375 plus dividends. Havent sold any because AAPL is no where near my target price. Its short term oversold and due for a bounce. I havent lost (or made) a dime until i sell. I may never sell AAPL. Perhaps ill buy some CMG puts and if AAPL retraces to 350, buy more AAPL. Between 1966 (when Walt Disney died) DIS went up 10 times with a 50% correction along the way.

No ONE could be as bad as you are based upon all the calls you've made. You have a near 100% miss rate. The only ones you've gotten right, I've gotten right bigger and better. As to not knowing what I am doing, I'm up over 10X since fall 2009. Not many people can say that... And, I am extraordinarily well position for a huge gain over the next 12 months based upon the cycles that I've come to recognize. As to not knowing what I am doing... I outlined what would happen to NFLX with clarity well before it did -- the selection bias, the need to raise prices to handle content, the negative reaction, etc. I outlined all that would happen to GMCR -- gradual saturation, margin pressure from the shift in mix from proprietary to private label (even when manufacturing the KCups), etc). Most of you know I nailed slowing comp store sales and impact on future growth expansion from Cantina Bell on CMG. And, you will see that all my calls here on the inability to extract significant economic profit from the digital businesses (and thus the abject failure of the burning billions in cash on loss leading Kindle Fire platform) due to changing competitive set and competitive dynamics will prove true as well. An Intel executive? Seriously? Mid level? I know several of the higher level execs and have engaged with INTC on the cutting edge technology front for years... You seem to fail to appreciate the economic implications of being at 14nm trigate when others are working to get to 20nm, And, if you think Apple is going to risk its premium brand and price position by having TSMC manufacture a RISC architecture for MacBook line when the new INTC chips outperform on a power/performance basis (which is why INTC DOMINATES servers now and will make huge headway in mobile over the next 2 years), then you really don't get it. It is negotiation posturing... ARM had a huge lead in mobile because INTC focused purely on performance for too long. But, that dynamic is changing and fast (as servers show). Also, you seem to fail to understand what will become a growing domestic foundry thrust over the next decade (see articles on INTC as FPGA foundry). See Panetta's comments about the threat of certain foreign made telecommunications hardware. The threat is far more pervasive than that. The only domestic player with the real capacity to act as a secure foundry if from out friends at INTC, who have been investing in next gen capacity (the margin hit in Q4 is shuttering old faciities to upgrade to 14nm while demand is soft). Your hindsight is great. Your foresight is challenged... On GRPN, you got objective perspective from a laid off GRPN worker? Wow. Impressive. Again here, you simply do not get it. The economics of creating a marketplace for services are harder. The up front sales cost are significant, which is why FB, Living Social and Amazon have failed so miserably. Google MIGHT be able to clime that hurdle through economy of scope. But, GRPN dominates the local commerce, particularly service oriented niche. And, the customer maintenance cost structure is vastly different than the customer acquisition cost structure. Apple is the most dangerous of the great cash flow generating companies to hold. The margin threat as categories mature is very significant. Not only is there competition from Android phones (and MAYBE MSFT but I doubt it), there is a significantly reduced value proposition for upgrades once the first generation buyers saturates. My wife just switched from Android to Apple, but bought the 4S because the 5 just didn't offer anything materially better and she liked the smaller form factor. As such, FE earnings multiples are likely to overstate margins and profits. Enough for now... Good luck Edison. I don't operate on luck. And, I don't try to time the market. I invest on fundamentals. Time will prove me correct on AMZN, INTC and GRPN for that matter.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1352574678066</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 14:11:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352575635992-18</Id><Topic><Title>Tech, The worst thing about the whole "5K GRPN" thread is:</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1352567412949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 12:10:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybil: I've taken much worse over the past few years. You should have seen the vitriol on the GMCR board when I predicted EVERYTHING that happened from 110... Usually, its on the short side, but I tend to play for the future both long and short. Because most people do not use rigor and analyze forward looking drivers of business performance, all those who cannot think about next week let alone a year out (99% of human beings these days) mock me and talk smack for the short term. But, whether it takes 6 months or a year, my predictions come true and I eventually make plenty of money. There's a reason FB, AMZN and even Google have struggled to make a dent in GRPN's business. The first moving does have an advantage here. It has developed the consumer value proposition of deal density by metro to have attracted nearly 40MM users. It has density in major metros to really make the Groupon Now / location based targeted real time deals work. Now one else does, nor will they (Amazon sure as hell cannot afford the sales investment to make it happen since its cash flow is increasingly challenged) except for possibly Google, but candidly Google would be better off buying Amazon at these prices (or double them) than building it. GRPN is worth more to Google today than when it was willing to pay over $7B because the merchant base and user base have grown so much. So, everyone talk your smack. I see not what is, but what will evolve. Groupon is dominant in a local market niche that others will find remarkably difficult to serve. Groupon's economics will improve over time as merchants become more familiar and integrated into the platform and require less sales/customer service support. The terms of the deal (discount and revenue split) can and will evolve over time and can be managed to make it even harder for anyone else to gain a foothold.
