One, this economy is so so bad for the man and woman without a job. Also the rich and the well off upper class obviously fail to see and have no idea how bad it is getting for those that were considered middle class that are now classified as "the new poor" so many people are new to his category and those well off with 10 25,000 limit credit cards pulling in 150,000 or more a year as a couple just would not believe it if you told them that their disposable income they spend on fun and entertainment, going out to restaurants etc is what this new poor that was the old middle class makes all year long. Amazon is positioned perfect for the new economy that even if it does not get worse and worse, the gap between the well off and the poor struggling to make it will become more and more obvious as many are hanging on by a thread with those credit cards they are running in a circle to get shut off soon. Notwithstanding all these new issues and developments Amazon is going to blow this quarter out of the water as well as the next one. Quite serious I am when I say 1 short of squeeze to 300 and another not long after to 360 area. Amazon is the new Wal Mart, anyone that has seen their new warehouses up close understands where all that research and development money went, and it was wisely spent when 90% of the time with companies Amazons size it is not. I cannot repeat cannot wait for earnings regardless of what the market is doing as a whole. Some of that money coming out of Apple today was going into Amazon. You will see more of the same the rest of the week and the next couple after that. Netflix missed today but would not have gotten whacked quite as hard as it did, for one simple problem they must deal with. Direct competition with Amazon. Netflix should come back pretty quick, globally they are doing better.</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1351055757400</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 01:15:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351062628457-2</Id><Title>Just remember to sell the RIPS, CNBC GRASSO and his friends still need to sell .

Particularly revenue from per unit licensees continued to erode because handset vendors in Japan, along with RIM, and HTC continued to lose market share to Samsung and Apple. Samsung and Apple are both fixed-term licensees where revenue streams are unaffected by volumes. OUTLOOK SHOULD BE SOLID We believe that due to the timing of asset sales, as well as license renewals and outcomes of litigation, that quarterly results are difficult to forecast. However, we should continue to see an annualized trend towards growth through licensing, partnerships, and asset sales. This is reflected in our sum-of-the-parts analysis below. Our estimate of cash includes our estimate incremental cash that resulted from the sale of the patents to Intel. We reiterate our BUY recommendation and our 12-month share price target of $45.00. Our estimate excludes licensing revenue from Nokia, Huawei, ZTE, and LG, which are all involved in litigation with Interdigital currently. Yesterday's the stock closed with a gain of 5% in the after hours trading.

(Delusional, deranged, lunatic . . . etc.)" A little clarification: Sybil has some paper profit now, so to her, any upside moves (to a limit) means losing part of that paper profit. Techstrategy is still in the red (could be near breaking-even) with AMZN short position after waiting fro months. His INTC long position is down about 50% (or more) in a little over one month. When he was still "sure" that going long INTC (through calls) was a sure bet, he was calling Intel the best manufacturer in the whole world. Now that he lost about 50% of what he's put into it, he calls his long position on INTC a "relatively" small one. Ex.goldbug has been down with all of his AMZN shorts on average over the years. Sometimes, he lucks out and "win" small amounts but on average over the years deeply in the red.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1351075748495</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 06:49:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351076439816-8</Id><Topic><Title>countijng my money for tomorrow and earning right now!</Title><Username>beauty90210211</Username><Timestamp>1351023198523</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 16:13:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" also figure that if Best Buy, Walmart, and Target are all price matching/kicking out the Kindle--that's a pretty fair assumption that AMZN is making an impact on their bottom line" son what you are describing is a price war.

However AMZN as a company is not in a good position and its current valuation means it's priced for perfection and beyond!!. Sooner or later the wall street favor will disappear and this stock will drop faster than NFLX did a year or so ago. I'm still wondering why wall street favors this overvalued internet retailer that basically throws its hands into every tech "buzzword" industry, but never really makes any money. Wall street slams AAPL because the iPad sales @ 15 million this quarter may be lower than estimates, but they praise AMZN for saying the Kindle Fire is the best selling item on the AMZN website but never mentions how many Kindles were actually sold. Amazing how the talking heads and analyst never say anything negative about AMZN even though its the most overvalued company in the market with no chance of living up to the hype!</Msg><Username>wuwuwu3</Username><Timestamp>1351084320672</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 09:12:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351085617140-21</Id><Title>Strange stock . . .</Title><Msg>I love this stock.

Instruction Regarding The Disney-Google Agreement Members of the jury, yesterday you heard counsel for Defendants ask Dr. Becker a number of questions during cross-examination regarding a patent license agreement between Disney and Google. Defendants were trying to establish that the technology of the DisneyGoogle Agreement is comparable to the technology of the patents-in-suit that I/P Engine is asserting against Google and the other defendants. The Court has ruled that the technology of the Disney-Google Agreement is not comparable to the technology of the patents-in-suit. As a result, the Court instructed you to disregard all testimony regarding the Disney-Google Agreement. You may not consider that agreement, or the amount of that agreement, for any purpose, including trying to determine what the appropriate royalty should be in this case. I want to emphasize that my instruction to you on this matter is in no way a reflection that Dr. Becker did anything improper. During his direct examination, Dr. Becker testified that he was not relying on the Disney-Google agreement because there is no evidence that the Disney technology is relevant to any issue in this case the questions of Defense counsel regarding the Case 2:11-cv-00512-RAJ-TEM Document 740-1 Filed 10/24/12 Page 1 of 2 PageID# 160891 Disney-Google agreement were improper. The Court has therefore ruled that any evidence regarding the Disney technology is improper and irrelevant. 2. Instruction Regarding Discovery of Google’s Financial Information You also heard counsel for Defendants ask Dr. Becker questions regarding whether he had asked counsel for I/P Engine for further documents or information to support his opinions regarding his apportionment, or whether there was a final version of PX 64, the Revenue Force document. After reviewing the record on this matter, the Court has found that counsel for I/P Engine had requested those documents and information from Google, but that Google did not produce to I/P Engine a final version of the Revenue Force document, PX 64, or any documents providing the numerical support for the slides on page 38 of that document. I instruct you that you may conclude, based upon the cross-examination questions asked of Dr. Becker by Defendants’ counsel, that Google had additional documents and information that, had they been produced, would have provided further support to Dr. Becker’s opinions regarding his apportionment.

Admittedly, I have been TERRIBLE at picking AMZN moves. My position is mostly based in weekly 235 and 240 calls as an earnings play. I know multiple vendors vendors on AMZN who are growing at clips of 50-100% qtr over qtr--Q3 2012 being the most dynamic. I also know AMZN has instituted large marketing allowances and chargebacks that go directly to their own bottom--they are just a much savvier retailer than they were a year ago. I also know the chatter in my own industry is that you must deal with AMZN now and that's different than a year ago. I also feel that UPS's earnings are a good indicator that AMZN momentum is still VERY strong. I find it so very hard to belive that AMZN has an inferior model to brick and mortar. I do belive tomorrow will be a big beat, but I'm in the minority...we'll see...unfotunately, I'm a businessman and not an analyst.</Msg><Username>beauty90210211</Username><Timestamp>1351106088299</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:14:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351106098436-131</Id><Title>P/E of Amazon = 280.

This drop is due to massive increased competition in their two highest margin areas: AWS (comp from IBM and Google), and eBook sales (from awesome new Apple iPad mini). Amazon price already had next 5+ years of rev growth and EPS baked in (forward P/E 100 on CY13 consesus earnings). The big money is realizing that they cannot achieve the rediculous 5yr numbers (adding $200B of new revenue) with the compeititon they now have. Even if this stock gets a little bump from Q3 earnings, it will move down to a P/E of 30-40 over time ($2.40 CY13 EPS x 40 P/E= $96).</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1351107521654</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:38:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351107646004-154</Id><Topic><Title>Bought some calls.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1351105723509</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:08:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Both calls and puts are very expensive.

Amazon is to be stripped of its huge tax advantage on the sales of electronic books after the European commission ordered Luxembourg to close a VAT loophole. Amazon is registered as a Luxembourg company and pays that country's VAT charge of 3% when it sells an ebook to a British reader, rather than the 20% it would have to charge if it were UK-based. The Guardian revealed this week that Amazon is forcing British publishers to cover the cost of a 20% VAT charge on ebook sales even though the true VAT cost to the online retailer is a fraction of that. The European commission – which oversees European Union law as the EU's executive arm – on Wednesday gave Luxembourg 30 days to increase its VAT rate on digital services from 3% to 15%. This will close a tax loophole that has encouraged companies such as Amazon, Skype and Netflix to be based in Luxembourg to benefit from the 3% rate when selling throughout the EU. Luxembourg must agree to change its VAT rate before the end of November, or face being referred to the European court of justice and risk fines. France has also been issued with a similar warning over its 7% rate for digital services. Amazon is expected to contest the commission ruling, so there will be no immediate impact on the cost of ebooks bought from its UK website. Luxembourg, with the lowest standard VAT rate in Europe, has been successful at attracting many global e-services providers. Under EU rules these companies are able to charge consumers across the EU the reduced Luxembourg VAT rate for these services. The home state of the consumer who makes the purchase receives no tax revenues. Charging ebooks at the 3% rate gives firms such as Amazon a huge competitive advantage over UK ebook retailers, which have to charge the local rate. The commission issued infringement proceedings in July against Luxembourg and France on the grounds that their policy was incompatible with EU law. The next step, a reasoned opinion, was published on Wednesday. Luxembourg and France will rely on the defence that there is an anomaly in EU VAT law which allows paper books and newspapers, for instance, to be charged at a reduced VAT rate; but digital must be charged at the standard, higher rate of the country in which the company is based. The commission, which is being pressured by national online booksellers which lose out to Amazon's better margins on digital sales will demand that member states cannot act alone and must seek unanimity amongst all 27 states. Richard Asquith, Global Head of VAT, TMF Group, the indirect tax consultancy, said: "Countries across the EU have been breaking ranks by charging cut-rate VAT on services sold across borders. Luxembourg's move at the start of 2012 to cut its ebook rate to only 3% to help attract and retain the media industry has been copied by France, and I expect Belgium to do the same. The UK has held out at the full 20% VAT rate, which has a detrimental impact on the UK industry. The EC's move will seek to end these anomalies and tax competition amongst member states, and comes under pressure from member states' ministers of finance."</Msg><Username>greencarbelgium</Username><Timestamp>1351124450161</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 20:20:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351124595168-220</Id><Title>Amazon to lose all margins in Europe - read this confirmed by Financial Times</Title><Msg>Amazon is to be stripped of its huge tax advantage on the sales of electronic books after the European commission ordered Luxembourg to close a VAT loophole.

Oct 15, 2011 10:38 AM . Permalink Bruce: I have 3 long positions AAPL, GOOG and NSPH. I had until recently (and will probably reestablish) long positions in INTC and CSCO. They are all best of breed globally dominant players with vast cash holdings, except NSPH. NSPH is a speculative play that I think has potential for a 5-10x return over the next 2-3 years. It is trading for less than net cash despite having FDA approved moderate complexity point of care diagnostic devices and will have the results of its FAST TRAC clinical trial for ultrasensitive troponin well within its current cash holdings. There are no ultrasensitive diagnostics that run on moderate complexity (think point of care that can be run by technicians, instead of doctors and scientists) today. Ultrasensitive troponin alone has the potenital to reduce millions of overnight stays in the ER from chest pains by ruling out heart attack more rapidly, could save insurers billions and would take NSPH's market cap from a mere $50MM despite its 50MM in cash to something many multiples higher. It is spedulative and could go to zero, but it also could become a multibillion globally dominant diagnostic company as the approvals come in. I like that risk/reward... In the mobile/semi space, right now I hold only AAPL and GOOG because they are the two winners in the global mobile secular trend. Both will win, although right now AAPL is winning more than GOOG. Longer term, I expect that to reverse (look up UltraViolet and you'll get a sense as to why). Either way, they are some of the fastest growing companies on the earth, trading at insanely low multiples and even if/when they stumble in the core business, the will have so much cash that they can completely reinvent themselves. Both are very smart about acquisitions (YouTube is now becoming a huge rev center for display and will be the nexus of GOOG's content play), despite everyone attacking that. DoubleClick has paid off. There's no numbers on AdMob, but I have a pretty good idea that is part of why GOOG is constantly destroying estimates... MMI will be the same. GOOG's people know their business better than Wall Street does, but Wall Street wants to believe differently... I don't really see it is a three horse race. AMZN has 1 retail channel (okay BBUY and a few others will sell the Fire as well) and 1 manufacturer, starting from zero. Apple has many retailers and is starting with hundreds of millions of iDevices sold annually. GOOG has virtually all other manufacturers and hundreds of retailers and hundreds of millions of devices per year. AMZN is actually way late to the party. It didn't recognize and respond to the tablet/storefront threat nearly soon enough. AMZN's e-book business is likely to lose share as iDevices (particularly iPads) and Android tablets boon (GOOG Books storefront will grow over the next 2 years as well). Sure, AMZN will be the leader here, but fighting to defend your core doesn't lead to 110 (150 on a 2007 basis) multiple. At the very least, diversify. Better yet, overweight toward AAPL and GOOG. You will thank me within 1 year.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1351128067504</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 21:21:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351128149881-226</Id><Topic><Title>earning surprise ?</Title><Username>rimm_dn</Username><Timestamp>1351124808354</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 20:26:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have absolutely no confidence what will happen after er or i will be happy man.
