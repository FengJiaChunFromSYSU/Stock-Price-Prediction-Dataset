It is about the only explanation for something so inane. Amazon makes most of its money from high value density electronic goods. Not building materials and not groceries. All the free Prime shipping of low value density goods (including the above) will crush its economics. But buy. Please buy so the institutional longs that manage 401Ks (including for those people just devastated in the storm) can sell even more at these insane prices. If you are buying this stock up here, you obviously do not need or care for money, so better that it be transferred to a 401K holder that might use it to survive "voluntary" early retirement.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1351948455808</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 09:14:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351949097981-3</Id><Title>who would have thought the earningless one,AMZN would hold up better than AAPL? the one with all the money?</Title><Msg>holding 2000 PE stocks in favoer of the one that has a ton of cash from making a boatload of money in the last 4 year bull market. Things must be so great for AMZN ahead for it to grab invesotrs attention here at the expense of real money makers. Earnings for AMZN now have to be great in the future just to bring the multiple back toward 100 now. That's mind boggling to see AAPL break though it's 200 dma while AMZN, making no money with high imagination hold up well above it's 200 dma. Imagination stocks trumping strong balance sheet stocks. I'm not surprised to see AAPL have a big correction or even go into a bear market. But I am surprised to see AMZN act like it's a utility stock/dividend payer making big money when it's more valued like a high flying 2000 Peak stock here. Very strange indeed. Even yesterday, there's absolutley no backing to Oppenheimer's bullish arguement on AMZN at these levels that don't reek of letting clients get out of the stock. You'd expect AMZN to have to play catcup when it's PE went over 100, then 200, then 300, now it's over 2000 and earnings going toward 0. Where's the earnings model to make money as they are investing? They should still be making money as they Capitalize investments like other growing businesses? This argues to a questionable earnings model that no analyst ever mentions. Einhorn was the only one who has come close to that point when he called AMZN a riddle: which would make Bezos a snake oil salesman, no matter what his so-called genius is. His genius is having WS help to pump/keep this story at a huge mutliple , while their earnings have gone into the dump and stocks that make real money and pay shareholders in cash have gotton dumped. That's his big genius. Doesn' have to end like Enron but still be a huge orchaestrated, speclativley built , bubble. Notce the Oppenheimer pump a few days after the huge run on losing over 60 cents after the earnings release. In other words, a heavily supported WS scam of crap. There lies 5 days of Bezos genius to get that kind of paper support of crap. Supporting crap values to the max again on the future promise of earnings. Seems funds could be used for so much wiser things right now.</Msg><Username>mets41us</Username><Timestamp>1351949097981</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 09:24:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351951971426-4</Id><Title>AMZN will test the lows achieved in after hours after the earnings release.</Title><Msg>206?

Almost all the trades are for 100. On a very rare occasion do you get anything over 500. Institutions are holders of over 70 percent of the stock and the float is very low. this is why even with bad/awful/dreadful/non earnings they can push the thing up with no problem at all. Next thing to remember is they are all trapped. None of them want to hit the big sell orders for absolute fear that the whole thing comes crashing in without even unloading much at all. You can see drops of 50 points a day if anyone decides to hit the exit. Rest assure that when funds need money on the big market sell off AMZN will have to be sold. First one to hit the sell will be black balled for causing the others to get sacked. HOwever 2nd thru the sell door is watching very closely for ANY large Block sell orders. A 100 point down day is coming as soon as the 1st trading desks cracks. Black Rock Goldman Morgan Knight take your pick. I bet first one out is Morgan. They have other issues that will force them to be the first to raise cash....</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1351961045663</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 12:44:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351961378882-10</Id><Topic><Title>Coinmaker--no need to post every 5 minutes--also tell GiGi.

Fewer sales mean less money lost if items are sold at a loss. Once power is on - more sales is bullish since since sales will increase. 2770 PE is just the start. With Christmas sales and sales taxes it is very bullish since PE can now expand to 4590. Rising gas prices is also bullish since people with no money for basic living will not want to travel to buy a razor and can simply order on line and the cost of shipping will add to AMZN costs. AMZN is hiring more seasonal help to see which is more expensive robots or human help.</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1351978986427</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 17:43:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351980233069-14</Id><Title>PE ratio is only 2,800 LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>LOL 2,800 PE RATIO!

If They do recover they will sell more product and have higher sales. If the people can not afford to go out and buy stuff since they are under water, they can order on AMZN and not have to drive to get their stuff. AMZN is hiring more help for the holidays to see if robots are less expensive then human help. they can count the additional costs as a positive and have a PE of 4567. Since the higher the PE the more support for the stock it can rise. Paying taxes is also bullish since it will obviously be seen as a plus by customers who are patriotic. Thus having a positive spin. If Christmas is too competitive or sales are off they can simply buy another ware house to show future expansion is coming. As for the cloud sales the outage on the east coast can only be bullish for AMZN since IBM is located in NYS and is new to this cloud stuff. New entrance into the cloud space only means more people will want AMZN since they start with the letter "A" in the phone book. They can also buy the yellow pages and simply eliminate the competition. If your PE is currently 2750 you must be doing something right since everyone is selling APPL at a 13 PE and holding AMZN. Those who own it must know something about clouds since their heads are in it.</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1351980377214</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:06:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351980698337-16</Id><Topic><Title>Coinmaker--no need to post every 5 minutes--also tell GiGi.
