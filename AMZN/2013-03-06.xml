The value of a company should reflect the discounted value of all future cash flows. Looking at a highly volatile ST move in oil prices lower (despite your best attempts) means nothing to the expected value of gasoline prices that should be used in a rigorous bottom up model by investors. Gasoline prices, outside of the great recession, has been systematically increasing for a decade. Absent another great recession, they will continue their inexorable rise upward, and Amazon's competitiveness will decline. A few day drop which brings us part of the way back to where prices were but a month ago solves nothing. In fact, through the first two months of this quarter, Amazon will have results reflecting gas prices that have never been higher for the YOY comp. Institutional longs can choose to put their head in the ground and be completely negligent with others' money by blindly holding or worse yet, accumulating. Or, they can recognize this as the biggest bubble in the market today and use this as currency to buy stocks that are not in a bubble (those that keep the market multiple low enough for the talking heads on CNBC to continue arguing the case that the market is cheap).</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362578449877</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 09:00:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362578970103-16</Id><Topic><Title>$284 will be tested today.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1362577608303</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 08:46:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are predicting a blow off top today?</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362578970103</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 09:09:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362578978705-17</Id><Title>we are in for a retest... very likely</Title><Msg>I wanted to tell you that I am really thrilled with the great job this site is doing with there service.

Yes, I believe the market should function to allocate capital to productive enterprise, not exist as a skimming operation for certain institutions to tax the investing public and, in the process, amplify the malinvestment enabled by the Fed... In time, it will revert to reality.

It is BS and will not work. 10% of the people control roughly 80% of the financial assets. Thus, the market cannot sustain consumption. And, as soon as it stops going up, the psychological lift falters and any benefit is lost. No, the channel through which POMO is supporting the stock market is not via the impact on fundamentals via a confident consumer. It is a direct transfer to the MM and is being used to kill volatility and create the appearance of safety, so that the TBTF institutions can unload via the upper deck (with the help of the quants).

Amazon does not pay returns to the investors, so Amazon can't be a ponzi scheme. Amazon does not receive money from investors, so Amazon can't be a ponzi scheme. Amazon is a company that actually does stuff, for example I buy from them regularly, so Amazon can't be a ponzi scheme.

I wouldn't be surprised to learn that virtually all companies don't make any money at all. Ever. The government doesn't mind that because, at least all companies, whether they make money or not, employ people so that they and their families can be fed without help from the welfare system.

I am but one who recognizes the profound and permanent damage that is being done to our markets by these predatory moves. I've been wrong short term, just as I was with NFLX, GMCR and CMG. But, ultimately, I was proved correct there and will be here as well... The difference Nas is that I am risking my own money. Not taking massive risk with other people's money in a speculative greater fool play. There is no scenario where Amazon is anything but a bubble. Best case, AAPL is used as cash to support this for another quarter before the rush to the exits. Smart money will get out before that (and before earnings) because the valuation gap is simply too large to sustain. I do hope the new SEC/FBI team nails the folks behind this. And, I will certainly do what I can to assist any investigation that were ever to arise. These games destroy trust in the market (I know plenty of AAPL shareholders who are #$%$ right now... and are pulling money from the market). See the latest retail flows... That is the collateral damage caused by these games. They add no value. They are simply glorified theft. When something creates no value but extract much, it eventually craters or incites a major backlash.

Maybe in November 2011 when it had the jolt of 247 and bottomed at 166.97 but not since. Just wondering. Very tough to play the put game in AMZN on the purchase side.

But, the Fed's balance sheet expansion does not render all securities laws null and void... BTW, I haven't said this is illegal. I have said it is wildly predatory and destroys trust in the market to have AAPL systematically crushed while MOMO float jam scams fly. I have also said I would love to see the FBI/SEC take a good hard look at the AAPL/AMZN trade made here. I suspect that Nanex, armed with the consolidated feed on both the underlying and options, could demonstrate purposeful manipulation. In the end, I doubt there will be any legal action. I expect the bubble to burst because the math doesn't work and this is simply a greater fool play.

The technical guy said he did not like either company up here. Then he said if he had to pick a company on just the technicals he would take AMZN. The fundamental guy said GOOG and the technical guy agreed it's a better company. Technically I'm sure AMZN looks better since it has been consolidating in this same zone for a while and earnings won't be announced for a while but those usually don't matter either because the sell side analysts will make up a new metric as a reason to raise the price target even if sales come in closer to $15B vs. the current analyst estimate of $16.2B. They tend to not kill the golden gooses like AMZN. Now on a relative basis if you asked me to pick between AMZN here or CRM or NFLX right now I would take AMZN but fundamentally I don't like any of them. Good luck.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1362608214582</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 17:16:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362608411556-150</Id><Topic><Title>CNBC...</Title><Username>cybercash28</Username><Timestamp>1362602249823</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 15:37:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From a fundamental POV, it isn't close.
