It’s not a popular rumor, but it’s an interesting one none the less. People might dismiss this as crazy, but it’s not. If there was an Amazon brick and mortar store close to you that just opened today, would you go to it? I mean would you go to it today? If there was a Best Buy store that opened close to you today, would you rush to go to that? I think most people would answer yes to the first question and no to the second. Amazon is fresh, Best Buy is stale. I think if people had an Amazon store next to them it would be wildly popular. It just has a different feel to it. Amazon is in the process of building more distribution centers throughout the US. The company will open 18 new ones this year, including $130 million for new facilities in New Jersey, $135 million for two new centers in Virginia, $200 million for Texas distribution centers, $150 million in Indiana and another $150 million in Tennessee. The reason the company is doing this is because they are trying to roll out same day shipping, and to make this work it must have these distribution centers close to every major market. Now that Amazon is going to start collecting sales tax in many states, it might just consider purchasing Best Buy instead. With over 1,000 stores in the US, Best Buy would give Amazon all the distribution it needed to make same day delivery economical, or maybe I should say possible. This isn’t about same day delivery though. Amazon has thought about opening a brick and mortar store before. In fact, the company is rumored to be opening a small retail store in Seattle later this year. It will be like Apple stores, and only focus on selling pricier merchandise such as tablet computers. It’s a test run to see how profitable a venture like this could be. But it would be profitable, I don’t see why it wouldn’t. As I said, I think people would visit an Amazon store, whether it’s a small-scale Apple like store or a big box Best Buy like store. The Amazon name, reputation, and pricing is what will attract customers.</Msg><Username>soma022</Username><Timestamp>1349203983288</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:53:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349204026765-71</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon To Purchase Best Buy?</Title><Username>soma022</Username><Timestamp>1349203983288</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:53:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whether Amazon test the waters first on a smaller scale is still a question. After all, buying up the largest brick and mortar electronics retailer isn’t without risk. While I do think it would work, you have to wonder if Amazon really needs to do this. It would be a big change to their current business model, as the company would now have direct contact with its customers, rather than just an internet presence. This is a major issue that the company must consider when entering the brick and mortar space. The Amazon brand is well respected, that must be a major focus if the company does expand outside of the internet. Look at how Best Buy has tarnished as a brand due to unsatisfied customers. And Amazon might consider Best Buy a tarnished brand, even though the Best Buy name would disappear if Amazon bought it. Amazon could just replicate what Best Buy currently has right now, and that way it could avoid all association with it. But that wouldn’t be a good idea. If Amazon is going to enter the brick and mortar space in a big way, it would be beneficial if it didn’t have to compete with Best Buy in the process. You buy them out, you get rid of your biggest competitor. I don’t like to admit this as a consumer, but imagine how Amazon’s margins would improve because of this. Amazon has the lowest prices, everybody knows that, but with Best Buy not around anymore, it would allow Amazon to raise prices slightly on some merchandise. Not drastic enough to scare away shoppers, but enough to make an impact to the bottom line. I don’t know which direction Amazon is going to go. I could make an argument for all of them. If the company opened up small stores like Apple has, and just focused on selling the Kindle Fire and other merchandise, then that wouldn’t be a risky or costly move for the company. It probably wouldn’t make a big impact though in terms of sales. If Amazon wants to just build all of these distribution centers in order to offer same day delivery, but not expand into the brick and mortar space, well that would work to. It’s a costly endeavour, but the risk seem fairly low. However, you still have direct competition with Best Buy. If Amazon wants to get rid of its biggest competitor, then a buyout of Best Buy would open up many doors for the company. Sales would increase dramatically, but so would the risk associated with those increased sales. It’s a tough decision, one in which I’m sure Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos has thought about many times.</Msg><Username>soma022</Username><Timestamp>1349204026765</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:53:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349204891119-72</Id><Topic><Title>Down for no reason!</Title><Username>wingofeaglets</Username><Timestamp>1349203038523</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:37:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even Apple and Google cannot keep going up.

Sergey Aleynikov, an ex-Goldman Sachs computer programmer, was arrested July 3 after arriving at Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. officials said. Aleynikov, 39, who has dual American and Russian citizenship, is charged in a criminal complaint with stealing the trading software. Teza Technologies LLC, a Chicago-based firm co-founded by a former Citadel Investment Group LLC trader, said it suspended Aleynikov, who started there on July 2. At a court appearance July 4 in Manhattan, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti told a federal judge that Aleynikov’s alleged theft poses a risk to U.S. markets. Aleynikov transferred the code, which is worth millions of dollars, to a computer server in Germany, and others may have had access to it, Facciponti said, adding that New York-based Goldman Sachs may be harmed if the software is disseminated. “The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways,” Facciponti said, according to a recording of the hearing made public today. “The copy in Germany is still out there, and we at this time do not know who else has access to it.” ‘Preposterous’ The prosecutor added, “Once it is out there, anybody will be able to use this, and their market share will be adversely affected.” The proprietary code lets the firm do “sophisticated, high- speed and high-volume trades on various stock and commodities markets,” prosecutors said in court papers. The trades generate “many millions of dollars” each year. Defense attorney Sabrina Shroff said in court that the government’s allegations are “preposterous.” The firm was aware that Aleynikov, who is the father of three young girls, was downloading programs to his personal computer to do work at home and that he hasn’t disseminated the code, the lawyer said. “If Goldman Sachs cannot possibly protect this kind of proprietary information that the government wants you to think is worth the entire United States market, one has to question how they plan to accommodate every other breach,” she said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. $750,000 Bail U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Fox ordered Aleynikov, who earned $400,000 a year, to be held by on $750,000 bail, after prosecutors claimed he posed a threat to the community. Aleynikov planned to earn three times his salary by joining a startup company and engaging in high-volume automated trading, prosecutors said. Aleynikov posted bail today and was released. Aleynikov didn’t speak at the hearing, except to say that he understood the conditions of his bail. Teza, co-founded by former Citadel trader Misha Malyshev, said in an e-mailed statement that it first learned of the allegations on July 5 and suspended Aleynikov without pay following an investigation. The firm “was not aware of the alleged misconduct” and offered to cooperate with the government, according to the statement. Reverse Engineering “Someone stealing that code is basically stealing the way that Goldman Sachs makes money in the equity marketplace,” said Larry Tabb, founder of TABB Group, a financial-market research and advisory firm. “The more sophisticated market makers -- and Goldman is one of them -- spend significant amounts of money developing software that’s extremely fast and can analyze different execution strategies so they can be the first one to make a decision.” Someone could use the code “to implement the same strategies and maybe on certain stocks they can be faster and, in effect, take away money that would normally be Goldman’s,” Tabb said today in a phone interview. “The second thing that they can do is actually analyze the code so that they know what Goldman’s going to do before Goldman does it and kind of reverse engineer Goldman’s strategies and make money basically at the expense of Goldman.” ‘Wake-Up Call’ Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said proprietary electronic data poses significant risks for all financial institutions. “This is a wake-up call to all financial institutions to review their security systems, not just with respect to trading codes, but with respect to all proprietary information,” said Pitt, now chief executive officer of Kalorama Partners LLC in Washington. Goldman appeared to have taken some steps to prevent the theft of its code, Pitt said. “The real question is whether, in light of this outrageous conduct on the part of one of its employees, it should have taken more steps,” Pitt said. Aleynikov spent four hours with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent after his July 3 arrest, Shroff said. He told the agent that he’d done nothing wrong, authorized prosecutors to seize his personal computers, and said he hadn’t known the server he was using was in Germany, she said. 32 Megabits Only 32 of 1,024 megabits of the software code was transferred, Shroff said. “It is not disseminated,” she said of the code. Facciponti said at the hearing that Aleynikov could disseminate the code “in 10 minutes” using a cell phone. Once the government obtains access to the German server, prosecutors will see if Aleynikov transferred other confidential data as well, he said. It’s logical to conclude that Aleynikov planned to use the code at his new company, the prosecutor said. “This is the most substantial theft that the bank can remember ever happening to it, in the sense the entire platform has been taken from it,” Facciponti said. “There has been no breaches anywhere on this magnitude at the bank.” Aleynikov worked at Goldman from 2007 until June, the government said in the complaint. He was part of a team of workers responsible for improving the computer platform. His alleged transfer of computer codes ran from June 1 to June 5, according to prosecutors. Moscow, Rutgers Aleynikov studied applied mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Transportation Engineering before transferring to Rutgers University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 1993 and a master’s of science degree, specializing in medical image processing and neural networks, in 1996, according to his profile on the social-networking site LinkedIn. Before joining Goldman Sachs, he worked for about eight years at IDT Corp., the U.S. vendor of prepaid calling cards, where he led the team responsible for developing routing systems, according to the profile. His profile on LinkedIn describes him as a vice president in equity strategy at Goldman Sachs and includes two recommendations from colleagues at the firm. Goldman Profit Goldman was the world’s biggest and most profitable securities firm until it converted to a bank in September following the bankruptcy of smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman earned $2.3 billion last year, down from a record $11.6 billion in 2007, as market turmoil caused it to report a fourth-quarter loss, its first in a decade as a public company. Goldman’s equities business generated $2 billion of revenue in the first three months of 2009, down 20 percent from the first quarter of 2008, the company reported in April. Second-quarter results are due to be reported next week. Goldman rose $2.97, or 2.1 percent, to $146.46 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

A number of crimes committed by organized groups are done so for the purposes of financial gain. This is called racketeering, which is a felony crime. Characteristics of Organized Crime Groups Organized crime offenses vary greatly, but, there are some generalizations that apply to the groups as a whole. They are all developed based on a hierarchy of power and importance associated with the individuals in the group. They are stable organizations that usually exist over very long periods of time. They may use violence to defend the interests of the group. They usually have political or social protection that keeps them safe from retaliation from the surrounding community, including law enforcement. Their purpose is to accumulate capital which is then reinvested into the operations and businesses run by the group. The majority of organized crime groups operate behind the mask of legitimate businesses. In some cases, their racketeering practices involve the bribery and manipulation of legitimate business owners or public officials. This prevents their racketeering practices from being detected.

Aleynikov, 39, who has dual American and Russian citizenship, is charged in a criminal complaint with stealing the trading software. Teza Technologies LLC, a Chicago-based firm co-founded by a former Citadel Investment Group LLC trader, said it suspended Aleynikov, who started there on July 2. At a court appearance July 4 in Manhattan, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti told a federal judge that Aleynikov’s alleged theft poses a risk to U.S. markets. Aleynikov transferred the code, which is worth millions of dollars, to a computer server in Germany, and others may have had access to it, Facciponti said, adding that New York-based Goldman Sachs may be harmed if the software is disseminated. “The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways,” Facciponti said, according to a recording of the hearing made public today. “The copy in Germany is still out there, and we at this time do not know who else has access to it.” ‘Preposterous’ The prosecutor added, “Once it is out there, anybody will be able to use this, and their market share will be adversely affected.” The proprietary code lets the firm do “sophisticated, high- speed and high-volume trades on various stock and commodities markets,” prosecutors said in court papers. The trades generate “many millions of dollars” each year. Defense attorney Sabrina Shroff said in court that the government’s allegations are “preposterous.” The firm was aware that Aleynikov, who is the father of three young girls, was downloading programs to his personal computer to do work at home and that he hasn’t disseminated the code, the lawyer said. “If Goldman Sachs cannot possibly protect this kind of proprietary information that the government wants you to think is worth the entire United States market, one has to question how they plan to accommodate every other breach,” she said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. $750,000 Bail U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Fox ordered Aleynikov, who earned $400,000 a year, to be held by on $750,000 bail, after prosecutors claimed he posed a threat to the community. Aleynikov planned to earn three times his salary by joining a startup company and engaging in high-volume automated trading, prosecutors said. Aleynikov posted bail today and was released. Aleynikov didn’t speak at the hearing, except to say that he understood the conditions of his bail. Teza, co-founded by former Citadel trader Misha Malyshev, said in an e-mailed statement that it first learned of the allegations on July 5 and suspended Aleynikov without pay following an investigation. The firm “was not aware of the alleged misconduct” and offered to cooperate with the government, according to the statement. Reverse Engineering “Someone stealing that code is basically stealing the way that Goldman Sachs makes money in the equity marketplace,” said Larry Tabb, founder of TABB Group, a financial-market research and advisory firm. “The more sophisticated market makers -- and Goldman is one of them -- spend significant amounts of money developing software that’s extremely fast and can analyze different execution strategies so they can be the first one to make a decision.” Someone could use the code “to implement the same strategies and maybe on certain stocks they can be faster and, in effect, take away money that would normally be Goldman’s,” Tabb said today in a phone interview. “The second thing that they can do is actually analyze the code so that they know what Goldman’s going to do before Goldman does it and kind of reverse engineer Goldman’s strategies and make money basically at the expense of Goldman.” ‘Wake-Up Call’ Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said proprietary electronic data poses significant risks for all financial institutions. “This is a wake-up call to all financial institutions to review their security systems, not just with respect to trading codes, but with respect to all proprietary information,” said Pitt, now chief executive officer of Kalorama Partners LLC in Washington. Goldman appeared to have taken some steps to prevent the theft of its code, Pitt said. “The real question is whether, in light of this outrageous conduct on the part of one of its employees, it should have taken more steps,” Pitt said. Aleynikov spent four hours with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent after his July 3 arrest, Shroff said. He told the agent that he’d done nothing wrong, authorized prosecutors to seize his personal computers, and said he hadn’t known the server he was using was in Germany, she said. 32 Megabits Only 32 of 1,024 megabits of the software code was transferred, Shroff said. “It is not disseminated,” she said of the code. Facciponti said at the hearing that Aleynikov could disseminate the code “in 10 minutes” using a cell phone. Once the government obtains access to the German server, prosecutors will see if Aleynikov transferred other confidential data as well, he said. It’s logical to conclude that Aleynikov planned to use the code at his new company, the prosecutor said. “This is the most substantial theft that the bank can remember ever happening to it, in the sense the entire platform has been taken from it,” Facciponti said. “There has been no breaches anywhere on this magnitude at the bank.” Aleynikov worked at Goldman from 2007 until June, the government said in the complaint. He was part of a team of workers responsible for improving the computer platform. His alleged transfer of computer codes ran from June 1 to June 5, according to prosecutors. Moscow, Rutgers Aleynikov studied applied mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Transportation Engineering before transferring to Rutgers University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 1993 and a master’s of science degree, specializing in medical image processing and neural networks, in 1996, according to his profile on the social-networking site LinkedIn. Before joining Goldman Sachs, he worked for about eight years at IDT Corp., the U.S. vendor of prepaid calling cards, where he led the team responsible for developing routing systems, according to the profile. His profile on LinkedIn describes him as a vice president in equity strategy at Goldman Sachs and includes two recommendations from colleagues at the firm. Goldman Profit Goldman was the world’s biggest and most profitable securities firm until it converted to a bank in September following the bankruptcy of smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman earned $2.3 billion last year, down from a record $11.6 billion in 2007, as market turmoil caused it to report a fourth-quarter loss, its first in a decade as a public company. Goldman’s equities business generated $2 billion of revenue in the first three months of 2009, down 20 percent from the first quarter of 2008, the company reported in April. Second-quarter results are due to be reported next week. Goldman rose $2.97, or 2.1 percent, to $146.46 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The case is U.S. v.
