It's those kinds of statements that show that you want the stuff to go down NOW, not 2+ years from now (or whatever) as you now claim.

Amazon just released their quarter numbers and missing both top and bottom line. The stock dropped like 5% after hours. All analysts, of course, were having a great time predicting a blood bath for Amazon for the next trading day. Then, the "ground zero" letter from Jeff B hit the wire before the opening and Amazon JUMPED. Did it have any help from the market makers or now, I wish I knew. Nonetheless, Amazon actually ended the day up like 5%. That letter made a $10Billion difference! I have been trying to persuade my son to study writing essays instead of writing programs ever since. So, buy when Jeff B's letter is out, at least for a short time.

If she could read charts as she claims she can, she should have known that AMZN would be above $270 around this time and wouldn't have shorted at $220.

In his letter to shareholders Jeffy "noted that the brand reputation will continue to outweigh short-term swings in Amazon’s stock-price". This sounds like Jeffy thinks there might be come trouble coming soon in the (ridiculous) AMZN stock price. 2. Amazon increases Executive salaries. Amazon has been letting the AMZN longs pay his top executives by using stock options since Amazon started. Up to now this has been a good strategy because the stock price has gone nothing by up. To start paying them in salary is only going to hurt earnings, which last year weren't very good.

And because those very few people who own it all also have a lot of money, and it's not even their money, they can now vault AMZN to increasing price levels by way of offering increasing bids on it between themselves without actually having to buy (much) of it between themselves. In other words, they can simply trade it upwards between themselves to make it go up without having to worry that (most) anyone else is going to actually sell any to them. That's how certain collectibles that are intrinsically worthless got to be "worth" a lot of money in the first place. And thus, the owners have "proven" to all outsiders that it is not the "intrinsic worth" of an item (i.e. fundamentals) that mean anything vis a vis its "current trading value." Rather it is in the owners ability to manipulate the price higher. And thus, they have proven that all outsiders need such owners to make all of their collectibles/stocks "worth" more (i.e. one cannot make them worth more on one's own, and neither can the thing itself---i.e. the underlying company in question---can do anything to cause the "stock" to be "worth" more). Great. I'm thoroughly convinced. Now here, take all of my money and make my "stocks" go "up." At least on paper.</Msg><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1365794789697</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 15:26:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365795127935-60</Id><Topic><Title>What's amazing is to see gold crash at a time where Central Banks have ratcheted up paper moeny printing</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1365793786301</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 15:09:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In the end oil and gold will still be around, albeit cheaper than what it iz now - particularly gold...

And oil from about $10/barrel in 1999 to over $100/barrel in 2007, then tanking back to $30's soon thereafter, then back up to $100+ soon thereafter! And with all of the so-called daily excuses following each rise and fall. All of those "reasons" are just after-the-fact excuses. We know that, you know that. Too obvious.
