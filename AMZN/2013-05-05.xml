Amazon is for the slow shorts with slowly deteriorating revenue growth while Netfilx is more "action oriented" with the wild earnings expectation and one is large cap 100 bill+ and the other is the more volatile mid cap 10+ billion. There's still some juices left in Netflix while I can't say the same for Amazon. In terms of T&amp;A Netflix could make a double top at $300 while Amazon, possibly, has already topped out at $285. With "bond money" flow into dividend paying stocks, shorts has no chance outside of wildly expensive or speculative stocks.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1367809201877</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 23:00:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367810128187-8</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN gain in market cap today = 2 times AMZN earnings in its ENTIRE existence</Title><Username>saumg514</Username><Timestamp>1367630036203</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 21:13:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Earnings used to matter greatly, and then growth play a bigger role, and now we might be a the stage when money is being thrown into anything with a symbol on the exchange searching for the bigger fool. This is precisely the definition of "irrational exuberance" that we just experienced in 2000 first and 2007 second. I have nothing against high asset prices if they are actually being supported by the underlying economy but this is not the case. The funny thing is the money in the stock market actually keep inflation lower than it should. We actually might get high inflation during the first stages of market decline (when people cashed out paper to by goods) and deflation afterward as spending got axed due to fear of implosion.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1367810128187</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 23:15:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
