Where have I heard, let's say, unintelligent stuff like this before? I think it was Shiller was talking about the housing bubble on CNBC in 2005 or early 2006 and two pigs who were making money on the long side of it were literally chuckling at him. Stuff like what is going on in the markets right now often ends badly. I'm not saying this will but it is better for the markets to pull back a bit rather than go straight up. That is just not healthy. Especially since all of the recent up days have been on lower volume while it's been just the opposite on the down days. At least that has been the case with the Nasdaq which I track.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1362508038409</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:27:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362508198751-71</Id><Title>i added to my shoert at 276.21</Title><Msg>thanks amzn will fall like a rock this week</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1362508198751</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:29:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362508214344-72</Id><Topic><Title>in a market where's there's ton of "QE" backing with no oil or interest rate pressure AMZN is gonna win</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1362506572281</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:02:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey, hapiphammer yeah i'm so unintellignet that i've ridden this for years while you just showed up trying to short it into the fed's ongoing qe. you are the unintellignet there pal.</Msg><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1362508214344</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:30:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362508300747-73</Id><Topic><Title>i added to my shoert at 276.21</Title><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1362508198751</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:29:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, thanks for ripping you a new one amzn as you said easy short the other day. that's idiotic to say as any short would tell you over the years in amzn</Msg><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1362508300747</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:31:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362508335118-74</Id><Topic><Title>Research Firm DOWNGRADES TO SELL</Title><Username>thomasdickson984</Username><Timestamp>1362131739471</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 04:55:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that was helpful</Msg><Username>josephhunter790</Username><Timestamp>1362508335118</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:32:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362508748357-75</Id><Topic><Title>in a market where's there's ton of "QE" backing with no oil or interest rate pressure AMZN is gonna win</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1362506572281</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:02:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah a fair weather genius.

They should have an absolute field day here. I certainly have documented some highly suspicious/irregular activity for them... They are catching on to the float jam scam enabled by market structure and executed by the quants here... There is a reason the NY Fed works with HFT-giant Citadel: it is precisely to facilitate what HFT is "accused" of doing. But one can't go and expose all the manipulated secrets that have sent this fake market to even faker all time highs. Authorities are exploring potential holes in the system, including new algorithms referred to as “news aggregation” which search the internet, news sites and social media for selected keywords, and fire off orders in milliseconds. The trades are so quick, often before the information is widely disseminated, that authorities are debating whether they violate insider trading rules, the people familiar with the matter said. Authorities are also monitoring alpha capture systems, platforms where sell-side firms share information with buyside professionals, for potential front running or insider trading. Also on their radar is artificial intelligence trading, an algorithm that predicts market reactions based on history. One can see it already: "it was all Twitter's fault.""Nonetheless, there is at least a trace reason to be hopeful: One government official said market structure could be the next big area for cases, although it was not clear whether any of the strategies violated criminal laws. To prove a criminal case the FBI would need to show that the trader intended to manipulate the stock, which could prove more difficult for strategies that are triggered by computers.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362512133590</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:35:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362512178566-89</Id><Topic><Title>techstrategy? momo crushed? you gotta be kidding me?

Amazon's true FCF is actually much worse because most of its CapEx needs relatively rapid replacements (a significant fraction of the fulfillment center buildout is off balance sheet...) -- like AWS/cloud infrastructure. Amazon certainly could lose 80% again. Its competitive set now is very different that the mom and pop retailers it took out in the last wave. Now, it has to knock out TGT, WMT, COST, EBAY and GOOG. The 3 former have already built out a wider distribution/retail network and do not require the ongoing investment to the same extent. The latter two have vastly superior margin and cash flow from which to strategically acquire the physical network as needed and at a discount, as opposed to Amazon's massive malinvestment approach. This time is different. Amazon is a $100B plus market cap company. It will not recover this time. And, it has material risk of insolvency given the right macro shock.

The market manipulation that has led to this valuation is a scam that dwarfs Enron. The collateral damage from what is being done is orders of magnitude greater. As companies like INTC get HAMMERED for commitments to productive investment in cutting edge manufacturing capacity, companies like AMZN get rewarded for investing in redundant, value destroying distribution infrastructure (because we do not have enough...). It would not be happening but for the float jam manipulation scam that systematically suppresses the value of real investments and inflates bubblicious MOMO scams, all to extract scalping profits from those who realize the disconnect in valuations on each side... Keep talking smack Geeg. Once the AAPL/GLD knockout trade ceases, the Fed POMO will be inadequate to maintain this scam and AMZN will crater.

Helluva start.... Second, I have no interest in selling my 3 flat. It generates cash flow in excess of its fixed interest service cost and is slowly building equity. Should we get hyperinflation, only my energy and taxes increase, while rents increase more. My 3 flat is actually a reasonable hedge as a physical asset against the central bank printing (which the Fed is using to buy all the mortgages to gain physical collateral to augment its real or imaginary gold holdings...). In contrast, Amazon's cash flow isn't 20% overvalued, it is more than 100% overvalued. Beyond that, it is NOT a good hyperinflation hedge. Its relative cost competitiveness declines in a world of "inflation" and its future cash flows become more challenged, not less. Furthermore, AAPL and GLD are being taken down deliberately in this scam market, where they will actually benefit and see increased relative value from the "inflationary" pressures (let's be honest and just call it money printing to try to sustain the nominal asset values of financial assets). In short, this isn't about a scam market of inflated values across the board. This is a predatory move driven by certain institutions using money printed out of thin air (and virtually unlimited leverage to which only they get access) to beat down and shake out those who were acting like real investors and positioned themselves rationally given the state of the economy. Note that short interest is decreasing in all MOMO scams (probably driven by big boys deciding not to loan shares short in MOMO scams) while growing in relatively undervalued large cap tech (reaching near all time highs in INTC, nearly double last year in AAPL). This country isn't remotely done. We just need to stop believing that "price is truth" and that the capital markets reflect real world value. We need to invest in the real rather than the financial economy as the latter is simply a tax...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362537956874</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 21:45:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362540333396-131</Id><Topic><Title>tceh how is lenin doing</Title><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1362533397745</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 20:29:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who would you bet on? Japan (will likely be the match that lights the powder keg with its stupidity of shutting down all nuclear and ensuring that a weaker yen will not improve the weakening trade situation) and with ridiculous demographic crisis? Europe, which outside of Germany is hosed? China, which despite its industrial might still has to maintain stability with a population of 1.3B people who have increasing expectation for standard of living? Saudi Arabia or Middle East oil states that face a constant threat of terrorism? Russia, the paragon of honest business? Brazil, which has massive poverty and is rapidly consuming its natural resource base? Only Canada and Australia realistically can/will maintain a relatively similar (median) standard of living to us. Eventually, we'll become a little more strategic, building the Keystone for a strategic capacity buffer (via tar sands and Bakken oil to our refineries) to reduce Saudi/OPEC supply leverage and better control oil / gas prices. Further, if we were strategic and banned export of refined product (an idea which I am sure will engender angry response from laissez faire free traders here), global gasoline prices would likely spike while oil prices drop from end use demand destruction outside the US... Which would in turn put pressure on the OPEC cartel as more would cheat, further reducing oil prices. It's called competitive strategy. Others are doing it to us. We are getting played all the time... There's plenty we could do to right this ship. But, its going to require people pushing back against the status quo.
