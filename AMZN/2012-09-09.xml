Even better RENN, the chinese facebook and about 5 other companies, a groupon site, serious videogame and mobile games site and so much more. It ipo's went to 28 and now is under 4, that stock will go to 20 in 4 days, followed by 30 the week after. It will run even more powerful then BIDU and has just recently added the richest man in the entire country of CHINA to the RENN board of directors. Chen said after that (the ceo of RENN) he will not be happy till RENN has at least a 100 billion dollar maret cap. You figure out what that would make the share price, but the CBOE has not priced the 2014 RENN calls, they just recently did the april 2013 calls. This is highly suspicious because many that are in RENN are in DANG also. Dang has had 2014 calls available for a long time as has sold many of them. Do not take your eye off either of these stocks for even one day, and when the serious pump and loading starts, get in and keep adding heavy as much as you can afford because these will really take off. RENN should start anytime and be 16-18 by Oct expiration, the calls tell the story! Dang, that will partially depend on if amzn rises or tanks in Oct</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1347163797663</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 00:09:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347190824806-2</Id><Title>Obama attemping to re-colonize America for Britain - old war still being fought</Title><Msg>The very very simple but well covered truth.</Msg><Username>mackgreene33</Username><Timestamp>1347190824806</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 07:40:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347191832503-3</Id><Topic><Title>The urgly news : The Catch in Kindle’s Data Plan</Title><Username>me_novice</Username><Timestamp>1347154665826</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 21:37:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It wasn't meant for video and video calls if you have free skype pre-loaded why would you need to make data plan video calls anyway.

People simply download via PC and transfer via USB cable to their devices. That is the same way an ipod for example works. Funny how these shorts think that Amazon hasn't already thought of all this, and that they, the shorts, were the first ones to think of it. Obviously none of the shorts have never used Prime or Amazon downloads or they'd know how the system works. As for the $50 per year for that amount of data this price is extremely low and attractive.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1347192207646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 08:03:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347193388039-7</Id><Title>The only thing left for shrts to do from here is to.....</Title><Msg>Stop covering....

Margins are lower because they are spending heavily on new technologies that are helping AMZN with revenue growth. The trailing PE of 306 and forward PE of 106 (highest among technology companies by a factor of 10 and 20) are justified by those who believe in spending-today and reaping -profits tomorrow philosophy. The problem is when they stop spending on R&amp;D, the revenue growth will decline - would the market then focus on profits and ignore revenue growth rate? It's very tricky business model and there are no guarantees that AMZN's profit will double or even triple that some are expecting, while burning cash today. I think trailing PE of 306 and forward PE of 106 are extrenely risky given the instability of the business model. I am surprised that there are investors who believe this novel way to look at stocks even without entertaining any thought that things may not turn out as they are speculating given the highly volatile naature of the technology market. These kinds of PE's could have been justified in 1999-2001 period when NASDAQ PE's were astronomically high in 100'sv but today when NASDAQ PE is in 30's, AMZN's PE's look outrageously high and therefore very risky. If spending cuts lead to slow revenue growth, these kinds of PE's can't be sustained and conceivably AMZN stock could collapse to under 100. There are several companies that are growing revenues and profits at rates higher than AMZN and yet they have PE's of one-seventh of that of AMZN (e.g., AAPL and Google). It's extraordinary that in this age of sluggish markets, AMZN is assigned bubble-like PEs.</Msg><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1347210374900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 13:06:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347210885952-12</Id><Topic><Title>I bought 50,000 AMZN shares on sale 3 days ago..</Title><Username>lekinsh01</Username><Timestamp>1347075153894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 23:32:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah and you dont have that free 12.5 mill layin around.............That is a fact.........</Msg><Username>deeelbydesign29</Username><Timestamp>1347210885952</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 13:14:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347212488564-13</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN's business model is unstable - will explode in face</Title><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1347210374900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 13:06:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are no investors in this bubble markets.

Social media/internet infomation providers and retailers will also pop. Scamazon life-blood will always be a mail order retailer.
