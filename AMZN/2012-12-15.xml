Amzn is in the belief that all the potential profits come from content on the kindle which you get from amzn itself.

Rise of shipping costs? Lawsuits concerning sales tax? Rising competition? Inferior products? (Cough..Kindle!) Major profit taking by insiders? Rapid expansion with uncertainty of payoff? Oh yes and lack of focus and direction? The company is going everywhere and has no true focus other than directing traffic to their site which only goes so far, especially considering the factors listed above. All the stock needs is one piece of bad news and this bubble will pop. Lets say they beat heavily on Kindle holiday sales, each one sold at a small loss. By the time they announce earnings they will not have time to sell enough content to make up for the loss. This is really irrelevant considering they eventually will sell content to make up for the loss but how will the market perceive the loss when initial earnings are released? This is also irrelevant in itself because Kindle sales haven't been great over the holiday season because their competition has better and more desired products. Amazon is then forced to further discount their Kindle creating more of a loss. So no matter what way they announce results the market will perceive it badly is what I am saying.

First, Amazon already has a virtual monopoly on digital books. So, it has more to lose and less to gain as tablets and consumption options proliferate. The Kindle Fire was a defensive move because Amazon realized Apple would be well positioned to dominate in the future. The DOJ ruling against Apple, which is hyped by many Amazon pumpers, is actually a disaster for Amazon because it gives Apple free reign to compete with Amazon on price on eBooks and undermine its key source of advantage and cash flow. Neither Google nor Apple need to make a penny on eBooks and since Amazon has opened a business model competition with both, both are not only justified but well served attacking Amazon's core business. Second, Amazon includes unlimited videos with its loss leader Prime. That means that new Kindle/Prime buyers are unlikely to generate large video content profits. Again, Amazon has no advantage on new releases. For those hyping a "self publishing" platform, I encourage you to visit YouTube. Google is light years ahead of Amazon on monetizing that opportunity.... Third, Apple iTunes dominates music. Here, Amazon may be able to grab some share, but Apple has advantaged economics here and can certainly match Amazon's prices. So too with Google play. Over time, value will migrate to content creators rather than distributors as digital distribution with cloud/play anywhere offerings proliferate... Amazon will make some money on digital media, but mostly it will be trying to preserve the profitability of the existing Kindle ebook franchise... It is going up against bigger, better and much better financed competitors (both in cash and cash flow) in these arenas. It is NOT competing against mom and pop retailers and dinosaur bookstores anymore.... We'll take a deeper dive on cloud next week...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1355579451275</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 08:50:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355581054823-6</Id><Topic><Title>really dumb that sheep keep buying AMZN if AAPL only gets 8.5 forward PE</Title><Username>csco_brat</Username><Timestamp>1355577790978</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 08:23:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While I agree that 27% growth looks less and less likely due to current revenue trends, the competitive environment and the economic outlook .. the real rub is that even if they hit it, that growth does not come even close to supporting the current stock price. They have to increase sales by 25% per year for 5 years while at the same time they quadruple their operating margin to higher than Walmart levels - and even then, that only delivers today's price 5 years from now with a normal P/E... Have any longs done the math? So, they need to either growth much faster than 25% per year for 5 years, or change their business model entirely to deliver significantly margins. Basically they need to become Apple from 5 years ago, ohhh, except in that case their P/E would only be 10, so that wouldn't work either!</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1355581054823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 09:17:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355583365108-7</Id><Title>Here's the bottom line, folks:</Title><Msg>This pig iz constipated with bernanke bux and needz to take a gigantic sheit for the possibility of it to be healthy once again.

Rather disappointing to see such “disintermediating” innovations emerging from outside the U.S., perhaps attesting to the head in the sand denial on the part of US publishers and the stranglehold Amazon has over the industry. It was rather crazy for the publishers to have resorted to collusion for price-fixing and inviting the wrath of DoJ when the more effective approach would have to foster Publit-like platforms. Why bother with agency model, wholesale model etc. when all that is needed is a platform to host the content, manage DRM, process payment and advertise/promote etc. and receive realtime market intelligence as gravy. Besides Publit-like platforms, the publishers and authors could establish their own collaborative eBook portal and simply pay commissions to sales coming from affiliate's referral links from specialist book review sites similar to movie review sites Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. And if only the industry promotes the development of generic, commodity e-reader devices using an open format like ePub and figure out a way to subsidize or pretty much give it away, it will liberate themselves and the readers from the walled gardens of Kindle and iBooks and shift the paradigm to “Content is King” rather that the yoke of “Platform is King” they squirm under. And as it ought to have been to begin with, hope the day will come soon when eBook distribution is done on a “Marketplace” model sponsored by neutral, non-competing platforms like Ebay, Facebook, Publit etc.</Msg><Username>krk_krk</Username><Timestamp>1355598015292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 14:00:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355599440451-17</Id><Topic><Title>Time to address the "digital content" profit fable...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1355579451275</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 08:50:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another issue--"stale" inventory at "fullfillment centers"? Things that no longer sell but show up as "assets". Sooner or later, writedowns? Is this incorrect? Second, Amazon has sacrificed profits to gain share. Like the old adage, "lose money (almost) on every sale, but make up for it in volume". Is this a winning business plan? If they raise prices to get more profit, others may move in to take business. Plenty of potential rivals out there, starting with Apple, eBay, Google, Priceline, etc. and they have lots of cash. Similarly, "the cloud" is a fancy name for a digital data center. If it becomes very profitable, there will be MANY competitors. Amazon is a retail stock selling for tulip bulb bubble PE ratio in my humble opinion.</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1355599440451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 14:24:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355599624640-18</Id><Topic><Title>up yours Sybil!!!</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1355590147942</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 11:49:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And, praise the trading gods, good 'ol skiidady has shown up to curse the bullz.</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1355599624640</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 14:27:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355599734560-19</Id><Topic><Title>Bots are warming up for the sell program</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1355538067769</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 21:21:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Skiidady, thank you for showing up and ringing the bell.
