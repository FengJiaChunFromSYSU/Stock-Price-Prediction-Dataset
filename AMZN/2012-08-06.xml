At the time of award, Amazon assigns it some fair market value and records it as paid-in capital (mind you, these are phantom dollars as no money has been received) and offsets that as an unrecognized compensation cost. As the RSUs vest, the appropriate dollar amount from the unrecognized compensation cost gets expensed. This disclosure in its 10-Q should give an idea of its size, pace and timetable: ""As of June 30, 2012, there was $1.25 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis, with approximately half of the compensation expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a weighted average recognition period of 1.3 years. " All the money for its buyback dilution sterilization program has to now come from its profits or cash flow as there was no capital which was brought in as would have happened in an options award and exercise situation. As an RSU has a zero cost to the recipient, it is much better than holding an option in the event the strike price ends up higher than the stock price at the time of exercise, and then the recipient has to count on the goodwill of management to reprice them. It is perhaps with this is mind that Amazon has chosen the RSU route rather than Options, as even in the event of some sizeable collapse of its stock price, the RSUs will still be worth something and hopefully that serves as an adequate golden tether and avoid disruptive flight of talent. At the rate at which Amazon has been issuing the RSUs (4.3 million in 2Q12 alone) and with 2.1 million Restricted Stock Units reported vested and probably waiting to be flipped it will quickly run through its buyback war-chest, which, as they can’t be replenished with profits, will have to be done with debt. So, I see Amazon soon needing to tap the debt market. And why not? With its rating it should have no trouble borrowing at today’s “please take my money” amazing rates. But I wonder if the closer scrutiny that generally accompanies a debt placement might be the tipping point for this ponzi scam?</Msg><Username>krk_krk</Username><Timestamp>1344227508000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 00:31:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344234556000-3</Id><Title>The DOW futures plunging now!</Title><Msg>Down 2.00 points!

It just depends on when you think it will fall. You can buy weekly, monthly, or yearly Puts. If you think it is truly overvalued, as I do, you might want to consider a 3-6 month out Put in the $200 range. There is no interest associated with buying puts. I would definitely understand options before making this play though.</Msg><Username>bg_rox2001</Username><Timestamp>1344273629000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 13:20:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344274729000-50</Id><Topic><Title>Bought some calls.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1344270908000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 12:35:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Added more.

Best Buy in Huntsville was packed. The computer section had aisles blocked for better control. This gave me a good indication of how important that 8% sales tax can be. Amazon has to collect now in many states. Texas was the latest and many more governors are lined up. No stopping it now. Schulze &amp; pals from BBY have this morning started a buyout bid for the company (BBY). They know the details as to how the stores have fared in the states where AMZN is collecting taxes. Will this slow or stunt AMZN's growth? I would think so. And a 200-300 PE needs a lot of growth to support.</Msg><Username>bottompickinfool</Username><Timestamp>1344275112000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 13:45:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344275166000-53</Id><Title>AMZN SCAM MANIPUALTION FRAUD PUMP PEAKED</Title><Msg>AGAIN DOWN CYCLE DUMP BY FRAUD STREET "HFT' MACHINE GUNS WILL PLAY OUT NEXT MASSIVE RIOTS IN 2013 USA A FAILED STATE AMERICANS ARE HISTORY WITHOUT REVOLUTION http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/category/articles/ RED ALERT IN USA BANKERS GONE WILD - HOW THE US GOVERNMENT HELPED WALL STREET GANG-RAPE AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/wildbankers.php</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1344275166000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 13:46:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344275900000-54</Id><Title>Don't Miss ZNGA Ka BOOM TimE!!!!
