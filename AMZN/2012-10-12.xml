By now , they were supposed to be over growing mutliples higher,not just the stock markert cap. So what are these "strong"earnings in you mind b/c the last two qtrs they were almost non-existant, and blamed on "spending" for expansion. Another question, if they were spending for expansion, why were earnings declining, as most spending costs are balance sheet items amortized, and should not affect earnings like that. So it puts into question the profit model no? And when were you short? I never saw you here ever.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1350047260457</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 09:07:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350047500954-18</Id><Title>Best Buy to price match any online price.</Title><Msg>Looks like Best Buy playing hardball.</Msg><Username>hugeman99</Username><Timestamp>1350047500954</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 09:11:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350047936914-19</Id><Title>DRAM $0.65 has entered into a formal agreement with AMD (NYSE:AMD) for the development of an AMD-branded version of Dataram’s RAMDisk software.

Its upside is very limited because it is one of the most overvalued stock in almost all aspects, PE, PB and even PS compare to its peers. What's the downside risk ? Go take a look at the Cisco 10-15 year history. Cisco can make more money than AMZN when it was in growth time, and Cisco products are more stick than Amazon in terms of loyalty of the customers. Now the competition is coming everywhere, from Walmart, BestBuy and many other smaller online retailers, which still have sales tax advantage, to B&amp;N, Google, Apple, Oracle, Microsoft and IBM in cloud computing and contents business. Its growth is very limited, will see its growth slow down. Then, its trading pattern will be like Cisco from year 2001. There are still a lot of more undervalued stocks on the market, many of them traded under book values and with PE less than 10, such as some banks, insurances, and even some oil and energy are traded in this kind scenario. Their downside risk is much lower and upside is much higher.</Msg><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1350052087775</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:28:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350052239398-42</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN downside risk is much bigger than up</Title><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1350052087775</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:28:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You may the biggest idiot on yahoo.</Msg><Username>ben_bertanked_me</Username><Timestamp>1350052239398</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:30:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350052411638-43</Id><Title>You're going to blink you're eye and this will be up $3</Title><Msg>Watch!</Msg><Username>buy_puts_and_call</Username><Timestamp>1350052411638</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:33:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350052567342-44</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN downside risk is much bigger than up</Title><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1350052087775</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:28:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just look at your hisotry here: you lie constantly and are a useless, brainless poster who's not worth reading: EVER! that's the truth. you offer nothing</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1350052567342</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:36:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350052668906-45</Id><Title>Bought some calls.</Title><Msg>I couldn't refuse.

Likewise, they now pack more features than ever: from built-in backlights to 3G connectivity, these readers continue to influence how people consume text. However, a new German company by the name of Txtr is hoping to rattle the industry with its ultra-cheap eBook reader: the Txtr Beagle. Priced at $13 — no, that's not a misprint — it has the potential to become the least-expensive eBook reader to date ... but it comes with some serious compromises. For starters, at 5" it features a much smaller eInk display than many of today's traditional readers. The Kindle Paperwhite by comparison packs a 6" screen. Furthermore, the Beagle isn't touch-sensitive, and it lacks: a backlit display, WiFi, 3G ... and just about every feature we've grown to love in our eBook readers. More importantly, the Beagle can only load eBooks sent from your smartphone via a Bluetooth connection. To transfer books users must launch the Beagle app on their Android smartphone (an iOS app is forthcoming) and zap eBooks via Bluetooth to their Beagle device. But with 4GB of memory, the Beagle can only hold up to five eBooks at a time. Did we mention it runs on two AAA batteries? The Beagle is set to launch in Europe before this holiday season, but Txtr also has plans for a U.S. debut in the works. Engadget reports Txtr is in talks with Sprint and AT&amp;T hoping they'll each offer the device with a small subsidy. Assuming it debuts at $13 with a 2-year smartphone purchase or renewal, is the Txtr Beagle cheap enough to lure you away from your Kindle? Or is this one smartphone accessory you wouldn't mind skipping?

What I mean by that is I strongly suspect the marginal value of incremental Prime subscriptions is declining and rapidly. There are only so many high value Amazon shoppers (one needs to have enough wealth to buy enough high value density items to make the math work). I suspect most of those self selected into Prime before the free video and Kindle Bundle giveaways. Thus, as the average annual purchases of a Prime member declines over time, even as Amazon continues to pay for content and shipping on low value density items, the economics turn... There are so many areas I could go to town on this scam. To the jackasses on TV saying WalMart cannot match Amazon on price. Sure it can. It may hurt margins this year. But, see what Amazon's economics look like if its negative working capital model starts to see revenue growth go negative...

They also do a great job or capturing investors imagination by entering fields with almost limitless growth--cloud etc...we'll all have to see on 10/25. Bezos isn't a dummy, he knows he's got to make some money this qtr. All I can say is this--you can get anything on AMZN, and most people do. They carry a weeks supply of everything in robotic staffed warehouse in cheap parts of town. If you feel somehow, this is an inferior business model to modern retail, that's just silly. This quarters numbers are VITAL to them. I agree whoeheartedly that a big miss would knock this stock to 150 instantly, but a big hit has a fair shot of hitting 300...we'll see. Thsi debate we're having has gone on for 15 years and longs have certainly has the best of it so far.</Msg><Username>beauty90210211</Username><Timestamp>1350077167027</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 17:26:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350077349202-161</Id><Title>Geegee that dope is back to the amzn knife catching extravaganza...</Title><Msg>Getting his right hand cut off in this weex action wasnt good enough...

WalMart and Costco have superior cost structures for the forward looking environment and they, not mom and pop, are the competitive set now. Amazon has over invested in robotics, but that will be one clear in time. The announcement that is really going to shock people is when manufacturers decide to end the negative working capital environment. Certainly the brands with power can/should demand 30days or cutoff product. Then others would follow. A reversal in payment terms by all tablet/phone manufacturers (applied to all categories of products they sell including TV, video, stereo, PC, etc} would put Amazon in a WORLD of hurt heading into holiday 2012.

Great piece today by Cramer! Top 10 momo's to buy for the last quarter of the year. Number one momo to buy!? AMZN!!! Cramer actually stated that AMZN is cheap! It only is trading at a PE of 35 if you take 2015 earnings.into account. It's cheap because your basing it on a growth rate of 36%. But he forgot that earnings are increasing so briskly because the company will eventually stop building distribution centers. What is the rev. growth rate??? Setting it up for one last pop.
