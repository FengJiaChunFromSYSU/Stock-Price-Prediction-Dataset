By moving into a variety of areas, such as cloud computing, video on demand, and electronics, Amazon has been unable to master anything, and is falling behind companies that specialize in these distinct areas. In the wake of this competition, Amazon has had to resort to selling products at a loss or with special offers, in order to beef up sales numbers. If this trend continues, it seems possible to see Amazon posting negative operating profits in the near future. Take for example the electronics market: in this market, Amazon has produced the Kindle, but is facing stiff competition from both Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG), and the Kindle will continue to battle these competitors. With Apple recently releasing the iPad mini, there is now even more competition with the Kindle. With so many other companies also entering this market, this will be a continuing struggle for Amazon. As another example, Amazon also has a video service, which competes with the popular service Netflix (NFLX). Amazon has tried to make its presence felt by striking a deal with Time Warner (TWC) and more recently A&amp;E Networks to add more content to its Prime platform, but the service has still failed to achieve the hype and success Amazon was hoping for, and the expenses are piling up. Though it remains to be seen if Amazon actually makes profits on this content, the company will need to keep investing if it is to match Netflix, which will prove to be an expensive undertaking. Amazon's core business - online shopping - is what made it so successful years ago. With such a large portion of this online shopping market, Amazon was set to become one of the biggest retailers in the world, and still is on that track. However, the additional services, products, and offerings are only taking away from this core business. Amazon is moving away from its core values and specialties, and this may prove harmful in the end. The Takeaway Amazon's expenditures have been on the rise, as the company is trying to gain market share in new businesses and raise revenues. However, these higher expenses are outpacing revenues, and are costing the company in earnings. We have now seen Amazon post losses, and its huge expenditures might take its toll on the company in the form of drop in stock price very soon. All of these prevailing issues for Amazon make it an ideal candidate to be shorted in the market. With the stock gaining nearly 40% in the last year, and its financials showing weakness, a correction seems likely in the near future.

I thought about this from my own experience and think it shows one the problem that amzn is facing. About 5 or 6 yrs ago, I bought a 46" flat screen tv on amzn for around $2,000. Now, you can get a 46" tv from $450 on up. Think about the impact of this price drop on amzn's profitability. First gross margins on things like tv's have been squeezed over the past few years. Let's say that gm% went from 25% to 20%. Unit gross margin on the $2000 tv is $500 and unit gross margin on the new tv is $90. Next, think about what has happened to shipping cost over that same period. At best, its flat (I think its probably up). I don't know how much it costs to ship a 46" tv, but it has to cost at least $50 (probably a lot more for next day delivery). So, years ago, amzn would make around $450 on a 46" TV. Now they make $40. This is one of many reasons why amzn won't be able to deliver the earnings that justify its current price.</Msg><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1358721394072</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 17:36:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358724363381-66</Id><Topic><Title>Average Rev Per Unit Sold</Title><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1358721394072</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 17:36:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When prices drop, AMZN gets hit on revenue, margins, and profits.

The most AMZN has ever ran is $50-60 in 2 months without a major pullback. I count 3 with this being the 4th. If you scale in slowly your not down 50...but admittedly still down. I'm willing to bet it will pull back $30 before it rises $30 at this point. That is regular AMZN movement, imagine if it stops being the most loved? And you can't count 14 years, this stock did #$%$ until '09 which is around the same time QE started.The bear case here is not over valuation, there is enough of that in the market, it's tulip craze valuation. You say "earning don't matter" and they don't presently because they are building the company out but truth is eventually it will matter. How much earnings are needed to justify this price? Well if you use the pie in the sky esp. of 2017 the stock is only moderately overpriced.Why buy now and wait 4 years for minimal upside?? Once revenue slows this gets crushed.
