The trading pattern is repeated day after day, almost always during illiquid times, such as AH, opening bell, noon time, or at the close. Among these 10 firms, about 10% of the daily trading volume is cancelled at the end of the day. The trades never settle, so no money changes hands. Among any 2 firms, the these dark pool trades never amount to more than .1% of the weekly trading volume (10% divided by 100 combinations). The Nasdaq is also self regulating, which means even less likely that anybody is ever looking at such violations. The AMZN cartel can accomplish this, since their dark pool HFT operations are funded by FED money at 0%. The only real money entering the AMZN arena is short money, which is what the HFT machines go searching for. It's the major reason why AMZN rises several days after particularly bad news. Short positions are built up, by rational investors, and then the HFT machines manipulate the price through buy and cancel programs, forcing the stock higher and causing short money to cover. The entire process is repeated over and over, shifting actual short money into the HFT pockets. The entire plan is fraudulent, but since nobody looks for the crime, the criminals are free to transact in this manner, over and over again. Wall Street is the mafia, but there is no enforcement agency. The government is broken.</Msg><Username>chl94611</Username><Timestamp>1343235230000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 12:53:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343235232000-92</Id><Title>217.50 critical.</Title><Msg>Good luck to all!</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1343235232000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 12:53:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343235344000-93</Id><Topic><Title>PJ, you see when an entire economy is based</Title><Username>fig_plucker</Username><Timestamp>1343231423000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:50:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>8% implied move following earnings anouncement</Msg><Username>retire_yung</Username><Timestamp>1343235344000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 12:55:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343235422000-94</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon's "Unobtanium" running out?</Title><Username>the_invisible_hand2010</Username><Timestamp>1343234687000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 12:44:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Fed will print.

But, real disposable income will stagnate or shrink in 2013 and its impact will be catastrophic for AMZN. Google, Apple and WalMart all have strong incentive to attack AMZN in 2013 when its consumer value proposition drops (paying sales tax), investment remains high (devices to compete with Apple and Google and physical distribution infrastructure for same day delivery) which will limit its cash and ability to invest in growth.

US Poverity is now at the highest levels since 1960s. 1 in 6 relies on food stamps. Student loan debt now exceeds credit card debt. Making more money available for loans is pointless when the middle class is disappearing and people can't pay back existing debt. Banks are not lending because no one is qualified to take out loans. Instead of making more money available for loans we need more money going into the pockets of wage earners so they can pay back loans.</Msg><Username>davlee1972</Username><Timestamp>1343239285000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 14:01:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343239602000-112</Id><Title>Only down 2% ON UP MARKET</Title><Msg>Not bad for a safety stock that's supported by wall st according to nads6000</Msg><Username>pjw1857</Username><Timestamp>1343239602000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 14:06:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343239658000-113</Id><Topic><Title>OH MY!!

This is true, but where's the risk factor in your analysis? No reasonable person should be willing to pay the same for this years earnings in the bank as they would for next years potential earnings let alone 2016. To me this is the problem with all the analysis out there leading to targets of $240 -$300+. You are essentially saying you are willing to pay $25 now for each $1 of 2016 earnings. That would be expensive even if those future earnings were guaranteed. With the fast-changing online retail and technology landscapes what are the risks that that $9/share doesn't materialize in 2016? And even if it does, at P/E of 25 you've got to expect even more growth beyond that to justify your purchase price. And that's just for the shares to be worth today's price. If you want your shares to go up in value you need to factor in even more growth. I'm not saying its impossible for Amazon to achieve, just that the odds are against it.</Msg><Username>philtmcnasty8</Username><Timestamp>1343243844000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 15:17:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343243991000-137</Id><Title>AMZN will be safe</Title><Msg>....my intuition told me so.

Almost all 37 Analysts for Amazon will be WRONG as well. Apple stock is covered by 42 analysts. Previously in 4 free lunches before Apple's report I stated that the low estimate for earnings for the past quarter is $9.45 and the high estimate for the past quarter is $12.51; the low estimate for revenues is $34.54 billion and the high estimate is $41.73 billion. Not even a single analyst out of 42 got it right. Apple reported $9.32 a share. -------- For Amazon here are the current estimates. EPS: Low Estimate -0.23, High Estimate 0.37, Consensus 0.02 Revenue: Low 12.51B, High 13.21B, Consensus 12.89B -------- Revenue is going to be tricky to predict Last Quarter's Revenue: 13.185B Last Year's Q2 Revenue: 9.91B What we know for industry reports. Online retail sales decreased 2.3% between Q1 and Q2. Retail sales in general fell in April, May and June. This would put AMZN's revenue around 12.88B which is close to consensus. Home goods sales online increased by 35.3% in Q2. Sales from mobile devices increased from 13.1% in Q1 to 15.1% in Q2. Spending for Electronics and Appliances fell by $321 million in Q2 2012 compared to Q2 2011. These reports are confirmed by EBAY's earnings report with huge jumps in Home Furnashings, Home Improvement with Electronics falling 4% from last year. Additional earning reports from Radio Shack, Netflix, Apple and Microsoft (XBoxes) confirm a slowdown in Electronics and Media sales. Here's big downer for Amazon. 60% of their revenue in Q1 was from Electronics and 36% was from Media Sales. I have a hard time believing that Amazon could report a flat 9.91B in Revenue year over year which would be a worst case scenario. Instead I'll just focus on the number one selling product in Q1 which was the Kindle. Amazon sold roughly $500 million in Kindles in Q1 of 2012 which was not around in Q1 of 2011. With the introduction of the Apple iPad HD and 87% increase in iPad sales, I'm estimating that Kindle sales dropped from $500 to $250 million in Q2. My ball park figure for Q2 revenue will be 12.63B max, but it could be substantially lower if industry reports are right. -------- Earnings are clearly going to be below consensus. I don't see how Amazon gets close to $0.02 a share in EPS. Take out last quarter's one time equity accounting gain and you end up with $0.07 a share. Add in an additional $50 million in warehouse expansion costs and you end up with -$0.14 a share and that doesn't include any sales slowdown, foreign exchange impact and introducing state sales tax in six states. My ball park figure for Q2 EPS will be -$0.15 max, but it could be substantially lower as well.</Msg><Username>davlee1972</Username><Timestamp>1343244130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 15:22:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343244212000-141</Id><Topic><Title>SSH @ 221</Title><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1342704627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-19 09:30:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>New LOD @ 217...OINK!</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1343244212000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 15:23:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343244288000-142</Id><Topic><Title>Here's my preview for Amazon's Earnings tomorrow</Title><Username>davlee1972</Username><Timestamp>1343244130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 15:22:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like the way you preview</Msg><Username>pjw1857</Username><Timestamp>1343244288000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 15:24:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343244322000-143</Id><Title>FB is running again</Title><Msg>Time will tell</Msg><Username>loopejoe</Username><Timestamp>1343244322000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 15:25:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343244493000-144</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon Inc. fundamental analysis (325$ target price)</Title><Username>oribe90</Username><Timestamp>1343186396000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 23:19:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your analysis is full of do do matter, Village Idiot!

And don't get me started on the price of oil going higher into Central Bank printing that dilutes purchasing powere and affect company margins, especially to comapnies who's model is "door to door.". AMZN is going to make $9 bucks but couldn't even make it to $3 bucks forecasted 3 years ago: that is the fact up to now.

The consensus range is (23c)-37c for EPS, and $12.51B-$13.21B for revenue, according to First Call. After reporting better-than-expected EPS and revenue in Q1, the company expected Q2 revenue to be in the range of $11.9B-$13.3B. The company also announced Q1 active customer accounts exceeded 173M and its Q1 inventory increased 47%. Investors will be looking for updates on the new Kindle Fire and other tablets or smartphones it has reportedly been working on. Amazon should also provide details on its distribution, since Target (TGT) stopped carrying Kindles over the summer, and since Amazon agreed to a new deal with U.K. bookseller Waterstones. The company will also most likely address the effect of the European economy and sales tax requirements on their profit margin and bottom line. In the previous quarter, Amazon announced several agreements to enhance their Prime Instant Video product, including deals with Paramount, NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. and MGM.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1343247033000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 16:10:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343247046000-186</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon Inc. fundamental analysis (325$ target price)</Title><Username>oribe90</Username><Timestamp>1343186396000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 23:19:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no, the market relects , in this case, the tigth float support and the fact of about 20 % ownership of the CEO.

Now, explain to me how EXISTING cash should be ADDED to annual earnings. After that, please tell me why you are INCLUDING their cash, but EXCLUDING their payables.

It's all about odds. When a stock is first moving up after a very long basing process the handle it forms at these low levels works only about 60 percent of the the time. When it does work down there you have yourself a big winner and the runs are very good. Now for AMZN. a cup and handle at this level only works less then 20 percent of the time and when it does you get a blow off top. these are what you are facing here. Place your bets where your comfort level is but the best you can expect on the long side is a blow off top. Odds aren't good here but gamblers can make money going long.

The press this month has been all over Amazon's change to next-day delivery and expansion into cell phones. Now, I give you that Jeff is a brilliant guy, he has fleeced AMZN 'investors' out of billions of dollars. But can somebody give me a reason to believe that building warehouses all over the place and paying an army of delivery agents to make same day delivery is a sure-thing profit strategy? At the same time, Jeff has been pumped to believe that he is a 'tech'. The Kindle seemed to be a success (no proof provided) so he launched the Kindle Fire and has rumors of an Amazon cell-phone to reap the rewards from the emerging market of Android apps. Did any of the AMZN 'investors' happen to notice ZNGA today. Actually the Kindle and the Kindle Fire were desperation moves as physical media changed to E-music and E-books that Amazon had no advantage in. The old-school business plan was to do one thing and do it well. Amazon has created an easy-to-use web store with a little help (actually quite a bit of help) from an antiquated sales-tax system. Beyond that, would one of the AMZN 'investors' identify a single successful product or service that Jeff has brought to market (success defined as something that earns a profit and has a defined customer base).</Msg><Username>bbyboomer50</Username><Timestamp>1343262615000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 20:30:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343263181000-245</Id><Topic><Title>Cup 'N Handle</Title><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1343262386000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 20:26:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18977084 stop with the alchemy technical mumbo jumbo.....howabout some facts.</Msg><Username>erbium_doper</Username><Timestamp>1343263181000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 20:39:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343264364000-246</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon, Dangdang and other US-China internet stock pairs</Title><Username>w2cbest</Username><Timestamp>1343250745000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 17:12:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone knows how Amazon China is doing compared to Dangdang?</Msg><Username>zoyabeijing</Username><Timestamp>1343264364000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 20:59:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343264839000-247</Id><Topic><Title>Here's my preview for Amazon's Earnings tomorrow</Title><Username>davlee1972</Username><Timestamp>1343244130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 15:22:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For AMZN 'investors' and i don't think this Q will be any different, earnings and EPS don't matter.

Estimates was for $0.07. In reality the real beat of $0.09 and the stock jumps 30%. $89 million or $0.19 in EPS came from accounting gimicks. Amazon owns 31% of Living Social. Living Social is taking losses left and right, but managed to get some new investors to buy in. This diluated Amazon's stake so Amazon was able to report a one time $55 million gain by reducing thier liability on historical Living Social losses. The other $41 million came from marking up the book value of Living Social. Living Social had equity stakes in two other firms which they eventually bought out. Living Social reported a one time equity gain on those two initial equity after the buyout completed in Q1. Buy some shares at $50, buy out the company later at $75 and book a $25 gain on those initial shares. I find it ironic that Amazon made more EPS from Living Social than Amazon and at the same time Living Social is operating with losses. Sounds like they are cooking the books on this one. "In the first quarter, LivingSocial’s revenues totaled $110 million, increasing 168 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. The Washington, D.C., company also recorded a profit of $156 million during the period, compared to a loss of $60 million a year earlier. [Update: To clear up any confusion, a footnote in Amazon's filing explains that LivingSocial's net income in the first quarter was boosted by non-cash gains from acquisitions during the quarter. Otherwise, it reported an operating loss of $92 million.] The results of the privately held company were reported last week by Amazon, which holds a 29 percent stake in the company."</Msg><Username>davlee1972</Username><Timestamp>1343266150000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 21:29:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343266564000-253</Id><Topic><Title>Here's my preview for Amazon's Earnings tomorrow</Title><Username>davlee1972</Username><Timestamp>1343244130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 15:22:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I absolutely agree.

Should the stock squeeze, I will double or quadruple my position. The simple truth is that this is an overcrowded momentum trade destined to end badly because Amazon simply cannot capture enough value to justify the valuation. This growth story has been a fable for some time. Amazon has grown revenues without meaningfully growing profits or cash flows and now has high enough fixed costs where loss of cash flow could make it quite vulnerable. It opened a multi-front war without the resources to fight one. In 2013, the best companies on earth (Apple, Google and WalMart) are going to send Bezos back to school... Just watch. If you don't get that Google has created Google App Engine / Cloud Platform and the Play store to compete more directly with Amazon (in a vastly higher ROIC and more capital efficient way, I might add), you are going to lose your shirt and your pants. Don't think for a minute that Apple is going to sit back while Amazon launches loss leader phones and tablets (Apple's key source of profits). Apple is going to hit back and hard. And WalMart is back to focusing on everyday low prices... All can/will get into a content bidding/pricing war, particularly on digital content, and crush Amazon's key source of current competitive advantage. Apple and Google could literally fight that war for years without getting one penny in revenue. Amazon has already committed way too much on BS, value destroying redundant physical infrastructure and now has relatively modest cash on hand and practically no cash flow. Amazon's customer financing could dry up in a hurry as its content share drops to the level of its installed device share...
