The e-Ink devices and the related software components of the Kindle platform are a good investment because they are easy to build and maintain and they sell a high margin product (something Amazon needs). But investing large amounts in a tablet platform that is at best 3rd rate is just stupid. Amazon is not an engineering and not a hardware culture and it shows in the product. Amazon is a political and strategic organization that is focused on IT ops and physical logistics, not hardware. I am both a former Amazonian and a Kindle Fire owner. I can tell you, my Fire is the biggest piece of #$%$ I own. It's under-powered, slow, and clumsy. I have maybe successfully watched 4 movies or TV shows on it. It's frozen on me a number of times, not to mention the frequent download errors you get when trying to do common things like purchase and download all of that high margin content Amazon is banking on. Fire HD (which is not actually High Definition BTW) is typical Orwellian Amazon marketing of a sub-standard product. The dual antennas do nothing extra, the basic video technology can fail, bricking the device, and the basic browsing capabilities are a joke. FireHD is not a serious offering although it was a noble attempt. It's not that they won't sell these devices (at a loss BTW). It's that even if they sell them, usage will be depressed because the experience is such #$%$ people will put the devices in their drawers. I haven't touched my fire in 6 months. Selling the device only wins the battle if you make money on the hardware or if people can't stop using them. You might read the expansion of Lab126 as a signal they are selling a ton of Fires. Seriously, don't kid yourself. It's more a Hail Mary pass by Amazon to rescue the Fire platform. For some reason, Bezos thinks he needs to own a space in hardware to sell movies, TV, and books. That's the same walled-garden thinking everyone has been worried about since DSL got created and Verizon thought they would get into Media. Bezos should ditch the hardware ambitions or partner with someone who knows what they are doing-- or just ignore hardware and focus on increasing support of the Prime platform for media. iPad mini is going to come out soon, and that plus re-furbished iPads is going to make Fire look like a very silly, costly mistake.</Msg><Username>americanuspublius</Username><Timestamp>1348323012111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 10:10:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348325996087-3</Id><Topic><Title>Kindle Design Center to Expand to Double, No, Triple Current Size</Title><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348257425334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 15:57:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've said for awhile that the Fire was a defensive, not offensive, strategy. Bezos saw the amazing success of the I pad and had the oh crap moment where he realized that books share could mirror tablet share and that tablet would quickly surpass readers as competition drove prices down. He felt threatened. When Apple launches the mini and the other players (especially GOOG/MMI) release next gen product before Christmas, I suspect they all will have an increased focus on books content. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple and Google negotiate an iTunes match type program where for $25, any eBook purchased in the past (which would be mainly Kindle books) could be matched and hosted in the iCloud/Google Drive. All Amazon's legacy advantage would be erased for $25 a user. And, it would be incremental revenues for publishers. On top of that, Apple and Google match price on EVERY book Amazon sells. Good for competition. Good for consumers. A big problem for a company that bet the farm on earnings supranormal profits on content it didn't own...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1348325996087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 10:59:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348328255779-4</Id><Topic><Title>Kindle Design Center to Expand to Double, No, Triple Current Size</Title><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348257425334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 15:57:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Defensive is right. Google is going to have to get serious about eBooks sometime soon. For the time being, they are a minor player. But there is no reason they can't crush Amazon. Their search capabilities are superior, their ability to supercharge eBooks with contextual-type searching and preference matching would leave Amazon in the dust. One problem: they haven't tried yet! Maybe they've been waiting for the tablet to happen first. Publishers are #$%$ about Amazon busting the agency model (which had nothing to do with collusion, and in fact increases eBook competition in the long run) and want revenge. There is some comeuppance due.</Msg><Username>americanuspublius</Username><Timestamp>1348328255779</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 11:37:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348329178127-5</Id><Topic><Title>Kindle Design Center to Expand to Double, No, Triple Current Size</Title><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348257425334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 15:57:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A related thought. It's funny that the DOJ came down on Apple/Publishers for collusion to restrain trade from an Amazon-staged lawsuit (Amazon has stooges at the DOJ). After all, they say it's Amazon that orchestrated an employee-wide "anti-trust" training to change the way people talk about dominating markets and getting monopolies. Don't say "dominate" say "serve a lot of customers." Don't say "market," say "market segment." Trying to avoid what happened to Microsoft with Windows. Try to avoid the appearance of restraint of trade when Amazon has over half of the eBook market-- aside: Amazon will argue it has no monopoly because it will look at eBooks and Print books as a whole and claim that percentage is low. But when it backs a lawsuit against Apple, which has a minority share of eBook sales, Amazon suddenly wants to just look at eBooks as their own market.</Msg><Username>americanuspublius</Username><Timestamp>1348329178127</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 11:52:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348330424874-6</Id><Title>Geegee, nemesis, "philjoe" = Retarded pumperz, non believers of the power trading gods, and ......</Title><Msg>Idiots that sybil iz going to bash into the dirt as this ponzi scheme Stok collapses as the ponzi bernanke markets rumple up while sybil gets paid to watch them all burn.....
