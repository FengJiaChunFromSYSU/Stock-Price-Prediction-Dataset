Yet, they can keep rasing price targets without them as long as the stock goes up. This is how WS works and AMZN is in the sweetspot like no Company I've ever seen , with such a "Black Box". Doesn't say much for the underlying foundation of the US economy, and more illustrates how big of a Ponzi Scheme the economy is becoming: having the Fed base the economy's health on the basis of providing a "Wealth Effect" to drrive economic behavior, regardless of the values it hinges upon. Interesting times indeed.</Msg><Username>homeytheclown03</Username><Timestamp>1382281584794</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 11:06:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382281750125-7</Id><Title>Walmart luring away Amazon talent/increasing ecommerce investment</Title><Msg>News that Walmart is luring away a lot of talent from amazon.

So move the clock foward to today, and now you warn of the Fed creating bubbles and moves in stock b/c of this $85 billion in progress. THEY WERE JUST STARTING YOU IDIOT WHEN YOU THOUGHT THE MARKET WAS ABOUT TO CRASH, NOT END AS YOU POST HERE. And as far as being angry, nah, I have no reason to be angry being right and understanding what has been going on in the markets for quite. My one mistake looks like a I sold out of some AMZN too early just over 300, when you first starting unrelenting rantings about AMZN toward shorts. One of the things I'm here now is to remind the board of what a fraud you are. If you wern't, you wouldn't have to say with 1000 messages the same thing to shorts ,when can understand you with one. That shows that your messages aren't of the benefit for the board, but , somehow, the benefit for youself to keep pushing the issue over the course of you sitting on a computer, on a yahoo message board, all weekend long. Doesn't match the life of most "millionaires." more of that of a complete fraud.

"Luckily, we have instruments of torture, which we will use if necessary," Andreas Mundt, the president of the German cartel office, was quoted as telling daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. A struggle with competition authorities in its second-largest market after the United States would add to Amazon's woes. Its German operations have been rattled by a dispute over employees' pay and a trade union has warned that staff could strike during the Christmas holiday season. "The terms of Amazon's Marketplace in effect obstruct competition," Mundt said, according to a pre-release on Sunday of the newspaper's Monday edition. "We are in talks with Amazon to eliminate these impediments to competition...If necessary, we will issue a crystal clear decree." Separately, Amazon has been criticized over its tax payments and leading policy makers have called for a new German government to crack down on tax avoidance by multinational firms without waiting for its European partners to act. At the heart of the watchdog's complaints about Amazon's Marketplace is a requirement that third-party merchants must offer their cheapest price when selling their products over the platform. Amazon was not immediately available for comment.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1382315343595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 20:29:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382315455283-38</Id><Topic><Title>prediction</Title><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1382314716754</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 20:18:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ABSOLUTELY CORRECT</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1382315455283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 20:30:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382315873701-39</Id><Title>BMP Capital:"Bezos' Ponzi Scheme to Catch Up"</Title><Msg>"Unsustainable money losing business model will catch up, history never lies"</Msg><Username>bruce_gaya2</Username><Timestamp>1382315873701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 20:37:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382316699009-40</Id><Title>Im out first thing Monday congrats those who hung in but....</Title><Msg>now time to bail my friends.</Msg><Username>bankmaster39</Username><Timestamp>1382316699009</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 20:51:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382317122409-41</Id><Topic><Title>Has Anyone Seen My Stalkers stinky And stinky Jr.????</Title><Username>skiidady</Username><Timestamp>1380641298183</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 11:28:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where'd that stalker/briar go????

Since AMZN will report on Thursday close, I expect AMZN will move up $20 each day on Monday, Tuesday and Wesdesday. That will move AMZN to $389 or $400 a share. On Thursday it will be flat or slightly down because of profits taking. Then earnings will decide Friday's price. It will be $450 if AMZN beats or get back to $300 if AMZN misses. Either way, it is very safe to buy AMZN till Wednesday because GOOG longs have deep pocket and AMZN is their first target to grow their profits even more.</Msg><Username>blust34442</Username><Timestamp>1382324263234</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 22:57:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382324453865-45</Id><Topic><Title>Folks.....
