I think Friday is a hangover from the good old days (last week). The earnings were truly frightening and the way forward is missing entirely. I am applying very tight trailubg stops that I expect to trigger this week when we reopen. I won't short because shorting is too risky for me. But I think 2013 is going to be a very tough year for us all and especially for AMZN.

People should pay attention not to buy from vendors who are in your state. Call me cheap but I like to save 7% on everything, if not every big ticket item, I buy. I also notice since AMZN switched to central distribution model, most of its marketplace vendors have moved (back) to EBay. And Amazon's prices are now higher than EBAY, even higher than Wal-Mart sometimes. I predict buyers will get smart and avoid AMZN at any cost in the next few months. Right now only fools are buying from Amazon.</Msg><Username>blust34442</Username><Timestamp>1351557505041</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 20:38:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351558822071-83</Id><Title>Pumperz are putting up brazen posts considering the ars whip'in they are about to endure...</Title><Msg>Like mel gibson's charactor in Brave Heart.....
