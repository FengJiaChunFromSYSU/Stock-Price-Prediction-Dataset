They took the majority of their position in Q4 providing most of the run up last year (from 220 to 280). They now own 9.3% of outstanding shares, and 11.5% of the float (amazing when you think about this - Bezos &amp; Cap Group own almost 1/3 of stock combined!). AMZN is about 1% of their total assests under mgt (as of Dec 2012) They moved out 3.3% of their shares during Q1. Their lack of accumulation and minor selling is probably what led to AMZN trailing the S&amp;P500 by so much in Q1. My guess is that they also moved a bulk during the drop post earnings, but had to slow selling due to the impact. They are probably having a hard time getting out at these prices. They are very active traders and drive significant movement activity on 2/3 of their portfolio each Q.</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1369227031401</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 08:50:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369227364180-10</Id><Topic><Title>I see Sybil the Clown has all these fake tickets of shorting today: the greatest bull in our lifetime and this clown acts like he's</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1368818058032</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:14:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would a weird, 60 year old self-loathing pizza flyer selling stalker/briar want to know?????

If you think AMZN is undervalued you must check out the income statement for Concurrent (CCUR) over the most recent four quarters: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=CCUR CCUR has seen large, consistent growth every quarter in revenues, gross profit, operating profit, and net income! In fact, CCUR's net income last quarter was up 450% from three quarters ago and its operating income was up 559% from three quarters ago. CCUR successfully reduced operating expenses from being 56.2% of revenues three quarters ago to only 51.8% of revenues last quarter, while simultaneously increasing gross margins from 57.4% to 59.1%. This has allowed CCUR's operating profit margin to rise over the past twelve months from 1.2% all the way up to 7.3%. Last quarter, CCUR reported GAAP EPS of $0.11, which equals non-GAAP EPS of $0.16. CCUR's fundamentals will likely continue improving as they are now beginning to power Virgin Media's Virgin TV Anywhere platform for video on demand (VOD) delivery to the tablets/smartphones of their 3.8mm subscribers. Time Warner Cable just launched their new Android and iOS apps, and CCUR's CDN technology is now powering VOD delivery to the mobile devices of their 12mm subscribers. CCUR's booming business will continue seeing huge growth as pay-TV operators launch multi-screen services to better compete with Netflix (NFLX). NFLX is up 347% over the past year and their quarterly operating income is only up 97% vs. CCUR's operating income up 559%. NFLX's operating margin has only improved from 1.8% to 3.1%, while CCUR's has improved from 1.2% to 7.3%. CCUR operating margins are now 235% above NFLX and NFLX is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 3.48, which would value CCUR at $27.69 up 299% from its current price of $6.94. CCUR's short-term upside potential is huge!</Msg><Username>rblatuis</Username><Timestamp>1369228892697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 09:21:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369229783641-12</Id><Title>Either News Supported or a perfect case of</Title><Msg>manipulation of a price drop 2 minutes before the opening. did you see it on Level 2?

It doesn't work in Japan for 20 years (only make it worse) and it will not work anywhere else. The world is deleveraging after decades of break neck growth due to slower population growth, peak resources extraction, etc...Only GDP growth possible is to some tech advances but at the expenses of job cut which undermines wages, earnings and the overall economy. Thus the only option left is to print, they have to print 5-6% new debt every year to get 3-4% GDP growth some of which is bloated. This is not sustainable. It will blows up due to certain events, debt default, high inflation, or massive deflation if they decided to stop (doubt it) take your pick. All the money they printed does not help the real economy. All it does is make the bankers rich and create more bubbles everywhere like real estate, commodity, stock, loans, bonds, etc.....Global debt is 200 trillion while GDP is only 70 trillion. If just 1% or 2 trillion of this debt got written off than we're phucked as it could trigger massive default everywhere. Some interesting time we're living in.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1369242023025</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 13:00:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369242107771-46</Id><Title>Thank you shorts!</Title><Msg>For giving support here.

The poor and lower middle class to middle middle class are not doing well now and all this #$%$ going on with the FED is not helping them. If anything it's having the opposite affect. Add to this the President puts his healthcare plan in place and small businesses want to stay at 49 full time employees and hire temps making bupkis with no benefits at all.

At some point they will be 5% and maybe more. It wont be because the fed haz raised interest rates to 'cool down a growth cycle'. It will be because china, japan, and the eu insist on highwr rates of return on the treasury auction from over night paper to long dayed bondz. A complacent vix with home mortgagez at 3.25% on 30 year notes, amd junk muni and corp bondz flying out the door at 1.5% do not reflect the risk trouble thats brewing in the GIGANTIC bond bubble, but at some point they will fully price risk much to bernankes dissapointment. When interest 1st begin to rise it will be billed by the yakity yak media az a 'buy the banks' under a yeild recovery, and bernanke may say 'we have inflation again, and this iz healthy. We can scale back bond purchasez'. But then they will rise uncontrolably az a bond defualt fire storm catchez across the corporate junk and muniz , quickly ripping the gvt central banx buried in this trash. The yeild curve will invert with short term rate yeilds spiking to infinity, lending of all formz will lock up, and then KABOOM! Out go the lights - nice job ben. Are you ready sheeple?

We crossed the point of no return for putting the next crash in the books when the s&amp;p crossed 1250 wirhout halt to money printing.... If we were in a 'healthy' recovery (one where rich dudez go unassisted by the fed) then the s&amp;p would be somewhere around 1000. Now in this 'pay me now or pay me later' zero sum gain , bitcoin economey of printed bernanke bux on top of 30 yearz of agressive fed intervention, we will have to go lower than 2003, lower than 2008, and possibly risk global currency and military warz to burn off the excess... History repeats its self over and over and the more people and intervention, the more amplified the events. Bernanke should have stopped at TARP. That was qe monthly, qe3, qe 2, qe1, operation twist, and zero percent interest rates 'for an extended period of time' ago... We are truely fvcked for the near foreseeable future, at least until 2018 with a slow crawl out.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1369278187649</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 23:03:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369278503830-102</Id><Topic><Title>market cant stand without bernanke money</Title><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1369250511186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 15:21:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Lol they are so scared."
