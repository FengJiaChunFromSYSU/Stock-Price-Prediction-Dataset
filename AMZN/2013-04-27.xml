But sales of digital content helped boost revenues for the quarter by 22% to more than $16bn. Its gross profit margin - a closely-watched measure by investors - also increased to 26.6%, from 24% a year ago. In recent months, Amazon has been investing heavily in building new warehouses to improve delivery times, as well as launching new products such as its Kindle range and online film and video content. Analysts say its strategy is to ensure longer-term success at the cost of short-term profits.</Msg><Username>shamin195</Username><Timestamp>1367068666599</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 09:17:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367068713232-23</Id><Title>i did ok shorting an going long this week</Title><Msg>amzn did me well</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1367068713232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 09:18:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367069689086-24</Id><Topic><Title>Amzn will be ok</Title><Username>kotharivk</Username><Timestamp>1367063452237</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 07:50:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let me summarize a post I just wrote which did not get posted here.

It can be inferred that they've been under a 3 month distribution cycle az this pig haz failed to put in a new high while the markets have, so it can be assumed that those sneaky bot runnerz have been selling into market strength to ever hopeful bagz. Until the market az a whole turnz and crashez, this will fall at a seemingly alarming rate, yet it will be moderate in relative termz. Large drops will be accompanied by glorious short squeezez, az the pile on bandwaggon shorts jump in and create some nice fvck en pops to short. It will rise during shortsqueezez of 15% short interest band waggonerz, but rise under the premise that : A 50% drop requirez a 100% gain, so a 30% shoet squeeze from 120 wont add up to the baggie lossez, only give them false hope az they hang on for dear life. When the markets do go into crash mode, this pig will trade sub 30.00. The end.

You'll alwayz want to keep a base load of shorts and swing trade around that base loaded position by shorting the rips and covering the dips. If this pig managez to rize again then you'll want to have more shorts then what you have now the next time it hits this level in the fall, if it rizez. What you DONT want to do iz bet 'all in' short here, just in case a well funded hedgie deciedz to pull a crazy ivan and take this thing to 320 by sparking off forced short covering. You dont want to be the one stuck having to cover while sybil iz shorting the sharez that have fallen out of your dead bloody hand that iz grasping the mouse that clicked 'buy to cover'. Furthermore dont trade optionz. They are the scam siren call of the cboe, claiming that you will be rich instantly for a 200.00 trade. If you buy 200.00 of optionz then you will lose 180.00 to 200.00 - get it? Finally,sybs says all of this because you dont want to find that you've covered for a 'bounce' az it drops from here to 220, then accelerates lower to 205 and 180 az you wait for that 'bounce', which will never be satisfying enough for you to chase it. People arent emotionally built to chase. If you cover 255 shorts, you wont want to reopen them at 205 - you need to trust sybil: short trade this pig around a core short position.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367111546139</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 21:12:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367111995045-47</Id><Topic><Title>they made me toil with $5000 loss on 200 shares of AMZN and margin acct</Title><Username>kotharivk</Username><Timestamp>1367101549360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 18:25:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry about you luck, but thank you for loaning sybil your 264 sharez from your margin account for sybil to sell for you .
