Its funny... Sybil has never seen markets like this - ever... In '99 stox were high, very high. But everybody loved them, adored those stox, haaaad to have them.... In 1932 stox were hated, very hated, nnnnoooooooobody wanted a stok in 1932 - they were very low cost then.... But in 2012 stox are both very high AND very hated..... Very unusual world that bernanke created....

You can be convincingly dead wrong at times... Its monitary policy thats got us here.... Algo trading just increased the pace of the bs, but the fuel comes from talf, tarp, qe1, qe2, possible qe3, operation twist, and prolonged low interest rates that shall remain in place 'for an extended period of time'.... All of which without we would be trading at 600 off of a 450 bounce - true s&amp;p value, and useless government svcs would already be in the tank.... Its where we are heading at some point - its just bernanke, geitner &amp; co staved it off so the 1%ers could get their sheit in order.... Keep trying tech - you'll get it eventually... In the meantime STOP TRADING SCAM OPTIONS BRO.</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1344828513000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 23:28:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344829785000-13</Id><Topic><Title>The only idiots that think amzn is going up are the spammerz</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1344797753000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 14:55:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybs: I get it in spades. While I think the S&amp;P is too high because historical mutliples that relied upon massive growth of the effective money supply (read credit, not base money) are ridiculous comps in a world of deleveraging (even with Fed printing to reinflate to the extent possible). What I am talking about is the predatory trading scams that pervade this market, espeially on low float stocks. They have little to do with QE per se.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1344829785000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 23:49:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344830120000-14</Id><Topic><Title>The only idiots that think amzn is going up are the spammerz</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1344797753000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 14:55:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thoze scamz will exist no matter what....
