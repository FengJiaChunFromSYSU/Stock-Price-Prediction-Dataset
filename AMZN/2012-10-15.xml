Having said that, TI's board should be sued by shareholders if they agree to anything other than an all cash deal... If Amazon uses cash, it will just accelerate its demise. That would be open season for all shorts. In summary, it makes no sense except as a vehicle to preserve some value of a massively overvalued currency known as Amazon's stock.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1350305627876</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 08:53:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350305748752-16</Id><Topic><Title>And to think last year, this nation was threatened with bank runs,</Title><Username>mets41us</Username><Timestamp>1256561272000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2009-10-26 08:47:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You go first.

"While we have significantly outperformed the international equity markets we focus on over a multi-year period, we have not generated attractive absolute returns in an exceptionally difficult environment. The last eighteen months have been particularly difficult," the firm wrote to clients, as reported by Reuters, which also reported that the fund was down 11 percent through August. Is an 11 percent loss enough to cause most $1 billion hedge funds to shut down, and return funds to limited partners? Lots of funds have suffered worse. Just look at John Paulson, his flagship funds have been hit with even bigger losses. While the two funds have fared well recently, they are still down for the year, and after a disastrous 2011, it will be a long time before they get back to their high water marks. So is Octavian pulling the trigger a bit early? Shouldn't they be willing to stick it out? It's hard to know what went into the decision-making process. One could argue that the managers looked into the future and just couldn't see a path to outsized gains, though once-toxic assets seem to be faring better now. Management might have decided that trying to get back to even would take forever, so why not throw in the towel and avoid the chance of bigger losses for investors later. It's also possible that the funds' losses are bigger than publicly known, and perhaps extend for a longer time horizon. In any case, more funds have been shuttering this year, compared with last year. Each no doubt has a different story to tell.

"So while it is true that stocks have advanced a few percent since March, my strong view is that this is good fortune born entirely of investor anticipation of ECB and Fed announcements that are now behind us. Indeed, the S&amp;P 500 is lower now than when QEternity was announced, and on a volume-weighted basis, is also lower than when Draghi threw his hail-Mary pass over the Bundesbank. By our estimate, the present ensemble of market conditions is associated with a historical rate of loss in the S&amp;P 500 approaching -50% annualized. Now, I donâ€™t expect conditions to be similarly negative for a full year - the typical course is for the market to transition to less negative conditions after an initial hard decline. But I continue to believe that the gain in the S&amp;P 500 since March, when our return/risk estimates became overwhelmingly negative, should not be the basis for complacency here.

All one has to do is look at the relative valuation of Intel and Amazon and it becomes crystal clear. One of the most innovative companies in the history of the world, which generates huge cash, has a great balance sheet and still dominates the processor landscape, is worth less than a internet retailer which has almost never generated significant cash nor made large profits -- all on a story. As long as the institutions play these games, they will destroy trust and more cash will move to non financial assets... Folks thought they could compel retail investors back into stocks. They are wrong. The distrust is too great.

The uncollected tax exceeds Amazon's net margins...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1350345139292</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 19:52:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350348857027-162</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN is a con.
