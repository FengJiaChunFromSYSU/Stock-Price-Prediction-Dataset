That's exactly why you shorted from $180 and the stock is approaching $280 strongly against your investing thesis. You cherry pick the inappropriate "multiyear" timeframes. The share price is not based on a timeframe held strictly to the years you happen to select from the recent past. It is based on recent years plus a projection out into future years which should yield the large returns which will be the results of those past investments. If just to illustrate you have Year 1 at -5 and Year 2 at - 10 in the past, but Year X some years beyond that at +30 or +40 and even larger returns subsequent to that year, it makes no sense to have cherry picked only Year 1 and 2 in order to have evaluated the life-time value of the investment.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1360127740873</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 00:15:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360131925402-2</Id><Title>New price target for AMZN</Title><Msg>324.60 in the May-June time frame after a small correction into the low 240's.</Msg><Username>imshortemc</Username><Timestamp>1360131925402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 01:25:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360144153217-3</Id><Title>Living Social's Competitor Spreebird Doing Well</Title><Msg>20-Page Hardcover Photo Book $10 for 20-Page 8.5x11 Hardcover Photo Book ($39.99 Val ue) Time Remaining 3 days, 5 hrs, 49 mins 282 Bought Limited Quantity Available Fresh Valentine's Day Flowers &amp; More $15 for $30 of Fresh Valentine's Day Flowers, Gifts &amp; More Time Remaining 2 days, 5 hrs, 47 mins 113 Bought Limited Quantity Available iPhone 4/4s or iPod Armband With Earphones $15 for One iPhone 4/4s OR iPod Armband &amp; Earphones with Microphone &amp; Volume Control ($50 Value) Time Remaining 2 days, 5 hrs, 46 mins 68 Bought iPad Mini Case with Bluetooth Keyboard $30 for One iPad Mini Case with Bluetooth Keyboard ($70 Val Time Remaining 2 days, 2 hrs, 45 mins 57 Bought Limited Quantity Available ue) Electric Wine Bottle Opener $20 for One Automatic Electric Corkscrew Wine Bottle Opener ($50 Value) Time Remaining 2 hrs, 44 mins, 14 secs 84 Bought Limited Quantity Available Face &amp; Body Cleansing Brush $33 for One 5-Piece Face &amp; Body Cleansing Brush ($100 Value) Shipping &amp; Handling Included!

The ROIC has shown a consistent degredation over the years now. Inventory turns have dropped. The fact the you (and most analysts it seems) are either unwilling or unable to understand the true cost drivers of the business does not change the real world economics.

" When the investment thesis involves future there can be no "real" numbers. Those looking for them wind up like you, frustrated. What the market does is simply look at Amazon's track record of going for several years into investment programs that begin with losses and end with multiple years of huge profits. So it isn't measuring by isolated strings of annual ROIC but rather multiple years of investment expansion followed by large returns in multiple years. If you haven't figured that out in the past numbers, then my posting anything is not going to change your mind. You're simply too lazy to look at the SEC filings over that long a period. I challenge you to put up specific numbers that refute what I have described above. "(TGT, WMT matching), state tax collection shifts the mix in adverse ways (both product and channel). That's just to start." Ha! What a joke. Brick and mortar are simply showrooms for Amazon. Even those retailers you name are going the way of BKS and BBY. I guess you didn't realize that Walmart is essential flat in marketshare gains during the past 3 years. Factoring in inflation, Walmart's growth over that stretch is probably NEGATIVE. And over a 5 year period, as Amazon more than tripled its share of retail with 225% growth vs. 18% for Walmart. Again, factoring in inflation, Walmart grew by only 1-2% per year during that time or essentially flat. Now that Amazon can move right next to where customers live it is going to cut even further into brick and mortar share.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1360175231012</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 13:27:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360175444105-89</Id><Topic><Title>has been acting very sick,since the earnings report</Title><Username>chugibugi</Username><Timestamp>1360175131099</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 13:25:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bought 200 FEB16 265 puts at 6.45, hope i won't be sorry,wish me luck</Msg><Username>chugibugi</Username><Timestamp>1360175444105</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 13:30:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360175489042-90</Id><Topic><Title>Missed target, AMZN should go to hxll.

Huge profits? I know you like to pump but at least don't be so obvious. AMZN since 2001 has made almost as much profits as Target makes in a year. $4.4 Billion (since 2001) vs $3.4 billion( this year for target) "Brick and mortar are simply showrooms for Amazon." Yes like target with profits that Amazon has never ever been close to.

In other words, you should make a big margin by overcharging customers so that you have the luxury of cutting those margins from say 30 to 20% coming under pressure from razor thin margin e-tailer only to see your (Apple's) share price lose $100 to $200 a share as a result? Short's think it is "easy". They should tell BKS or BBY just how easy it is. What a laugh! How much have those companies been "growing" recently. Hey, it's so easy!

But their spending rarely goes to zero. From home you can still want to something, and you can order so frictionlessly from Amazon. The same has always happened in the past when oil prices went up. Amazon sales just increased. Didn't help shorts at all. And then when people get used to it the pent up demand hits and they go out and spend more and more at Amazon anyway. Over the past 5 years oil prices did not go down and yet Amazon revenue grew 225%. Shorts simply can't do math if they think oil prices are a useful thing to them.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1360179777726</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 14:42:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360180128670-124</Id><Title>yes, revenue its up, profits have went toward 0, many of the spends are "capitalized" so profits shouldn't go to 0</Title><Msg>and nobody saying spending goes to 0, but it can diminsh.

And they're very rapidly capitalized so there is no one to one correspondence between a single year's earnings and the proportion of the cost that gets amortized. As previously, by the time they're running closer to full capacity, so little if any depreciation as a % of sales will be being amortized resulting in huge, huge profits that will astound the tiny imaginations of you skeptics. You'd have thought shorts had figured that out by now. But they don't.

AWS related investments will have 2-3 years useful lives as technology infrastructure has exceptionally short useful lives. In fact, Amazon is at a disadvantage in its historical buildout because the new Haswell based servers have far better energy/performance tradeoffs and energy (including cooling to move the server heat out...) is a very material portion of the TCO... And the prices Amazon can charge is capped by price matching from competitors. Where it used to have a 5-10% tax subsidy, it is losing that in the most populous states...

Welcome to Amazon math. They have come up with a new accounting practice call Amazon math where you only add the revenue and do not subtract expenses. And all those analysts out there love it, they cheer it and they bump up the price target on your stock based on what else? Amazon Math Now, we can extend this concept to US government and stop subtracting deficit from GDP and whoa, we have surplus, spend, spend, spend... thanks to the Amazon math.

In 2006 he had 101M in shares, now he has 87M in shares remaining. Compare the amount Bezos has made from his sales to that to how much AMZN has made in profits since it's inception 17 years ago, $1.9 billion.... And that is just Bezos since 2008, I am pretty sure all insider sales since inception is much higher than the $1.9 Billion.
