LOL you're like one of those Apple fans who think Apple can price-match the Kindle and still make money. I'm saying it's *extremely* hard for any business to survive on razor thin margins. No business can compete with Amazon by cutting prices overnight. Amazon did this by scaling their business from the ground up over a decade. I bet retailers that price-match amazon are already losing money, and they're fighting a war of attrition. Amazon will win and the others will fold because they'll run out of cash before Amazon does. If you're comparing Google's "cloud" offering with Amazon web services, that just shows that you have NO clue what amazon web services really offer. Why don't you compare Amazon web services with Apple's iCloud since you're already comparing apples and oranges.</Msg><Username>axbggy</Username><Timestamp>1358247893689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 06:04:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358249053791-11</Id><Topic><Title>Don't forget NFLX $330 to 52?

It's AMZN who was running low on cash. Not that it matter in the analysis coming from Wallstreet or the algorithmic HFT program to keep running it higher for some hedgefund.

Howerver, the disappointment of not growing earnings was merely met with buying and changing the AMZN story. That's shown from the stock rally from 166.97 end of the year low to where we are now on earnings going toward 0. So it's hard to know if the lack of making money is considered a disappointment and what will qualify as one. WS has put on a fullcourt press to drees up AMZN as if there never was these past disappointment. It's called favoring the "loss leaders." And going on for quite some time now. Mom and Pop should run as far as they can from this kind of stock, no doubt, but that doesn't keep the HFT algorithyms from it and driving it up to the moon. If they can drive it to this level of nonsense,who knows what will scare them off. Certainly the fact that they had to hit the bond market shows that the fundemental case of not making money has made them have to get some. I've counted 5 recs by WS in the last 5 days on excuses mosly ranging from not worrying about not making money. My question is when do you then? It's now a $123 billion company as a loss leader. This is at,it's core, supported by Bernanke bucks. That's why the Fed deserve the abuse of unbridled printing to support market as it's gottonin the past from the likes of Ron Paul and Stephen Roach. It's should be translated as supporting nonsense, like the housing bubble and tech bubbles of yesteryear. AMZN is at the heart of it this time around. Certainly surreal to see AAPL crack and continued support of the loss leaders. That's a hedge fund phenomena in action. good luck.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1358258821676</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 09:07:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358259629414-33</Id><Topic><Title>buy the dip, sell the rip</Title><Username>bluebloodedtrader</Username><Timestamp>1358257920950</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 08:52:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sure, they disgarded the fact the last 4 qtrs: but in a comparative to the real word values of other stocks, they are have not/are not close to being good enough.

Think AAPL proving that there is a highly profitable market for nice, upscale, a touch-of-upper class feel smart phones and apps for everyone one. Now, the competition (like Samsung) sees that there is a market, they are going after what AAPL had had to build. And, what happened to AAPL stock price? Note: AAPL stock price got hit simply due to a change in the strategic prospect. AAPL is makes a ton of money, but the strategic picture changed.

I was bearish at 650. But, I said then that AAPL has superior UNIT COSTS to any other player. As such, if AAPL wanted to get more aggressive on price, it could still make healthy margins. AAPL will partner with INTC on next gen chips and reestablish the unique performance characteristics of the devices. Any fund manager buying AMZN here and selling AAPL should be sued for gross negligence.

That is what makes a market. And AMZN is about technology infrastructure and building the platform..not to confuse with the items that they are selling..that is other people's business, Amzn provides the infrastructure - scalable which is key and no borders - yes, they still have to deal with growing regulation on ecommerce but nothing on the horizon suggest ecommerce will be choked off by regulations. Kindle might be sold at a loss to get users onto the platform, and I would argue that is where the upside is... suppose they get more traction and sell at a gain? whereas apple is going the other way, their huge margins in a commodity business is unsustainable. And Apple's mgmt team ex-Jobs is less than impressive, this is not Jobs Apple anymore. I don't see resizing ipad and iphones as innovation.

It isn't just a function of higher oil prices. But, the conclusion you reach is correct (although this would have massive downside even if oil slipped because the economic driver isn't oil price per se, that just happens to reinforce the effect). Amazon is a scam. Amazon is moving closer toward being a brick and mortar retailer every day, yet its multiple continues to diverge from that of bricks and mortar. One would think at least 1 analyst out there would catch the irony in that. The math doesn't work and will not work. And, it will get worse in time.

Amazon faces other tax troubles in the United States and abroad. Amazon received a $252 million demand from French tax authorities at the end of last year.

I am always suspicious of that. The article is fact. But, I increasingly think there are bigger issues... I'm going to do some more due diligence around the disclosures of cash position and tax liability at the time of the debt offering... Amazon had been notified of by the IRS at that time. At first glance, I saw none. I find that remarkable given the possible cash flow issues Amazon had at the time of the offering (in Q3 net ST assets and liabilities were about equal and the shipping/advertising had to burn cash). I'm going to ask an expert on securities regulation (have one in the family...).

I have posted under 1 other alias when blocked and always disclose. My issue is with people creating additional aliases to spam the board... Still researching the debt financing documents for disclosures of then current cash position and IRS tax issue... I have yet to find anything that provides more updated financials than the previous quarter (particularly cash position as of the financing) and explicit recognition of the IRS claim. I am surprised by the lack of explicit disclosure of these items which changed materially after the Q3 report. From the registration: Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and consumer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet and online commerce, the amount that we invest in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE OWE INCOME TAXES, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Registrant enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions, and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2012, under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” It seems that material facts were OMITTED from bondholders...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1358312336923</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 23:58:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
