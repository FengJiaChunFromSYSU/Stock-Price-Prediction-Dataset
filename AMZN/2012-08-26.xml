Its a reasonable assumption. Most retailers use 50%." yoiu have not idea what you are talking about nor do I. What the AMZN bears fail to realize is that even massive capital costs spread out over 30 years can still wipe out current earnings. So the official PE is meaningless. Other methods must be used" Name another that was able to do that over 30 years. WMT didn't when Sam Walton grew that. Also, I have read many stock market books that warn against shorting high PE stocks unless a downtrend is already underway. Some of these books were written before Amazon even existed." Wasn't the subject once again, about whether it's a good short as it hasn't been. The issue goes to the profit model while captializing costs. It's interesting you seem to be focused on this I havn't see you on this board before for 10 years. And now your pushing the cheapness of AMZN. interesting. Did you just become enlightened or something after it's run from 5 to 250?</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1345983718744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 08:21:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345984141541-3</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN real PE = 8</Title><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1345867325335</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 00:02:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>in fact, what you are doing here is increasing your liabiilties without increasing the equity against assets.

I then began playing with AMZN as a bear because the options volume on CMG was too small. Like many people, I started as a bear because of the sales tax issue. Unlike CMG, AMZN isn't heavily shorted and the shorts tend to be professionals. So why are the pros bullish on AMZN when many stocks are already in bear declines? I offer an explanation. However, as you have pointed out, the earnings might not materialize. After Jan 1 that fear might sink in.</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1345988295077</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 09:38:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346010100884-5</Id><Title>PE 299</Title><Msg>AMZN is undervalued at anything under a 400 PE.

Great plan to get customers if it is true. Even if they only charge like 10 bucks the sales would be thru the roof. tie that to some coupon deal and you get a 300 dollar price tag on the stock and a PE still under 400.

"Apple's strategy of enforcing patents against other device makers is starting to work out, so it may stay the course," says Mueller. "It could step up its enforcement against Motorola Mobility and later go against Motorola's parent company directly." But, he adds, "If I were in Apple's shoes the next company I would sue is not Google, but Amazon, which has an even weaker patent portfolio than Google and sells large volumes of Android-based devices with a subsidies-centric revenue model, which is even more of a threat to Apple's margins than Google's advertising-based model." Amazon (AMZN). That's an elephant I hadn't even considered. ----------- Read this article FORTUNE -- There was an elephant in the courtroom when Apple (AAPL) won its billion-dollar patent infringement award against Samsung Friday, and its name is Google (GOOG).</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1346014667276</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 16:57:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346016499802-10</Id><Title>300 PE -AMZON stock is cheap?
