Find someone that truly understands activity based costing or has been a world class operations consultant and you'll find out what I mean. This is a ponzi and someday people are going to look back at the disclosurs (and lack thereof) in the Q4 debt offering. The foundation in this country is crumbling because to much overhead fincial weight is being placed upon increasingly scarce productive investment.

Another good quote from his article ; "“For as long as I can remember, veteran businessmen and investors – I among them – have been warning about the dangers of irrational stock speculation and hammering away at the theme that stock certificates are deeds of ownership and not betting slips… The professional investor has no choice but to sit by quietly while the mob has its day, until the enthusiasm or panic of the speculators and non-professionals has been spent. He is not impatient, nor is he even in a very great hurry, for he is an investor, not a gambler or a speculator. The seeds of any bust are inherent in any boom that outstrips the pace of whatever solid factors gave it its impetus in the first place. There are no safeguards that can protect the emotional investor from himself.” - J.

This is the message sent loudly by the elites saying, f-the fundamentals and economics we got money and power and we will get what we want even if it does not make sense. If things does get hairy, we can always ditch the dollars/ paper assets and move to fill in blank currencies/ physical assets and let the "commoners" pick up the tab.
