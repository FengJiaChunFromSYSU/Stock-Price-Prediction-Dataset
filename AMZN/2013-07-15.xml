Not even management internally knows the timing. It is simply a project driven model where timing of that kind matters much less. Projects are run by discrete, not central groups in the company, and they simply wait until markets are ready to respond on their own. Obviously for the sake of structuring roll outs they will have certain estimates or targets such as with the introduction of Kindle. Those estimates could be wrong and you could end up with a shortage of product as did happen in that instance. Implicit in their model is that markets essential develop on their own for the most part. You can do what you can to stimulate demand but only to a point. You can't really control or predict precise timing. For momentum traders this can be very frustrating. For a long-term investor quite the opposite and very rewarding. Timber's whole thesis is based on market crashes and he simply got lucky during those times and wiped out afterwards pretending he understood one iota of Amazon's business. He understands nothing about the business. He won't be back unless their is another crash. And that won't matter to me since I will just add more and see those shares go up as you said 9 fold a few years later since the drop would have nothing to do with Amazon operating performance.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1373876265544</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 04:17:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373878057028-5</Id><Topic><Title>crack head optionz</Title><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1373821940466</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 13:12:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So we have 7.2M shares of option action this week.

If Wal-Mart decides to let third party sellers use there name like Amazon this could be game changer. Wal-Mart already has the distribution centers less delivery charges. Amazon is loosing money on the other services you mentioned KIndle, video creation, cloud computing. Amazon bread and butter is e-commerce site with third party selling. Use Amazons name to sell products. This is where the cash flow is created. The books are being sold low price. The electronics is the big ticket seller.

I'm prepared to lose it all since my investment is small compared to the potential gain. Again, I will be looking for another options setup going into earnings next week. Bulls have been right for a long time however IMHO we are at nosebleed levels regarding valuation and technically AMZN is looking tired from a long perspective. If I'm wrong, I'll trade another day.</Msg><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1373927999140</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:39:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373928154772-134</Id><Topic><Title>Tail_risk, dont bash sybby for what the robots do</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1373927372682</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:29:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybil: Don't underestimate institutions desire to lock in some profits prior to next weeks earnings call.</Msg><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1373928154772</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:42:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373929102572-135</Id><Topic><Title>Sybs gonna forego bashing stupid pumperz with no livez today to tell you what iz going on here with scazon price action</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1373925104196</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 17:51:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>actually,looking at Sybils predictions today, he was rghit: he said the morning AMZN would bottom and then be another up round of push into margin short covering. And that probably happened. That, or it bottomed when ex-Goldbug showed up spewing "Einhorn is in" and "don't let AMZN do a CMG" posts, which is ALWAYS good for a rally as he's an unmitigated disaster for the shorts here. That's the pattern I've seen at least. In fact, he's so bad ,I sometimes think he does it on purpose b/c he's on the other side . lol!</Msg><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1373929102572</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:58:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373929577230-136</Id><Topic><Title>Nasdaq_6000 should not be alloewd to post on behalf of the pumperz because he ownz no stok</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1373926800358</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:20:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybil , stop losing $1 million in carried shorts you fakely put up here with no stops and maybe you'll have an ounce of credibliltiy to say what others do and how one should handle these markets. Your way on these boards has been unmitigated disaseer. . You really shold shut your mouth, and try to make even one of your fake trades work b/c your've been gushing too much 'fake" money to have one iota of credibility.
