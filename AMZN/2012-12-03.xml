The money made in the financial markets is now from trading, not investing. The solution is actually to NOT increase dividend taxes or to do so minimally (to 20%) but to extend the ST capital gains holding period to 3 years. 3-5 years 20% and 5 years or more 15%. Doing that would lead to real investment in productive assets again, bring the market back into balance and restore trust in the markets.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354543079795</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 08:57:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354543353723-20</Id><Topic><Title>sad: remember the days in 1980;s to 1990's when the stock market went up and the dolar did to with it</Title><Username>im_too_hipp</Username><Timestamp>1354540603640</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 08:16:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as we can keep kicking the can down the road, the doom day will never come.</Msg><Username>blust34442</Username><Timestamp>1354543353723</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:02:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354543456148-21</Id><Title>The 314.00 Price Target could be achieved by Jan 15-19th as earnings are the 31st</Title><Msg>Record earnings, sales and revenues are obvious. Only 2% of the float is short. Even the bashers on the AMZN board are really long. I told you the 20% of Hedge Funds down on the year will try to get even or positive 2-5% by grabbing AMZN in a big way knowing Amzn will fly right by its 52 week high and up to its 314.00 target or better. The future of tech is the war between AMZN GOOG and AAPL with Amazon over 100 Billion dollars cheaper as far as market caps go. Amzn is selling so many kindles and thus future content, its cloud business is the best, most trusted, and fastest growing because it was voted the easiest to use. Online sales, they are killing it, they are paying off campus and distribution centers while adding ac to keep the workers happy and thus doing the right thing. It is to the point why bother checking other places and prices, Amzn is always the best price and now they are adding two different categories of private seller listings of both new and used listings, (stepping all over ebays territory and of course we all know AMZN will do it better, and in time be more successful at what ebay has done for years.) AMAZON just picks an area and then they dominate it, leaving skeletons of the former competitors behind. All Amazon has to do us produce 5 or 6 series as good as the series HBO and Showtime produce, at which point I would fill my entire IRA with AMZN shares and add bi weekly.</Msg><Username>dramatic_move_up</Username><Timestamp>1354543456148</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:04:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354544043411-22</Id><Topic><Title>Doesn't make sense. . .</Title><Username>rgc99</Username><Timestamp>1354542475723</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 08:47:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't worry, as most stocks get held up, the lead mm's in Amzn like to hold amzn back until the ask starts getting whacked so bad they have to let it go, then they start buying like crazy and a fury of buying starts leading to Amazon up 10-15 points in 1 day! AMZN is long overdue for a 12-15 point up day in just 1 day. If you look at the 6 month chart you will see last time AMZN hit 245, it basically went straight to 264, this time when we break 264, it will be smooth sailing till 280, panic buying will start in Amazon soon as everyone knows we are going over 300 by the end of the year or very close. Nobody is stupid enough to short Amzn ahead of its best time of the year for earnings, Jan 31st, but I wish the shorts would make a stand, for no other reason but to move us up to where we are going anyway just faster is all.</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1354544043411</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:14:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354544090776-23</Id><Title>OH YEAH ROCKA &amp; ROLL AMAZON $253</Title><Msg>LET'S ROCKA</Msg><Username>italiaole</Username><Timestamp>1354544090776</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:14:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354544754029-24</Id><Title>Today I am selling half my position to shorts LOL</Title><Msg>Today I am selling half my position to shorts LOL</Msg><Username>italiaole</Username><Timestamp>1354544754029</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:25:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354545022455-25</Id><Topic><Title>The 314.00 Price Target could be achieved by Jan 15-19th as earnings are the 31st</Title><Username>dramatic_move_up</Username><Timestamp>1354543456148</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:04:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, they will have record sales AND revenue!

Keep on losing money, your pathetic efforts to affect the stock price is laughable. *************** I am for local shopping. Much better small independently owned retailers, but TGT and WMT are still much better than Amazon because significantly more of the value remains circulating in the local economy. Amazon's artificial tax subsidy led people to believe it was a more efficient model. It will become clear in time that Amazon's model is NOT more efficient than TGT or WMT. In terms of internet shopping, I am a strong advocate of Google's solution which essentially enables consumers to optimize for price, location and source. It is an inherently superior approach to Amazon's which leverages the already overbuilt distribution and retail infrastructure rather than investing more new capital in what needn't be built. The only pathetic thing is "investors" cheerleading epic malinvestment simply because float manipulating algos have (temporarily) increased the value of the company based on how the stock trades rather than its underlying economic value capture potential. So laugh at my efforts... I encouraged you and others to vote your values with your wallets... You are entitled to your perspective, even if it will be proven laughable over the longer term.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354551854376</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:24:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354552093634-66</Id><Topic><Title>sad: remember the days in 1980;s to 1990's when the stock market went up and the dolar did to with it</Title><Username>im_too_hipp</Username><Timestamp>1354540603640</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 08:16:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bruce: Implementing it would mean sending a detailed, thoughtful and critical analysis to the states and the state pension plans why ANY subsidy of Amazon's buildout or ownership of its stock/bonds is undermining their LT solvency.

On a different note, 6 months ago I bought grandma a Roku tv set top box along with a Netflix subscription. I also gave the Netflix password to several family members. Netflix has cleverly designed their service to be shared as long as only one movie is being streamed at a time. As our Netflix viewing has increased, we have had to buy more subscriptions. At $8/month, I don't see how Amazon Prime ($80/year) can compete with Netflix.

So I have to conclude here that the traders are doing just what Cramer said they would do and using AMZN as a bullish trade barometer on the online Holiday sales story and ignoring whether the overall market is with it or no.</Msg><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1354566570439</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 15:29:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354566701283-109</Id><Title>AMZN is falling and they can't get out , TIC TOC ready for the drop SLOW DOWN HAS STARTED ISM is tanking</Title><Msg>AMZN is falling and they can't get out , TIC TOC ready for the drop SLOW DOWN HAS STARTED ISM is tanking</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1354566701283</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 15:31:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354567276241-110</Id><Title>down 4</Title><Msg>down 4 from the days high</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1354567276241</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 15:41:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354567701283-111</Id><Title>Move over rover, now sybbys takin over</Title><Msg>Biatchez...

Amazon is taking a big slice of Ebays cash business and will show Ebay how it is really done with a much cleaner interface. AMZN will go bonkers tomorrow, the hedge funds will get crazy aggressive grabbing even more Amazon shares, the mutual funds know its time to add more shares of AMZN tomorrow and the Cramer fans will be buying AMZN hand over fist as 300 by the end of January is guaranteed and if it is as big a blowout as many think it will be, AMZN will gap up to 340 in after hours.

"Amazon is 1% of global retail sales..." A classic lesson from Marketing 101: Not properly segmenting the addressable market opportunity... It's not surprising since Amazon lacks any truly coherent strategic focus and none of the analysts (and certainly pumper in Chief Jim Cramer) have ever challenged the strategic coherence and addressable market... Is it now going to dominate restaurant sales? Spa? Auto repair? Gasoline sales? Oh wait... GRPN is better positioned to serve certain of those categories... And, certain of those categories (gasoline retail) will never be meaningfully served by Amazon or Groupon... The reality is that Amazon's business model is more efficient for a small subset of retail sales. For most, it is an inferior proposition. The irony is the number of product/categories for which it is superior is declining over time, not increasing.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354578775149</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 18:52:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354578917165-141</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer still likes this overvalued</Title><Username>wuwuwu3</Username><Timestamp>1354576847970</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 18:20:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll be your huckleberry...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354578917165</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 18:55:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354579183457-142</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer still likes this overvalued</Title><Username>wuwuwu3</Username><Timestamp>1354576847970</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 18:20:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's see if this one gets through...
