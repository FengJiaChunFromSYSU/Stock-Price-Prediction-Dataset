APPL is making about $40 a share, Amazon is making zero profit. APPL dropped about 30%, Amazon will probably drop about 80%. Unless of course Amazon has to declare bankruptcy in which case it will drop to zero.</Msg><Username>jimdupont</Username><Timestamp>1378141171715</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-02 12:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378157400234-2</Id><Title>Off to the races for AMZN tomorrow?

It seems as if Syria is now 'off the table' and Europe and Asia are off to the races today while US markets are closed. It's likely to flutter lower at the end of the week but I won't be surprised to see a rising tide lift all boats tomorrow before fear/reality sink in and markets creep lower on the week... again. G/L trading but I expect it to pop on Tuesday with the markets.</Msg><Username>soonersof_ou</Username><Timestamp>1378157400234</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-02 17:30:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378164425877-3</Id><Topic><Title>techstr</Title><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1377866732070</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 08:45:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4???????

Smells like a move back to 285 easily tomorrow... Pray for a slow open tomorrow and jumping on some AAPL and GOOG calls as they both are likely to crush it this week following recent pull backs and 'no news' getting in the way of the rally until possible employment report on Fri~ Bummer for the puts I currently have in AMZN, guaranteed to get destroyed at the open tomorrow, just wondering if the rally fizzles all week and we close lower.... what to do.
