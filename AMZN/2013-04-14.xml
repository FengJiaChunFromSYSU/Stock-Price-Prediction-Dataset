Now its 0.09 and the stock has traded roughly flat. Have to agree with you... amzn should be able to be 0.09. Who knows what that will do to the stock price though. Remember, for q4 2012 they missed rev by a billion and missed esp too. Of course the stock traded up. Unreal. Needless to say, this stock is unpredictable.</Msg><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1365956059304</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 12:14:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365956259686-5</Id><Topic><Title>Guess this week's price action:</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1365950523823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 10:42:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey sybil, have to say that I could see amzn go to the 250's easily. We've got problems in europe, plus n korea will likely let off a test missile monday. a lot of things could push this thing lower. manipulating the price to earn a few $$$ on option premiums doesn't seem strong enough to keep this thing trading sideways into earnings.</Msg><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1365956259686</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 12:17:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365959546047-6</Id><Topic><Title>Geegee you are one annoying fvck.... you can even get under tech's skin</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1365902825920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 21:27:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybs: Geegee is just a tiny cog in the wheel. His overlords will dispose of him when it it convenient and he will find after years of existing to taunt people on message boards that he has little to offer the world. Whatever wealth people have will be largely redistributed through defaults, inflation and if anything is left, through taxes. Those of us who figure what that which will create recurring value AFTER the reset will be the long term winners. That is actually where I focus.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1365959546047</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 13:12:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365964409353-7</Id><Topic><Title>Guess this week's price action:</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1365950523823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 10:42:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amzn will be 250, 150, and 50 in time - all that sybs will say iz you cant time exactly when and shouldnt try to ....

Like techstrategy, you shorts are all liars.
