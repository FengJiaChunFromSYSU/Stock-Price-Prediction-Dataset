The drop might have surprised the street but not the serious backers of the companies. Or they're willing to give the company more chances to prove themselves. Or they're doing this to discourage shorts from piling on to the trade while they're liquidating their positions. After all, this is one of the highest over valued companies with the lowest short interest. But earning reports prove that the macros are finally catching up to them. There will come a point that pure revenue increase without profit will not be enough to attract the new blood.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1351404350330</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 02:05:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351416963268-3</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN IS A $30 STOCK</Title><Username>sellbby</Username><Timestamp>1351299913156</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 21:05:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This will be have at least a 50% haircut in a year's time.</Msg><Username>titomuch</Username><Timestamp>1351416963268</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 05:36:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351417247164-4</Id><Topic><Title>Here's what's going to happen.</Title><Username>agamemnus_0</Username><Timestamp>1351290751919</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 18:32:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I forgot to mention Europe...: )) Some call for a 1:1 Eur/$ ratio.....

If not during January loading for the entire year of 2013, regardless of the market (within reason) Amazon will get its pops and continue to go up to all time highs, punishing the shorts over and over again. A very big dump or selloff could occur here say during a stock crash, or if they really screw the kindle thing up. Office depot sells the kindle though and they fluctuate between 2nd and 3rd place in the entire world for the most computers sold. I didn't believe it till I saw the stats, but it makes sense, the bossman goes to office depot with his best worker or 2 or 3 workers and while they are their he is like, if you guys want a new laprop, pick it out and I will get it for you, it is a tax writeoff anyway. I would not be surprised if they were to take amzn down just for tomorrow 5-8 points, that would not just be a play on cramer viewers shorting and buying puts but also those that are long AMZN that will sell because cramer all but told them to. So if you combine the 2 different types of cramer viewers that will play AMZN stock tomorrow and the mm's dump a little just to get that group of people excited, well that could get the group excited that does not watch cramer or take his advice but they do watch the stock, you take AMZN down more then 5, some will do some serious adding. Amazon warehouse and warehouse patents are one of the main reasons I and others continue to buy on dips. Now all that said I do not fall in love with stocks, I use to really like bidu sina and couple other China stocks, not anymore, they would have to show me something serious for me to get long those stocks again. China is still slowing and will just get worse until they announce their major stimulus which could be delayed or argued over more then the 6 months they say, it could take 9 months or longer.</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1351470050428</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:20:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351470406790-45</Id><Title>Surpising the japmarkets didn't immediately sell off given their experience with floodwaters</Title><Msg>Sybil supposes zipper heads think the major US metro areas about to get clobbered in the mid atlantic can handle ocean surgez better when they get Spanked by that rotten #$%$ they call Sandy.... wait until this pig starts selling...

A year ago all the talking heads on tv including Cramer were telling you to buy because of phenomenal ecosystem and ultimate return on "investment" spending. Today - most on tv say they love the company but hate the stock and now even Cramer has his doubts. Bezos lost control of the narrative. Growth is declining rapidly and there is no light at the end of the margin expansion tunnel. Friday's technical bounce will not see much follow-through. Focus in next quarter and thereafter will be on growth and margin - and with the low estimate on revenue in 4Q of 16% is realized wall street will begin to exit this stock in earnest.</Msg><Username>dutchboyinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1351474911750</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 21:41:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351475430526-50</Id><Topic><Title>o come on yarrrr!!!!</Title><Username>davdddd</Username><Timestamp>1351460316816</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:38:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is ridiculousness taken to the extreme.

They are spending a ton on building warehouses that is eating into earnings. If you take out that money being spent the PE would be much lower that 1,836. But I checked the expectations for next year. AMZN gives a ridiculous range with earnings, they usually report some where in the middle. If you went with the high end estimate, the pie in the sky, no way in God's green earth do they ever hit this number estimates, their PE would be 50! For a 13 year old retail company that does a bunch of stuff but does none of it great (except for internet retail) They will use the we grew earning 100% when they start going up against these weak quarters but the revenue with still only increase 25% if they are lucky. They are F'd down the road. - PJ</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1351477036570</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 22:17:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351477548584-54</Id><Topic><Title>Surpising the japmarkets didn't immediately sell off given their experience with floodwaters</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1351470406790</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:26:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I may refrain from trading tomorrow.
