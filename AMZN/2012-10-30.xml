Only concerned for our friends, family and fellow citizens in harms way. I could not care less what Amazon does short term and long term it will certainly crater as the ponzi that it is. Google postponed its annoucement, but soon enough the Amazon cult will realize its headed for a tragic ending. Google is clearly signalling with Chromebook and the advanced specs that it will outcompete Amazon's consumer value proposition. 100GB Cloud Drive for 2 years with Chromebook. New Nexus 10, probably a price cut on Nexus 7, new Nexus G with a probably price cut on Nexus, all likely to have a strong cloud storage offering and steal content revenues from Amazon... Chromebook with Google Apps will become an increasingly compelling TCO play for small businesses. With its device dominance, Google Now and Shopping will provide a better user experience by aiding local businesses in meeting needs of local customers. It is the future. Amazon's model is dated... Stay strong shorts. This will be a fun ride to 100 (likely lower).</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1351578611005</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 02:30:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351592537520-2</Id><Topic><Title>Skiidady says he lives in New York City, so he will be providing us with regular Hurricane updates</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1351533883988</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:04:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kisses, stinky jr.</Msg><Username>skiidady6</Username><Timestamp>1351592537520</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 06:22:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351604300378-3</Id><Title>Impact on weekly options &amp; retailers</Title><Msg>Options: ----------- Looks like option writers will get some free money here.

Whether insured or not, it DESTROYS value and will hurt everyone. The meme that it is good for some segment is typical short term WS #$%$. It will create a significant drain on many families, particularly those with fewer resources to begin with (and those with the highest marginal propensity to consume in the first place).

Yes, it will cost individuals and insurance companies, but all that spending will flow into the hands of retail point blank.

I call it a tragedy. That's it. Nothing more. I see nothing good about a deadweight loss to society. I see nothing good about people suffering and property being destroyed. I am of the opinion that those trying to pump retail stocks based upon this tragedy are charlatans. I chose to be more specific on the impact for Amazon to clarify that you and GiGi are either exceptionally fuzzy thinkers or charlatans. People will have to replace a lot of product and take on significant new burdens, which will redirect money toward automobiles (look at the damage), industrial/electrical equipment, construction products (wood, drywall, etc). That will shrink the pool of available dollars for discretionary goods, particularly electronics and consumer goods. Retail is not monolithic. Amazon will be hurt by this as will most retailers outside of the few categories which now require replacement. This is value destroying for society (and all that freed up cash will simply be a future tax in the form of higher insurance, taxes, etc...). Get. A.

VERDICT THIS WEEK, Could take VRNG to Orbit" Seeking Link Seeking Alpha Article Vringo: Parabolic Rise Imminent By: Harmohan Parmar October 29, 2012 Disclosure: I am long VRNG. (More...) When examining Vringo's (VRNG) technicals, it looks to be in a bullish state, as can be seen here. Technical analysis aside, the PPS (price per share) of Vringo will be greatly influenced next week by the outcome of its lawsuit against Google (GOOG), IAC Search &amp; Media (IACI), Gannett Company (GCI), Target Corporation (TGT) and AOL (AOL). Developments coming out of court so far suggest Vringo has done an excellent job presenting its case to the court. It seems that Google's lawyers underestimated the risk of going to court and are overpowered by their Vringo counterparts. Dave Manuel defines a parabolic move as, "When a stock starts going up, the buying interest increases dramatically, sending the stock into orbit." Basically, the interest in the stock keeps compounding and growing, triggering a chain react ion. Are we about to witness parabolic movement with the Vringo stock. Verdict for the trial could be announced as early as this week or by the end of the week.</Msg><Username>drsimon15</Username><Timestamp>1351630382216</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 16:53:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351635755455-31</Id><Title>Joke</Title><Msg>Stores sold out so they will order on amazon.

Netflix could double in a hurry! If Microsoft was to offer 120 a share. I really believe Amazon would beat it for its Kindle fire. And my gut tells me microsoft would come back with a higher offer. They want this for the new xbox, the reason is it could be the deciding factor between the kid and parents that can't decide to get the kid the new xbox or new playstation that will be out not this christmas but next. If Sony was smart they would bid on Netflix, for the price they could get netflix for, (yes even after a bidding war) they can't build one better with such loyal customers, (and they are loyal) Even Google would have something to gain from Netflix. They could link it right to the google cloud for instance. No doubt in my mind this turns into a bidding war. The average kid will say yeah but with the xbox you get all the netflix movies with the xbox live suscription or something like that. If Sony Playstation does not wake up, they will be saying "what do you mean microsoft is selling 45% more xboxes because Microsoft has Netflix now. Sony would be #$%$, but it will be on them for not thinking, people that play games, also like to sit back with a joint when they are tired of playing gamesand watch a movie, and a lot of these kids just moved out and will spend every last dollar they have on a videogame system and games each month, but they can't afford cable when 90% of what is on they don't want to see anyway. Amazon is smart, netflix ownership for Amazon would mean kindle and movies from Amazon would become the #1choice. Cramer said sell aapl and all but said sell Amazon, I will buy Amazon if it sells off on the cramer talk but will watch aapl fall to 500 and if it breaks 500 maybe 440.</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1351646083666</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 21:14:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351647182778-36</Id><Topic><Title>Will Amazon counter bid for Netflix if Microsoft tries to scoop up for xbox live customers!</Title><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1351646083666</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 21:14:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amazon hardly has the cash to stay in business let alone put out billions for Netflix</Msg><Username>spyeman</Username><Timestamp>1351647182778</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 21:33:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351649174381-37</Id><Title>amzn - nothing to be excited about</Title><Msg>Revenue missed, earnings missed (posted a loss), fcf falling, expenses going up, competition heating up in every segment, other retailers doing price matching, no competitive advantage to speak of... When this finally falls, it will be epic. They'll be able to salvage some value selling their fancy warehouses below cost to raise some cash (they looooove to sell at cost or below). At that time everyone will be talking about the huge P/E, tiny profits and sometimes losses, hedge funds manipulation, etc. No doubt next Nortel, RIM, Netflix, etc. in the making.</Msg><Username>likesky78</Username><Timestamp>1351649174381</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 22:06:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
