LOL. There is no true fundamental "investment" logic anyone can come up with as to why this stock continues to rise. Complete disconnect between stock price and actual company prospects. Current group of wall street crooks have anointed this stock and others (NFLX, LNKD, TSLA etc) and driven them into the stratosphere. High short interest, low public float attracts the crooks and they create short squeeze after short squeeze. You just never know when its going to end and stock takes a quick 50% haircut.</Msg><Username>wuwuwu3</Username><Timestamp>1378562519451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 10:01:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378565613894-5</Id><Title>New business model</Title><Msg>The old model of selling stuff at a slight loss is now being replaced by selling stuff at a complete loss.</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1378565613894</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 10:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378566148728-6</Id><Title>selling</Title><Msg>Giving away free stuff is now considered selling by AMZN. Next step in the business model is they will pay you to shop there and you can spend their money. Paying you to ship with them is coming soon along with paying you to buy the products.

I dont know how much is the cost of data though for these corporation which have higher purchasing power than us. if they can get it down to less than 10-20 dollars per month then they would be golden they need to find out how many times their ads will be displayed per day first though</Msg><Username>ryugo82</Username><Timestamp>1378572140544</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 12:42:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378572233864-8</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon to offer free smart phone....really</Title><Username>wuwuwu3</Username><Timestamp>1378505351000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-06 18:09:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so people I would not say the idea is not unworkable it can work if done correctly and they can see it through. if amazon is successful facebook and all these others will likely follow suit.

IF FCC approves of it. NEW INNOVATION TO CIRCUMVENT MONOPOLIES. 4g/3g/wifi: depends on what ads they want to show the user streaming ads require more bandwidth thus need 4g to run so its up to the types of ads and commercials amazon wants to show.</Msg><Username>ryugo82</Username><Timestamp>1378572527836</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 12:48:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378582517382-10</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon to offer free smart phone....really</Title><Username>wuwuwu3</Username><Timestamp>1378505351000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-06 18:09:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wuwu, Amazon is a non-profit corporation, like public television.</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1378582517382</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 15:35:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378607698240-11</Id><Title>AMZN is NOT a non profit</Title><Msg>Non profits have to break even.
