They can easlity get blown out if this truly exists. AMZN is "top shelf" treated by WS , that we know. Timing a correction in it is very hard and why would want to promote shorting it like ex-goldbug and Sybil do: maybe be/c they like the "cartel" you never know. It's something to think about for sure. "I have said this before, but it bears stating again. AMZN is a cartel controlled stock. The cartel is not just riding the wave of investor euphoria, ala 1999-2000. AMZN is well suited for this type of investor mania, as we all know. AMZN is a company that has negative operating margins and no profits, but is simultaneously in 7-8 different business lines. Each of these business can be priced to infinity, so that the sum of these parts can add up to 135 billion of enterprise value. There is no E in AMZN, and thus Wall Street can use their useless fluff pieces as justification for price targets. But AMZN is more than just a typical Wall Street pump job. It is a controlled cartel, most likely by Fidelity and GS, with several other trading firms and large holders thrown in. This enables the cartel to literally control the price, through sometimes fraudulent and illegal trades. If you watch the way AMZN trades, it moves on little to no volume, most often in pre-market and in the first 30 minutes and last 15 minutes of trading. AMZN moves as if the stakeholders have figured out a way to trade with each other, shifting the price higher during low market floats, and then cancel some percentage of the trades at the end of the day. This enables the cartel to not only control most of the float, but have near limitless buying power during the most manipulated trading periods. Since there is no value to ultimately judge the stock, and most of the float is controlled, getting the stock to the high level is the ultimate goal. With AMZN, there is no counterbalancing value selling that happens in every other stock when buying overshoots the mark. Overshooting the mark is the nature of the game for the cartel. Of course this is illegal, but since nobody at the SEC or self regulating exchanges is looking for evidence of cancelled trades, the cartel can commit their crime with impunity. There is zero chance of prosecution. Ironically, the short interest, which in AMZN is the only true value seeking capital, consistently provides fuel for the cartel. It is their new money that constantly enters the pool, rather than new longs. The short money is the target. A 1% increase in short interest is what the cartel goes after. Shorts that hold for any length of time inevitably are forced to cover, thereby moving money from their bank accounts to the cartel. The entire process works because the incentive system for Fidelity is perverted. Dec 31 asset size is what matters for mutual fund managers. Larger assets, larger bonus. By marking up AMZN between themselves, they are effectively paying themselves out of their mutual fund holders pockets. When the game of musical chairs stops, their bonuses have long since been distributed. The question still remains as to what will cause the end of this cycle. I am puzzled. In the meantime, the earnings catalyst is the next big event for AMZN. And technically stocks seem to want to go higher. The AMZN AAPL dispersion is striking, even for the always bizarre AMZN chart. AMZN will almost certainly gap off its earnings. Higher or lower is the question, and I don't have the answer. Have enough new shorts entered the pool on this up cycle in order to create another blowoff gap to the upside, or will AMZN perform its usual dance of miss, gap lower, and then recover? That is main question for AMZN stock, and the next big money making (or losing) opportunity. 25 Jan, 07:17 PM"</Msg><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1359204303957</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 07:45:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359206689303-12</Id><Title>geegee missed hiz invitation to nasda_6000's circle jerk</Title><Msg>Geegee 'sold all callz at a rather big loss' on wed....

The more puts that are bought the more likely it is that any sell off will be muted without any real traction. Perhaps it will crater hard in the after hours, but then recover in the premarket or at the open in the morning - the net result being that all the put buyers lose - they paid a premium b/c bought into the earnings release and within 24hrs that premium if dissolved and they will be lucky to be flat even with a 5% selloff. On the flip side, this could be a NFLX moment, not due to short interest b/c it is low, but rather because of the derivatives and the streets buying into the "hope" created by Bezos about the future. Bezos is very key here, they love him and he is more a Jobs than a Cook - Cook could have saved Apple on the conference call, but chose the be atypical Apple and remained mum and changed the way they provided guidance - talk about confidence killer. only exception here is if a huge miss on top line revenue and a picture that guidance is showing a real slow down going forward. Earnings per share does not matter on this trade nor does p/e. With a low short interest and a huge miss this could crater big . . . but if put volumes are very high on Monday/Tuesday especially on the weeklies - then I would be skeptical that a large sell off will occur. Most of those writers will be naked and a certain strike will be defended no matter what. I played this week to upside and won. I am going to go into earnings with the handful of atm (3 months out in front) puts I bought into yesterdays close and wait until everything settles out on Wednesday to get a gauge on direction. If there is a pull back on Monday or Tuesday I will dump the puts and have no position into the release. You can still win big with this stock even after it swings up and down with earnings especially if you are using derivatives - but only after the premiums come down after the release and excitement subsides. Wait until Wednesday, especially if short side is your play IMO. If it spikes up you can call the top easier to short or if it sells off it will be supported for a while due to derivatives giving you time to play the further downside. good luck to all who are going to hold a position into the ER, should be an interesting one considering the huge liquidity in the marketplace right now, the obvious push higher on all indexes and ultra low volatility. Patience this week could be rewarded IMO - and the put volume should dictate the immediate aftermath of this stock on Wednesday's open.</Msg><Username>ajmanieri</Username><Timestamp>1359206785128</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 08:26:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359207096963-14</Id><Title>Seemz that nasdaq_6000 haz to jerk off without geegee's help theze days</Title><Msg>thats ok, because when this thing collapsez to 100 with nasdaq_6000 sitting on the short bus at every support level stop.

Of course, the collateral damage is that any sensible person now knows with certainty that the stock market does nothing to allocate investment capital nor create value. In fact, quite the opposite is true. It has come to function as a tax while simultaneously misallocating capital to those who pursue value destroying (at the company level and at the societal level) "growth". The collateral damage is hard to overstate.

In our case we were able to create negative working capital by pushing the inventory to a vendor style finance model where we paid for goods only after it was sold. It is true that it creates a one time permanent cash flow increase. That increase continues as their sales increase. Then when sales flatten it has no effect until the program ends then the working capital adjustment goes against you. Another company that does this effectively is Auto Zone. In any event my guess is they will get well past 100B in revenues. So that working capital adj may not happen for a while and they seem to be killing all the competitors in the meantime.

The switch to negative working capital is not a one time increase in free cash flow. Changes in working capital are NOT true FCF. Bezos and the analyst community are misrepresenting it as such. That capital has to be paid to vendors. It is working the float and had, in the past, been helpful in financing growth. But, Amazon's collapsing cash true cash flow meant that it had to raise debt to finance its capital intensive malinvestment. That should have been a big flag for longs... Just as NFLX accelerated the death of its cash flow generating DVD business, time will prove out that AMZN has destroyed TRUE FCF through overly aggressive category expansion and the acceleration of 3P/FBA. But, that requires a more detailed analysis of the cost and profit drivers in the business model. There is a reason for the migration in Amazon's business model, just as there was for NFLX... The holiday season will be as good as it gets. From here on, it is all downhill....</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1359226382201</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:53:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359228507847-29</Id><Topic><Title>Reason why AMZN won't sell off enough for shorts . . .</Title><Username>ajmanieri</Username><Timestamp>1359206785128</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 08:26:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"There are much bigger forces at play (and I do not mean the Fed... that hypothesis doesn't pass correlation tests)." It absolutely passes the correlation tests: the last 3 times in 12 years the Fed has flooded the system with easy money: huge malinvestments begin to occur: and you think there's no correlation? Do you have a past affiliation with that Institiution or something? I couldn't disagree with you more: There's a direct correlation in these type of games and capital misalloctions. The Fed is printing money right now , giving it to banks to use at their discretion, and now running it into highly speculative investments in favor of solid balance sheet compnaies backed by dividends. Companies that won't justifiy their prices of today for a decade or more. You really do sound like a Fed apologist techstrategy to say there's no correlation there. They might not directly route the money but they turn their back on the makings of them everytime and never ever take the punch bowl away. If they had, maybe we wouldn't have built up two asset bubbles in 12 years where the Fed has to lever up their balance sheet now to run the economy. And where their a huge % of the bond market where a big backup in rates to historically low levels could quickly become a problem.

Sure, easy money is lifting asset prices. But, that doesn't justify the #$%$ that is going on. Rigorous analysis shows that Amazon cannot translate the rev growth into profits because that same money printing is altering the relative cost structure for Amazon and others. This is a collusive float jam scam and nothing more. In terms of the correlation test, there are other assets that are more directly tied/levered to Fed balance sheet expansion. The moves in those assets has not correlated at all with Amazon... What has happened since QE3 and really since November is all predatory knockout, having nothing to do with money printing. Do you know why Apple is down almost 40% despite record profits and sales growth that still is on par with Amazon? It isn't about margins as the market apologists would have you believe.

The right path is to write off bad debt, but they are worried about cascading defaults. Ultimately, everyone with a financial view of the crisis is missing the point. The challenges we face are much larger and much more fundamental. Real GDP growth isn't real growth -- absent a structural deficit of 6% plus with the increase in debt not factored in (because it is a balance sheet issue and governments do not use GAAP accounting -- or everyone would understand the real debt...) GDP would be collapsing. And such is the case for almost every developed economy. No one is asking why... If we could confront the brutal reality, it would be a lot easier to start making the very real and very significant changes that will be required. Instead, we delay and pray. Unfortunately, the constraints of the real world will make the pain grow exponentially. Fed bashers think easy money caused this. In reality, easy money was the response to the real cause... But, I'll be the first to say I think it is amplifying our problems since it is absolutely NOT the right policy response.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1359242314186</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:18:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359242326633-42</Id><Topic><Title>Reason why AMZN won't sell off enough for shorts . . .</Title><Username>ajmanieri</Username><Timestamp>1359206785128</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 08:26:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The whole s&amp;p iz a knockout, tech...

Although they lost more money on the increased revenues, the POTENTIAL is what matters. Increased revenues COULD turn into increased profits "some day." And don't forget the POTENTIAL "future free cash flow" that Billy babbles about. Other good things about DAL are huge debt to cash ratio. And there is always the POTENTIAL that they come to some settlement with their unions to cut costs. And of course they have a lot of COMPETITION. And don't forget more good news: NO DIVIDENDS from DAL now, but POTENTIAL DIVIDENDS from DAL "SOME DAY." And don't forget they have a low cost carrier called SONG that has never made a profit yet but it has the POTENTIAL to make a profit "SOME DAY." All in all, DAL has a lot of "POTENTIAL" things going on here, just like AMZN. I think all AMZN hypesters should buy DAL at increasing prices on it's "POTENTIAL" just as they buy more AMZN at increasing prices on its "POTENTIAL." Be like Billy, buy on future hype potential, not on present realities.

Here is what I found: The DOW is on the 5th rally wave since the uptrend started on Mar09 and using the Eliot Wave Theory, it means the top of the long-term uptrend could be at hand #$%$ waves is usually all that is seen before a major correction or new downtrend occurs. In addition, each wave has been weaker than the previous wave with the first wave rally which started on March 2nd 2009 being 4789 points, the second wave being 3262 points, the third wave being 2618 points, the fourth wave being 1618 points, and the current wave being 1424 points so far. It should also be noted that starting from the top of the 1st wave seen on Apr10, the high to high rally differential (from one rally top to the next) has also been coming down with the first one being 1618 points, the second being 462 points, the third one being 323, and the current one, using Friday’s high at 13895, has been 234 points so far. As such, the Eliot Wave theory does suggest that the index will not rally much more above Friday’s high, certainly not above 13984, as that would make this top to top rally higher than the last one. I do believe this is an important fact that will be seen and used by the traders this coming week.</Msg><Username>luckyone581</Username><Timestamp>1359245871745</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:17:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359246016341-51</Id><Topic><Title>Just as Amazon revolutionized E-Tailing</Title><Username>shlockheed</Username><Timestamp>1359245666818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:14:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Until oil breaks $155..</Msg><Username>pschkqitzsough</Username><Timestamp>1359246016341</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:20:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359246029198-52</Id><Topic><Title>Just as Amazon revolutionized E-Tailing</Title><Username>shlockheed</Username><Timestamp>1359245666818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:14:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Problem is, you yo-yo's all have a 12 month top horizon.

It is a huge proportion of his liquid worth. It was a planned sale but can be easily pulled back or canceled if he thought the stock would be significantly higher after earnings. I am amazed at the retail people here that think they know more than the CEO of the company. Because people know there is time lost in shipping (and sometimes backorders) they start their on-line Christmas shopping about 10 days earlier than regular shopping. Bezos saw their sales were coming in much slower than expected at end of November and he sold - so did many other insiders. My nephew and his friends also saw sales were much slower, and they were let go. This stock is not a crashed and burned NFLX - it is APPL at $700 times 100. There is going to be pure carnage after earnings and Cramer is going to once again act like he did nothing wrong even though he wiped out thousands of people.</Msg><Username>davecarneyinc</Username><Timestamp>1359248971123</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:09:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359249019386-59</Id><Topic><Title>I think Amazon is gonna post blow out earnings</Title><Username>imshortemc</Username><Timestamp>1359238354282</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:12:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$300 easy after the earning.</Msg><Username>tr_smtp</Username><Timestamp>1359249019386</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:10:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359249403463-60</Id><Topic><Title>I think Amazon is gonna post blow out earnings</Title><Username>imshortemc</Username><Timestamp>1359238354282</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:12:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get outta here. 28 cents?

And that's after spending billions building what they've already financed over decades of real cash flow from running the businesses to make money... So, I was with a good buddy from Kellogg whose wife ordered 25, 50 and 75 lb freeweights for him for Christmas. Came in 3 separate shipments. He's a prime member... Good business model. Sure, it is an extreme example. But I'd love to hear the analysts explain why they think that is so good for Amazon. IMHO, it simply shouldn't carry stuff where the math doesn't and will not work. The relative economics of clicks versus bricks depends upon product, category and consumer characteristics... and some macro drivers as well. Amazon is moving to digital content wherever it can because it knows the core online commerce economics for most physical products are one big fairy tale. But, it will not be able to capture meaningful rents there either. The scam is almost exposed. This earnings report sows seeds of doubt. Next one exposes the scams real economics (holiday sales density masks the extent of the flaws).</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1359256757699</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:19:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359256960543-67</Id><Topic><Title>short interest is only 2%</Title><Username>it_all_goood</Username><Timestamp>1359145647992</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 15:27:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>aapl was 1.8 man they were right on</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1359256960543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:22:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359257400645-68</Id><Topic><Title>Bezos sold $100 Million of Stock right after Christmas Season Started</Title><Username>davecarneyinc</Username><Timestamp>1359191214599</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 04:06:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was $200MM.

If Q3 to Q4 operating expenses rise on roughly the same percentage basis as 2011, then Amazon must post at least $23B in revenue to break even. With all the various and credible reasons mentioned on the board for a revenue miss, it seems reasonably probable that Q4 is at the bottom of the range or worse. Losing a couple hundred million in Q4 will not be positive for the share price.</Msg><Username>powerchump</Username><Timestamp>1359257553069</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:32:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359258904350-70</Id><Title>Kindle Fire is a disaster</Title><Msg>Website operators, check your device usage logs for the last month.
