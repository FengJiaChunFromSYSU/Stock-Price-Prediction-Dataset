This has a lot of traders thinking that big money can be made simply by buying put options on stocks that will move down with the market, especially high beta ones. Nothing can be further from the truth. Most amateur options traders who did that either failed to make any money, make very little money or outright lose money even though the stock moved down a lot as predicted. Why is that so? Volatile market conditions are especially bad for buying stock options due to 2 reasons. Firstly, the extreme volatility resulted in extremely high implied volatility which increases the extrinsic value of options dramatically, depressing its profitability. Secondly, extreme volatility leads to extreme speculation which encourages market makers to open up the bid ask spread to an unreasonably wide level in order to fill their own pockets. Extrinsic value is the price one pays to the seller of stock options in order to justify the risk undertaken by the seller for giving such a right to the buyer. This price is arrived at in theory by options pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model. Extrinsic value directly affects the profitability of the options as the higher the extrinsic value of an option, the more the underlying stock needs to move in order to breakeven or profit. Extrinsic value is the price one pays to the seller of stock options in order to justify the risk undertaken by the seller for giving such a right to the buyer. This price is arrived at in theory by options pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model. Extrinsic value directly affects the profitability of the options as the higher the extrinsic value of an option, the more the underlying stock needs to move in order to breakeven or profit. For example, if two options based on the same underlying stock, the same strike price and expiration month have different extrinsic values (of course this cannot be the case in reality), the option with the higher extrinsic value will make lesser money in profit than the option with the lower extrinsic value when the underlying stock moves by the same amount when held to expiration. Extrinsic value is affected mainly by the level of implied volatility of the underlying stock. If the underlying stock is expected to make big moves, implied volatility goes up and the extrinsic values of its options go up as well. In times of extreme market volatility, extrinsic values go up dramatically across the board, depressing the profitability of options. In fact, one could end up losing more money than usual if the stock does not move according to expectations due to the higher extrinsic value paid. This is why a lot of amateur options traders who simply bought put options recently failed to make much money or any at all. This situation is made even worse by the wide bid ask spreads provided by the market makers. Market makers are those options traders really trade options with. When you buy an option, you are really buying directly from market makers who hold an inventory of those options and when you sell options, you are really selling back to these market makers who want to maintain an inventory of those options. Market makers buy and sell options in the exchange, ensuring the liquidity of all options contracts and profit primarily from the bid ask spread that they provide, buying at the bid and selling at the ask. They function exactly like used car dealers, buying at lower prices and selling at higher prices. Typically, the more actively traded the options are, the closer the bid ask spread tend to be due to competition between market makers, however, in times of extreme volatility where there are a lot more buying and selling on panic and more than enough business to go around for all market makers, they usually open up the bid ask spread in order to make even more profits. That is why we saw unusually wide bid ask spreads in this recent crisis. Wider bid ask spreads result in larger upfront losses which again depress the already depressed profitability of stock options due to the higher extrinsic values. The higher extrinsic value and wider bid ask spread makes profiting from simple stock options buying extremely difficult and are the main reasons why amateur options traders fail to make money buying put options during the recent stock market crisis. Conversely, writing options are an extremely profitable way to trade options during a volatile market where extrinsic values are high. Naked writes and Credit Spreads are really the way to go in a volatile market condition and are what most beginner options traders do not know about. Selling options instead of buying them turns the table around and creates an extremely profitable position during times of high extrinsic value.

Note the Snowden files to reveal criminal deeds at the US Helm, the man labeled a traitor. The defensive tactics have turned more desperate and often border on the edge of amusing. In 2002, certain officers who attempted to reveal the sequence of events and the culpable parties from the big event the previous year were smeared with child pornography accusations. Memories fade. Few recall the Anthrax threat to the Congressional ventilation systems just before the Patriot Act passage, the threat as courtesy by the FBI. In general, the opponents to the fascist core axis are declared terrorists. The accusers are nazis deeply engaged in financial terror, war crimes, bond fraud on $trillion scale, central bank gold thefts, bond counterfeit, theft of large funds, murder to defend the fortress, with a cake that bears treason as icing. The last three US Presidents have refused to submit to the USCongress their medical records, as required by law. The details of their narcotics addiction would not sit well with the American public or even naive Congressional members. Authority might not be followed. The world is watching. The world has identified the problem. The world has fingered the USDollar as the toxic paper, the USTBond as the acid element in their banking systems, and the US Bankers as the criminals in the room. The nations of the world have made grand strides in rallying behind China &amp; Russia. The former has made a direct challenge to the US in global financial leadership. The latter has been making direct challenge to the US in global military leadership.

They find themselves at friction-filled odds with Russia. They will find some measure of safe haven behind the Chinese cape. The Saudis are busily making their pivot to China. Note the large petro-chemical project begun last year near the Red Sea. The entire Arab Spring movement is a direct assault upon the Arab world, whose nations one after the other are run by autocrats better described as benevolent dictators. The USGovt strategy to spread democracy is intended to disrupt the royals sitting upon peacock thrones, as much as to dislodge valuable resources. In North Africa the objective was to derail the planned European development with new industries, equipped with roll-off port facilities, run by cheaper skilled Arab labor. In the rest of the Arab MidEast, the objective has been to let loose a band of Keystone Cops that unseat the House of Saud itself in a most bizarre sequence of events. The overthrow of Mosni in Egypt required a huge financial assist by the Saudis, hardly a team effort with the Obama Admin clown show. The retreat from Syria has angered the Saudi Royal family in unspeakable terms. They have responded by threatening the shutdown of US Embassies in Saudi Arabia. Hidden in the many conflicts are the Pipeline Politics, which the USGovt cannot afford to reveal. Doing so would make crystal clear its ulterior motives, its weakened position, and the rise of the Natural Gas Coop led by the Russian Gazprom giant. Revealing the fading power of OPEC as the Saudi weapon to enforce the King Dollar scepter would accelerate the Dollar Alternative movement led by the Eastern Alliance. The Syrian War was all about blocking the completion of the #$%$ Gas Pipeline from Iran. The US could not stop the Iran-Pakistani Gas Pipeline. The weakness of the USDollar will be made evident by the strangle of natural gas pipelines, mostly run by Gazprom. The US lost the Pipeline Wars to Russia long ago. The Western population is slowly coming to grips with the rise of the #$%$ majority in Iraq. Yes, the United States lost the Iraqi War. Yes, the United States will soon have lost the Afghan War, except for the heroin booty. Valued at over $800 billion in narco profit annually, it has been the big prize on the battlefield supported by soldier blood &amp; guts. At an estimated $6 trillion all-in war cost, thank the Bush II Admin for another folly that equals one third of the national debt. The great turning point for the Global Dollar Politics lies in the massive changes underway with the Petro-Dollar. The Saudis urgently seek a new protector for the Persian Gulf. It will be China to wear the cape. The Saudis will soon announce acceptance for oil payments in Euro terms, in Yen terms, in British Pound terms, and most important in Chinese Yuan terms. The effect will be felt like a gigantic crash impact of a 7-story building hitting the ground, marking the Death of the Petro-Dollar. It has served as the foundation for the USDollar for 40 years, since the Arab 1973 Embargo. The resolution involved a grand pact, engineered by Kissinger. It called for recycling Arab Oil Surplus into USTreasury Bonds, used to fill the many national banking systems across the world. The unraveling of the Petro-Dollar standard will bring about colossal reformation of the many national banking systems. They will ditch the USTBonds in favor of a mix of Chinese Yuan and Gold bullion. Later the same Yuan will become partially gold-backed. Game over for the King Dollar!</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1383408134012</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-11-02 12:02:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383408917776-18</Id><Topic><Title>Longz!!!!

It is relying on prime growth of next quarter's new prime fees to keep it close, but slight decline in actual margin. Now, they've built up massive shipping obligations and then prime growth stalls. That's when the big margin drop and "unexpected" profit drop hits. That's how pyramid schemes structures end.</Msg><Username>one_smooth_stone</Username><Timestamp>1383413728008</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-11-02 13:35:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383414302277-28</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN's Q3 revenue beat</Title><Username>uncover1999</Username><Timestamp>1383360814264</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-11-01 22:53:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>2-day shipping is significantly more expensive than standard ship.

Of course you don't buy your longer term puts as the volatility spikes. You buy them before (like now) while the volatility is very low, in anticipation of a market drop and volatility spike.

If you follow his thesis, you'll understand my investment in productive assets, particularly my DG and biofuel energy technologies. The market has indisciminately (actually, I should say intentionally mispriced via unlimited leverage pain trade enabling MM/PD to extract gains with 100% success rate, a staistical impossibility in a fair market) bid up all stock without understanding the effect of the end game on companies based upon where they sit in the business system. Amazon is a US, Japan and European consumer oriented company with no net working capital.
