Another timeframe sees ROIC improving greatly over time i.e., not an data end point of 2013 but one further out. In which those measures simply improve as those investments are optimized. "Google Target IN Chicago... or NYC" I did and only found one near the river in NYC, hardly centrally located, and others NOT in Manhattan but in the Bronx or Queens, in other words in outlying areas. You must not understand the Target/Walmart business model at all. Locating in lower rent areas is a fundamental necessity of a discounter. "Unless a household is going to buy everything online blah, blah..." If it were so simplistic all the bookstores that Amazon has put out of business would simply have located themselves right next to a Walmart, the low-rent neighborhood you and Syb seem bent on hyping.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1364761036907</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 16:17:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364765290347-16</Id><Topic><Title>Sybil haz an amazing prediction for todayz action</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1364556669493</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 07:31:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1) It is pure hype to suggest anything other than declining inventory turns and ROIC as both have dropped consistently nearly every quarter since 2009. That's not cherry picking. It is a consistent trend reflecting the impact of higher fuel prices and delivery cost with diminishing benefit of Amazon's more centralized inventory model due to low interest rates. That's economic fact. 2) I note you didn't respond to Chicago locations of TGT, with several right downtown. I have 2 within 5 miles of my home on the North Shore (which is only low rent for oil and Russian oligarchs, though we don't have many of those). 3) Comparing to bookstores shows your idiocy. The category economics of books were ideally suited to Amazon's model. It is why Jeff B started there. As Amazon has expanded, the category economics keep getting worse / less well suited to online versus physical commerce. Again, you fail to understand the profit drivers and the embedded tradeoffs in the business model. Stick with the stock price pumping. It's all you have...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1364765290347</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 17:28:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364771968152-17</Id><Topic><Title>When Is The Next Divi Payment?</Title><Username>frtgrdn21</Username><Timestamp>1364738975118</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 10:09:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HaHa You are priceless.

I think all of them are over valued and setup for pain in coming years. But, I like COST as a company (best demographic base and most robust model for what is coming). Unlike Amazon's membership program, COST's all drops to the bottom line. It is a well structured selection bias. Any analyst worth his or her salt should ask for a cohort analysis of total spending and average order size by Prime members. The aggregated stats are worthless BS as they mask the saturation of the most profitable customers, who were already Prime members when it was just a shipping proposition. TGT and WMT matching Amazon prices, with Amazon now having to collect taxes will hurt. And, it is very sustainable for them. just as it is sustainable for GOOG to match/beat on cloud, eBAY on 3P and soon enough Apple on books (thanks to the DOJ -- and I suspect you'll see more DOJ anti-trust review of Amazon after the good reads deal since author's guild, Indies and others will all raise a stink). It'll be interesting to see where Amazon generates the cash for all its loss leaders in the future. It has already burned through its cash surplus and its current ratio would have dropped below 1 without the debt offering...and the competition is just heating up. I was actually surprised by how few TGT's there are in Manhattan. But, that helps to explain WS's fascination with Amazon. Few on WS ever take a car to shop for everyday items like most Americans (at least all of the CNBC pundits have made clear they buy everything on Amazon). Their "time is too valuable". They missed Marketing 101, so they are projecting their usage of Amazon onto the general populace... In most cities and most suburbs, it's different. Cost of living is lower, garage spots do not cost more than cars and there are plenty of strip malls within a short drive and on the way home from work or the kids' activities.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1364784081898</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 22:41:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
