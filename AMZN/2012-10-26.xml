Good luck with this one. Permabears nothing, this should be a quick easy short TRADE, futures tilted down 118 points, and aapl was halted. 9% gap fill is ridiculous, you have no idea how to tade on tape. 9% drop was a previw. This is overbought, and it isn't like we have never seen a tech earnings bubble. I am in disagreement with you and see a bit of a tumble tomorrow.

She is a nickname of philandjoel1e, a deranged trader who's just got lucky shorting AMZN recently. Sometimes shorts win. She's one of those shorts who got lucky in the last three weeks. (Because she is totally deranged, she could endure months of upside moves after she started shorting AMZN around 220 months ago. She kept adding shorts as AMZN climbed to 264.11, effectively raising the average sell price to 249. By pure luck, nothing else, AMZN dropped sharply so she's ahead now.)</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1351242770479</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 05:12:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351244734304-21</Id><Title>Its 218 USD in Frankfurt</Title><Msg>Its 218 USD in Frankfurt</Msg><Username>gsarc2000</Username><Timestamp>1351244734304</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 05:45:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351246156666-22</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon: 'But just wait until next quarter'®</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1351242926038</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 05:15:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>with pt barnum at the helm, people will buy into the lies for awhile. everntually, they discover they've been lied to and they get out the tar and feathers. these guys are tighlipped on their off the wall biz ventures..[eg. wanna do a grocery store] to keep the lie going as long as possible and not reveal the facts. gonna be a day of reckoning and it could be today.....</Msg><Username>erbium_doper</Username><Timestamp>1351246156666</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 06:09:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351246298929-23</Id><Title>how low will AMZN go?</Title><Msg>what kind of options will you play it?</Msg><Username>gil35mem</Username><Timestamp>1351246298929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 06:11:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351246732502-24</Id><Topic><Title>how low will AMZN go?</Title><Username>gil35mem</Username><Timestamp>1351246298929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 06:11:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think next stop is 180-195...and then will continue trading with the market</Msg><Username>gsarc2000</Username><Timestamp>1351246732502</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 06:18:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351247058237-25</Id><Title>Wow 6:15am est, and this pig iz already trading on volume...</Title><Msg>Some bot iz in a fvcken hurry to get out.....

Well guess what, in Q3 GM dropped to 14.3% - even less than Q1 !!! Lets see - growth has slowed, margins are declining, R&amp;D spending is inccreasing at a breakneck pace to produce products they are losing money on, looking at piles of depreciation and new employees they don't need .... wow a P/E of 20 sounds about right on $2 earning next year ... $40. just a matter of time before big money has to throw in the towel.</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1351252244096</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 07:50:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351252265245-50</Id><Title>iPad tablet is the least of AMZN's concerns, they have a near term liquidity issue developing.</Title><Msg>9/30/12 working capital is $0.

Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to 360 million or 2.8% of revenue down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange CSOI decreased 4%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 47% to $107 million or 0.8% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $109 million a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a one-time expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition.

Accounts payable increased 24% to 7.07 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year. Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million, the increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure including Amazon web services and additional capacity to support our funding operations.

Rampant speculators, propagandists and financiers of Wall Street are given some unfair advantage over the average consumers and taxpayers and the cumulative effect of the people watching selfishness prevail over the public interest has been an undermining of the public’s trust in the present US government. There’s no question the Wall Street is rigged against the average consumers and taxpayers. The Wall Street has a lot more information. Wall Street jerry-rig the system so that Wall Street always win. If the Wall Street loses trillions, the US Treasury will bail the Wall Street out so it can go back and do it again. 50 trillion dollars in global wealth was erased between September 2007 and March 2009, including 7 trillion dollars in the US stock market, 6 trillion dollars in the US housing market, 8 trillion dollars in the US retirement and household wealth, 2 trillion dollars in the US individual retirement accounts, 2 trillion dollars in the US traditional defined benefit plans and 3 trillion dollars in the US nonpension assets. Greed, arrogance and incompetence created a massive meltdown, cost trillions, and still Wall Street comes out richer and more powerful. BANKERS GONE WILD - HOW THE US GOVERNMENT HELPED WALL STREET GANG-RAPE AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS (AND MOST OF EUROPE) Thomas Jefferson and Eisenhower warned us long time ago: I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs. Thomas Jefferson, (Attributed) 3rd president of US (1743 - 1826) Catherine Austin Fitts: "They're Going to Depopulate or Bankrupt the Rest of Us" Catherine Austin Fitts calls what happened to the U.S since the market meltdown of 2008 a “fiscal coup d’état.” Fitts should know because she is a former Wall Street insider who has managed investments worth $300 billion. She is also a government insider. Catherine Austin Fitts was an Assistant Secretary for HUD in the first Bush Administration more than 20 years ago. She says our leaders are “. . . doing a number of things that are going to depopulate or bankrupt the rest of us.” Why are people so ill-informed? Fitts says it’s because, “Corporate media is lying to you and wasting your time.” She also says, “Were going through a period of great change, and the pace is going to accelerate.” And, “Gold will be at the center of a new currency that will emerge.” Join Greg Hunter as he goes One-on-One with Catherine Austin Fitts of The Solari Report.

They can't get out because noone in their right mind is buying to hold. Bezos and his cronies on the street have figured out a way to keep this thing propped until the company "stops spending" and moves to higher earnings and margins. Until they can get some big buying coming into the stock, the big money can't get out. Possible scenarios: 1.) some fund that is realizing that AMZN will NEVER grow into it's valuation, will begin the run for the door by beginning to dump. Personally I hope that happens today. 2.) They keep this propped up until the company figures out a way to actually become profitable. I just don't know. This has been the game in AMZN for years, which is why I believe it is cronyism. I just knew they would steal all of that put money. You might consider selling some calls at let's say 280 strike, as far out as you can go in time. Jan 2015. Collect the money, sit back and wait. Hopefully sometime between now and Jan of 2015, this pig will fall to the valuation it has honestly earned for a company that loses money. Try to pick the top before shorting the calls. You can also use this method to scalp call trades, just make sure you have enough liquidity to get in and out. I hope any of this helps, and I hope someday you can buy your Dad a coal company with your AMZN proceeds.</Msg><Username>cruise_andgetbruised</Username><Timestamp>1351257948499</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:25:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351257982529-147</Id><Title>THE AMAZING AMAZON!

This company is over 12 years old and has never made that much money. They grow revenue, but that is only because they sell at no profit margin.Kindle is their number one seller, but they don't make any money selling it until the customer buys some books or something else on it. Meanwhile goog and appl make billions and miss by a few cents and their stocks get hammered. I am going to sell all my mutual funds that hold this. total #$%$ and explains why mutual funds usually lose money after all their fees. Amazon may not even make money in next quarter. Barclays lowered price target to 220 but it still goes up. Even 220 is too high for a company that is losing money and only made about $2 before having to build all the warehouses etc. and don't say that living social doesn't count, another money losing disaster. groupon stock got hammer, but not amzn. anyway, I give up. logic doesn't apply to stock that wall street guys love for no reason.</Msg><Username>fredofkeller</Username><Timestamp>1351260931677</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:15:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351260998924-226</Id><Topic><Title>Wow... this POS never fails to amaze</Title><Username>likesky78</Username><Timestamp>1351259928964</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:58:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will never understand why this puppy goes up after big earning miss, notwithstanding this is a great company to do business with.</Msg><Username>pauly6734</Username><Timestamp>1351260998924</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:16:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351261078745-227</Id><Title>Jefferies maintains $300 price target</Title><Msg>"Jefferies noted that Amazon’s third quarter marked the fourth straight quarter that their operating income exceeded the high end of guidance." The positive reaction to higher-than-guidance operating margins might make sense IF the stock had first gone down when greatly reduced Q3 guidance was issued along with Q2 report. By this logic company could continue to issue lower guidance and then beating it all the way to bankruptcy. I also note that there is very little discussion of gross margin this Q, which was such a big deal last quarter when it moved to new highs - despite the fact that every 10Q reiterates that operating margins are a better measure of success.

Andrew Jackson quotes: Gentlemen, I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter, I shall ruin ten thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and thieves. ------------ NEW SLOGAN IN USA WALL STREET IS NOW PURE FRAUD STREET CASINO AND RIGGED WITH ALL SCAM LEGISLATION AGAINST 99% WORKING CLASS AND ALL FRAUD LOOT PROTECTION FOR CORPORATE THUGS AND BANKSTER FINANCIAL TERRORISTS AT S.E.C ENFORCED AND ALL LOOT MANIPULATION SCAM WEAPONS AT THEIR DISPOSAL LOOT/SCAM/BANG USA 99% WORKING CLASS PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IN BILLIONS WITH DARK POOLS AND HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING MACHINES WITH FRAUD PRICE/VOLUME MANIPULATION WITHOUT ANY FEAR IF, BY MISTAKE YOU ARE CAUGHT?

Gene Burnett - Jump You F*#kers (A Song For Wall Street) Modern day bank robbers are at Wall Street but they wear grey suits and not masks. Rampant speculators, propagandists and financiers of Wall Street are given some unfair advantage over the average consumers and taxpayers and the cumulative effect of the people watching selfishness prevail over the public interest has been an undermining of the public’s trust in the present US government. There’s no question the Wall Street is rigged against the average consumers and taxpayers. The Wall Street has a lot more information. Wall Street jerry-rig the system so that Wall Street always win. If the Wall Street loses trillions, the US Treasury will bail the Wall Street out so it can go back and do it again. 50 trillion dollars in global wealth was erased between September 2007 and March 2009, including 7 trillion dollars in the US stock market, 6 trillion dollars in the US housing market, 8 trillion dollars in the US retirement and household wealth, 2 trillion dollars in the US individual retirement accounts, 2 trillion dollars in the US traditional defined benefit plans and 3 trillion dollars in the US nonpension assets. Greed, arrogance and incompetence created a massive meltdown, cost trillions, and still Wall Street comes out richer and more powerful.

I believe that is a HUGE unrevealed factor in how this stock is rewarded such a high valuation. This being said: at some point the big fund money will begin to try to get out before the other funds "wake up" from their Bezos psychopathic #$%$ spin. Surely that process is or will begin in the extreme near future. Once the others start to dump is when we will get some sort of sell off. Personally, I don't know who in their right mind can hold this long any further. It is a losing model, with increasing serious competitors in every aspect of their attempts to increase profits. AMZN's desperation is so obvious to me as they continue to enter every single market they can, from selling tools, to the cloud, to renting movies, to buying profits by acquiring companies. To date all of their acquisitions, and efforts have been rewarded with losing money. People and their competition (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, and so on) are getting smarter.</Msg><Username>cruise_andgetbruised</Username><Timestamp>1351266108927</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:41:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351266128602-302</Id><Topic><Title>No downgrades!?</Title><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1351265639486</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:33:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From what I read about notes from analysts, they are still pumping it; it is only a matter of time.

Not at all. The stock price is nothing more than a gamble. It is akin to poker. Nobody knows what the other person is holding. And a pair may be high or low. The bet is not on the card but on what the other person will do with their hand. The game is of investing is nothing more than a way to get somebody else's money. It is a simple bet with the hope you win. And the more times you win the more money you took from other players. And good for you.

LOL seriously though, I (and MANY others) only have a vague idea as to what you're talking about.... we couldn't possibly answer that seriously. However, my best guess is that they are indeed NOT playing together, but the way that they are playing the game is still beneficial to each other. There are many many large holders trying to dump right now, and each is big enough to influence stock price on their own. So they don't simply dump, they use trading algorithms to keep the price up as high as possible so that THEY can sell their shares for as much as possible. None of them are trying to break this stock as they are holding so much, they are simply attempting to get as much value out of the shares that they currently own. This can certainly give the appearance of them playing together, when in fact they are not - their self serving strategies are simply mutually beneficial. As far as exactly how do you dump 10 million shares without bringing the stock down? I have no idea, I have never found myself in this fortunate position :P What do you think?</Msg><Username>kevin.grygiel</Username><Timestamp>1351267115811</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:58:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351267178561-318</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN Rally Tomorrow, Then The Long Slide Begins</Title><Username>chl94611</Username><Timestamp>1351213438210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 21:03:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Playing out exactly as I scripted.

I never buy under 2 peg unless i'm buying dividend. amzn is a market leader but these valuations are out of control. they're not without competition. sales tax now a factor... big box stores are matching online prices (ie, best buy)... ipad mini... facebook gifts.. the list goes on. amzn has no margins! where's the barrier to entry beyond amzn's scale?? There is none. Their scale advantage will be erroded as soon as amzn attemps margin expansion. To justify these rediculous valuations, they need absolute perfection in the face of competion from ebay, apple, overstock etc. Even with perfection, I see catch 22 for amzn... they can't expand margins and maintain sales growth. They will be lucky if sales don't collapse when the company attempts to switch gears.</Msg><Username>i.alaric</Username><Timestamp>1351277286756</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:48:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351277344585-483</Id><Title>UBS to cut 10,000 Jobs, FORD is closing factories !!!</Title><Msg>worldwide recession and yet Amazon is trading at a PE of 284 !!!!! what a bubble........</Msg><Username>europe_and_usa</Username><Timestamp>1351277344585</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:49:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351277431513-484</Id><Topic><Title>How do momo bots hold the price up AND sell it with flash crash phat phingured trading speed?</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1351265616591</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:33:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybil thinks its a plausible explaination - thank you for replying...

As along as AMZN is held to making money, why would he show any earnings: the stock goes wild on presenting "loss" reports rather than "earnings" reports.

The powers that control it couldn't have cared less if the rest of the market fell apart, as long as their control to AMZN to the upside stayed intact. And once the market recovered, they moved it agressivlehy up. I call it buy and chasing , that's what they do, robotic, HFT , whatever it is. IIt's alwyas used by the poweres to ramp over short postions as seen today. As I said, it matters little if Jeff Bezos ever shows a profits: he may become the richest human on the planet as long as this behavior reamins intact: which is kind of a sad statement on the USA and it's markets. Today showed how obnoxious it has gotton: probably the most blatent day I've ever seen of it: until the next one:lol! it's already quickly heading towrd 1000 times earnings with a major market cap: I don't think I've ever see that for such a big company. 300 times earnings is 'so yesterday.' The moral of it all is you have to be a fool to short it on valuation alone if you can't take getting run over time and time again.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1351282139004</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 16:08:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351282170204-596</Id><Title>Who recalls TYCO, or Conseco or Bear Sterns.

Maybe thankfully so IF you are patient. This is how you make a fortune exploiting it. At some point amazon will get cut by 75% or more. A fortune to be made buying puts. Maybe Einhorn will buy some PUTS and at the next conference Einhorn it. Once he does it is over. The market lets you pick up gifts like apple trading for 7 times cash flow on an ex-cash basis. Cheaper then microsoft, cisco, oracle, P&amp;G, Wal-Mart and not too far from RIMM and HP. It's a steal. Sale prices might not last long but maybe they will. Someday though the market will fix both these companies stock prices as well as any others that are massively dislocated from reality. This is how you can make a fortune.

AAPL gets halted before its release while the futures tumble in armageddon fashion. Someone at the majorminvestment firms knew before the release. Plain and simple. Who trades these futures in mass and simultaneously. look no further than JPM and GS. The very same banks you bailed out with your tax dollars that refused to lend you money for the house you got sucked out on. how did the market know that aapl would miss to a point where they would halt the shares? The game is rigged to steal money from the "muppets" meaning you, me, anyonenwho would dare buy and hold anything fornfive minutes. Then there is amazon. Amazingly, they rally on 11M shares after a drastic miss, a #$%$ guidance, and 290x earnings. Why, because they saw you short. It made sense, the holders of a miss should sell on bad news. So you were trapped on HFT algorithms. The fact is that the only way for us to stop this is to pull out our 401ks, protest the system, stop participating. The equity in your home is already gone, Let them take the house. Retail investing is dead. The calls at make the most sense, like shorting a high pe growth story that is losing money, they will be punished. When the market starts to feel more like a casino than a machine that logically processes valuation based on real metrics.... Well, then it is a casino. And the only way to stop this is to stop playing against the house, we need to pull the plug, pull every dime out, go over the fiscal cliff, and tell these banks that they are here because of us, not the other way around.</Msg><Username>lackinginsenseofhumor</Username><Timestamp>1351289929985</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 18:18:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351289947507-661</Id><Title>PATHETIC CORNHOLED LOSER SYBIL LYING IN DESPERATION !!!</Title><Msg>His account is destroyed !!!

They say manipulation does not exist, but it does and today was the biggest example of it that I have ever seen. What is manipulation and how does it happen? Insider trading is definitely one. But there are other more disguised methods, and I believe that is what is at work right now. There is a deliberate movement to run this stock higher NO MATTER what the company does to steal/thieve money from others who are using the company's actual performance to make their stock or option decisions. The company's conference call was a joke. It's is being mentioned across the media. It is being written about by many. The trading action was a BLATANT disregard of a company that is not growing anything but it's expenses, it has begun to lose money, and it is a mature company (over 13 years old). The likes of MSFT (a mature company no longer to offer "growth"), AAPl, growth COULD slow, even though they make TONS of money...these stocks are sold off hard for excellent performance and execution. Yet Bezos mumbles a bunch of stuff that is basically worthless, guides lower, the stock rips to gouge those put writers, or short sellers, who are taking positions based on the criteria that governs all other companies. Something is clearly awry here, and it's the stuff of EVIL. If this does not trigger some form of investigation into Amazon and Bezo's Wall Street connections/relationshps..then I don't know what will. For those of you that agree, what we can do is huge. Not only can we make calls and get something going to bring about an investigation. There is another thing we can do: and it could be HUGE if the snowball can grow into an avalanche, and that is this: STOP shopping at AMZN and spread your business to retailers that hire many people, and are part of local communities,etc.</Msg><Username>whiteonyx52</Username><Timestamp>1351296489158</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:08:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351296857714-706</Id><Topic><Title>I decided to look at shorting when PE approaches 1000</Title><Username>johnrobertkosanovic</Username><Timestamp>1351296339766</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:05:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and probably a lottery ticket short still as it long ago stopped trading on a PE basis, so don't trade it on that basis in my view.

The way we change the system is to vote your values with your wallets. If the stock manipulation has hurt you, don't buy anything from Amazon. More importantly, encourage anyone you know that might be long Amazon to sell the stock while the scam is alive. Let others hold the risk. Let's have retail get out at the top for a change. If you really feel that way, write an email and send to your friends and family. Explain to them what happened today and make sure they understand that the markets have become a game of simply trying to prey upon people rather than actually allocating capital to productive uses (else Apple would have gone up and Amazon down). Encourage them to pass it along... If people are smart, they will aggressively pull capital from the market. Invest locally in people and businesses you know and trust. Invest in physical assets that cannot be controlled and manipulated by co-located servers having a structural information advantage over you. I hope all of those that were hurt by this move (long or short) literally take the time to educate those around you. The markets have ceased to provide any value. The only times that the stock market truly creates value is with financings (IPOs, secondary offerings, acquisitions). The rest is simply redistribution from the general investing public to those that have rigged the game. You are much better off putting your money into local physical assets and gold for that matter (and yes, the physical kind that you control and that the HFT bots cannot take from you in a stop loss sweep). The point is this. Markets respond to signals. When the institutions see people pulling funds aggressively, they will get the message and probably not before then...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1351299723956</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 21:02:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351299758101-712</Id><Title>SEC IS USELESS; CONTACT FBI OR CONGRESSMAN ABOUT BLATENT STOCK</Title><Msg>Manipulation; no position but this is totally illegal</Msg><Username>sellbby</Username><Timestamp>1351299758101</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 21:02:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351299889574-713</Id><Topic><Title>CNN analysts said this afternoon</Title><Username>stocker4949</Username><Timestamp>1351298130110</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:35:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great stock performance , no retained earnings; shareholders have done well on appreciation of stock, no dividends, while insiders have benefitted and locked in on the advance selling along the way.

This one has minimum retail participation so it's just Bezos and the boys smoking the option buyers and short sellers for personal gain while keeping this scam investing churning.

The game is about to end unless Bezos and the boys want to inject some of the ill rotten gains into the company to have the game on for another round. It's almost an embarrassment when this thing drop below $200, really. Will this garbage go to $260, $300? It's possible, but doing this in a deflating business environment has to be nothing short off financial suicide. It's like sending all the reserves in for the last attack only to prolong the war a little bit more. Wall Street have gotten too fat and lazy to be function in a meaningful way as the allocator of capital for the economy. Now it's just games and more games between the trading desks and more capital raise (stealing from people's hard work). Look at all the massive lay-offs on Wall Street since there's little retail $ to steal or scam deals to seal.

AMzn went up because they are investing in growth and investors love growth. However, it is already trading a huge premium-- it should have come down a few percent at least. Heres the bottom line: GOOG, AApl, AMzn, are golden unless proven broken. They basically own their spaces. Bby is basically dying because of AMzn. Growth and leader companies get a wide berth. Period. However, although these stocks don't get punished on earnings, they can drift down. Like AApl prior to earnings. I think AMzn will start drifting down slowly.</Msg><Username>simon93147</Username><Timestamp>1351303060253</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 21:57:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351303331871-727</Id><Title>Nice thing about a PE over 2000</Title><Msg>You can miss earnings by a MILE and still rally.</Msg><Username>investment_wanker</Username><Timestamp>1351303331871</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:02:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351303995905-728</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN Trading Action</Title><Username>whiteonyx52</Username><Timestamp>1351296489158</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:08:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My point is this, and by the way I am not disagreeing with you.

What the HFTs seem to be saying is that (for example) Amazon's foray into Apple's space with the Kindle will make them money, when in fact Amazon is starting from a competitive disadvantage (cost-wise, product-wise, popularity-wise), while eroding both their margins and Apple's. It's true that Kindle is different from ipad, etc., but the same rules apply: Apple had a first-mover advantage in integrating SSDs, screen over-production from TV flat-screen booms, and other miniaturized components, and thus got themselves a huge margin and initial sales. More competition is here now, and no one's margins cannot go up; Apple took a breather because of this fact. Somehow, the "buyers" of AMZN seem to think otherwise, but a reckoning is coming.</Msg><Username>agamemnus_0</Username><Timestamp>1351304172119</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:16:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351304172675-730</Id><Topic><Title>I could not believe you are supporting Amazon Corporate officers and Board of Directors.</Title><Username>geok.chew</Username><Timestamp>1351302939776</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 21:55:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>California, one of the biggest state is beginning to charge sales tax in September along with a host of other states. If that doesn't cut down commerce, I don't know what is. I believe this is one of the critical competitive edge that they just lost to physical retailers. That's why they have been fighting so hard for many years with corporate trickery and loopholes to prevent this. But states are broke and starting to want their fair share of tax revenue. They've been using the revenue growth for years to keep even the smartest bull to ignore the puny little profit (now loses) they have generated. But revenue is useless if you have no profit. That's actually make things worse because, you're holding market share that eventually will be contested over. At some point, like now or the near future, revenue growth will not be possible but the operating losses are here to stay and growing. Than insolvency will be looming in the back ground. The retail "race to the bottom" is not good for many companies in general and Amazon is no exception. It leave them standing like a house of card, with razor thin margin and dwindling cash. Good luck withstanding another economic storm with the house of card like Amazon. I believe that the street is starting to wake up to the fact that the party is over for Amazon.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1351304172675</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:16:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351304301189-731</Id><Topic><Title>I could not believe you are supporting Amazon Corporate officers and Board of Directors.</Title><Username>geok.chew</Username><Timestamp>1351302939776</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 21:55:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I do not believe many (or ANY!) individual investors hold Amazon stock.
