Hello Jennie, Welcome to the exciting world of investing. It would help us answer your question better if you could tell us your approximate age and investment objective and horizon and how much you can afford to lose. If you're young and going for a long-term growth, I believe AMZN is a good stock to own. However, I'm not sure if now is the time to buy AMZN. AMZN may offer a better entry point (below last Friday's close: $257.47) in the near-future. A minor pull-back is quite possible and healthy.

AMZN was already in the uptrend mode 2 years and 1 months ago (August, 2010) when shorts were salivating with the "imminent" crash due to Hindenberg Effect.

If it goes up and you didn't buy it means you haven't lost anything. To make money you have to buy at the right time and sell at the right time. AMZN is near its all time high. Now is the time to sell and bank some profit. Remember, no one ever went broke taking a profit. AMZN always hits new highs, but suppose you buy at 255 and it drops to 220. At that point some investors will get scared and sell. That's the opposite of what you should do. Be patient. When earnings are announced there is a good chance the stock will drop for a day. That is the time to buy.

Most of people bought Kindle Fire because it's cheaper, so these people are price sensitive. They will pay a lot to buy books, and movies. Large percentage of them may even go to XDA get hacked rom to make it be able to access Google Map, Google Playstore and gmail.</Msg><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1348458550762</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 23:49:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348459027025-29</Id><Topic><Title>NTWK $6.7 ..Up 50c….Breaking Out!!......Hottest NASDAQ stock….Up every day since record earnings/strong guidance......This is just the start of a prolonged rally to double digits…,.Fundamentals can support $16 per analysts with $21 max target......Cloud Division is growing exponentially.....Only 6 PE and 1 times sales is 30% of sector average......Very cheap based on steady growth and strong guidance of over 30% revenue growth and $1/share net income in 2013</Title><Username>accountislate</Username><Timestamp>1348253944661</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 14:59:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't know much about T/A but I saw a daily and weekly chart posted at the NTWK board and it looks incredible!! The chart shows an uncanny resemblance (lower or weekly chart) to the 2010 rally when the stock went from $8 to $24 in 4 weeks. I hear that the company is stronger and more diversified now than in 2010. The company did not have the highly profitable cloud divisions in 2010. I will be buying with both hands tomorrow</Msg><Username>d.malkkey</Username><Timestamp>1348459027025</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 23:57:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
