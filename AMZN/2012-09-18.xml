Anyone long the sector is not thinking carefully or has no choice, because any fund manager with a choice not rotating out is simply negligent IMHO. Having said if I were forced to be long any 2 restaurant stocks, they'd be MCD and CMG. I am currently riding a 25% of my typical LT OOM puts from underneath. I sold all my DITM puts when it hit $280 to focus elsewhere (like here). As I always say, don't take on what you cannot carry at a 50% premium for a year. We will crash well within that timeframe. Those that are expecting hyperinflation do not understand the system level interdepencies and the constraints.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347943459793</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 00:44:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347954919926-4</Id><Topic><Title>The lowest price target now is 293</Title><Username>wingofeaglets</Username><Timestamp>1347904673481</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 13:57:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMZN worth at least 1,000. hahahahahaha NOT!!!!</Msg><Username>lehman_bros</Username><Timestamp>1347954919926</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 03:55:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347962312213-5</Id><Title>future are down!!!

That is not because Bezos is shy or reluctant for others to learn of his success ... it is because he intends to conceal the truth. First, retailing in general operates on slim margins.

Any future effort to increase prices by 4%, for example, would be an invitation to competitors to take market share from Amazon. Second, regardless of his deep focus in Montessori, his company (forty years hence) is very unfocused. This has been the undoing of entrepreneurs and CEOs through the ages --- enthusiasm, optimism and hubris frequently cause them to enter fields where they have little expertise, resulting in sub-standard earnings. One of the first decisions made by Steve Jobs upon returning to Apple (in '97) was to cancel virtually all of the products Apple sold so the company could focus on building a few great products. (That's also the advice Jobs gave to Google's Sergy Brin.) Amazon DOES have great features --- I shop there frequently and am a happy customer --- but for me the three most important are: wide selection, comments/ratings from other customers and no sales tax. Suppose for the moment that other customers agree that these are among the top features. What does that imply about the company? #1 is neither unique to Amazon nor particularly difficult to duplicate (for a well-heeled competitor). #2 represents value added by customers, not Amazon. Now, Amazon had the great insight to develop this feature ... but that was MANY years ago. Also, it represents an achilles' heel for Amazon: That information is available to shoppers even if they ultimately buy elsewhere. Just as Amazon lets local retailers serve as its showroom where shoppers examine but don't buy, Amazon is a source of consumer ratings &amp; information that shoppers can use for free ... then buy elsewhere. (Oops!) Finally, the no-sales-tax advantage is pretty rapidly being eroded and won't be common 3-5 years hence. Bezos knows all of this ... which is why he continues looking for new ways to earn a profit. Keep entering new businesses, and maybe one will be profitable.  Keep entering new businesses, keep shareholders focused on the company's future potential instead of its mediocre (in profits) present. One thing from Apple's experience seems relevant when considering Amazon's future. Apple's amazing beginning eventually ran out of steam, and it was no longer able to earn a profit throughout almost all of the 1990's. Finally, when shareholders realized that they had been investing in a dream rather than a profitable company, many sold their shares and stayed away. Even now, its p/e multiple remains at modest levels. Unless Amazon is able to monetize past efforts to create markets and attract loyal customers, eventually shareholders will walk away from it, too. And rather than having a p/e of 100, it will be 10 ... and remain stuck there for the following decade.

If the institutional longs are ever going to get real investors to come back into the market, they gotta quit playing these games and let the MOMO crap go. Everyone knows it is a scam and it keeps people away from the market because everyone immediately thinks back to dot bomb days. But, at this point, I'm not sure FMR, Capital World, State Street and others really comprehend the long term damage they are doing to their assets under management (continuous redemptions and withdrawals) because they are allowing a few growth fund managers and some quant/algo funds to push the limits of collusion to juice ST returns. Unless and until they get it, those fund managers will push the limit until these break, and that could easily be north of $275. They are running the EXACT same channel signalling scam here that they did with CMG (although running it faster with the QEdrenaline)... It bounced today and based upon previous patterns, I could easily see it hitting the upper BB north of $265. I'm not the least bit concerned.

I know you are past that point, but I still hope and pray that TPTB will do the right damn thing for a change. If they don't, there is absolutely nothing Benny B or anyone else can do. The foundation of any economic system is trust and the predatory behavior of the remaining market participant (which continuously erodes what little trust remains) virtually assures its demise and irrelevance. If they wait to sell, they will once again do what you always accuse them of --- transferring wealth from the many to the few. It actually isn't in their long term interest to do that -- as more and more wealth gets concentrated, it will become increasingly clear that fewer WS folks are needed and those that manage the wealth will capture fewer economic rents as time passes.... at some point, they'll wise up. The only question is whether it will be in time...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1348013645387</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 20:14:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348014531234-72</Id><Topic><Title>$266 will be tested tomorrow.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1347993633794</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:40:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Tech, Thanks to you I found about Nanosphere.

It will rise up out of the ashes slowly and without help. People will hate stox AND they will be very cheap...

WW II was a boondoggle for the good ol USA ... Maybe we could be so lucky again to be the last industrial guy standing - but probably not so lucky this time because if sheit breaks out then we'll be at the center instead of on the fringes like ww II ...

The security offers a steady stream of income due to the payment of a high coupon rate. In addition, at maturity the owner will receive either 100% of the par value or, if the stock value falls, a predetermined number of shares of the underlying stock.[1] In the context of structured product, a reverse convertible can be linked to an equity index or a basket of indices. In such case, the capital repayment at maturity is cash settled, either 100% of principal, or less if the underlying index falls conditional on barrier is hit in the case of barrier reverse convertibles.</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1348016937217</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 21:08:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348020331699-76</Id><Topic><Title>More reverse convertibles issued on Amazon</Title><Username>americanuspublius</Username><Timestamp>1348013163630</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 20:06:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Somebody is just selling 208 strike puts on AMZN for 6 months, and packaging it into a MTN.

Part of the reason I post on these boards is in the hope that some investors out there will redirect funds away from float jam scams (which generally do little to enhance our nation's competitveness and thus our children's future) and toward real innovators like NSPH. Keep in mind it is still speculative and probably will have to raise another round at some point and will almost certainly have some big bumps along the way. Having said that, I also believe, unlike Amazon, NSPH could easily be a 500% gain from here in two years if all goes well.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1348024046134</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 23:07:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348025342561-78</Id><Topic><Title>More reverse convertibles issued on Amazon</Title><Username>americanuspublius</Username><Timestamp>1348013163630</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 20:06:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Danger, Danger Will Robinson. Retail investors effectively selling puts at what 250*TTM, 90*FE (likely higher becuase FE are FOS) heading into a potential recession? Now we know why this had to rise so much. They had to bring in the put sellers who will be "comfortable" having their principal converted to amazon shares because it would have to have "corrected" 20%. It will correct another 40% from there, at which point they will all get shaken out, and the institutions can buy those shares back...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1348025342561</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 23:29:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
