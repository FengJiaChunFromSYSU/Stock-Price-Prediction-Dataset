If there is no charge for borrowing, the broker will still benefit from the fact that the cash received by the short seller is tied up in margin without earning interest for the short seller. The money will actually be earning interest for the broker, but they won’t give you any of that money. When you opened an account with a broker, you probably signed an agreement allowing them to borrow shares out of your account. Therefore, it is legal. When shares are sold short, the new buyer gets ownership of the actual shares and in a second set of books, an “IOU” is placed in the share lender’s account replacing the number of shares that were sold short. The share lender, will not see the “IOU”, as it will just look like he still owns the shares when he checks his account. The short seller will show a negative number of shares to offset the “IOU”. The result is that for every new share shorted, an additional long share is "created". For each short share, two people will show a long position in their account for that share; the person from whom the share was borrowed and the person who bought the share from the short seller. The short seller’s account will show a negative for each share shorted.</Msg><Username>jeffpmpccea</Username><Timestamp>1361685098553</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 00:51:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361689080816-3</Id><Topic><Title>BOZO and his gang is dumping shares..</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1361652539542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 15:48:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's the last 3 years.

But, the Titanic has taken on much more water since our last event. Now, it requires heavy positive pressure from QE/POMO, full analysts weekly pump to keep it from sinking too fast. It is still taking on water and start to list badly, so they've added the up/down limit and soon mini options to buy more time to unload more important people before letting it sink. Not just happening here. Every scam is being inflated to record levels (somehow, I don't think limit up will be enforced in situations like NFLX capitulation squeeze)...

How do you determine a responsible short position? and what are the things you look for when determining a stock is a good short? if you want to find one of these dogs at 10 or 30, are the criteria you look for when screening stocks? How about short funds like HDGE? what do you think of them? If I understand you correctly, one of the reasons you oppose options is because they are wasting assets or, as you put it, " designed to lose money." this is true, but it seems to me there is a time element that can work against you in all investments; it is just that this is an essential component of an options trade. But what about the time element in other trades? When you talk about shorting you say you wait it out "without time limit." How can this be? Time comes into shorting the underlying as well, because you can never know for sure what the market is going to do. That's why most short traders do close out a position in a certain amount of time or at a certain percentage if a trade goes against them. You are the first I have heard of who shorts "without time limit." I agree that the market looks like it's near a top, but no one knows. What do you do if AMZN keeps going up for the next five years and never comes down? Or what if the dog you pick at 10 suddenly shoots up to 30 as a result of some freak news release that never entered into your calculations? Unless you have unlimited funds, time is an issue, because your debt just keeps growing, even on a relatively small position. Then in the event of a market decline when you are making a profit, you also have to time your exit. Very few can correctly time the bottom. After the popping of the net bubble, how many held their AMZN short positions all the way down to 10 to reap maximum profits? I'm sure many got out much too early and made only minimal profits compared to what they might have made if they had waited longer. I don't see how anyone can escape the time issue in the market unless their strategy is "buy and hold forever."</Msg><Username>newpikachu</Username><Timestamp>1361711969386</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 08:19:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361716044224-7</Id><Topic><Title>Who iz gonna hold their tulip bulbz too long?</Title><Username>sybil_lives</Username><Timestamp>1361396700569</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 16:45:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Holy shyt!

But if you want to play options, the only way to play them is to be a seller.

This iz not what sybil iz saying at all.... Option sellerz are just az much crackheadz az option buyerz.... The only 'people' that successfully trade optionz (buy or sell them) are thoze with a robot + a stastically significant amoubt of the float. This iz the only way with any level of certainty to set the bet line.... Dummiez just dont get it.... Sybil cant wait until retail crackheadz think they can make shoe-in money SELLING optionz....</Msg><Username>sybil_lives</Username><Timestamp>1361747731386</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 18:15:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361754062009-30</Id><Topic><Title>Who iz gonna hold their tulip bulbz too long?</Title><Username>sybil_lives</Username><Timestamp>1361396700569</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 16:45:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Syb, I'm not trying to figure out the market; I already know I'll never figure it out. I ask these questions because I want to know more about your personal views and trading style. I hope you will still honor me with a reply to my questions, cryptic and evasive oracle! You have made yourself famous here on the AMZN msg board.

The big money is made off of predicting future events. Never under estimate the power of a big market spike one way or the other. And now.... every one and their brother KNOWS its going to be a down spike. That's what scares me, because in reality its going to be an upspike I'm afraid. And that means one word. War.
