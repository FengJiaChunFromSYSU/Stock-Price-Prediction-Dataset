The cartel makes close to all of its money squeezing shorts. Remember, the cartel itself is on the long side. Big money got in at $17 and certainly below $100. So, it is all about taking it as high as possible and earning as much as possible from shorts and then faking out a collapse. The fake collapse does one key thing: it gives the illusion of bargain, which let them sell their real shares for more than they paid for them (buy at $50 sell at $150 after a drop from $250). Basically, their are more buyers after a collapse which they can sell heavily against without spoofing out the market. There are actually a few stocks where shorts have lost more money over the years than the true market cap of that said stock. Shorts are they own enemy as they have weaker hands than the long side. This comes from the fact that longs have a long-term tenacity whereas shorts have a short-term one. Longs hold after big drops, but shorts run to cover at the slightest uptrend.</Msg><Username>trade_that_trade</Username><Timestamp>1343571175000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 10:12:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343572122000-8</Id><Topic><Title>Cracks starting to appear in amzn model</Title><Username>terp5l6</Username><Timestamp>1343518894000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 19:41:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>did any one even notice they guided to a LOSS???</Msg><Username>notoriousbono</Username><Timestamp>1343572122000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 10:28:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343572302000-9</Id><Title>Bezos supports pervert marriage $2.5M</Title><Msg>Time to use another book vending site.

But I have a few questions. 1. Sales - I don't seem to see that anyone has notice that sales growth seems to be decelerating. As I recall sales used to increase around 40% over the previous years quarter. Now it is under 30%. 2. Gross Margin Growth - When a business activity has no cost of sales the Gross Profit is a meaningless number as it is 100%. As Amazon goes into services with no cost of sales of course that will cause over all gross profit margin to increase but that does not indicate any progress. You must look to Operating profit to see that. 3. Earnings - I really don't understand the concept of why investing in the future should provide a pass on low earnings. Investing in a business is usually done by recording something as a capital asset and then expensing it over time against the future earning it is supporting. This is a basic accounting principal. Also if Amazon is expected to maintain its continued growth it must continually invest and would never reach the earnings expectations. I would note that my investment brokers earnings report seems to drop the analysts earnings expectation almost on a quarterly basis for 2011, 2012 and 2013. Based on the above facts, I would think that this stock would be dropping like Netflix after the last report and outlook. I am not sure this is not a busness that grows the top line by continuing to invest in low profit margin business and because it is doing it over the "Internet" it is getting an histerical response. On an anticdotal note I recently purchased a TV that I priced from a number of sources and Costco ended being about 10 to 15 percent lower than Amazon before sales tax. I also had it up and running 2 hours after I purchased it and would have been able to return it to the store within 90 days.

I always bet responsibly, but I do so through DITM LT put options. They are gonna hold make all the short calls eat 'em and while killing all the short dated puts and then pull the bid. Give it two weeks and two or three days and then it will start to get really interesting. Good luck.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1343612209000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 21:36:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343612527000-37</Id><Title>people. you will all get bagged in AMZN</Title><Msg>this is so ridiculous and unpredictable. you just all love the gamble. watch when it cracks by tuesday</Msg><Username>tycobb_us</Username><Timestamp>1343612527000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 21:42:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343614931000-38</Id><Topic><Title>When US starts to tighten like Europe...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1343446804000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 23:40:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tech, Would a ramp be out of the question???- Pj</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1343614931000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 22:22:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343615330000-39</Id><Title>289 pe. lol. could be worse. lnkd has close to a 1000 pe. rofl.</Title><Msg>Short amzn herd.

They have similar retail cult following that lose sight of reality. It will be a lot harder given the timing. The public has no idea how close we could be to an extraordinary shock and how thoroughly we've exhausted the traditional Playbook. I'm only long a handful of things. Short a bunch. The next week will hurt, but in # month I will be far ahead again.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1343617295000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 23:01:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343617372000-43</Id><Topic><Title>When US starts to tighten like Europe...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1343446804000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 23:40:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not true.

Until the growth slows, that stock can keep running. Their p/e will drop from 1000 to 100 in the next few q's while amzn's won't drop tenfold to 29. AMZN's p/e will most likely increase. So I would say that comparing lnkd to amzn based on p/e is a very poor choice. LNKD has great margins, growth and will make a lot of money until other players eat into their lunch. Amzn competes in the uber competitive, extremely low margin retail space where a 15 p/e is pricey. I highly doubt amzn will ever pull in enough earnings at even $100/sh to give it a p/e of 15 let alone @ $237 /sh. Where do people think the stock price can go if they even do have some great q's? This company will never justify it's price with 2 percent margins or even 10 percent margins which are impossible in big box retail anyway.</Msg><Username>Snaffew</Username><Timestamp>1343619327000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 23:35:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343620537000-48</Id><Title>Shorts</Title><Msg>Shorty, Shorty, Shorty.
