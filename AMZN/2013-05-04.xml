I saw that a while ago and I just looked at it again. It's nice you love Amazon so much and there may be some branding affect but honestly I don't think anything in your article truly addresses the metrics in this article one iota. I understand the mentality of it always goes up so I just buy based on what it always does so I guess you just keep doing that until it doesn't work. Again that makes sense as long as you don't double, triple and quadruple down when and if it finally doesn't. http://seekingalpha.com/article/1385631-amazon-keeps-spending-more-as-its-customers-spend-less Good luck.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1367682031522</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 11:40:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367688582397-7</Id><Topic><Title>Look out over yonder from the hieghts of a mkt blowoff top</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367610749178</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:52:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not yet somewhere around 1650-1710</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1367688582397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 13:29:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367690984332-8</Id><Topic><Title>Look out over yonder from the hieghts of a mkt blowoff top</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367610749178</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:52:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybs set up worst case at 1700 back last summer, but iz honestly shocked we got this far (bernanke) . We land where we land between now and july, where ever that may be. Sybs content to sit short and add a little on the way up. All thingz considered, the down side far outweighz the upside of theze markets. The fed can print a bubble az we all know over 35 yearz, but it cant print sustainablity... Bernanke did a good job bailing out OB's 'fat cats'. We alwayz had our cats, but the treasury and Fed stuffed them with bernanke bux and made them fat cats, and now re-elected OB iz 'complaining' about hiz fat cats. OB's a better republican then bush, yet sheeple limba republicans hate him, but the real republicanz keep quite and soak themselvez in bernanke bux hot tubz.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367690984332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 14:09:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367692507305-9</Id><Topic><Title>Look out over yonder from the hieghts of a mkt blowoff top</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367610749178</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:52:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even a broken watch is right twice each day, idiot.</Msg><Username>rick3ster</Username><Timestamp>1367692507305</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 14:35:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367712375344-10</Id><Topic><Title>Look out over yonder from the hieghts of a mkt blowoff top</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367610749178</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:52:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Even a broken watch is right twice each day, idiot."

I see every where from top to bottom people is touting stock is the best place to be in, the FED got your back, economy recovering, and other BS. I sense that the top is fairly close by. It scares me since there is no permanent plateaus since everything is so out of whack and will eventually reset at the expene of extreme inflation or severe deflation take your pick. All this "paper" wealth will be gone to the delight of WS insiders who I believe could secretly cashing out their long positions opening up their short now or very soon. US has lost the AAA rating, it's the dollar that could soon be loosing it's status as currency king. It's crazy, yes I know. But with all these debt money, one day, people could wake up and face with massive bank holidays due to loans defaulting everywhere. All of the plastic will seize to work and what's left is cold hard physical cash or PM for bartering. Austerity, such a dirty word.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1367716268175</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:11:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367724918115-12</Id><Title>collapse and get it over with</Title><Msg>Extremely over bought on nothing but throwing money at dead markets.
