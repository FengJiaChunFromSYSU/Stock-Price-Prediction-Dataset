Look at asia, Nikkei up and down 2% every other day on currency moves. It's all about central banks pumping money into markets and currency manipulation, no longer about economical or company fundamentals. Markets could collapse any time from now on, because of systemic currency failure.

China simply wont let them and russia and iran arent going to line up an help em out. Since the stock market near all time highz iz 'forward looking' (actually its just a scam mechanism to transfer wealth from the many to the few), it will see this 'black swan event' (even though its az plain to see az any ol run of the mill white swan) many many months before this event happenz and will roll over with sheeple being the most positive and complacent... BOND BULLIEZ will be the next crisis bad guy boogymen, and right fully so, they will be the idiot banks and financial institutionz that were bailed out with bernanke bux at high moral hazard and will fvck the public by raking in their tax payer assets for 40 cents on the dollar... They will only do this after they pump the markets and write az much bond debt az humanly possible with a robot to generate cash and stok feez.... When the markets freeze up and the to big to failurez refuse to write bondz they will tank the markets and win (again).</Msg><Username>sybil_lives</Username><Timestamp>1360432821922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:00:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360433630917-10</Id><Topic><Title>Dont you find it odd that when tax receipts are down and in what should be the most austere of timez that....</Title><Username>sybil_lives</Username><Timestamp>1360432821922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are right. Most of the “Stimulus” money was spent on life support to states and cities near bankruptcy (so they could maintain their bond ratings and continue their overspending for a few more years, and get through the next election cycle). They should have been tightening their belts. But government employment is as high as ever, and higher in some places. When the stimulus and QE money dries up, the panic will begin.</Msg><Username>jeffpmpccea</Username><Timestamp>1360433630917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:13:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360435741001-11</Id><Topic><Title>Dont you find it odd that when tax receipts are down and in what should be the most austere of timez that....</Title><Username>sybil_lives</Username><Timestamp>1360432821922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes ....

At the time I thought you being over dramatic but now I'm think it's a possibility. You still hold that mind set? Not that this bull saves AMZN, the trend is still down. It will just be a slow descend instead of a fast crash. Wrong board but..... NFLX is collecting shorts for another short squeeze isn't it? I'm out of that trade and waiting for another bone crushing squeeze.before easing into it. - PJ</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1360436752454</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 14:05:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360438319479-13</Id><Topic><Title>Dont you find it odd that when tax receipts are down and in what should be the most austere of timez that....</Title><Username>sybil_lives</Username><Timestamp>1360432821922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PJ, sybilz range on the s&amp;p iz 1700 on the up side and 450 on the down side: 175:1075 = 7:43 oddz Place your bets, but bet wisely because the shorting the parabola can take you out the friday before the monday you are found to be correct....

Thanks! Ya, I'm waiting until I see some weakness before getting in. I don't think it breaks for real until after the printing stops or interest rate rise. Was thinking short TNA and definitely FAS and maybe some MC or V. Most short squeeze spikes I've seen correct within a few days, if they don't, there usually is another leg up. Going on day 11 for NFLX..... I'll wait for 200...207 makes even more sense. But are you saying it pulls back to 135 before squeezing again?! Cruel those 'bots....
