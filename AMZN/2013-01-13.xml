I'm probably missing something here... Let's look at a simplified example (illustrative only): Let's say there are only two on-line competitors: amzn and bby Let's say that last year total sales = $100 and this year it went up 14% (see comscore) to $114. Let's say that sales were evenly split between amzn and bby last year. amzn sales = $50 and bby = $50 Well, if bby increased its sales by only 5% yoy, their on-line sales for this year = 1.05*$50 = $52.5. AMZN would have increased its sales to $61.5 or 23%. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that if bby doesn't increase its on-line sales by at least 14%, another company (amzn?) is increasing its market share.</Msg><Username>johnalexgordon</Username><Timestamp>1358080506791</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 07:35:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358082789328-8</Id><Title>AMZN is the PERFECT demonstration os MARKET INEFFICIENCIES.....</Title><Msg>I hope no one still think that the market is efficient..... 20-50 big dudes/institutions are now controling stock market mouvements... many stocks(like amzn) are now just toys used by big hands to fill their pockets.....

Do you suppose it has anything to do with the fact that I've read everything JB has written, and watched every youtube video of him that is available?

BBY showed they can compete directly with AMZN on online-sales. Increased competition simply means less growth for AMZN. More importantly, it means AMZN will not be able to get to an "nutopia" where it simply could, ahem, "reduce it costs", "increase prices for everyone", and do whatever to rake in the pie-in-the-sky revenues and profits that would justify its current valuation; The number one concern of a consumer is to get a good enough deal. A good deal means first of foremost a good enough price, convenience, and the peace of mind that one is able to ask someone a question or quickly swap out a product. Up until now, due to the sales tax advantage, which is ending, AMZN could offer a price that overwhelmed the other factors. That's no longer the case, and that's why BBY online sales growth is a very critical validation point. AMZN is becoming a short in the style of NFLX -- maybe even much better, and much more devastating. NFLX, at least, had and still has somewhat of a niche, AMZN got dozen of very well-heeled and influential competitors along with thousands of smaller ones.</Msg><Username>stock_lol</Username><Timestamp>1358100028901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 13:00:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358100184068-22</Id><Topic><Title>Forget about earnings, new paradigm is revenue growth - AMZN and FB will set new records</Title><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1358099613052</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 12:53:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right, PE did not matter either in 1999, and house prices will never drop because we are out of land and babies are born every seconds.</Msg><Username>stock_lol</Username><Timestamp>1358100184068</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 13:03:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358100355958-23</Id><Title>Move Over Berkshire Here Comes Amazon</Title><Msg>The Year ~ 2020 Amazon trading at $151,000 a share with a P/E of 8101</Msg><Username>johns_joint</Username><Timestamp>1358100355958</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 13:05:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358100641963-24</Id><Topic><Title>Forget about earnings, new paradigm is revenue growth - AMZN and FB will set new records</Title><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1358099613052</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 12:53:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I didn't say it will stay like this forever - all bubbles eventually burst whether it's real estate or bond or Amazon.

I guess the upgrade to outperform was not quite good enough for the boss or Bezos told the boss at MS to improve the recommendation level. That allowed them to hold on longer. The very day they did that, I believe strongly would have been the day when AMZN peaked and right now would have been trading undrer 240; maybe much lower. The technicals were precarious. That very day, the general market was down a lot. The next few days a few others, not to be outdone, jumped on the bandwagon with their upgrades of AMZN. It is really childish. These guys should be ashamed to be seen in public after being such fools. I would tell the CEO of MS right to his face what I think. Come on CEO, meet me for lunch. Are you afraid to talk common sense? I think you are. It is unethical at the very least when MS knows very well that their made up reasons are BS. They are in the bully pulpit, so they get to do that. The music will stop at some point, but not untll they let it or external events break the trend and even they have to capitulate.

If you ran some institutional $$$, where would you put that $$$. Certainly not AMZN because of the small upside. Maybe FB... don't they have a "big" announcement coming out next week? Down-side is huge here. If they miss rev and eps on the q4 2012 report, they are likely going to go into a sustained downtrend. Question, how would you feel if you ran institutional $$$ and had a big investment in amzn? What would you do if you wanted out? Write a bunch of calls? Sell big chunks of stock and risk causing a panic among the other larger holders? Also, who would you sell to? volume has been lite.</Msg><Username>johnalexgordon</Username><Timestamp>1358105111370</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 14:25:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358105234771-32</Id><Topic><Title>a failure of the markets</Title><Username>johnalexgordon</Username><Timestamp>1358039592070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:13:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You'd strongly buy AMZN at this level?
