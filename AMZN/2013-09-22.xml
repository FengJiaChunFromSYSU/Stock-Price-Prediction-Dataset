Fundamentals? Facts? You're plenty focused on attacking others, yet offer nothing of substance or value. NAS's big insight is that QE lifts the market (except for stocks like AAPL that have been crushed despite solid fundies... don't worry about that counterfactual). I haven't even seen that level of intellectual content from A/J on this board, but maybe he does so on other boards. So fellas, how high is it going? What is Amazon going to earn next year?

I'm not a good trader. But, I'm rarely wrong on fundamentals economic analysis. I'd be happy to look at any source for your "well founded" assertion. I'll simply refer you to the AEO2013 report which shows that we have a LONG way to go for energy independence. ****** Oil production, particularly from tight oil plays, rises over the next decade, leading to a reduction in net import dependence Crude oil production has increased since 2008, reversing a decline that began in 1986. From 5.0 million barrels per day in 2008, U.S. crude oil production increased to 6.5 million barrels per day in 2012. Improvements in advanced crude oil production technologies continues to lift domestic supply, with domestic production of crude oil increasing in the Reference case before declining gradually beginning in 2020 for the remainder of the projection period. The projected growth results largely from a significant increase in onshore crude oil production, particularly from shale and other tight formations, which has been spurred by technological advances and relatively high oil prices. Tight oil development is still at an early stage, and the outlook is highly uncertain. In some of the AEO2013 alternative cases, tight oil production and total U.S. crude oil production are significantly above their levels in the Reference case. The net import share of U.S. petroleum and other liquids consumption (including crude oil, petroleum liquids, and liquids derived from nonpetroleum sources) grew steadily from the mid-1980s to 2005 but has fallen in every year since then (Figure 1). In the Reference case, U.S. net imports of petroleum and other liquids decline through 2019, while still providing approximately one-third of total U.S. supply. The net import share of U.S. petroleum and other liquids consumption continues to decline in the Reference case, falling to 34 percent in 2019 before increasing to 37 percent in 2040.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1379901612605</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-22 22:00:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379901960000-31</Id><Topic><Title>Tech - youre right again....</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1379899935623</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-22 21:32:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybs: I am commercializing two energy technologies, one of which is liquid fuels based. There's a reason oil and gas prices are stubbornly high despite domestic demand dropping... And when people talk about being energy independent in 2030, they always fail to mention the market clearing price... For those that are intellectually curious, there is an interesting IMF working paper that explores the impact of a drop in trend production growth to 1%. Read it and you'll develop a better understanding of what is in store for the global economy.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1379901960000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-22 22:06:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379904792834-32</Id><Topic><Title>Sybil's cracked crystal ball</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1379895827613</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-22 20:23:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Will this be like last time, a few weeks ago, when Syb was yelling "parabolic move--cover all shorts, then quickly reversed to a full short.</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1379904792834</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-22 22:53:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379904877632-33</Id><Topic><Title>Yuuuuoooooo betterrrrrrr cooooooooverrrrrrr</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1379894228992</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-22 19:57:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Syb.
