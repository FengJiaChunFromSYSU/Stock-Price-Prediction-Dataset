Of course, the upshot for him is he only works (if you can call it that) during market hours... at least for now. But, it has to be a little scary for him as he begins to realize that he has invested his life doing something that creates no value and is in secular decline. I'm sure there are plenty of posters and readers on this board that think I am an arrogant (and stupid) POS. I suspect most of them are daytraders or "finance professionals" who only see life through the prism of the past 3 decades -- the great financialization ponzi (Sybs, since you are giving me supply and demand lessons, maybe you can help me understand what happens to 401Ks flows as a greater percentage of the population retires and lives longer and the Millenials have lower real incomes and massive college loans, upon which they are defaulting) The financial sector cannot see the bubble because as Faber elogantly put it it is the bubble. And that bubble is getting very close to bursting. There is about to be a massive excess supply of "finance professionals" looking for work as the system comes back into balance. If you happen to be a member of said group, I hope you are preparing and not assuming a minor or short term adjustment. It's going to take a decade to work through the excess financialization of the economy and it will likely be a painful and humbling experience for many. I don't wish for any decent human beings (which disqualifies Geeg and Nas) to lose money or get hurt. I hope you've taken some off the table and that you honed skills that actually create value.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1380695531646</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 02:32:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380707610537-2</Id><Topic><Title>Think of it this way</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1380674120606</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 20:35:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look at the history of your calls.

Add to that lost confidence of a gamed financial system whose primary purpose iz to transfer wealth from the many to the few, and you have even bigger reduction in DEMAND. Now that we know that demand iz low and going lower, we can answer why sypply must be crimped faster than demand - it iz done so by qe supported buy and hold 'banks' that get paid weekly rent for doing so by peddling optionz crack... It works until it doesnt tech.

The Fed's balance is going toward $4 billion. And the 10 yr's bought have many below 2 %. So it's not so easy for rates to go up with out the leverage up system going up in flames. This whole bull from 2008 is built on supressing rates while running stocks to huge multiples to get a wealth effect of the rich: the low volume shows it : it's a top 5 % type rally: and it's dangerous with record margin interest among other things in the works. It's more imporatant that rates stay low than stocks going into the bubblenomic stratisphere ahead.</Msg><Username>homeytheclown03</Username><Timestamp>1380715439994</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 08:03:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380715886589-13</Id><Topic><Title>Paid pumpers and bashers drowning real signal in noise...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1380682336337</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 22:52:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Techstrategy: "I'm sure there are plenty of posters and readers on this board that think I am an arrogant (and stupid) POS."

That class tends to be domestic exporters. Dmoestic float jam scams like Amazon, whose international sales and profits are concentrated in nations on the decline (Europe and Japan) simply will not get said benefit. Also, those countries tend to save first through physical rather than financial markets. What you are really seeing right now is the leadup to the breakdown in USD hegemony.

Marc Oczachowski, EDAP’s chief executive officer, continued, “Therapeutic ultrasound is gradually gaining ground in cancer treatment approach. We clearly see a growing interest in minimally invasive focal therapies for cancer tumors. Our 20 years expertise in the treatment of localized prostate cancer using HIFU has long been demonstrated and we are excited to further participate in the development of such new projects aiming at improving cancer drug delivery. While we expand our expertise in HIFU to further applications, we remain fully focused on developing our HIFU technology and adapt it to the current focal therapy trend to treat prostate cancers. We believe that the focal therapy approach represents a unique opportunity for Ablatherm HIFU to become the gold standard of treatment for prostate cancer.” -</Msg><Username>fdaplayv</Username><Timestamp>1380734705675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 13:25:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380735683984-55</Id><Topic><Title>I COMPARE NFLX AND AMZN TO PCLN AND GOOG.

But, the 3,000 sf home works for me and it limits how much my real estate taxes and energy bills can go up to pay for our unfunded liabilities in Cook County and Illinois. 2) I hate what trading has done to the capital markets and investing writ large. The entire financial economic has become completely parasitic. It used to actually add value. Not anymore. I still hold out hope that some folks within the financial community will realize that, by failing to exercise human judgement, they are obviating the need for their existence... The rebalancing I talk about is inevitable and it will happen soon. The only question is whether we will hav e a complete collpase of faith in the system (which happens if they keep trying to perpetuate these scame) or whether they simply let the float jam scams (where the real bubbles reside) go. All that it will take is the TBTF/PD/POMO banks deciding to direct the infinite daily leverage to investing rather than predatory trading and scalping (which this week seems to have been to try to force call sellers to eat the calls). The moment they do, this freefalls. Right now, looks like your gold call is holding. Personally, I think that is where we will see the endgame play out. We are headed toward a complete crisis of confidence in the system (starting with cash settlement of gold). Time is truly running out for TPTB/TBTF to use the POMO to manage a stable transition...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1380762619792</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 21:10:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380764765811-71</Id><Topic><Title>the real problem with techstrategy if any of u still need to know</Title><Username>cashback_7</Username><Timestamp>1380734545774</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 13:22:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But look what bothers me...
