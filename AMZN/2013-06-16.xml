Glen Doherty, 42, and Tyrone Woods, 41, U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. and Sean Smith weren’t so lucky. It was reported that both Woods and Doherty were killing every terrorist that appeared. Ty repeatedly requested back-up support from a Specter gunship that was in a neutral area. This is a C-130 aircraft that fires 20mm bullets (about the size of a man’s thumb) and 105 howitzer rounds at laser-illuminated targets. This aircraft is commonly used by U.S. Special Operations forces to provide support to Special Operations teams on the ground involved in intense firefights. The aircraft was told to “stand down”! WHY? And by whom? Again, only the President can give the order to military units to cross a country’s borders or not to. But he had a campaign to run and was absent and unavailable.</Msg><Username>purebred_red</Username><Timestamp>1371393763674</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 10:42:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371402025702-2</Id><Topic><Title>REMEMBER THE ONLY REASON YOU ARE ALIVE TODAY</Title><Username>purebred_red</Username><Timestamp>1371393763674</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 10:42:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's four fathers that won't be having a Happy Father's day.</Msg><Username>turtle_toss</Username><Timestamp>1371402025702</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 13:00:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371402377187-3</Id><Topic><Title>INTERNET SALES TAXES WILL SINK AMAZON</Title><Username>inpeach_obama</Username><Timestamp>1371306517989</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 10:28:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wrong! Jeff Bezos owns 80,000,000 shares along with partner American Funds almost as much. To much control over stock, market makers. Pick another stock to short. Best to stay away from trading this stock long or short. So far longs are winning past couple of years. Only way stock will go down if another Company decides to compete against e-commerce site like Google with electronic catalogues.</Msg><Username>smartybob569</Username><Timestamp>1371402377187</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 13:06:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371403386169-4</Id><Title>IN THE COMPANY OF BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA</Title><Msg>Isaias Afewerki, Eritrea Omar al-Bashir, Sudan Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan Bashar al-Assad, Syria U Thein Sein, Myanmar G.

The local WalMart neighborhood store sells whole milk for $2.90 per gal. On top of this 51% markup, there's a $299/year subscription fee, and a $35 min per order. Pay a lot more, and there's a chance that your food will be sitting in the sun on your front porch for half a day while you're at work. Most people are already heading out for work before 5:30 am.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1371411006246</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 15:30:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
