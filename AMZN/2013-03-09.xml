The folks on this board blame the Fed for everything. It definitely plays a huge role. The Fed's money printing is basically choosing those that have pre-existing financial wealth as winners and those without it as losers. That's one thing for folks my age who had an opportunity to accumulate in a different era/context. But, it is quite another for the youth. Their professional careers start in an era of how unemployment and underemployment, with artificially high college tuition costs, home prices, gas and necessity prices, etc. When the youth in a society has no prospects, bad things happen. ZH points out the student loan debt all the time. But, the housing bubble was an intergenerational transfer of wealth that we are refusing to let reverse. Those students graduating with oodles of debt and little prospect for higher paying jobs CANNOT afford overpriced housing assets. Thus, the housing recovery WILL NOT happen because the "flow" of household formation cannot happen. And, the money printing simply leads to an increase in the price of necessities which again hit the youth disproportionately because they never had the chance/time to accumulate the financial assets to ride through this financial repression and necessities are a greater fraction of their salaries, reducing disposable income. But, what about these scams? Why do I focus here? Because we still have massive wealth in society that could be deployed to productive investment and reverse course. Instead, it is tied up in tradnig scams that create no value. When society's resources are all directed to that which at best, redistributes value and generally consumes value, REAL growth doesn't occur. Fake nominal growth does. Unless real growth through real investments in illiquid productive investments returns, we are hosed.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362844133438</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 10:48:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362845172090-19</Id><Topic><Title>sooner or later Tech will have to walk away or</Title><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1362840213839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 09:43:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't want the financial sector to shrivel up and die. I want it to succeed and grow. But, it can only do that by restoring trust and returning to its roots. That's what it used to do by allocating capital to productive companies and restoring internal balance to the market in the form of relative valuation. IPOs and M&amp;A generally create value. M&amp;A's will would accelerate massively if market capitalizations were realistic. M&amp;A is still quite low because sophisticated investors know many companies are bubbles. The massive internal disconnect in the market (MOMO bubbles enabled by short squeeze and float jam scam) only breeds distrust from retail investors who know it is a matter of time, so they scale out gradually. My issue with these scams is that they systematically engender malinvestment. And no, it is not caused by Benny B. It is enabled by the excess liquidity, but enablement and cause are two different things. It is caused by unchecked greed of certain institutions and manner others who've decided to pocket a little more short term gain at the expense of lost of trust and secular decline. For those that think I'm wrong, look at the RIF on WS that continue. It will accelerate as trust is lost... I will not walk away until the institutional longs do the right thing and restore balance. Yesterday's Yahoo incident got me working on the comprehensive short thesis to post on Seeking Alpha. You've seen my posts for long enough to know that I had identified the issues that Tim Phillips and Paulo Santos publish on more than a year ago. Last night, I started putting out a few more tidbits that undermine the story and highlight the true fragility of this situation. When they let the scams go and restore balance, I walk away. That doesn't threaten the status quo. It simply means they make money (and more over the longer term) from productive investment rather than predatory skimming/scalping, which is leading us toward destabilizing outcomes.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362845172090</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 11:06:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362847038763-20</Id><Topic><Title>sooner or later Tech will have to walk away or</Title><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1362840213839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 09:43:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will not walk away until the institutional longs do the right thing and restore the balance ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is hilarious. They are trying to restore the balance by transferring the worthless cr. ap. that belongs to them and their clients on the sheeple and the shorts. And they don't mind to get paid in weekly option premiums... or monthly... or leaps - whatever they can take. As soon as they finish their process (or as soon as some of them finish and have enough money to kill those who hasn't made it to the finish line with them) they will speed up the balancing completion with the black swan. Hey, what is all this talk for. Publish the article and list the large funds momo holdings for starters and how they changed from q to q. Identify the killer whales and their future victims.

I will probably connect with the Tyler as I view ZH as a much more credible and rigorous outlet. Most of the folks I know in the analyst/fund community read it, as well as daytraders/retail. A friend is in the process of publishing some derivatives related stuff in upcoming HBR issue. I've been talking with him about this stuff and will probably publish with him as a nationally recognized securities law expert. I'm obviously more on the business fundamental economics side... I'm documenting the historical case studies (NFLX, GMCR, CMG) that provide useful historical evidence of the game/scam. They clearly demonstrate the Ponzi/greater fool aspect of funds holding rather than selling here. There's the statistical analysis of multiples and relative expasion contraction as a function of float and presence of weeklies (minis will further amplify the problem) and quant fund accumulation/distribution that helps show how we get to this point. Amazing how high beta stocks become low beta after hitting already insane price levels... and go up 50% or so from initial breakdown before then dropping 60-80%.... Then there's the massively intellectually dishonest Sell side BS that I have been tearing into for awhile here that pumpgrades the hell out of these during the low volume ascent, squeezing shorts until few are left and allowing quants/CapWorld and Fido to unload via the upper deck selling call with just enough support to paint the tape northward. Until someone has unloaded enough. And then collateral damage ensues. And analysts run away (as they have with AAPL even as it actually has real fundamentals). I will keep releasing tidbits on the board on the Scamazon. THere are more under discussed and under appreciated challenges facing Amazon. Contrary to NAS assertion, falling gas prices will not improve Amazon's performance because the or other correlated changes that will affect the true profit driver, amplifying adverse selection biases.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362859042006</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 14:57:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362866267262-29</Id><Title>amzn down hard next week</Title><Msg>to bad longs</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1362866267262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 16:57:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362866723922-30</Id><Topic><Title>sooner or later Tech will have to walk away or</Title><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1362840213839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 09:43:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>u are not bearish enough to participate in zh. :) everyone knows u like mickey, apple and stuff like that.</Msg><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1362866723922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 17:05:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362871839387-31</Id><Topic><Title>SQUAWK BOX to feature AMZN CEO!</Title><Username>chad.cooper61</Username><Timestamp>1362420966374</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 13:16:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good news</Msg><Username>moral_max</Username><Timestamp>1362871839387</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 18:30:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362890075210-32</Id><Topic><Title>amzn down hard next week</Title><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1362866267262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 16:57:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How hard is hard.
