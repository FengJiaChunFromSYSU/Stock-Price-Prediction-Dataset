If they were to Pick up their chips here then for every 100k levered short at 35% equity at the beginning of the week then they would be DOWN a WHOPPING 25k for every hundred K invested..... WOW! 32% equity levered shorts sitting over the weekend arent getting much sleep .... They are probably pretty irritable, and lord forbid the cat come out because it will be swiftly kicked. shorts starting last week 32% or lower and did nothing are DEAD.

Afterall, AAPL was selling some book, so movies seemed a good fit. AAPL has to figure out how to compete against AMZN: the market obviously things AMZN is going to clean their clock in the next stage of content delivery. Who's gonna step up? Competition is good and the big pockets are out there to compete.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1373729712807</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 11:35:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373729721465-32</Id><Title>140 Billion for a company that has an EPS of -0.19</Title><Msg>and still being chased!! 2000 all over again!</Msg><Username>mo_659</Username><Timestamp>1373729721465</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 11:35:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373731295506-33</Id><Topic><Title>amzn bought servers in 2008-9 for 10 cents on the dollar</Title><Username>davekomives</Username><Timestamp>1373716535617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 07:55:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And they are worth 5 cents now.</Msg><Username>agamemnus_0</Username><Timestamp>1373731295506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 12:01:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373731751119-34</Id><Title>AMZN will be more than AAPL..I see $500 coming</Title><Msg>nothing can stop the computers.</Msg><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1373731751119</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 12:09:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373736923016-35</Id><Topic><Title>Only 2% of float is short--don't count on a short squeeze pumpers--you idiots have to buy to keep it rising</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1373690399679</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 00:39:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's a huge problem.

We already know, that the analysts originally forecasted AMZN to be growing earnings to $5 by now originally from that $2.52. number. Instead, the earnings went down, stock more than doubled, and the analysts continue to rasie AMZN price tartgets relentlessly while lowering near earnings. Every investment AMZN has made has been rewarded big time by the market. They certainly have gotten a pass by the market to bottom line numbers for a long long time. In fact , forever. In fact, where shorts were right into the last few years is that there was a down cycle in earnings not forecasted by the WS analysts. What wasn't expected was not only wouldn't it matter, but also blow the stock out parabolically which it's now in the priocess of doing. AMZN stock didn't just jump the "shark" the last two years in the face of declining earnings, it skyrocketed to the moon here. I would have to agree with some who mention it here, that a lot of that, if all, has to do with the Federal Reserve's monthly QE purchases that ,expecially, seem to keep AMZN stock driving higher and higher. As long as the Bernanke put is there, Bezos may come closer and closer to attaining the wealth of Bill Gates and Carlos Slim, without even getting to the stage of showing consistent corporate profits to the balance sheet. Profits don't seem to matter, just QE backing right now and for so long now.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1373742357649</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 15:05:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373744073346-41</Id><Topic><Title>I am inventing the AMZN Rule</Title><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1373738088812</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 13:54:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's because of pseudo capitalism.

You'll have to let the bulls have their runs especially is only being held up by momentum and fantasies. It can go to whatever, I don't care. All I know is I will be there in the end to ride it down. There will be obvious signs when the time comes. Low % short and high daily short volume means bears are trying to time this and so far the vast majority have been sheared. Don't fight the FED. Let the FED destroy itself, either soon or down the road. They are loosing control with the interest rates as the rest has figured out that there's no way that the government can pay down these debts without killing the economy and standard of living. This is the worst of both world, more worthless balance sheet stuffing while the debt payment balloon bigger. Very soon the FED balance sheet will take a big haircut if they're keep continuing with reckless abandoning. They should have stopped several years ago and let the market readjust but no. The rest of the world will not just stand by and let their dollars be destroyed because, it's their money too. They will force the FED to stop or slow down with the interest rates rise. It will be a slow death for the FED when their balance sheet is full of worthless treasury and toxic loans. Yes, they can buy unlimited amount of paper but who's going to bail the FED when these paper blow up??? How about converting bad paper to toilet paper?

That's why a couple of year back NFLX lost customers after it increased subscription price, and its stock collapse to less than $60 at certain point. due to this reason. Having AMZN shares in your account just like having a time bomb. Someday, if it doesn't have growth, its stock could collapse more than 60-70% like what NFLX experienced.</Msg><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1373762546359</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 20:42:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373764364019-67</Id><Topic><Title>Time to sell, not necessarily short AMZN...</Title><Username>gomerpylegriffith</Username><Timestamp>1373761845520</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 20:30:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Historical chart showed that AMZN only go up about $20 after breaking up top Its breaking up top in the last 3 years are $191 -- $206 -- $227 -- $246 -- $264 -- $284 -- ?? Now it is already more than $20 higher than previous high. Assuming percentage wise is similar to previous ones, this time it should stop around $310. I guess the reason the previous ones only go up around $20 because its stock price is just too high in terms of valuation. No fund dare to big up further.</Msg><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1373764364019</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 21:12:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373766520807-68</Id><Title>sorry</Title><Msg>I meant the Sept 4500 call</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1373766520807</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 21:48:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
