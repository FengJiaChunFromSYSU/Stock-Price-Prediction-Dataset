They have over 200 million actual loyal users which grow everyday but more importantly they have the 11-29 year old age group completely locked up with over 5 Billion in that specific age group to get online in China over the next 5 years for the 1st time. The stock is about 8 winning companies in one. The Ceo Chen is building an empire much the way apple makes things that all go together and relate to each other awesome and smooth. Now for the best part, the stock is under 4 dollars because China is at a 3 year low on the slowdown with a stimulus just days away, oh yeay one more small factor, the richest man in the entire country of China has recently joined the Renn board of directors and said along with Chen they will not rest or be happy till Renn has at least a 100 Billion dollar market cap. This is the next Bidu, after 2 years of manipulation about to blast off like a rocket as the hedge funds have had plenty of time to load up. The rumor is the Billionaire told Chen he would not blast it off with his buddies until Chen is done with his company buyback of shares. This should be completed in Sep sometime because the Oct calls are getting hammered at ask each day no matter what the stock does, up or down. The only other stock I can find that will change as many small retail longs lives as RENN is DANG which acts bonkers everytime Amazon spikes or has news because DANG IS A LEADING ETAILER IN CHINA! fb COULD POSSIBLY BE CLOSE TO THE END OF ITS GROWTH WHILE RENN IS AT THE BEGINNING!!!</Msg><Username>dramatic_move_up</Username><Timestamp>1347425003108</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 00:43:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347427652886-4</Id><Title>1st series of negative articles about Amazon Kindle and down 60 in a week</Title><Msg>You buy way way up here and will be sorry, short squeezes took us way up here with not many new suckers.

But it's close. Even if you step up and pay the extra $15 to disable Offers on your Kindle Fire HD, you can never and will never shake the feeling that this is less a tablet and more of a tool for shopping -- a Trojan Horse that's let into your home thanks to its low price and then unleashes a legion of must-buy items to completely compromise any walls you've built around your budget. If you can get past that decidedly subsidized feeling, you do have a compelling package in your hands. The HD is fast, has a nice design, a beautiful screen, proper stereo speakers and, of course, oodles and oodles of premium content. For casual users looking for an inexpensive yet powerful tablet, the Kindle Fire HD should absolutely be at the top of your shopping list. But, for those looking to do more, and do more rapidly, the Nexus 7 is still the king of this diminutive hill.</Msg><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1347429641090</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 02:00:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347429868465-7</Id><Topic><Title>Kindle Fire HD7 review from Engadget</Title><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1347429641090</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 02:00:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many negative reviews will be posted for the Kindle Fire.

N7 has longer battery life, GPS, and doesn't slow down after extensive use, possibly due to an overload of store ads. Another problem is the constant bandwidth used by these ads which would decrease the browsing speed and payment to ISP. Try loading the Yahoo webpage with and without Adblock. A huge improvement with Adblock, even if you have a 15M line.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347446820089</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 06:47:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347449802869-10</Id><Topic><Title>Core Competency in Loosing Money</Title><Username>dutchboyinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1347399800798</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 17:43:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you mean "losing", spell check doesn't catch it.

It has failed to recognize the move was inherently defensive to protect against Apple overtaking its core cash generator -- Kindle eBooks. To protect itself, AMZN sunk billions of losses into tablets (which are still getting rated as below the Nexus 7) with the hope of protecting and growing its digital content. Of course, Apple's predictable competitive response to match pricing on iBooks (and Google's soon to be announced on GooglePlay), will limit the adoption/benefit for Amazon. Again, if I were at Apple or Google, I would offer a 10% credit on the first $250 of digital content purchases (while matching Amazon's prices) to migrate more of the ebooks content to their platform. Apple/Google should also streamline the conversion of Kindle Books into iBooks/eBooks native format and "sync" the Kindle purchase history in their respective clouds.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347455686743</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:14:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347455975684-16</Id><Title>Fire HD 7" Performance Results at PCMAG</Title><Msg>We test using a range of benchmarks and apps including AnTuTu, Geekbench, Basemark OS, Browsermark, and others. The Nexus 7 beat the KFHD on all the overall scores and on the most intense graphics tests; the KFHD beat the Nexus on some memory access tests and the Basemark system tests. Burrowing into the Basemark OS and AnTuTu results, it looks like the KFHD is slightly faster per core, but the Nexus 7 has more cores, so performance varies based on how many cores a program puts into action. But one difference jumped out at me: Basemark OS revealed that the KFHD is much slower to launch apps, which creates a very real perception of lag. I ran into too many delays in the KFHD's user interface. Thumbnails on Amazon's video and apps pages take a couple of seconds to load; that's a bug that will be fixed soon, Amazon says. Scrolling around Web pages in the browser shows a white screen that gets filled in by content after a noticeable delay; that's actually a feature to accelerate the browser, Amazon says, although the browser didn't score any better overall on our benchmarks than Chrome on the Nexus 7 did. Heavy multitasking caused some jerkiness in the UI, as did plugging in an HDMI cable. "Amdroid" 4.0 just isn't as smooth in operation as the Nexus 7's Android 4.1. On the Android front we have the faster and more flexible Nexus 7, where you give up half the storage and the HDMI port in exchange for GPS, better games, more apps and faster performance at the same price. It's hard to lose those available gigabytes, but the Nexus 7 is so much smoother and more versatile, I'm willing to make that call. There's also the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0) , which builds in an IR emitter to make it a useful home entertainment remote control. Neither of those tablets have Amazon's wealth of Prime video and books, but they have Kindle and Netflix, Hulu, Crackle, HBO GO and more. I'm going to dismiss the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook Tablet , even though it's a very good color ebook reader, because these other choices are better general-purpose tablets. In the end, we still recommend the Kindle Fire HD, but to a more limited group of people than we did for the original Kindle Fire. If you want an easy-to-use media-consumption tablet, especially if you're an Amazon Prime customer, the Kindle Fire HD will keep you quite entertained. And its upcoming FreeTime feature makes it a truly compelling buy for families. But as a small tablet for most consumers, we'll still pick the Nexus 7 for its overall speed and flexibility. The Scamazon Fire HD costs $15 more because the Nexus 7 does not come with ads! The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 comes with a microSD slot to expand storage up to 32GB.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347455975684</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:19:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347457117973-17</Id><Topic><Title>NTWK $5.3 UP 33c....BREAKING OUT!!

"I am fully confident in our highly capable team, reinforced by our talented group of IT professionals, to scale the business quickly and capture a portion of this burgeoning industry, creating an additional revenue driver and further diversifying our revenue mix by geography." "What we are offering, in essence, is private cloud performance at an elastic cloud price -- giving potential customers in our target market segment the performance, flexibility, reliability, and a no-nonsense fixed pricing model that they have long desired," added Imran Haider, COO of NetSol North America and head of NetSolCloudVM.

NTWK created a new division, NetSolCloudVM, that will offer infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), initially targeting the North American market. Set to launch in Septem division of NetSol North America, NetSolCloudVM will provide clients with IT infrastructure on a monthly tiered subscription basis In its updated public cloud forecast in June, Gartner estimated that IaaS was the fastest growing cloud segment with a projected GAGR of 41.7%, and exceeding a $20 billion global market by 2016. "We made a calculated decision to enter this growing market given our years of experience as a software developer, the minimal investment required, and the revenue potential given just the breadth of our current relationships," said Najeeb Ghauri, chairman and CEO of NetSol. "I am fully confident in our highly capable team, reinforced by our talented group of IT professionals, to scale the business quickly and capture a portion of this burgeoning industry, creating an additional revenue driver and further diversifying our revenue mix by geography." "What we are offering, in essence, is private cloud performance at an elastic cloud price -- giving potential customers in our target market segment the performance, flexibility, reliability, and a no-nonsense fixed pricing model that they have long desired," added Imran Haider, COO of NetSol North America and head of NetSolCloudVM. "As a growing software company ourselves, we have critical insights into the efficiency and productivity needs of NetSolCloudVM's target customer base and look forward to unveiling our new services in the coming months."</Msg><Username>s.k_tammy</Username><Timestamp>1347461257185</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:47:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347461468341-37</Id><Title>258 an hour ago, no REASON for the selling</Title><Msg>............</Msg><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1347461468341</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:51:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347462093176-38</Id><Topic><Title>258 an hour ago, no REASON for the selling</Title><Username>chairman_westgate</Username><Timestamp>1347461468341</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:51:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how about the stock is up large just in the last 3 weeks?.......pullbacks happen..</Msg><Username>backdooreddy1</Username><Timestamp>1347462093176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 11:01:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347462582387-39</Id><Topic><Title>I bought 50,000 AMZN shares on sale 3 days ago..</Title><Username>lekinsh01</Username><Timestamp>1347075153894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 23:32:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>where? if you buy 255 calls they will be worth $5.00 in coming days</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1347462582387</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 11:09:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347462861591-40</Id><Topic><Title>253.75 somewhat critical.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1347378766404</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:52:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boring.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1347462861591</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 11:14:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347462887289-41</Id><Title>You should sell your 50,000 shares before its to late.

They have over 200 million actual loyal users which grow everyday but more importantly they have the 11-29 year old age group completely locked up with over 5 Billion in that specific age group to get online in China over the next 5 years for the 1st time. The stock is about 8 winning companies in one. The Ceo Chen is building an empire much the way apple makes things that all go together and relate to each other awesome and smooth. Now for the best part, the stock is under 4 dollars because China is at a 3 year low on the slowdown with a stimulus just days away, oh yeay one more small factor, the richest man in the entire country of China has recently joined the Renn board of directors and said along with Chen they will not rest or be happy till Renn has at least a 100 Billion dollar market cap. This is the next Bidu, after 2 years of manipulation about to blast off like a rocket as the hedge funds have had plenty of time to load up. The rumor is the Billionaire told Chen he would not blast it off with his buddies until Chen is done with his company buyback of shares. This should be completed in Sep sometime because the Oct calls are getting hammered at ask each day no matter what the stock does, up or down. The only other stock I can find that will change as many small retail longs lives as RENN is DANG which acts bonkers everytime Amazon spikes or has news because DANG IS A LEADING ETAILER IN CHINA! fb COULD POSSIBLY BE CLOSE TO THE END OF ITS GROWTH WHILE RENN IS AT THE BEGINNING!!!

You re confusing us with longs who have eternal hope in stocks. Shorts buy and sell more frequently then longs and the professional shorts do very well. As for the long faithful-there is a small percentage of shorts in this as of last week. sorry to throw water on your party but the best short sellers have taken their position and when I get the figures for this week I bet a ton more of the best did the same. If you want to bet with the longs be my guest. If you want to bet with the best short sellers in the business best go short. Some one will win at this level and I place my bets with the shorts.</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1347491370255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 19:09:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347491388743-97</Id><Title>ready to collapse</Title><Msg>The unfair advantages that AMZN has enjoyed is over, With massive nationwide expansion, and tax, AMZN will collapse as long as it starts</Msg><Username>maosteve95</Username><Timestamp>1347491388743</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 19:09:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347491661596-98</Id><Topic><Title>purpose in life</Title><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1347491370255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 19:09:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Short interest has been rising steadily the past few weeks, but it is a few million shares below the levels we saw last year.

Then the girls get wild and a few of the top TRIAD members stopped by. They will dump SINA before they run RENN up or at least take half out. The richest man in China that just recently joined the RENN board of directors will help as well as his billionaire friends and several hedge funds that have working relationships with the TRIAD, word is in China or anywhere in the world, you get in the TRIAD way and they let you know you got in the way and if you are still in the way, you had better get out of the way. It is as simple as CHEN, the Mega Billionaire, the Triad all knowing this is an undervalued 50 dollar stock worth 5 times as much as SINA, but they spot the manipulation and are about to force the naive specialists hand that just takes orders as Goldmans Bich. NYSE placed a former Goldman Bich in the CEO spot, that is not going to well, they are making many enemies on Wall Street. Keep your eye on DANG also though on the whistleblower and anonymous rumor boards Dang has been brought up 2 or 3 times while RENN is on the board daily with comments and people who argue how to prove they are legit without giving up their identity. You see once the buyback is done in a week or so RENN flies north regardless, a chinese stimulus would just be a bonus for renn and dang however it would be essential for Sina to stay at its current level or rise more. Pull up a 2 year on RENN and DANG, if you have the guts to go long or short AMZN you better grab on to some more and load in RENN before the run starts anyday, could be friday, could be next week, All of Oct will be straight up, look at all the calls outstanding and they sell a ton more Oct calls daily? WHY? I see Amzn going back to 189-195 range</Msg><Username>classactionlawsuitsonnakedshrts</Username><Timestamp>1347498804998</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 21:13:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347501996827-102</Id><Title>Apple PE:15.

There are over 200 new features, some significant. Apple is also dropping the price of the iPhone 4s to $99, and the iPhone 4 for Free. Free iOS 6 upgrades (software) available Sept 19 for many Apple products. Makes owning an Android device look expensive. Now we know why Amazon was in a hurry to announce their new tablets.
