I distinctly remember analysts pummeling Google for lack of transparency about mobile versus search versus YouTube earnings... Amazon makes Google look like an open book... The only difference being Google was generating tons of cash and profitability was certain whereas Amazon is barely cash flow positive and trying to obfuscate the real economics because they don't match the economic story that the Street has constructed... Are the analysts actually going to start asking the hard questions? When they were pummeling Larry Page, Google's enterprise value was less than Amazon's today (because of about $50B in cash) and it was generating almost $15B a year in cash. And, it was growing revenues at over 25% a year (not too far off what Amazon is...) and earnings faster than that. The inconsistency in rigor as it relates to Amazon is awful difficult to understand.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1357366569573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 01:16:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357367088508-2</Id><Title>Volume is declining</Title><Msg>Volume is declining and the vix are getting really low few more cents today would of been a 52 week low.

GS has a price target for a market cap that would exceed Google's when Google was holding $50B in cash and generating $15B in cash per year? Call me crazy, but I strongly doubt GS would be quite so cavalier... I'd love to see the analyst report because the flaws with any model arriving at such a price target would be so many that it would almost require willful omission of material risks and known competitive developments. I, for one, do not think GS really does intentionally try to screw people, so I am doubtful of such a cavalier price target. But, please do provide a link... By the way, simple napkin math can bound the content value... Look at average AAPL iTunes/Apps revenue/profit per device. Divide by the number of devices and then multiply by Amazon's installed base. Then, cut it by 50%... Why, you ask? It is called a selection bias. Apple attracts a wealthier and less price sensitive demographic than Amazon. Further, Amazon has already bundled much content into its Prime offering, limiting the need for many to pay for incremental content (why not use the lending library to read what you haven't already and wait for newer titles to appear in the library... Why buy any videos? Why buy any music from Amazon when almost all music libraries are in iTunes and iCloud at this point and the installed base of AAPL devices dwarfs Amazon?)</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1357400695480</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 10:44:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357401015157-9</Id><Topic><Title>Goldman sachs has AMZN Target for $350 this year</Title><Username>cityautomaker</Username><Timestamp>1357393499777</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 08:44:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And, for the record, when Google's price was 473, its enterprise value was below that of Amazon today, despite generating $15B in cash flow with massive margins and huge growth opportunities in mobile...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1357401015157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 10:50:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357403988494-10</Id><Topic><Title>let's see if next week we get a huge breakout above 264.11 and putting to validity to what I pointed out: a giant inverse H&amp;S</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1357348327453</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 20:12:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>more dellusion: Yahoo doesn't allow web addresses be posted where i cam show someone else who sees the massive consolidated inverse H&amp;S, where the breakout is imminenet: Hey good news for you, as if it happens, the pattern target $300, giving you more opportunity to add to your short position. anybody with a blind eye can see it.
