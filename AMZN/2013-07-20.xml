Of course he's going to sell his stock, why does he need 24 billion worth of Amazon stock? You sound like you think Amazon is evil for not volunteering to pay taxes it doesn't owe. Amazon owes it to the stockholders to not waste money. Time moves forward, and things change. Ebooks are the future, and publishers are no longer needed. Amazon offers authors more royalties, and customers lower prices. Apple illegally conspired to fix prices, to the determent of authors and consumers. Tech, it's really easy to make money with AMZN, just buy the dips and sell the rips. I sold at 308.50, because I'm pretty sure it will go back to 280, but if it doesn't I didn't lose any money.

We have peers missing earnings like MSFT, GOOG, and EBAY. Retail is down and increasing oil prices may increase Amazon's cost of shipping as a percentage of revenue (as FedEx warned). The upside risk seems low for the short term at least. Plus, most analysts are bullish and have been. But I have no illusions about a stock in an uptrend like that though. If it doesn't go my way in the next week, I'll either take profits or let my stop get hit at 306. Amazon is a great company for customers, but not so much for stock holders. A revenue miss could send this stock tumbling down significantly 5-10%, which is what I'm shooting for. Additional downside is less certain. I'm not going to sit on this thing stubbornly as it rockets higher and higher. But don't be surprised if we see 275 soon. Long term this channel will be broken one way or another, and the last time it broke a channel like this it was to the downside to correct.</Msg><Username>vornash</Username><Timestamp>1374338433393</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 12:40:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374338517729-34</Id><Topic><Title>Fundatmentals</Title><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1374326813032</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 09:26:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only thing that's keeping Scamazon at this level is the $85B monthly cash infusion from the FED.

Back then, Scamazon had little competitors. Fast forward to 2013. Scamazon's competitors include Samsung, APPL, IBM, MSFT, WMT, BBY, TGT, EBAY, NFLX, and other big guns. Most of these guys make enough money to pay a dividend. Scamazon is still barely profitable after 16 years of operation. CEO's only claim to fame is the promise of massive EPS somewhere down the road. Once the mania is over, Scamazon's stock price will be cut by 90%, again. It will never be "different this time". Even after a 90% hair cut, $30 is still to expensive for a retailer with no dividend and 1% profit margin. I doubt that Scamazon will be able to squeeze out more than 80 cents earning for 2013. Don't mistake a bubble stock for a great investment.

The market maker will get the stops close to market price as they have a computer program that figures out if they will make a profit by tripping the groups of stop orders at various levels. Once a stop is triggered it, becomes a market order that is subject to the honesty of the market maker. I once had a stop filled slightly but obviously off of the market price, which was only somewhat annoying to me, but if they do that regularly they make serious money, so after that I try to never use a market or stop order on nasdaq.
