In a tough spot, Goldman obtained extraordinary permission to make an overnight metamorphosis from investment bank to traditional bank holding company. “Can I prove this was a wired deal?

In a tough spot, Goldman obtained extraordinary permission to make an overnight metamorphosis from investment bank to traditional bank holding company. “Can I prove this was a wired deal? Absolutely not,” Mr. Lewis said. “Am I certain of it? Only 100 percent.” As for the whirling, three-million-shares-per-second casino of Wall Street? He sees it as rigged. “I would not risk stocks under any circumstances,” he said, “because we don’t know when this thing is going to blow.” Nothing about Mr. Lewis is easy.

I heard it was because they didn't want to enable a competitor. That can only mean that the ads shorts told me no one wanted to read must have been a huge driver of many more additional sales for Amazon. After all, previously Walmart had no qualms about selling Kindles. And they're not discontinuing the sale of PCs at Walmart which also enable Amazon shoppers, so it must be specific to Kindle. The strategy of driving more sales through tablets must have been a whopping success for Walmart to have taken such a sudden and wide scale reversal on selling Kindles.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348890856092</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:54:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
