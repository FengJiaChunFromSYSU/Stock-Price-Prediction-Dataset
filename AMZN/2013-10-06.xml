Op cash flows is artificially increased because of this. As far as lab 126 goes, I am not impressed. Didn't they design the kindle? Which has been a miserable failure?

Pretty bubbly... I'll give you a little credit. You encouraged AMZN to look into its growing fulfilmment expense. I encourage the analysts to do the game. Little thought experiment, assume you have 1 location from which you fulfill all orders and then expand to say 50. For the same quantity and value of goods demanded, is the required inventory AND labor higher or lower with 1 or 50 centers? Look at the trends over time and you'll see the answer that no pumper or scamalyst wants to acknowledge. Now, the self reinforcing scamalysts like to look at NET shipping as a % of gross sales (which is manipulated through Prime related internal revenue transfers IMHO), yet even they have stabilized and are no longer dropping. But, in order to truly offset the economic penalty above, gross shipping cost as a % of net sales would have to be dropping, yet they have risen over time. There are several drivers/causes, but the truth is that AMZN itself could not withstand AMZN's predatory behavior within its own cash flow from operations. Net working capital is down to just over $1.5B (the difference between Q4 2012 raise and the HQ purchase) with $3B LT debt (outside of all the financial engineering of leases). Its proprietary PHYSICAL products (Kindles, etc) do not afford it the same negative cash conversion cycle advantage as others. Without another injection, the ponzi will fall apart. The question is which WS firms are going to get tainted with this one... Going to be harder to go back to the market after having blown through $3B in the past year with negative earnings and declining TRUE FCF.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1381072887535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 11:21:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381073176745-18</Id><Topic><Title>It's funny to see shorts in numbers tried to #$%$ Amazon</Title><Username>investor95000</Username><Timestamp>1381063444473</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 08:44:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The majority of the op cash flow you reference is due to increasing accounts payable. 2012 op cash = 4.1... 3.4 is due to increasing payables 2011 op cash = 3.9... 4.1 is due to delaying payable.

You are wrong. You can artificially increase or decrease numbers in P&amp;L, because it is on accrual basis. Statement of cash flows is on cash basis and is tied to cash balance or bank statements--you can't artificially do anything to cash balance. As for Lab126 and it coming products, time will tell how it fare out. Amazon will have multitude of devices via Lab126 and are aiming at other market shares. The company is spending a lot on CapEx to expand their business for future growth. These kind of actions are recipe for success. Statement of cash flows show cash inflows of $3.3B to $4.2B per year from operating activities. They don't need external financing for operations. Heck, they don't have to get external financing for all those CapEx to expand their business. If that is the case, their business will be saturated and there will be no growth. Too bad for shorts, that is not the case.

Pretty bubbly..." So, you are comparing Amazon market capital with 1 quarter of cash flows from ops (specifically Q2-13), to show it "pretty bubbly". Wow! Cash flow from ops for Q2-13 was $0.9B, YTD Q2-13 was negative $1.5B. If I leave it at that, you will come back with post "hah! in your face investor 95000..." You need to keep in mind that every Q4, payable was high do to seasonal spending, and Q1 (next quarter), payable was paid off. That why, if you look at past years, you see hugh cash outflows from operating activities for Q1-13, Q1-12, Q1-11, etc. Back to one of my points. Cash flows (or I should say INFLOWS!) from operating activities for 2009 through 2012 were $3.3B, $3.5B, $3.9B and $4.2B, respectively with CAGR of 8%. Cash left over from cash revenue less cash expenses. P&amp;L did not reflect that because on many non-cash items. I do agree that there are concerns about P&amp;L showed declining net income for past 2 years and a net lost of $39M for 2012. Again, P&amp;L does not paint all of the picture--you have to look at other financial statements and aspects of it to get a better understanding of the big picture. Back to another of my points. Amazon doesn't need funding for its operating activities (because of the reason above). They got external financing for investing (refer to investing activities under statement of cash flows). Those funds are for CapEx to expand their business for future growth. Without these kind of activities, business will be saturated and growth will be stifled. Expansion of warehouses. Expansion of Lab126 for potential new products...set-top box? android console? smartphone? 3D smartphone? Kindle smartphone? All I see is, Amazon is positioning itself to take the company to the next level. Cha-Ching by then.

The point you are making is simply that the majority of growth in operating cash flow has come from applying a negative cash conversion cycle (getting paid before paying suppliers) to a greater sales volume. But, that is NOT the only driver as you point out. Days payable increased about 10%, which contributed another $700-900MM to bank cash balance. Those increases are truly short term and are indicative of more stress in the system. Net working capital is at multi year lows heading into Q4, despite the incremental $1.5B in cash from last year's financing. Of the 4.5B in cash flow from operations in the 12 months ending in June, $1.96 from changes in AP (as above, partly from increasing sales and partly from ~10% increase in days payable), $728MM from changes in accrued expenses and $2.2B from growth in UNEARNED revenue... better keep growing that ponzi...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1381085649053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 14:54:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381085890138-36</Id><Title>If anything, Barrons article was even more bearish on Netflix</Title><Msg>Netflix was mentioned negatively, saying Amazon could basically put it out of business with low profit model.</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1381085890138</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 14:58:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381086459209-37</Id><Topic><Title>It's funny to see shorts in numbers tried to #$%$ Amazon</Title><Username>investor95000</Username><Timestamp>1381063444473</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 08:44:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No you moron.

Again, it is total nonsense to say Amazon is a bubble about to burst. Also, I am not saying Amazon is a top pick or advising anybody anything. In fact, I don't own any Amazon shares yet. What is interesting about Amazon is that they are expanding their business, especially Lab126. They are aiming to provide variety of devices and aiming at other market shares. The company is already evolving beyond the e-commerce. Management is positioning the company to take it to the next level. How it fare out is another question. We have to wait a year or so to find out. If it is a bust, there will be a market correction in PPS. I doubt it will go back to $100 PPS as someone suggested in earlier post, unless internal financing can no longer or barely support operating activities. On the hands, if it turned out to be a great success, PPS will go up even higher than today. Market capital will be multiple of today market capital. There are plenty of room for improvement.

Most of the Lab 126 Intros have lost money but , because WS can pump the sales gains still, it's worked for goosing the stock higher. It' is a type of ponzi platform of hype. And so is the stock market,especially in the high beta stuff again, it's the second biggest bubble ever to year 2000. There's about a Trillion dollar worth of market cap stocks out there right now with almost no earnings. Heck, the Russell 2000 alone trades at almost 100 mutliple. That's a bubble. You just don't know when it's gonna go BOOOOM!!!!</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1381098451070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 18:27:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381098564293-59</Id><Topic><Title>German workers threatening Christmas strike...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1381095137880</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 17:32:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tech, I also am sorry for any rude comment against you.

Otherwise, we'd have real interest with real market values instead of $17 trillion in debt, $58 billion in total debt, and a Fed balance sheet that is a not a hedge fund, but a leveraged hedge fund.

I did not fully understand what you meant. We know that AMZN is generating cash from operating activities (about $4B a year) based on the statement of cash flows. But the P&amp;L does not reflect that, in fact net income has been declining from peak $1.2B in 2010 down to net loss $39M in 2012. I don't know what the non-cash items were. Again, AMZN get external financing for CapEx for expanding the business, not for operating activities. Amazon can improve the bottom line significantly and Mr. Bezos needs to reevaluate his stand of discounting. 2010, 2011, 2012 Year 86%, 89%, 89% % of cost of sales to net product sales 9.4%, 10.9%, 12.4% % of fulfillment to net product sales 95.7%, 99.7%, 101.3% % of Total COGS to net product sales $3.4B, $6.1B, $9.4B Net service revenue To me fulfillment is part of COGS, from above table, Amazon is not making money at all from product sales for 2011 and 2012, even worse, losing money in 2012 (cost was 101.3%). Amazon is practically giving everything away for free, except for services. That is why net income dropped from 2010 to 2012. From P&amp;L perspective, service revenue alone is barely enough to cover operations, MG&amp;A and other expenses. For 2012, 10% margin on product sales would add $5.2B to bottom line, (20% margin, $10.3B to bottom line), (30% margin, $15.5B to bottom line). For Amazon, free or hugh discount is not acceptable. Whatever benefit that service revenue got from that policy was not good enough, not even adequate.

The unearned revenue / working capital play is approaching ponzi in the true sense. And, if our new board long would look at his own time series of fulfillment as a % of net sales + GROSS shipping cost as a % of net sales together, he'd realize the actual results betray the "story" being told about the buildout. The question is who is going to tarnish their rep underwriting the fast approaching offering (cause it is coming). The other question being whether the many other large clients whose businesses are harmed by the scam do the right thing and migrate business away from those that do the offering.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1381105466044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 20:24:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381107121558-73</Id><Title>Nasdaq_6000 iz shouting in ALL CAPS</Title><Msg>He didnt take hiz medz this weekend.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1381107121558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 20:52:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381110060295-74</Id><Title>Bezos</Title><Msg>Have said this so many times.
