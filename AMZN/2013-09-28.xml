When supply goes down az demand risez pricez go UP (ref. ecomomics 101) What iz making supply go down? 1. Supply: Controlled Float limits - 'banks' bought up the bulk of annointed low share count stox at or near the bottom of late '08-early '10 on implicit and explicit garuanteez from the fed that they will be capitalized (ie bailed out) in order to be able to buy, hold and add 'for an extended period of time'. no one benefiting from the scam darez split a bitcoin stok to make more bitcoin, because even though demand iz low (ie low volumez - the name of the game iz to keep supply lower in certain annointed stocks) 2. Demand : demand on 'autopilot'. While demand amongst mainstreet iz low, demand on wall street remainz on autopilot by way of auto purchasez through fundz held in 401k'z, etfs, and pension fundz. Supply haz and will continue to be restricted below demand az long az no forced selling lasts by way of end qe and event that causez forced selling due to general panick by sheeple In these 'auto demand' fundz. And sybs favorite railing on what keeps Demand above supply: short covering action of shorts shooting each other az they fight to see who can unwillingly cover at the highest price. And a kicker for the banks troublez of buying holding and adding bitcoin stox using opms: crack head optionz buyerz which pay a nice kicker to the 'banks' in the form of weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly optionz premiumz... Its really a basic yet dirty game, but it aint gonna change before q1 2014 at the earliest, and it pricez will continue to rise exponentially az long az shorts keep piling in while sheeple become even more complacent and feel the need to 'get in' which alwayz happenz at the top of a major mkt shift.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1380370289763</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 08:11:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380372729071-7</Id><Title>Pay attn ex....
