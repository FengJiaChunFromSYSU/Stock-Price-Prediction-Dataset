Youre not the 1st to profess sybs tradez az 'fake' - thats OK because tradez that sybs posts az a matter of course AND the phat coin piling into sybs Master Margin Power Trade Acct tellz of a much different story, dummy.... Bottom line skiidady iz that you are a sorry pumper at the tops of absolute pig stox. If you actually traded your posts then you'd be broke dating back to nflx 2011 where sybs scored HUGE on the first of many scamz to explode (joy of joyz sybs back short pig flix at 172 after finishing up covering 240-303 shorts at 120 in 2011). You are truelly a d'ckless clown without money or any street cred., and for that reason you lash out against otherz in anger and frustration, wishing and imagining demise on them. You are a very sorry individual and you should seek psychiatric help before you harm yourself or otherz.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1366478626129</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 13:23:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366481868089-6</Id><Title>Can anyone make a case for Amazon trading above $150, or even $100?</Title><Msg>Even if we assume 10%+ earnings growth?

They decide what happens to stocks, not us. Go with the flow and watch the tone of headlines - they will be your cue. Look at GE and HON price action: both beat and both warned about Europe. Actually GE beat EPS and Rev but HON missed Rev. Look at Pepsi: missed on Rev and even EPS outloo is lower than estimates by 5% - well you know where the stock is headed! Just watch similar companies and read the articles carefully - you will notice which is being supported and which one is being bashed.
