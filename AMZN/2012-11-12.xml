How did the Amercan economy prosper with a 90% top tax rate. Genius if you were ever in business you should know that NO decision is made on what kind of taxes an investor or a corporation may make. I want to pay 1 million in taxes cause if I do it, means I must have made at least 3 million. and secondly because I love this country. Corporations are FLUSH with cash what is lacking is their LOVE of their country! The country that allows them to own 7-8 homes when many people are homeless It allows them to make on average 475 times the lowest paid. Look it up Mexico is next with only 50X the lowest paid! Go fight for a woman to be forced to give birth to a baby conceived in rape. Buddy one more thing CONTRACEPTION prevent s abortions! But for the right wing nuts that isn't enough they want it declared that pregnancy begins with an erection! Go back to 1955 you must love it there but hey wait wasn't that a period when we had a top rate of 90% and a Republican president hero who decided to make America strong we need a National Highway system and after the Rockefeller's, The DuPont's said no go from the private sector the Government stepped in and built it for all Americans Rich poor liberal and conservatives! That's when we had PATRIOTS who loved America! Not some one like you who want's to control another by calling their right to privacy and their decision on whether to give birth or not MURDER because of your warped mindset. You are a dying breed, get used to it Goodbye!</Msg><Username>michaelmars128</Username><Timestamp>1352722628088</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 07:17:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352722867932-5</Id><Topic><Title>2 big reasons AMZN will fall to 175 very soon</Title><Username>prospec5</Username><Timestamp>1352597597067</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 20:33:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>prospec5; your existance and input is irrelevant to economic matters. For one thing corporations have been getting a break for the last 20 years, and it hasn't solved #$%$ and has made our countires position worse if anything. Higher taxes affect them in the short term because they panic but then their operations stabalize and they adjust and begin to carry on business as usual. These are the guys who at the first sign of panic fire dozens of people and then go to the government and ask for more money. It doesn't matter what their tax rate it they need to tighten up operations which is what a higher tax rate forces them to do. I recommend you to look back at history and see how much better the economy has done under Democratic presidents in every aspect of growth than Republican counterparts. The kicker is the rich know they should pay higher taxes but many have fallen to the corruption of greed. They are no better than welfare recipients because they themselves are constantly screaming more, more, more! And they want that more to come out of the governments pocket!!! Look at the election results and you will see that 8 out of the top 10 richest counties in the nation voted for OBAMA! These results weren't even close in these counties, and the only 2 counties that didn't vote for him were in New Jersey and were the ones most affected by the hurricane. This goes to show you that there is extreme support for Obama and his higher tax plan among the wealthiest. Look at his supporters from Buffet to Jay Z and Beyonce. They all AGREE with him. Lets talk about the "Obama crash" I guess everyone on Wall Street forgot that the stock market reached record levels during his presidency. But everyone looks at the debt he amassed which was the result of him keeping us out of, potentially the greatest depression we have ever seen. So shut up and quit being bitter that your GOP had a terrible bullpin when it came to candidates and they picked some shape shifting snake as their nomineee. The only reason he was chosen is because they thought he could take Michigan, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire which he took none of them. His own people didn't even support him because he had no merit to run on. Massachusetts economic progress was terrible when he was governor and he accumulated a heaping pile of debt while he was in there. Second, the only reason he picked Paul Ryan as his running mate was because he thought he would take Wisconsin which he failed to do. The republican party is blind and ignorant when it comes to the economy and politics so shut up you football humping monkey.</Msg><Username>chipmantony</Username><Timestamp>1352722867932</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 07:21:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352723359145-6</Id><Topic><Title>Went to the ATT store yesterday most people were buying Galaxy S III and the new note II then Nokia 920 , IPHONE 5 not selling like it should I think AAPL is going to be in BIG BIG trouble</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1352691281658</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 22:34:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most people are preordering both phones, so you really can't tell by visiting a store.</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1352723359145</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 07:29:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352727303051-7</Id><Topic><Title>2 big reasons AMZN will fall to 175 very soon</Title><Username>prospec5</Username><Timestamp>1352597597067</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 20:33:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You socialists, libs and baby killers can move to a country that has done those things so succesfully for decades and is not paying for it now.

On the subject of "Libya" (yes it is spelled with a "y") we could have sent in 50 troops and jeopardized their lives or we could have spent 100 million bucks deploying our troops into Libya as an attempt to squash the riot. Either way the country's hatred for the U.S would have multiplied and we would have endangered more lives. Then your precious Fox news would have been criticizing him for entering a conflict that didn't involve us and ask why we are still wasting millions of dollars in other countries. Chris Stevens knew the risks there more than any of us and we will never know what his thoughts were. He is a brave fallen hero and how about you respect him and quit ferociously blaming anyone for his death. The middle east isn't pretty and there is just as much conflict if not more than there ever has been in the last decade so we can't possibly act on every hunch or threat we stumble upon.</Msg><Username>chiperoni88</Username><Timestamp>1352740890289</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 12:21:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352741750927-59</Id><Topic><Title>French Tax Authority (FTA) assessment</Title><Username>philtmcnasty8</Username><Timestamp>1351694568003</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 10:42:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see Reuters picked up the FTA assessment this morning.

I think we really do agree on another thing: Life is precious. Another thing: There is corruption in this world. The main differences are how to direct the solutions. Many people are wanting to adopt new born babies. Those who have been adopted instead of aborted thank their adoptive parents every day. If you agree with that statement, we have a major breakthrough in this discussion.

Congrats on your performance. I like it when people stay true to their strategy and execute with discipline. There are multiple pathways to make money, even if everyone seems to have adopted the beta chase momo approach. The market is a healthier place when a wider variety of strategies are actually employed. GRPN will start moving up soon enough and will break many overconfident shorts who do not realize it is better positioned than this POS for the future (despite having a market cap that is 1.75% the size)... I am buying for the future.

If you weren't going to offer a resolution I was about to lol. BTW I am one of the supporters of no raises for the military for the next 3 years and I believe it is necessary to scale back our numbers in certain career fields because I have seen first hand the daily operations. So you could say that my paycheck doesn't have anything to do with anything. The fact that you commented on my intelligence after you realized I was in the military was humerous but also offensive. That would be like me figuring out someone was from the south and saying you are just a dumb redneck that doesn't know anything beyond how to dry tobacco leaves and how to drill for oil. This stock is way overvalued and I also agree with you on BP which I also hold shares in, so we have now found some common ground. God bless and take care!

If INTC wanted to, it could certainly dedicate some of its 14nm trigate capacity which will be online in 2014 when the Samsung contract with Apple expires to manufacturing an ARM/RISC architecture with the requirement that Apple stay x86 for the MacBook line... Anyone with common sense should realize that Apple would be nothing short of stupid and negligent for AAPL to dump INTC from the MacBook line right now. It NEEDS INTC for strategic leverage with suppliers. What's more, INTC will probably be willing to dedicate some fraction of capacity and ramp production first for AAPL given the right strategic deal, which would afford AAPL unique/differentiated performance given that no one else will be at the 14nm FINFET (tri-gate) process technology node. And a nice implication for our friends at AMZN. If folks are doing this to Apple, it will be fun to see what they do to Amazon. Consumers don't like seeing increased prices and Amazon has little room for component price increases given that it is already selling at cost and generating no aggregate cash flow.
