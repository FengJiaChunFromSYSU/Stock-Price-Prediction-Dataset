Do you not think the Hedge Funds want to build serious positions in these Chinese stocks after China is going to come off a 3 year low for the economy! 5 billion users age 9-29 will come online and go right to RENN to talk to their friends. This is October finally and will be explosion month for RENN, Citi knows they have to cover and that their target price was a stalling technique. Chen we know you tell your friends they can buy this week, Is the Billionaire China man buying this week or next? Triads this week or next? The reason RENN is at 4 and not 40 is because they have manipulated this down to get everyone out they can and grab their shares, they have every intention of making this have the next BIDU market cap, same underwriters, players behind the scenes of the Bidu explosion and even the same MM's leading and running the show on level 2. If you can't see how obvious they have been setting this up for the BIDU run, you deserve to miss it. Also my AG EDWARDS and Raymond James broker in Sarasota, Florida said that the NYSE is losing new China prospects and clients, much less meetings with China companies then 2 years ago, the NYSE needs to run RENN skyhigh as well as a couple more otherwise all future China companies will list on Nasdaq, do you blame them? Nasdaq stocks go where the computers want them to. NYSE stocks go where one greedy rich #$%$ hole wants it to go by saying 5 million at 5 and the specialist winks at him and starts to move it their. But the specialist as big a #$%$ as he is, has been smart enough to load every opportunity he has had for 2 years and he is ready to run this hard, and when it starts, he will not look back or hold up for anyone!

In a tough spot, Goldman obtained extraordinary permission to make an overnight metamorphosis from investment bank to traditional bank holding company. “Can I prove this was a wired deal? Absolutely not,” Mr. Lewis said. “Am I certain of it? Only 100 percent.” As for the whirling, three-million-shares-per-second casino of Wall Street? He sees it as rigged. “I would not risk stocks under any circumstances,” he said, “because we don’t know when this thing is going to blow.” Nothing about Mr. Lewis is easy.

Pass performance is really the only thing we have to go by. I haven't crunched numbers and decided AMZN was the best opportunity for me, I'm an Amazon customer, and I studied Jeff Bezos. If JB were to get out of Amazon and start a new company, I'd look into investing in it and selling my AMZN. The thing about number crunching is the numbers can be lies, or crunchers can be misinterpreting them. I'm "short" AMZN at $260, by which I mean I sold some at $260, and I'll buy it back cheaper. I'm looking for a 20% move, 20% up ($300) I'll sell some more, 20% down ($200) I'll buy back.

That means no bad news will be coming out of China until the 6th, at the earliest. Major hedge funds will this opportunity (lack of bad news) to dump their shares. Of course, they will pump everything they've got into the markets all over the world before dumping. So it's a buy now. Next Monday's afternoon to Wednesday may be a good time to short.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1349147180719</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 23:06:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349147300480-149</Id><Topic><Title>Global markets will be strong for the next 4 days.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1349140326583</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 21:12:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Somethin to back up the words.</Msg><Username>ershon911</Username><Timestamp>1349147300480</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 23:08:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349147662117-150</Id><Topic><Title>What?

Right now the bias is up I believe (changes day-to-day).</Msg><Username>ershon911</Username><Timestamp>1349148428431</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 23:27:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349148678417-152</Id><Topic><Title>Key Technical Levels</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1349120155395</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:35:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Could you imagine the what would happen if the S&amp;P500 suddenly had a PE of 300+?" But it took 15 years for AMZN to reach this stage. Didn't happen "suddenly"? The biggest problem with shorts here is that they expect something "dramatic" always. If they observe the market and AMZN more objectively, they should be able to see so many little moves (which are far more predictable than crashes) are happening every day.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1349148678417</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 23:31:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349148690691-153</Id><Title>Speaking of CMG...(somebody mentioned it)...</Title><Msg>Wow!
