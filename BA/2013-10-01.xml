As we highlighted yesterday, the shut down will only affect the tiny amount of services government provides that Americans actually like. Rest assured, TSA grope downs, VIPR checkpoints, drone attacks, SWAT team raids, tax collection, torturing terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, arming jihadists in Syria and running guns to Mexican drug dealers will all continue unimpeded – as will NSA domestic spying. Although the NSA itself refuses to confirm it, to all intents and purposes the agency’s mammoth new spy center in Bluffdale, Utah “may be open already,” according to the Denver Post. “The facility is expected this fall to quietly begin sucking in massive amounts of information for the intelligence community and storing it in the cavernous buildings in Bluffdale, Utah, according to NSA officials — and it could be open now even as the agency faces scrutiny over efforts to collect data on Americans domestically,” writes Thomas Burr. An NSA spokesperson said back in July that the center would be open by the “end of the fiscal year,” i.e., the end of September. The fact that lawmakers have failed to agree on legislation that will fund the government from today onwards isn’t an issue for the agency. NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines also recently acknowledged that the center, which covers 1 million square feet of space, is ready for each machine to be switched on. The center will hold 1 trillion terabytes of data. To put that in context, all of the books ever written in any language would need just 400 terabytes. The facility is set to collect ”complete contents of private emails, cell phone calls, and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails—parking receipts, travel itineraries,</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380625854708</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 07:10:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380626385394-15</Id><Topic><Title>Obama on Raising the Debt Limit</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1380548470911</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 09:41:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I think he knows full well that's he bankrupting the country"...Correct...if the economy collapses.and it well.....the Elite can act as our saviors and force us to choose full communism as the only choice ...and all the infrastructure is in place to stop anyone who opposes.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380626385394</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 07:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380628693028-16</Id><Title>Young dumb idiots who agreed to pass Obonzocare to find out what was in it are getting shafted</Title><Msg>This article comes from the Guardian one of the most liberal papers in the UK and the paper that nailed Obonzo on the NSA scandal. Search the title 'US employers slashing worker hours to avoid Obamacare insurance mandate' if you want to read the whole article. ---------------------------------------------- Forever 21, the clothing store, told staff last month in a memo leaked to the press that it planned to cut hours and reclassify some full-time workers as part- time. The move, which the company denied had anything to do with President Barack Obama's health reforms, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), will nevertheless help it avoid a mandate under the legislation requiring companies with 50 or more employees to offer those working 30 hours a week or more health insurance. Earlier this month, Seaworld, which operates 11 entertainment parks across the US, capped hours for part time workers at 28, down from 32, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The trend has caused fears among low-paid workers living on the breadline that they will be hit twice – by having their hours and thus earnings cut and by having to pay more for healthcare. Based on what she said is happening in the stores around her, Samuels is concerned she too will have her hours cut and with it her eligibility for company healthcare under the ACA. "It's a really scary situation," said Samuels, who earns $9.25 an hour and is trying to reduce a student loan debt of close to $50,000. She currently receives subsidised healthcare through her university, but it runs out next year, when she had hoped her employer healthcare would kick in. "Technically, I should be eligible," she said. "But at least 20 stores around me have cut hours. I live paycheck to paycheck. I have credit card debts. It's a balancing act. I'm afraid I won't be able to afford healthcare." As one of the nation's lowest-paid workers, with little job security, Samuels is not alone in her fears that she may be worse off when the ACA takes full effect.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380628693028</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 07:58:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380628864573-17</Id><Topic><Title>Young dumb idiots who agreed to pass Obonzocare to find out what was in it are getting shafted</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380628693028</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 07:58:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My healthcare costs are going down.

Somehow, MD management gained the upper hand after the merger and installed the outsource-everything manufacturing system....which is adopted by low budget companies trying to save money while remaining relevant....which is exactly what MD was in the 90's before the merger. So what happened was the market leader merged with the market laggard and then adopted the business practices of the laggard. And , sadly, Boeing ceo mcnerney is the perfect fit for this uninspiring trinket-by-trinket manufacturing method. Well it might work for little red wagons and little #$%$ tricycles, or even a junky little Hyundai, it is not the correct way to build a system that travels at 500 mph at 35000 ft for 10 or more hours, where even the smallest component failure can be catastrophic.

That’s why Boeing is now acknowledging its 787 Dreamliner reliability issues and vowing to make the jets more dependable , reflecting a deviation from the company’s previous actions of staying conspicuously silent about the issues. The previous attempts of Boeing management to hide in plain sight and ignore the 787 reliability disaster has become untenable given all the 787 problems According to Reuters, Randy Tineth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes’s marketing vice president, is now recognizing new concerns. He explained at a press conference in Chile on Monday: “. It’s not as good as we’d like to see it. It’s not as good as our customers would like to see it.” Tineth’s Monday statement in Chile’s capital of Santiago followed what turned out to be a turbulent weekend for Boeing 787 jets. After encountering a excessive share of electric and safety problems, Boeing faced more disgruntled airlines Saturday and Sunday after its planes suffered more issues. According to Reuters, the first reported setback was by budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which was forced to ground a brand new 787 Dreamliner on Saturday after it suffered repeated breakdowns. The carrier demanded that Boeing repair the plane, and the company’s troubles didn’t end there. The problems continued into Sunday, when a different carrier, Poland’s LOT airline, was forced to land unexpectedly in Iceland due to problems with the 787</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380640776295</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 11:19:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380641308847-52</Id><Topic><Title>Even a Fox Guy Can See The Truth</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380639360305</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 10:56:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So now you trust FOX guys?

Through August, Boeing received orders for 786 commercial airplanes compared to 902 received by Airbus. Airbus SAS booked sales valued at more than $15 billion on a single day from Asia, underscoring the region’s role in driving global demand for commercial jets. The deals, once confirmed, will bring Airbus beyond the 1,000 aircraft orders the company has predicted it can garner this year.

Obamacare is more damaging to America “than anything I’ve seen pass in my lifetime," declared Jim DeMint - the guy who resigned from the Senate to run The Heritage Foundation which has put millions of dollars into campaign to distort and destroy public opinion of Obamacare, Now it was the Heritage Foundation that originally came up with the model that is the basis for Obamacare, a model which preserves the private, for-profit insurance companies as a layer of cost and a gatekeeper between you and your doctor, instead of a single-payer system (Medicare for all) that Democrats favored. And of course, Obamacare replicates the Romney plan that has been successful in Massachusetts, insuring 99 percent of the people. So what's the problem? First, that Americans will actually like Obamacare and not want to give it up. Also, that the success of Obamacare will lead people to trust that Government in the right hands, can actually do go (OMG, is renewable energy next? tax reform? public education funding? infrastructure investment????). What is more, Obamacare breaks the dependency of workers on their employer for their health insurance (like serfdom), and their great fear that if they leave their job, they will lose health insurance for their entire family. But if you aren't a prisoner to your employer, you can demand higher wages and better conditions. Or you can go off and start your own business. You won't be so vulnerable to a boss sending a letter around before an election "vote for my candidate [as was done on behalf of Romney 2012] or we will be forced to lay off workers." That also goes for spouses afraid to leave abusive relationships for fear of losing health insurance. What really has Republicans peeved about Obamacare, though, is free contraception for women, which Republicans have equated with the breakdown of family and society. In fact, in the dead of night, House Republicans added last-minute language into the shut down bill that would limit your access to contraception. This so-called "conscience clause" would allow an employer or an insurance company to opt out of preventive care for women, such as birth control. But at its heart, giving a woman control over how many children she has is key to her empowerment, her financial emancipation. And finally, health care - and how it drains resources from a family - is also key to economic and political power. Health care is not just a HUGE profit-making sector for CEOs who pocket a billion dollars (think about how many health procedures have been nixed to pay that), but living without health insurance increases health and financial insecurity. Half of all personal bankruptcies are related to health emergencies; a single medical emergency can wipe out a lifetime of savings and the prospect for college, a home, retirement. You can't be very politically active if you are fighting disease, suffering in pain or misery, or if you are watching the suffering of your child, spouse, or parent. Health care is such a big-out-of-pocket expense, it is a big, big reason why there is such a income gap between the 1% and everyone else. And that income gap is also a power gap. What else do Republicans and the One Percenters fear? They fear that there will be 30 million more people in doctors' offices and they might have to wait for care because we don't produce enough doctors. In fact the ACA - for the first time - also addresses incentives for training of doctors and nurses and opening new clinics - something that is desperately needed anyway. In fact, we already face a crisis of care, with the aging Baby Boomers (there is only one geriatric doctor per 8500 people over 65), we will soon be faced with a crisis regardless.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1380642233009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 11:43:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380642291887-65</Id><Topic><Title>If you go to church you can get an Exemption from Obamacare</Title><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1380591584786</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 21:39:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are these the same christians who hire disabled people to pose as family members so that their group can get to the front of lines at Disneyland?</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1380642291887</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 11:44:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380642822287-66</Id><Topic><Title>If its a outsourced Boeing 787 I am not going -Boeing vows to improve reliability and agree's their plance sucks</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380640776295</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 11:19:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>try to stay on topic father-zosima or did you want to go with your other topics gay men and your best friend Paul Allen and how rich you are ? here you are bragging about your connection from your estate in an apartment overlooking the sailor boys fleet in Everett. father-zosima your new name sounds like a priest name, father do you like hanging out with the boys ? father here you are as the other Boeing lover boy whsteffanms...

They fear that there will be 30 million more people in doctors' offices and they might have to wait for care because we don't produce enough doctors. In fact the ACA - for the first time - also addresses incentives for training of doctors and nurses and opening new clinics - something that is desperately needed anyway. In fact, we already face a crisis of care, with the aging Baby Boomers (there is only one geriatric doctor per 8500 people over 65), we will soon be faced with a crisis regardless. And despite the criticisms to the contrary, ACA also begins to address the obscene cost of health care - mainly by transparency, competition, mechanisms to foster "best practices" and shift payment incentives from more procedures and visits to successful treatment, and a focus on prevention, wellness and early treatment, including more treatment of mental illness. But what they fear most is that Obamacare will lead to single-payer or a public option (how is that bad?). Finally, the anti-Obamacare fanatics have made the claim that Affordable Health Care will somehow hurt the budget deficit. But last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the health care law would add more than $100 billion to the deficit over the next decade, and more than $1 trillion in the following decade. What is disgusting about the campaign against Obamacare is that the only way to combat the arguments for Obamacare are to lie. Some 60% of Americans say they are not aware of Obamacare - an interesting statistic since 54%, supposedly, do not support Obamacare (it turns out that two thirds of the 54% who say they do not favor Obamacare say it did not go far enough and would have preferred the single-payer, Medicare-for-all option; and 60% say they do not want Obamacare repealed or defunded). The lack of understanding of Obamacare is understandable since the media has focused on the tactics and the Congressional jousting (to the death!), while HUNDREDS of millions of dollars have been poured into anti-Obamacare campaigns. Right now, you have the Koch Brothers funding one of their shady groups with the patriotic name, Generation Opportunity, spending $750,000 to convince young people to opt out" of Obamacare and pay a fine rather than actually purchase health care (because they are invincible, after all) - using an image of a creepy Uncle Sam doing a vaginal probe of a pretty young blond woman. You might have thought it was an ad against the Republican Governors who have actually signed legislation that puts Government inside women's vaginas when they seek reproductive health care. But nooooo, this is intended to scare young people with the message 'Opt Out of Obamacare," so they don't sign on to health insurance. Is it that young people will never get sick, never have babies, never get hit by a car or crash their mountain bike, and never get bankrupted when the medical bills come? Of course not. Their aim is to reduce the size of the pool, particularly of young, presumably healthy people, to put a monkey-wrench into the cost savings that Obamacare is based on: the wide pool lowers the cost for everyone. Then Conservatives will be able to say "I told you so. Obamacare is not bringing down insurance premiums for everyone." Meanwhile Republican governors like Rick Scott of Florida are putting barricades in the way of "navigators" who want to help people enroll. Remember how upset Republicans were about IRS officials doing their job in seeing if political organizations qualified for SEC. 4 exemption? Now Darryl Issa's Government Oversight committee is demanding 1000 pages of paperwork from these organizations given federal grants to be navigators. And they lie. Remember death panels? Now Congressman Michelle Bachmann is saying that the IRS will exert its power to withhold medical care to political opponents of the administration (Washington Post branded her absurd claim "Four Pinocchios"). "So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they’re going to be in charge of our health care. There’s a huge national database that’s being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers health care, their personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially ...to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care,” Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) said on Fox News, May 15, 2013) They also lie and distort the issue of the mandate, probably the most controversial pieces of Obamacare. But the mandate isn't scary or onerous at all. Beginning Jan 1, 2014, all Americans will be "mandated" to have health insurance or pay a fine (which turns out to be a ridiculous low amount). The 85% of Americans who already have health insurance already comply so are not at all affected, do not have to change anything, will keep the doctors that their plan administrators have decided are the ones you can use. But since just about everybody requires medical treatment in their lifetime, we taxpayers have already been paying the "fine" or tax for those without insurance, amounting to $1000 built into the insurance premium, because we subsidize the emergency rooms (and how does that have anything to do with treatment after the initial emergency especially for chronic and long-term illness?) Plus, there is a generous subsidy program - something that Republican opponents have perversely said they favor, even though this is the government cost part of the plan: if you're purchasing individual insurance and you earn less than $45,000 per year (or a family of four that earns less than $94,000), you could be eligible for financial assistance to help pay for health insurance. That also applies to people who currently buy their own health insurance, so nearly half of them will be eligible as well. As we have pointed out, Obamacare is essentially the Republican plan, and it has nothing to do with this "noble" quest to keep down the budget deficit, since the deficit is falling faster than any time in 60 years, is half of what it was when Obama came to office, and since repealing Obamacare would actually add $100 billion to the deficit over10 years, and $1 trillion in the next decade. So there is more to the opposition merely to Obamacare, as the latest list of extortionist "demands" from the Radical Republicans makes clear: Now, to appease this minority of anti-government Tea Party fanatics they are now demanding that Obama not just delay implementation of health care, but also approve construction of the Keystone Pipeline, overhaul the tax code to favor the millionaires, more offshore oil and gas production and energy exploration on federal lands. Also, in a growing list are demands to roll back regulations on coal ash, block new Environmental Protection Agency regulations on greenhouse gas production, eliminate a $23 billion fund to ensure the orderly dissolution of failed major banks, eliminate mandatory contributions to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, limit medical malpractice lawsuits and increase means testing for Medicare, among other provisions. (Why stop there? Why not also demand that the 2012 election be reversed and Obama step aside for Romney?) There seems a common theme: all of the demands impact health care - the demand to increase fossil fuels and eliminate regulations of pollution and emissions, eliminate redress for medical malpractice, and at the same time, continue to shift wealth to the wealthiest - making Americans sicker, poorer and more powerless. "The bottom line, though, is do we want to continue to live in a society where we've got the most inefficient health care system on Earth, leaving millions of people exposed to the possibilities that they could lose everything because they get sick?" President Obama told President Clinton during a conversation on health care at the 2013 Clinton Global Initiative. "Or we've got little children and families going to the emergency room once a week because they've got asthma and other preventable diseases, because their families aren't linked up with a primary care physician who is providing them regular care? Where the costs to society for reduced productivity, illnesses, et cetera, all burden our businesses? Is that the kind of society we aspire to? "And I think the answer is no. And the notion that we would resist, or at least some would resist as fiercely as they have, make this their number-one agenda, perpetuating a system in which millions of people across the country, hardworking Americans don't have access to health care I think is wrong," he said. But now the Republicans are using Obamacare - and this reasonable approach to solving the health care crisis while addressing the budget deficit - in order to organize what amounts to a coup and disposing a democratically elected majority (Obama was reelected with 5 million more votes than Romney, and more Democratic votes were cast for Congress than Republican votes.) They may have expropriated the name Tea Party after the colonials who challenged British rule, but these rebels are far from noble. The Republicans have made it clear they intend to use this hostage-taking tactic - as Grover Norquist put it, keeping Obama on a monthly "leash" - over and over again. It has cost jobs, hurt retirement savings, prolonged economic suffering and cut off any mobility. In effect, they intend to destroy the democratic principles of this country, just as they seek to destroy government. Sounds like treason to me. President Obama cannot negotiate with hostage takers, because this practice is happening over and over. Those that would defeat Obama and his agenda have settled on this tactic because they haven't yet had the grounds to mount an impeachment. Obama needs to restore the democratic principles. In fact, Congress is in violation of the Constitution - the 14th amendment - which requires the Congress to pay its debts. Obama could invoke it himself, but that will trigger the impeachment process that the Tea Partyers have been salivating for. Instead, the President should sue Congress for violating its oath, and bring the suit to the Supreme Court, which despite the Republican activists (they were Unitary Executive proponents during the Bush regime) who have been dedicated to shifting power from the people to corporations while claiming to be "originalists," have to take the language of the Constitution: "The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned." Case closed. Get on with it. "I’m not going to start setting a precedent not just for me, but for future Presidents where one chamber in Congress can basically say each time there needs to be a vote to make sure Treasury pays its bills, we’re not going to sign it unless our particular hobbyhorse gets advanced," Obama said "Imagine if you had a Republican President and a Democratic Speaker, and the Democratic Speaker said, well, we’re not going to pass a debt ceiling unless we raise corporate taxes by 40 percent; or unless we pass background checks on guns; or whatever other list of agenda items Democrats were interested in. Does anybody actually think that we would be hearing from Republicans that that was acceptable behavior? "That's not how our constitutional system is designed. We are not going to do it. The American people have worked too hard to recover from a bunch of crises -- several of them now over the last couple of years inflicted by some of the same folks in Congress that we’re talking about now -- to see extremists in Congress cause another crisis..... "And that's why we’ve got to break this cycle. My message to Congress is this: Do not shut down the government. Do not shut down the economy. Pass a budget on time. Pay our bills on time. Refocus on the everyday concerns of the American people. "There will be differences between Democrats and Republicans. We can have all kinds of conversations about how to resolve those differences. There will be areas where we can work together. There will be areas where we disagree. But do not threaten to burn the house down simply because you haven’t gotten 100 percent of your way. That's not how our democracy is supposed to work. "Every day that this goes on is another day that we’re not focused on doing what we need to be focused on, which is rebuilding this great country of ours so that our middle class is growing and everybody has got opportunity if they're willing to work hard. That's what I’m focused on. That's what Congress should be focused on as well." The President has to break this cycle of hostage taking. Don't give in. Don't give up. And by the way, he should raise the stakes so that there is some penalty. Because all of this drama isn't just harming the economy and having real impact on the incomes and livelihood and opportunities for every American, but every day they are consumed with this they are not dealing with other vital issues: climate change, immigration reform, gun violence prevention, infrastructure.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1380643160418</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 11:59:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380643247499-69</Id><Title>Boeing stock price down today .07% Airbus up as usual 1.88% for the year to date airbus betters boeing 64% to 55%</Title><Msg>Boeing's recent decision to halt production of the Boeing (BA) C-17 strategic jet-powered transporter, is a great deal for Airbus as they now have in production, a rival to the C-17 its called the A400M, breathed life into hopes for new export orders for the plane.

The poll found Republicans favor the shutdown by a 49-percent to 44-percent margin. But independents oppose it 74-19 percent, and Democrats reject it 90-6 percent. It’s a national poll, and mid-term elections are decided district-by-district and state-by-state. There are still 13 months before voters cast their ballots. But Quinnipiac found Democrats enjoy their largest edge yet over Republicans in a so-called “generic” ballot, 43 percent to 34 percent. How do congressional Republicans fare? Seventy-four percent disapprove of the job they are doing, their lowest score ever in the Quinnipiac poll. Democrats? Sixty percent disapproval, 32 percent approval. And Obama isn’t popular — but he’s apparently blessed by his enemies. Here’s how he does against Republicans in Congress on several core issues: - He’s up 47 percent-42 percent on handling the economy. - He’s up 51 percent-38 percent on helping the middle class - He’s up 63 percent-26 percent on helping low-income families. - He’s up 47 percent-38 percent on handling health care. - He’s statistically tied on the deficit, 43-percent-42 percent. - Republicans have a slight edge on guns, 45 percent to 42 percent. “On almost all questions, voters see President Obama as more reasonable, and better able to handle the issues,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. “But it is not because the president is beloved.”</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1380643548483</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 12:05:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380643898675-72</Id><Title>Boeings recent decision to halt production of the C-17 is a shoe in for EADS A400M</Title><Msg>A recent decision to halt production of the Boeing (BA) C-17 strategic jet-powered transporter, a rival to the A400M, breathed life into hopes for new export orders for the plane. EADS plane is a subsidized work so now that it is built and flying more engineers will be freed up for projects that bury Boeing over time. Monday delivered its first A400M military transport plane, handing over the huge turboprop to France. The pan-European aircraft maker hopes the official handover ceremony at the Airbus Military plant in Seville, southern Spain, will launch strong sales to air forces worldwide following a difficult birth. "It is an extremely high performance aircraft and I am quite proud that France is number one for delivery," French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said at a handover ceremony also attended by Spain's Prince Felipe. Since this plane was a government's subsidy plane at cost plus no hard money loss for Airbus commercial division. Frankly Airbus would like to spin off this loser like a 787 as fast as possible like the 30 billion dollar over cost 787 this EADS turkey cost 8.8 billion too much. Not much need , the C-17 cancellation of the program shows that .

In fact, a shutdown would fail on both counts. Shutting down the government will "likely add to the budget deficit," Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Ethan Harris wrote in a research note on Monday. That's because a shutdown could hurt the economy, undercutting tax revenues. At the same time, stopping and starting the massive gears of government is "costly," he added. Those two factors combined to add $1.4 billion (or about $2.5 billion in today's dollars) to the budget deficit during the 1995-96 shutdown, Harris estimates. That shutdown was the longest in recent decades. Any shorter shutdown would have less of an impact, but almost certainly would not help the government's finances. To double the stupidity and irony of this situation, the shutdown would come at a time when the federal budget deficit has shrunk to its lowest level since 2008. At the same time, a shutdown will have no effect on Obamacare, which will start rolling out on Tuesday with the launch of health-insurance exchanges, shutdown or no, The Huffington Post's Jeffrey Young points out. That's because Obamacare is an entitlement like Medicare, noted Harris. Those keep going even when the rest of the government doesn't. That's not to say a shutdown would have no effect: In fact, depending on its duration, the shutdown could do noticeable damage to the entire economy. Harris estimates that a month-long shutdown could shave 2 percent from gross domestic product in the fourth quarter. Last week, economist Mark Zandi of Moodys Analytics estimated a one-month shutdown could hit GDP by 1.4 percent. This wouldn't be as catastrophic as a breach of the debt ceiling -- House Republicans' next trick. But for an economy grinding along at just 2.5 percent growth at last check, that is a significant hit. And it would be all for nothing.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1380646123306</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 12:48:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380646144459-88</Id><Topic><Title>Don't Forget Obama's Gloom &amp; Doom Prediction for Sequestration</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380638476384</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 10:41:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He produces responses from idiots like you.....that's valuable entertainment.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1380646144459</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 12:49:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380646319177-89</Id><Topic><Title>I got up at 3AM to Help Birth a New Calf</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380632123389</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 08:55:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Perhaps you could elaborate as to what your point is, and who you would propose to perform airline safety inspections.

Democratic Presidents tend to be "troughs" in the above graph, relative to their Republican successors and predecessors. On the other hand, the only two Presidents in this table to actually run an average surplus (in the Roaring Twenties) were both Republicans, and the Obama administration, in its first three fiscal years, was still running enormous deficits (albeit smaller than in the transitional year; see table 1). The first three years of B.H. Obama accrued almost as much total debt as the first seven years of G.W. Bush, which was more than eight years of Reagan, and half again as much as twelve years of FDR. If you include 2008-2009, the 8-year G.W. Bush administration accrued almost as much total debt as the 8-year Reagan administration and the 12-year FDR administration combined. The biggest accrued-debt-per-year figures are associated with B.H. Obama, G.W. Bush, G.H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, FDR, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter, in that order. How does the accumulated debt compare with what it would have been with no change? Since many of the items in the budget are multi-year commitments with considerable inertia (most obviously, interest on the national debt!), I recomputed the previous numbers, subtracting the annual deficit in each President's first year. In other words, this table compares how much debt was actually accumulated with how much would have been accumulated if deficits had continued as they were when the President took office. Truman is an outlier: he took office in the middle of World War II, which immediately followed the Great Depression. The Federal government was running an enormous annual deficit in his first year, so it would have been remarkable if it hadn't decreased during his term. FDR presided over most of the Great Depression, initiated many expensive government programs to fight it, and presided over the beginning of World War II. Likewise, Obama took office in the middle of, by far, the biggest-deficit year in history, dealing with two wars and the most severe recession since the 1930's; it would have been remarkable if the deficit hadn't decreased during his term. In Obama's case, the deficit decreased dramatically in his first two years, but was almost unchanged in his third.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1380647312921</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 13:08:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380647354794-99</Id><Topic><Title>I got up at 3AM to Help Birth a New Calf</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380632123389</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 08:55:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because, as everyone knows, the industry-paid inspectors are paid to lie.

It's hard to think of anything the government can do better than the private sector other than raise capital by force.</Msg><Username>ireadhistory2</Username><Timestamp>1380648232640</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 13:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380648246261-109</Id><Topic><Title>What Republicans fear the most</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1380642233009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 11:43:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4 of the 10 wealthiest communities in the nation reside in Long Island where Ms. Rubin the expert on Obonzocare fear lives.

Harry Reid's re-election committee in 2007. U.S. District Court Judge Larry Hicks also ordered Whittemore to pay $100,000 in fines for his three felony convictions and serve 100 hours community service upon his release from a yet-to-be determined prison that houses white-collar criminals. The 61-year-old former lobbyist and wealthy developer is to surrender on his own to federal authorities on Jan. 31, 2014. "These offenses go to the very heart of our electoral process," Hicks said. Prosecutors said Whittemore gave money to family members and employees in 2007 to make contributions he had promised to Reid while concealing himself as the true source to skirt campaign finance laws.</Msg><Username>ireadhistory2</Username><Timestamp>1380648759017</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 13:32:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380649027253-113</Id><Title>LMAO....MSNBC Anchor Tries to Enroll in Obamacare On Air, Fails, Gives Up</Title><Msg>Some choice quotes: "I keep getting this error page."

Last week, South Korea’s air force indicated that Boeing’s F-15SE (Silent Eagle) proposal, which had earlier been selected as sole compliant bidder by the country’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), would not be acceptable for the FX-3 fighter competition. In short, the RoKAF implied, the service wanted Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Also this month, Boeing announced that the C-17 strategic transport would end production in 2015, after the next 22 planes are delivered. Some of these last batch aircraft are being built on spec, albeit for likely customers. The short-term survival of the F-15 line isn’t a problem for Boeing. The company has just started building 84 planes for Saudi Arabia. But the RoKAF’s harsh pronouncement effectively kills the F-15SE proposal, and eliminates any hope of finding a sixth F-15 export customer (Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Korea are the sole members of this exclusive club). It also means that the current Saudi Arabian order will almost certainly be the last major sales success, and that the line will close in 2018 or 2019. But this development, and the C-17 announcement, highlight a serious military platform sunset problem. The F-15 and C-17 are the second and third most important Boeing military aircraft in terms of revenue, but the F/A-18 is first. This too is an endangered product. Unless the US Navy changes its mind (procurement is scheduled to end in the next fiscal year) or an export order arrives, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet will shut by 2016. So far, there is only one export customer, Australia. Brazil’s FX-2 competition was the best hope for an order, but given the Brazilian economy and animosity towards the US, this looks unlikely. Meanwhile the V-22 tiltrotor (built in partnership with Textron’s Bell unit) is ramping down too, along with all US military rotorcraft, including Boeing’s CH-47 transpo</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380651586952</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 14:19:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380651662366-138</Id><Title>Now We know Why there are No Democrats on Mt.

He also said that Airbus, which has U.S. engineering centers in Wichita, Kan., and Mobile, Ala., is likely to add two more in the next decade, and will seriously consider locating one in Washington state. “We are attracted to Washington state for the same reason we were attracted to Wichita. That’s where the talent is,” he said. “If you want to have access to the talent that developed over the last 100 years of aviation, Washington is very fertile ground.” Those startling ideas came from Airbus’s top man in America, who has probably the most exceptional aviation resume of any aerospace executive in the U.S. A highly decorated combat fighter pilot in Vietnam, he was an associate professor of engineering at the Air Force Academy, then flew as a pilot in the Air Force Thunderbirds flying display team. Afterwards, he headed air operations at FedEx, and under President Reagan he was head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for two years.</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380651842730</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 14:24:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380651963842-141</Id><Topic><Title>If its a outsourced Boeing 787 I am not going -Boeing vows to improve reliability and agree's their plance sucks</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380640776295</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 11:19:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>father_zosima well good , your copying me now . har har har psssst this reply moves my post up the chain it says if its a outsourced 787 I am not going that is the subject</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380651963842</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 14:26:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380652065996-142</Id><Topic><Title>Now We know Why there are No Democrats on Mt.

According to Yahoo! news: Hours after the government officially lurched to a partial shutdown, a new poll released Tuesday showed Americans really aren’t crazy about Obamacare — but hate the Republican approach of closing the government in an effort to repeal it. The Quinnipiac University national survey found that the public is split on the Affordable Care Act, with 47 percent opposed to it and 45 percent in favor. But Americans, by a lopsided 72-22 percent margin, say shutting down the government is not the answer. Would the GOP fare better by refusing to raise the country’s debt ceiling to stop Obamacare? Not much: Americans oppose that approach 64-27 percent. That’s likely to cheer the White House, which warns that failing to pay for programs Congress already has approved — the purpose of raising the debt limit — would trigger a default that would send shock waves through the fragile world economy.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380655515179</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 15:25:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380655527218-162</Id><Topic><Title>"Lemmings with suicide vests"</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380580778968</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 18:39:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and he 'e could play the guitard...

Unlike many Americans, many of whom have been forcibly kicked off their current health care plans, the governing class and their staffers as of now will keep their insurance providers and receive an enormous taxpayer subsidy (depending on which plan they choose) to off-set rising health care costs. Sound fair? I didn’t think so. As it happened, many congressional staffers threatened to resign if they were forced to enroll in the Obamacare exchanges and comply with the mandate -- even though many of them helped draft (and ultimately pass) the legislation. This is what prompted the president to act. But not everyone in Congress is comfortable with upholding such a grotesque waiver. Indeed, this has been a sticking point for Senator Ted Cruz and his allies -- and something they will never let the American people forget: What’s curious to me is that even Red State Democrats voted in lock-step with their party to buck the House of Representative’s duly passed spending bill on several occasions. Not only did they reject a continuing resolution that would end this unjust and unfair Obamacare waiver -- a de facto endorsement of special privileges and protections for members of Congress -- they voted against the provision to delay the law’s controversial mandate requirement to purchase health insurance. As recently as four days ago, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) said it was “reasonable and sensible” to vote in favor of delaying this provision for one additional year. So how did he and his party end up voting? Well, in the end, along with every other Senate Democrat, he and his colleagues rejected House Republicans’ plan to avert a government shutdown. Splendid. What does it say about a democratic republic that those who govern 'We the People' feel entitled to receive special privileges and exemptions from laws they themselves pass, while at the same time express no qualms whatsoever about forcing ordinary Americans to comply with them? Do Democrats in Congress really know what’s best for us -- and our families -- better than we do? Apparently so. Conservative icon Charles Murray put it rather nicely recently when he said that America was now becoming a nation where those “at the top of society live increasingly apart” from everyday Americans. Is he not correct? Perhaps this is why Ted Cruz volunteered to donate his salary to charity for every single day that the government remains closed. Now, of course, this gesture of solidarity is not unwelcome, but does it change anything? Absolutely not. Partisan Democrats have all but ensured that members of Congress and their aids will ultimately insulate themselves from the pain and costs of Obamacare. For their stubbornness, I sincerely hope that each and every single one of them pays at the voting booth for their intransigence. Throw the bums out. We need leaders in Congress who care more about public service than enriching themselves. Enough is enough.

Login to Reply Flag as Offensive anonymous86 Wrote: 1 hour ago (2:39 PM) Just why haven't the Republicans in Congress spoken against the 40% tax on Cadillac insurance that Americans will have to pay if their company or union is competitive enough to provide? Shouldn't our politicians want Americans to be provided the best coverage possible by employers? I would rather have the Lexus Plan than the Chevy volt plan. The members of congress and their staffs will not have to pay this 40% tax on their Cadillac plan which they will continue to receive through the waiver provided by our President. Why haven't members of Congress or their staff ever had a premium on their insurance since they were provided medical insurance? Very few Americans, whether they are self employed or employed by a company, don't pay a premium. Does this mean that our "public servants" are now the ruling class? Why are they treated different than all other Americans? If the Affordable Care Act, which the Democrats passed behind closed doors, is so great why do they get an exemption? Where have the Republicans been since the passage of Obamacare? Don't they have enough courage to speak for those who elected them to oppose Obamacare? The Republicans lost the last election because they are too focused on same sex marriage and abortion. They are too lazy or too stupid to fight for all Americans. They are too lazy and stupid to shake hands with the people in groups who may not normally vote for them. Have Republicans who come to a city like Las Vegas, ever introduced themselves to the union workers on the strip when they come for a convention or vacation? NO! They never go to the kitchen staff, wait staff, or housekeeping to say hello, but the Democrats do, along with their lies. The Republicans don't have enough intestinal fortitude to deal with the truth and think that they can win with their opposition to abortion and gay marriage. If just two Republicans had shared some information about Obamacare to these union members, we may have had a President Romney and no Obamacare. As long as we have illiterate and corrupt people as leaders in our Congress like Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, who can't read a bill before passage, our country is doomed.

Login to Reply Flag as Offensive ITSTLN Wrote: 2 hours ago (2:08 PM) The GOP inserted a provision in the law which REQUIRED Congressional staff to acquire their heath insurance through the Affordable Care Act. To my knowledge they are the only employee group in the country which would have that designation. The current legislation simply allows a carry over of the tax exempt subsidy enjoyed by virtually every other large employer-and every other echelon of government-in the country. Whether that's good or bad can be debated, but its not some unique provision to benefit Congressional workers: it basically allows them the same tax status support enjoyed by other employees of large group plans. I am a hard cost conservative: I think the Affordable Care Act is a bad one and needs to be replaced. But I don't do political hokey pokey.

We will see how many Democratic Representatives go along with this, if any. It will still pass and then we can see which Democratic Senators will go along. Then the GOP can make the point that the Democrats don't care about a government shutdown because they know they won't be affected. Login to Reply Flag as Offensive gstephens Wrote: 3 hours ago (1:21 PM) Language in the ACA treats Cadillac Plans as income above a certain level. The congressional plans are the top end of that circumstance. Since those plans are taxable as income above a threshold point, should they be considered a raise? If so, should these subsidies be subject to the limitations of the 27th Amendment? Of course, the amendment says that Congress cannot receive a pay raise they voted for themselves without first standing for election. That would prevent them receiving the subsidies until after Nov. 2014.

Stewart’s message: the Republican Party is utterly insane. Stewart played clips of Republican politicians blasting Obamacare, the reason why the party forced a government shutdown. The elected officials repeatedly claimed that the law was “unconstitutional,” even though the Supreme Court had already ruled it was constitutional. He closed out by pointing out that Obama is having better success negotiation with Iran than talking to the GOP.

The poll, released on September 30, noted that two in three of those surveyed said they "planned" to get insurance rather than pay the small fine at the end of the year. The poll further found that under half intend to take advantage of the state or federal insurance exchanges when they are finally up and running. It should be noted that that this result was based on what people say they intend to do, not what they have actually done or are even in the process of doing. Statistics worsened in the important 18 to 29 age bracket. Sixty-nine percent of the youth demographic were unaware they were required to get health insurance by January 1, 2014. This is the age group that Obama is hoping will foot the bill for the rest of America.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380666409609</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 18:26:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380666529699-225</Id><Topic><Title>There was this guy who could punt a football</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1380666288248</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 18:24:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How long have you been a Democrat?</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380666529699</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 18:28:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380667338909-226</Id><Title>I hate to burst a RWNJ 's bubble\</Title><Msg>but do the math: 28IF IAM the Walrus Paul is dead. the real Christians call him St.Paul then hit the ball outta the park like an Obama speech today into the archives... maybe IAM amazed</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1380667338909</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 18:42:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380667955130-227</Id><Topic><Title>There was this guy who could punt a football</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1380666288248</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 18:24:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>long/hang time inside the five is called a HALL OF FAME punter IN THE GAME OF FOTTBALL if yo' donnn'y want my arrogant uP YO BEHIND BEYATCH ARON PAUL</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1380667955130</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 18:52:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380668198654-228</Id><Topic><Title>Notice how often the Raven is posting?</Title><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1380658220393</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 16:10:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The tea party will grows like your fantasy island.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1380668198654</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 18:56:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380669942566-229</Id><Topic><Title>I hate to burst a RWNJ 's bubble\</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1380667338909</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 18:42:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the real christ the one and only christ part of the trinity IAM back in line again where do I want to go to Wherever IAM hope he wants bacon, eggs sunny0side Up [or] over easy if it is not too much work some hash browns, half of this 5 gallons of milk for my cereal, while IAM making my toast as the \ DISHWASHER the noise, the mir noise</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1380669942566</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 19:25:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380671126533-230</Id><Topic><Title>Help!</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380597681889</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 23:21:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a crow-bar, a can anti-semite dog srpay\\ \and a bigger boat Noah</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1380671126533</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 19:45:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380671754166-231</Id><Topic><Title>Notice how often the Raven is posting?</Title><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1380658220393</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 16:10:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey...You've relegated yourself to quoting Allen Dulles ... who used to fund the Nazis ... and a guy who PROBABLY (read Jerone Corsis new book) was in on covering up the JFK assassination ... because ...how did you put it...the Government has to protect itself ...it sums you up in a nutshell.....You sicken me</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380671754166</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 19:55:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380671990889-232</Id><Title>Obama can negotiate with the Iranians ...but NOT the GOP</Title><Msg>Worst President EVER ..........................

On the first day that new insurance exchanges were made available to Americans, companies like WellPoint Inc. and Molina Healthcare Inc. saw their stocks gain over 2.5%. It’s unsurprising that large health insurance companies are enjoying the fruits of mandatory Obamacare regulations, since they helped write them in the first place. WellPoint’s performance today will surely be celebrated by its former Vice President Liz Fowler, who wrote the 87-page white paper that was the foundation of Obamacare. After it was passed, Senator Max Baucus profusely thanked Fowler for being personally responsible for crafting the Affordable Health Care Act. Politico described her as a “major player” in getting the bill through Congress. WellPoint Inc. is the nation’s second largest health insurer and is responsible for operating Blue Cross Blue Shield licenses. Others companies like United Healthgroup Incorporated (America’s largest health insurance provider) and Cigna Corp also enjoyed spikes today in excess of 1.5%.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380676196757</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 21:09:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380676595924-254</Id><Topic><Title>Obama can negotiate with the Iranians ...but NOT the GOP</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380671990889</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 19:59:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You would have a better perspective if you weren't a KKK member.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380676595924</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 21:16:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380678116670-255</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Quote of the Day</Title><Username>ireadhistory2</Username><Timestamp>1380647368960</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 13:09:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Truth is relative to us Liberals .

So they are utterly safe and there is no down side for them right now other than the rest of the country.
