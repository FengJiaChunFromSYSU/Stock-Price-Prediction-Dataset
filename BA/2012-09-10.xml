Did you know that Boeing, due to the outsourcing cost on the 787 has a long term debt to equity ratio of 150.5, compare this to Airbus ratio of only 46.8! Boeing should take some of that money they use to influence lawmakers and get on the world bank, here is why. The taxpayer is paying for China's hollowing out the US aerospace industry, the american taxpayer is helping China to take away the last big manufacturing base and send it to china. "World Bank lends to China on concessionary terms, hapless U.S. taxpayers are picking up the tab for the subsidized rise of a mercantilist rival to the United States. Adding insult to injury is that the World Bank has done nothing to pressure the Chinese to honor their commitments to open their markets. Worse it has been financing the Chinese Export-Import Bank, whose principal raison d’etre is to hollow out manufacturing industries in the United States and other Western nations. Perhaps most startlingly the World Bank has advanced $15 billion to help build up the Chinese aerospace industry. That is a large dagger aimed at the heart of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and other American aerospace companies. It is not as if the United States can afford to take a laid back view anymore.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347288496648</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 10:48:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347294022598-11</Id><Title>Rasmusson: Obama 50% - Romney 45%</Title><Msg>The tax cuts for the rich trickle-down idea doesn't work for 99% of Americans!

If you want to look at airplane orders and forget the cost of doing business then you are not looking at the picture your pumping Boeing for the company not the shareholder or the financial interests of the users of yahoo, you are advertising for Boeing. Now on BAC, a day trade stock easy, and it is as pie, today trade, and up 54% for the year. I sold BAC last Friday and called my trade then, it was based upon reading a stock chart. I purchased on Thursday of last week and after i day and a opening on Friday I sold and the trade profited over 8% Now , today BAC is down today that was easy to see coming, so easy to figure if you can read a stock chart. If you want a buy and hold stock go with apple it is up 63% for the year and while it moves up and down the path is always up , the direction is up and apple AAPL stock price appreciation has beat Boeing by a wide margin for all of the last 15 years and will continue to make money for apple shareholders. All you have to do to realize Boeing is a dead cat bounce stock is look at Boeings huge debt load on the 787. Boeing Company will cease to exist, it will be delisted in five years, and you heard it here first. the 777x is delayed , no money so airbus moves ahead on that series of airplanes, the 737Max will be late an over budget and the Chinese 737 buster will start cutting into Boeing in about 3 or 4 more years along with Airbus plane, so goodbye Boeing the outsourcing business plan that bankrupted MD will now kill Boeing ! Thanks Phil Condit for buying a dead company like MD and then losing your job to MD ,Phil Condit , the past CEO of Boeing, the man who helped in a big way by making bad business decisions, Now MD you went bankrupt outsourcing and now how is that outsourcing working for you now? Boeing you need to cut pension with SPEEA now, what is next, anything else to trim and run off? Are we done, when will Boeing get a good BOD and CEO?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347319034305</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 19:17:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347321582830-26</Id><Topic><Title>If Politics Were a Football Game, The Republicans Would be Swamped With Penalty Flags</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_007</Username><Timestamp>1347317679429</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 18:54:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dik, You are One Redundant Fool!</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1347321582830</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 19:59:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347321632313-27</Id><Topic><Title>If Politics Were a Football Game, The Republicans Would be Swamped With Penalty Flags</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_007</Username><Timestamp>1347317679429</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 18:54:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If it were a football game, the murderer Obama would not qualify to play at all.</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1347321632313</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 20:00:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347321696466-28</Id><Topic><Title>If Politics Were a Football Game, The Republicans Would be Swamped With Penalty Flags</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_007</Username><Timestamp>1347317678929</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 18:54:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Snore...
