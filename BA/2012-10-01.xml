Why has CEO pay (which includes all the executives) increased to over 500 times the average the last 40-50 years from 20-50 times in the 50's and 60's?) Why is a company only successful due to the impact of the CEO but when it fails it is caused by the impact of unions? Why do failed CEO always get rich? If you think like that then you need to become educated. Please take the time to read the book "Who Stole the American Dream?" by Hedrick Smith. Try to deepen your thinking by understanding historically what is happening to the United States. I know it is a real strain for most of you one-liners as it is easier to be absolutely right about your position than to consider the facts. I know it is easier to think "Unions cause the downfall" and "CEO are entitled to all successes" it is much easier than investigating the basis of your beliefs or even considering another possibility.</Msg><Username>zevach</Username><Timestamp>1349092980755</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 08:03:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349093254142-19</Id><Topic><Title>September deliveries</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1349091756999</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 07:42:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the update.</Msg><Username>mrstock52</Username><Timestamp>1349093254142</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 08:07:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349093881240-20</Id><Topic><Title>To Cripple Boeing or not?</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1348971404754</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:16:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are wasting your breath.

The Chicago Purchasing Managers survey, which gauges private sector orders for goods and services, fell below 50 for the first time since September 2009. The data does not bode well for the next week’s September jobs reports. The economy added just 96,000 jobs in August, well below expectations, with nearly 400,000 individuals dropping out of the work force altogether. The unemployment rate has been above 8 percent for 43 consecutive months and labor force participation is at its lowest level in more than three decades. Jim Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute notes that 2012 “may be the worst non-recession, non-depression year in the history of the United States.” But despite all indicators to the contrary, Democratic voters appear increasingly convinced that the economy is improving. According to Gallup, economic confidence among Democrats surged 10 points between September 16 and September 23, while independents and Republicans reported a drop in confidence. Do Democrats just have hollow heads?</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1349112242695</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 13:24:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349113206934-36</Id><Title>Obama: "If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan..........</Title><Msg>...... Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.” Reality, via a new nationwide survey of employers: Two-thirds of employers think health care cost will rise. 1 in 5 say they may drop coverage for employees. Obama: "We're going to reduce costs an average of $2500 per family on premiums." Reality: But it turns out that family premiums have increased by more than $3,000 since Obama's vow, according to the latest annual Kaiser Family Foundation employee health benefits survey. Premiums for employer-provided family coverage rose $3,065 — 24% — from 2008 to 2012, the Kaiser survey found. Even if you start counting in 2009, premiums have climbed $2,370. What's more, premiums climbed faster in Obama's four years than they did in the previous four under President Bush, the survey data show. But hey, it's not like this was a promise Obama made over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, right?......uh, why yes he did!</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1349113206934</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 13:40:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349113737306-37</Id><Title>Defense cuts layoffs have started 60 day notices going out BIG BIG BIG Layoffs sell the rips gets some cash</Title><Msg>Defense cuts layoffs have started 60 day notices going out BIG BIG BIG Layoffs sell the rips gets some cash</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1349113737306</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 13:48:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349114302892-38</Id><Title>Economics 101 for Boeing Employees</Title><Msg>Jobs Outlook Weak as Companies Reporting Cost Cuts......cost cutting means more lay offs......more lay-offs mean less people traveling.........less people traveling......mean airlines order fewer airplanes......airlines ordering fewer airplanes mean few orders for Boeing.......few orders for Boeing means more layoffs at Boeing.

If nothing else, it’s given Team Obama grist for an absolutely devastating ad. But it’s worth pointing out another dynamic that’s been overlooked here: The escalating disaster that is Paul Ryan. At the time of his selection, a number of pundits argued Ryan’s strategic benefits, suggesting he would boost Romney by energizing conservatives, or by allowing Romney to run as the candidate of big ideas, or that he would at least be the party’s best defender of the Medicare plan Romney was going to have to defend whether he wanted to or not. This seemed like a stretch at the time—after all, Ryan’s Medicare plan proved to be a massive liability the one time voters weighed in on it. But who could say for sure? Well, fast forward a month-and-a-half and the numbers look pretty persuasive. This week the New York Times released a set of polls, conducted by Quinnipiac, assessing the state of the race in Ohio and Florida. The top-line numbers were jaw-dropping enough: Obama’s lead in Ohio grew from six to ten over the last month, and from three to nine in Florida. (It’s better to focus on the change here than the magnitude, which is highly sensitive to polling methodology.) But once you look at the internal numbers, they’re even less kind to Romney. More to the point, they suggest Ryan has done enormous damage to the ticket. Back in late August, Obama led Romney on the question of who would handle Medicare better by 8 points in Florida and 10 points in Ohio; now he’s up 15 in Florida and 16 in Ohio. And the problems are especially acute among senior citizens, a group Obama has traditionally struggled with. A month ago, Obama was down 13 points in Florida among people 65 and older; today he’s up 4. On the specific question of Medicare, Obama was down 4 points among Florida seniors in August; today he’s up 5 points. (The Quinnipiac Poll re-shuffled its age-groups between August and September, so you won’t be make apples-to-apples comparisons by eyeballing their crosstabs. But the super-kind people at Quinnipiac re-reshuffled them for me.) The numbers for Ohio are similar: In August, Obama was down 8 among seniors in the state; today he’s up 1. A month ago Obama was down 6 points among Ohio seniors on the Medicare issue; today he’s up 6. The turnaround here is simply breathtaking. Nor is the Times/Quinnipiac poll an outlier. Though I haven’t looked at the internal numbers, a set of Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation state polls out today shows something similar: Obama up 19 over Romney on Medicare in Ohio, 15 in Florida, 13 in Virginia, and 17 nationally (his largest lead on the question all year). As the Post write-up puts it: “[T]he more voters focus on Medicare, the more likely they are to support the president’s bid for reelection.” Interestingly, the early post-Ryan polling actually showed the GOP ticket gaining ground on Medicare, if only by disingenuously accusing Obama of cutting $716 billion from the program to pay for healthcare reform. (Ryan had proposed identical cuts, except in his case they would have been refunded to the wealthy as tax cuts.) But that that was before the Democrats joined the fight. Since then, the Dems have relentlessly attacked the Ryan plan, both at their convention and on the campaign trail, and the numbers have followed suit. It’s hard to believe Obama would have had the success he’s had here without Ryan himself on the ticket. So, yes, the “47 percent” is a big deal. But the likely upshot is to prevent Romney from getting up off the mat, not to knock him down in the first place. It’s Ryan who deserves credit for that. Update: A reader asks if the movement among seniors is more pronounced than among younger cohorts, which is what you'd expect to see if Medicare were driving this. The short answer is yes, though the relative movement varies a bit. According the Quinnipiac, Obama has seen a 17-point improvement among Florida voters 65-and-over since August, but only a 5-point improvement among those 50-64, and no change in his lead among those 18-49. His margin in Florida specifically on Medicare improved by 9 points among those 65-and-over, versus 7 points for the other two groups. (I'd argue that the reason seniors swung much more toward Obama on the first question than the second is that they're more likely to base their vote on Medicare. Or, put differently, no one likes the Ryan Medicare plan, but seniors are much more likely to vote according to that dislike.) In Ohio, Obama has seen a 9-point improvement overall among voters 65-and-over, versus 6 points among those 50-64, and no change among those 18-49. On the Medicare question, he saw a 12-point improvement among seniors, versus 7 points among those 50-64 and 5 points among those 18-49.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1349114952886</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 14:09:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349115638535-44</Id><Topic><Title>Economics 101 for Boeing Employees</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1349114302892</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 13:58:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you honestly think you can scare engineers and technical workers</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1349115638535</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 14:20:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349115789194-45</Id><Title>How low can Boeing go ?</Title><Msg>Here is one example as to the current Boeing financial games with employees and certain retirees. Few outsiders are aware of the underhanded games played by boeing when dealing with unions. No doubt legal re stretching the facts, but still underhanded and unethical. I’ve posted here a link to a similar game with former SPEEA bargaing unit members- not speea members – but simply any and all retirees who were at one time in the bargaining unit, and who still have $$ in the boeing savings plans. Boeing admitted that they did NOT negotiate with SPEEA on the issue ( but apparently managed to take advantage of a poorly worded Letter Of Understanding ( copied in the link which can be downloaded as a pdf file ) Keep that in mind when Boeing said : Q: Is Boeing proposing to take away retiree medical benefits? A: Boeing has no plans to eliminate retiree medical benefits for current retirees. If we’d had the opportunity to discuss our proposal with SPEEA, we could have clarified that we did not intend to change the status quo with respect to retiree medical benefits. Regrettably, SPEEA has chosen to sensationalize the issue and cause unnecessary concern. ” Boeing now charges everyone ( current and former SPEEA types who have funds in Boeing) a 50 cent per month fee for software access ( Portfolio Theory stuff ). Which may be fine for those who are OVER one year from retirement. But which is totally worthless and unusable for anyone who IS retired. And with ING which is NOT the lowest cost such provider for in house funds. SPEEA is the ONLY union who fell for the wording which allowed Boeing to include all former bargaining unit members, agency fee payers, etc back to day one without notice. Retirees of course have no recourse and SPEEA or any union cannot strike over such issues IMHO- The depth of Boeing deception is lower than a snakes butt in a deep rut in Death Vallley IAM turned the whole game down. BTW- ING is the same outfit that got hammered for shady money dealings, look it up in the news.

To verify what I'm saying, download the online version of BCERP for union employees, compare to the #$%$ benefits stuff on aug 28 on the boeing site. For those who plan to retire at age 60 in 2015 under the Alternate Pension Formula, plan carefully. The Alternate formula subtracts a percentage of the IRS defined Covered Compensation data which is the 35 year average of SS Covered Compensation.  Since 2010, the increase in SS covered comp each year on Jan 1 has been around $ 2000. But on Jan 1, 2015 the increase is $ 3,648, nearly twice the average of the year to year increase of the previous decade. The year to year increase in 2014 is only $1920. Coupled with no credited service increase for November and December, ( divide 2000 hours by 45 hours per week and see how many weeks are left in any calendar year ) and NO published agreement to prevent the decrease in your pension $$ as a result, many will find that to get back on track, one will have to work until the last half of 2015 to ' break even' with the previous November.

The fact that tomfranklin repeats this "takers" lie only means we have an exceedingly ill-informed voting public. Often these folks are PROUD to be ignorant of simple facts as in this case.

"I hope this doesn't harm Obama, but if I was from the United States, I'd vote for Obama," the socialist Chavez said of a man he first reached out to in 2009 but to whom he has since generally been insulting. Chavez is running for a new six-year term against opposition challenger Henrique Capriles, while Obama seeks re-election in November against Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Venezuela's election is next weekend. "Obama is a good guy ... I think that if Obama was from Barlovento or some Caracas neighborhood, he'd vote for Chavez," the president told state TV, referring to a poor coastal town known for the African roots of its population.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1349125195600</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 16:59:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349125478168-69</Id><Topic><Title>Obama scores another endorsement … from Hugo Chavez.</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1349111949365</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 13:19:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Muslim hate him &amp; Chavez endorses him........soooooooooo what's your point</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1349125478168</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:04:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349125601133-70</Id><Topic><Title>Ann Romney: Mitt not Fit to be Presdient!!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1349125144123</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 16:59:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would equally be concerned about the country's mental well-being</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1349125601133</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:06:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349125754027-71</Id><Topic><Title>Economics 101 for Boeing Employees</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1349114302892</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 13:58:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Over booked flights???

Romney would raid the poor and middle class to transfer more wealth to the wealthiest few -- and that would be a disaster for our economy. Behind closed doors, in the company of his ultra-rich buddies at a campaign fundraiser, Romney told the truth about how he sees much of the country. The GOP nominee made it very clear that he doesn't think it's his job to care about 47% of Americans. He callously wrote off seniors, students, soldiers, and other Americans who don't pay income taxes as irresponsible "victims" dependent on the government. That's the real Mitt Romney -- the Mitt Romney his campaign is so eager to keep out of view. And the fundraising video is only one example.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1349126046815</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:14:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349126275217-74</Id><Title>Why are Communists so Attracted to Obama?</Title><Msg>The Communist Party USA (CPU), the Socialist Democrats of America, and now Hugo Chavez have all endorsed him.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1349126275217</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:17:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349126372722-75</Id><Title>Romney cannot be trusted to lead America!!</Title><Msg>Romney's repeated refusal to level with voters and say in public what he says behind closed doors should serve as a huge warning to voters.

The Obama campaign has been vocal in its dissent of job outsourcing, using Romney’s past business endeavors as an indication of his performance on domestic job-creation. “I want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs and factories overseas,” the President asserted Tuesday during a speech in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “As long as I’m president, I will keep fighting to make sure jobs are located here in the United States of America.” However, Obama’s $787-billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funneled millions of federal dollars to companies that shipped American jobs overseas. Take, for example, North Carolina-based LED manufacturer Cree Inc., which reaped $39 million through a stimulus-funded tax credit program in January 2010. In November 2009, the company built a manufacturing plant in Huizhou City, China, which is the harbor for more than half of the company’s employees. While Cree is a U.S.-based company, chairman and CEO Chuck Swoboda says that “Cree management never runs this company as a U.S. company. We consider Cree to be a global company with local wisdoms.” And the firm’s plans to further expand into foreign countries are only just beginning, asserts Swoboda. “We will continue to invest here for both human talent and the most state-of-the-art technologies,” he said, adding, “We have committed that in the coming 3-5 years, we will continue to expand our operation in Huizhou.” Another foreign investment scheme spurred on by Obama’s stimulus law involves Japanese wind energy firm Eurus Energy, whose American subsidiary, Eurus Energy America, collected $91 million in stimulus funding to initiate construction of a wind farm in Texas. As it turns out, the wind farm was allegedly built using turbines manufactured by Mitsubishi — another Japanese company. “Eurus Energy America, the U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese firm, received $91 million in stimulus money for its Bull Creek wind farm in Texas,” cited a 2010 report by American University. “The farm consists of 180 Mitsubishi turbines.” Furthermore, the Energy Department’s insatiable appetite for “green” investments has become a chief stimulant to job creation in foreign countries. Solar power firm Sempra Energy, for example, was awarded a whopping $337-million loan guarantee to supply panels for a solar power array in Arizona. However, while Sempra is based in California, the company purchased its solar panels from the Chinese solar giant Suntech.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1349127467476</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:37:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349127699917-80</Id><Title>Got a Job?
