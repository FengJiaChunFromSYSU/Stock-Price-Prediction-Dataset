The first being that you can't afford it or two, you're a healthy young person who doesn't feel like they need it at this point in life. Others may not have health insurance due to lack of employer coverage. Regardless, under new ObamaCare rules lacking health insurance results in a large ObamaCare fine/tax, something that forces people to pay for something they can't afford and young people to pay for something they don't need. Not to mention, when people are paying a fine and not receiving healthcare insurance in return, they're simply throwing money into a black hole that could have been saved to eventually purchase a plan. Now, the Congressional Budget Office is out with new numbers showing an additional two million people will opt to pay the fine instead of purchasing healthcare. This brings to total number of people to six million. Under the law, Americans must be insured starting in 2014 or pay a penalty assessed on their tax returns. Shortly after the legislation passed in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office, working alongside the Joint Committee on Taxation, estimated that in 2016 roughly four million people a year would opt to pay the penalty instead of getting coverage. On Wednesday, the CBO and JCT revised that figure up to six million, citing legislation passed since 2010 as well as the weaker economic outlook. Of those people who opt for the penalty, 10% are projected to be below the federal poverty level for 2016, which the CBO and JCT estimate will stand at about $12,000 for an individual or $24,600 for a family of four. In 2014, the penalty will be no more than $285 per family, or 1% of income, whichever is greater. In 2015, the cap rises to $975, or 2% of income. And by 2016, it reaches $2,085 per family, or 2.5% of income, whichever is greater. The dollar amounts for a single adult would be $95, $325 and $695 during that same time period. But these aren't just individuals choosing to simply pay the fine instead of purchasing insurance, employers across the country are choosing to pay the fine instead of providing employer based health insurance because it's cheaper under the new ObamaCare system. A report from the House Ways and Means Committee finds that 71 of the nation’s top 100 companies would find it far more economical to drop their health care plans and simply pay the penalty for not complying with the Obamacare employer insurance mandate. The report, published May 1, surveyed 71 of the 100 companies in the Fortune 100 list of large corporations and finds that all of them would save considerable amounts of money by dropping their health care coverage instead of complying with the Obamacare insurance mandate. “According to data provided by the 71 Fortune 100 companies that responded to the inquiry, they could save a total of $28.6 billion in 2014 alone if they stopped offering health insurance to their U.S. employees and instead paid the employer mandate penalty for not doing so,” the report said. Finally, let's not forget the most recent projection from the IRS showing the cheapest plans costing $20,000 per family under ObamaCare.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1362490906237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 08:41:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362491140157-20</Id><Title>Napolitano Lied About Weekend "Long Lines at the Airport"</Title><Msg>During a breakfast with POLITICO yesterday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano carried out her orders to fear monger over the sequester and told reporters there were "long lines" at the airports over the weekend due to cuts in TSA security. Turns out, she lied. Ms Napolitano said today that major airports were seeing lines "150 to 200 per cent as long as we would normally expect" as result of the federal spending cuts that went into force on Friday. "We're already seeing the effects at some of the ports of entry, the big airports, for example. Some of them had very long lines this weekend," she told a breakfast event organised by Politico. When pressed for specifics she cited Chicago's O'Hare, Atlanta's Hartfield-Jackson and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), adding: "I don't mean to scare, I mean to inform." However, when contacted by The Daily Telegraph, spokespeople for both O'Hare and LAX, as well as representatives from the travel industry, denied that airports had been hit by delays. "We haven't had any slowdowns at all," said Marshall Lowe, a spokesman for LAX. Mr Lowe said that he had been on duty over the weekend and received no reports of unusual security delays. DeAllous Smith, a spokesman for Hartfield-Jackson, said: "There have been no abnormally long lines at the security checkpoint nor unusual aircraft delays at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as a result of sequestration." Their comments were echoed by Karen Pride, the director of media relations at Chicago Department of Aviation, who described operations at O'Hare as "normal" with "no unusual delays or cancellations."</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1362491140157</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 08:45:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362491498025-21</Id><Title>Will Democrats want the rest of the day off to have a memorial service......</Title><Msg>........to morn the 60th anniversary of Stalin's death</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1362491498025</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 08:51:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362491742644-22</Id><Topic><Title>Analyst Downgrades The Boeing Company.

Friday’s AM fix was USD 1,570.00, EUR 1,203.99 and GBP 1,043.74 per ounce. Silver is trading at $28.75/oz, €22.11/oz and £19.20/oz. Platinum is trading at $1,584.25/oz, palladium at $719.00/oz and rhodium at $1,200/oz. Gold fell $4.80 or 0.,31%% on Friday in New York and closed at $1,575.60/oz. Silver surged to a high of $28.77 in early New York trade before it also fell back off, finishing with a gain of 0.28%. Gold was off 0.31% for the week while silver was down 0.66%. Gold inched higher in all currencies today supported by physical buying in Asia. Concerns about the global economy and the outlook for riskier assets have led to renewed physical buying interest in Asia, particularly in China. The increasingly popular gold forward contract on the Shanghai Gold Exchange stood at 320 yuan a gram by 0741 GMT according to Reuters, or $1,600/oz. This is a healthy premium of about $23 to spot gold. Investors are waiting to see the impact of the spending cuts, known as the "sequester", although the $85 billion cuts are a tiny fraction of the U.S. government's total spending of $3.7 trillion and show the U.S. looks incapable of tacking its very precarious financial position. Hedge funds and money managers increased their net long positions in gold in the week to February 26 from a more than four-year low hit a week earlier. Those lows are very bullish from a contrarian perspective and a gradual increase in speculative longs in the coming weeks seems very likely. Better take a look at it.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362494446730</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 09:40:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362494866036-26</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing’s Conner says 787 fix can ‘move really fast’ before the truth comes out then ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362458384513</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:39:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for taking the time to expain how bad the 787 problems are.

Castillo, the son of a Dominican presidential adviser and the brother of a member of the country's Congress, has been entwined in the scandal himself, accused of hosting outings on his yacht in which Menendez used the services of prostitutes. Like Menendez, he has strongly denied the allegations. Castillo said he would seek a criminal probe into the source of the reports. On Monday, Castillo distributed copies of the woman's sworn statement to reporters. The woman did not attend. On its website early Tuesday, The Daily Caller said neither of the women in the video identified herself as Nexis de los Santos. The website also said both women consented to the presence of a video webcam. In the video released last year, the two women also claimed they had sex with Castillo and Dr. Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor of Dominican descent who is a prominent Democratic campaign contributor and a major supporter of Menendez. De los Santos claims those allegations are also fabricated. Melgen said in a statement that he is pleased Dominican authorities are investigating the prostitution claims, which he says are false. Menendez's ties to Melgen have come under close scrutiny after an FBI raid last month at the doctor's West Palm Beach, Fla., offices. Menendez has acknowledged flying on Melgen's private jet to the Dominican Republic twice and was compelled to reimburse $58,000 for the two flights that he had previously failed to report.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362498185494</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 10:43:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362498369401-39</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing’s Conner says 787 fix can ‘move really fast’ before the truth comes out then ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362458384513</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:39:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it's all a out sourcing business MD management failure, this is not a real Boeing airplane except for the Boeing logo. an outsider James McNerney and a failed MD company destroying the future of Boeing as the world watches</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362498369401</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 10:46:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362498778840-40</Id><Topic><Title>Obamamarket Breaks Record.

The company said Tuesday it has not been able to get a delivery schedule from Boeing for planes it had been expecting to put in operation in May. The 787s have been temporarily grounded worldwide while malfunctions are investigated. Thomson says customers would get refunds for extra fees paid to travel on the 787 and would be placed instead on Boeing 767 jets.

This is a charming and salutary Japanese custom that we should adopt. I’m waiting for the Jim McNerney apology tour in America. It might go something like this: “To Boeing’s shareholders, customers, vendors and, especially, employees, I’m deeply sorry that we — and I regret to say this includes my predecessor, St. Alan Mulally — attempted to build the world’s most advanced airliner on the cheap, with an untested and reckless outsourcing program that led to repeated delays, finally grounding, and putting the very future of the company at risk. I deeply regret the weak corporate governance that allowed this, and as a result I will give up the title of chairman to an independent director. I will ask all the directors to resign and appoint only those who pass a medical exam that shows they have a spine. I will give up all of my compensation for the past five years and if the 787 isn’t flying flawlessly this year, I will resign as chief executive… “To our employees in the Puget Sound, I owe a special apology. I’m sorry we moved the headquarters to Chicago. The hot dogs are superior, but otherwise the company’s top executives are too far removed from the critical commercial airplane business and from Asia. I’m sorry we made a hash of the outsourcing that you now have to fix. I’m sorry we tried to deflect accountability that rightly rests with management decisions by blaming our unionized workers and set up an assembly in South Carolina to punish and intimidate them…” (bows deeply here toward machinists, engineers and technical workers, whispering reverently, “No nerds, no birds” several times.) “The perfectly legal but morally reprehensible tax dodging? Sorry. We’ll pay our share to the country that has given us everything. I’m also sorry about McDonnell Douglas. I wasn’t around to keep them from using Boeing’s money to take over Boeing, but I could have stopped the McDonnell bean-counter culture from swamping Boeing historic and successful dominance by engineering excellence. Finally, I want to apologize to Jack Welch, whose backside I smooched lo those many years and still didn’t get the top job at GE. Jack, I’m sorry I listened to a word you ever said. Your methods may be good for looting the wealth of corporations and sending it to people who are already rich, but they’re no way to run a great American company. One more thing: I’m sorry to have been hiding in the bunker, following the advice of lawyers and flacks to ‘keep a low profile.’ As events have shown, this is a counterproductive, even stupid, approach. I’m getting paid to be Boeing’s leader and I intend to lead out front, with transparency and accountability starting right now.” It will never happen. If it did, it would shake corporate America to its bones. Who would play McNerney in the movie? George Clooney? Or Bryan Cranston?

Soon after this new investment in TSA uniforms, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano warned Americans that the lines are already lengthening at airports due to the sequester. "We are already seeing the effect on the ports of entry, the big airports for example," Napolitano told Politico on Monday. "Some of them had very long lines this weekend." "Look people, I don't mean to scare, I mean to inform," Napolitiano said."If you're traveling, get to the airport earlier than you otherwise would. There's only so much we can do with personnel and please don't yell at the customs officers, the TSA officers. They aren't responsible for sequester." On Feb. 27, the agency announced that on Feb. 22 it had awarded a one-year contract to VF Imagewear, Inc., which owns the Lee brand and Wrangler Hero, to provide the uniforms. “This contract will address the requirements of the TSA, Office of Security Operations, TSA Uniform Program,” the award states. The TSA employs 50,000 security officers, inspectors, air marshals and managers. That means that the uniform contract will pay the equivalent of $1,000 per TSA employee over the course of the year. This is not the first time VF Imagewear has been commissioned to make TSA uniforms. The company secured a $98 million contract in 2010 that expired on Feb. 17, 2013. The latest contract will run until Feb. 17, 2014, with a one-year optional transitional period. By next year, the DHS hopes to have TSA and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) secure their uniforms with a single combined contract. TSA's new $50-million one-year uniform contract was announced just two days before the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, took effect.

That one-month increase in the debt was nearly six times as much as the $44 billion in spending cuts the Congressional Budget Office estimates will take place in all of fiscal 2013 as a result of sequestration. At the close of business on Jan. 31, 2013, the federal debt was $16,433,791,850,294.04, according to the U.S. Treasury. At the close of business on Feb. 28, 2013, the federal debt was $16,687,289,180,215.37. Thus, the federal debt increased $253,497,329,921.33 during the month. In its Budget and Economic Outlook for Fiscal Years 2013-2023, published in February, the CBO explained that only $44 billion in planned federal spending will be cut during this fiscal year as a result of sequestration. The CBO also says additional cuts that will be “attributable” to fiscal 2013 will actually take place “in later years”—not in fiscal 2013.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362501176477</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 11:32:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362501190810-54</Id><Topic><Title>Obamamarket Breaks Record.

The Muscat-based company is also looking at adding Boeing 737 short-haul aircraft to beef up existing routes to India and within the Middle East as part of a move to extend the overall fleet to 50 planes from the 42 in service or due for delivery. Pearce’s plans amounts to a vote of confidence in the 787, which hasn’t won an order since being grounded on Jan. 16 with battery faults. The purchases, likely to be confirmed in the next few months, would be in addition to six 737-800s and six Dreamliners due to arrive starting late next year and from 2015. “You need a bigger fleet to get the critical mass,” Pearce, CEO for almost 15 months, said in an interview. “With a bigger magnitude you get better profitability, and we’re in an ideal part of the world with plenty of opportunity to keep growing.”</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362509517868</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:51:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362509640150-113</Id><Topic><Title>censored50 = Hittler reincarnated</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1362509023175</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:43:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tell you what uncle Adi if you got a job to go to somewhere then be prepared for the earth to spin out of orbit.

They left open the possibility for that hearing to be rolled into Zimmerman's second degree murder trial. Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch captain in his Florida subdivision, shot and killed the teen, who was visiting a house in the area.

Jim Jordan asked Education Department Deputy Secretary Anthony Miller and Transportation Department Deputy Secretary John Porcari how much money has been spent on travel, conferences and consultants. Jordan was told the departments do not think additional savings can be found when it comes to conference spending and travel for government employees. Jordan's line of questioning included the now infamous 2010 GSA conference in Las Vegas which cost taxpayers $840,000. Last week, the Oversight Committee reviewed report data showing federal agencies held more than 894 lavish conferences last year, costing more than $100,000 each and totaling $340 million for taxpayers. Further, a Committee report released today revealed waste-cleanup recommendations from non-partisan Inspector Generals working across the federal government, which would save taxpayers $67 billion per year, have not been implemented. Backlogs of unimplemented recommendations have grown to 16,906. “This report chronicles $67 billion in unimplemented reforms that non-partisan Inspectors General have identified,” said Committee Chairman Darrell Issa. “President Obama should listen to the recommendations of his Administration’s own Inspector Generals and work with Congress to implement common sense spending cuts that target wasteful and poorly performing programs instead of settling for the furloughs and service disruptions happening under the sequester.” If these non-partisan recommendations from Inspector Generals across the federal government were implemented, 78 percent of the sequester total would be regained.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362513368936</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:56:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362513374399-132</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing stock lags the Dow for the year to date ,netflix went fro 78 to 180 in the past 3 months boeing sucks</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362505348112</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 12:42:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spot on, freeveritas, spot on.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362513374399</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:56:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362513382227-133</Id><Topic><Title>Tomorrow Night is Steak Night at the Petroleum Club</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362511931961</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:32:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who would slop pigs with such delicacies?</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1362513382227</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:56:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362513483640-134</Id><Topic><Title>So, spending gets cut and the Stock Market Takes off</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362512356749</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:39:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't have fire insurance.

Now that another major national electoral contest is in the rearview mirror, it appears that Harry Reid's motley crew is preparing to make good on their magnanimous pledge to actually do their jobs this year. Via a senior Republican source at the Senate Budget Committee: We expect to mark up a Senate Democrat budget next week. We don’t have a date, we don’t know details such as whether Republicans will be allowed to offer amendments, and we don’t yet have any #$%$urance that Chairman Murray will provide Republicans, reporters, and the American people with the text at least 72 hours in advance. But we do expect it to happen next week, and think it’s important that Chairman Murray keep her public commitment to doing a budget this year. More than 1,400 days later, the Senate will finally "get off their #$%$" and engage in the prosaic business of core governance. Whether they'll follow through on this non-derelict behavior throughout the full budget season -- let alone in future years, as voter accountability day draws closer -- remains to be seen. Another budget vacation may soon be in the offing. The White House, meanwhile, has announced it will release Obama's FY 2014 budget in late March, nearly two months past its statutory due date:</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362513974612</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 15:06:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362514032596-140</Id><Topic><Title>Tomorrow Night is Steak Night at the Petroleum Club</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362511931961</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:32:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it was Karl Marx who said, "I wouldn't join any club that would have me for a member."

All the existing fleet of planes have to be upgraded to the new battery solution (if it is approved). All the planes under construction need to be retrofitted also. I have no clue if there are any penalties to be paid to airlines for the disruptions and late deliveries. One would think that this has to be a huge hit to earnings this quarter. Lost revenues, huge extra costs, etc. And not to mention the large decline in defense work that is coming down the pike.

I saw the condition of Zimmerman's head, and then I listened to who the real Trayvon Martin was, his background, and how old and big the kid was. Then I learned the background of who Zimmerman was, how active he was in the community, and how much of his time and effort he gave to benefit Blacks. I would question that Matin was even "visiting" in the neighborhood, but that makes no difference especially given Florida's "Stand your Ground" law. When your head is being beatin into the ground you know your a dead man unless you shoot Martin.

Getting to the store costs more, too. Gas in Corinth, Miss., her hometown, costs $3.51 a gallon now, compared to less than three bucks in 2012. That really hurts, considering her husband's 112-mile daily round-trip commute to his job as a pharmacist. Bruister, a mother of four, received a $1,160 raise this school year at her job as an eighth-grade computer teacher. The extra cash -- about $97 a month, before taxes and other deductions -- isn't enough for her and her husband to keep up with their rising costs, especially after the elimination of the payroll tax break. Its loss shrunk their paychecks by more than $270 a month. "If you look at how much prices are going up, you get in the hole really quick," Bruister said. "It's a constant squeeze." In the wake of the Great Recession, millions of middle-class people are being pinched by stagnating incomes and the increased cost of living. America's median household income has dropped by more than $4,000 since 2000, after adjusting for inflation, and the typical trappings of middle-class life are slipping out of financial reach for many families.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362516446687</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 15:47:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362516486439-154</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmerman's lawyers doing their job.

Regulators may not move so quickly. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which grounded Boeing's high-tech jet nearly seven weeks ago, faces unusually tough obstacles in approving it for flight - one of them brought on by the agency's own boss. The National Transportation Safety Board this week is due to issue an update on its investigation into what caused the battery to overheat and smoke but has indicated it will take longer to get to the bottom of what went wrong. Boeing proposed a fix two weeks ago, but safety experts said approval from the FAA will be difficult as long as what caused the batteries to melt down remains a mystery. In addition, the National Transportation Safety Board has questioned the process the FAA and Boeing used to approve the plane as safe just 18 months ago. "The FAA will need to find a way to communicate that they believe the level of risk has been reduced to a minute level that's acceptable," Aboulafia said. . "The safety of the flying public is our top priority and we won't allow the 787 to return to commercial service until we're confident that any proposed solution has addressed the battery failure risks," agency representative Laura Brown said. COSTLY GROUNDING Airlines are losing money by parking the planes and must lease jets or make other arrangements to fly passengers on flights scheduled months in advance. Goglia, the former NTSB board member, said regulators are facing very close scrutiny of its approval procedures. The NTSB has questioned the process Boeing and the FAA used to certify the plane. Aboulafia estimated that it would take at least four months for the 787 to get cleared to fly if the FAA approves flight tests soon, as Boeing requested. If flight testing takes longer, it could take six to nine months before the 787 is back in the sky. BOEING's SUPERBOX Some safety experts see the FAA eager to stand by Boeing and move quickly - even if politics slows it down some. The agency has a well-established process for vetting plane changes and has called in numerous experts to advise it on lithium-ion technology. Former Department of Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo said the FAA is likely to decide that the fix is "an acceptable risk before the NTSB will." Industry experts, say the inability to pinpoint the cause of the battery failures could make the FAA's job of certifying a solution more difficult, since it requires a fix that can contain the worst problem that can occur without damaging the aircraft. "People will attack this approach," said Weber. "They'll say, 'How do you know that's the worst case?'" Weber speculated that the safety concerns may result in regulators restricting the 787's ability to make long flights over water, a standard known as ETOPS. Such a change would be a severe blow to Boeing and airlines that use the Dreamliner for long-haul direct flights with about 250 passengers, a highly lucrative market that the 787 can serve at 20 percent lower fuel cost than other planes. "If they feel they cannot move aggressively toward restoring three-hour ETOPS they may restrict it to one hour, so the aircraft can land if there is a fire," said Weber. "That destroys the business case for the 787." Boeing in the mean time is buying back their own shares with investors money and releasing already inked deals on other plane to make Boeing sound good , a billion dollar 747 deal is really only a few airplanes and the actual profit after discounts is very small for a company burning up its cash like maybe 5% and that is paid at steps in the build process , not a billion dollars up front. The company stock has trailed the average that is belongs to for years the Dow so not a good investment Boeing is a Dow stock and the Dow average of all 30 stocks is up 10 for a year while Boeing is one of the lagers and after today’s nice run up still only 6% for a year compared to other Dow stocks Home Depot HD is up 48% and Wal mart is up 24% WMT. The failure of Boeing is very clear this stock even with new highs in the averages . So Boeing stock ownerership is a loss it is a lagging stock, it cannot beat an average of 500 or 30 stocks a loser stock for any investor . So compared with 6% for Boeing in a year or .5 of one percent per month, the S and P is up 12% for a year that is 1 % per month double the rate of return for the S and P over Boeing. Less risk more return. These are average for all the 500 Sand P stocks the big winners beat Boeing huge .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362527803742</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 18:56:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362528313152-169</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing’s Conner says 787 fix can ‘move really fast’ before the truth comes out then ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362458384513</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:39:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>did you take your boat to discuss this opinion with Paul allen first or is this something you came up with all on your own wstleeffanms ?

"Over $100 million of planned revenue will have slid from our fiscal 2013," CEO Tim Conver said on a post-earnings conference call. He added that many of these delayed orders will be pushed out into fiscal 2014. Defense companies are bracing for sustained pressure on military budgets under a process called sequestration, or the automatic across-the-board U.S. government spending cuts that began last week. The company said it now expects sales between $230 million and $250 million, down from its previous forecast of $348 million to $370 million. Aerovironment cut its profit forecast to 30-50 cents per share from the $1.41-$1.51 per share range it forecast earlier. Net income for the third quarter fell to $3.9 million, or 17 cents per share, from $5.7 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 34.6 percent to $47.1 million. Monrovia, California-based Aerovironment's shares were trading down 22 percent at $16.93 after the bell.

If some of the more pesimistic timings of 6 to 9 more months are correct that could be 2 to 3 billion. So its not unreasonable that Boeing could have a big drop in eps this year, That's a 25 - 100% drop in EPS.
