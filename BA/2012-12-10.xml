As far as credible source, it seems to me the Seattletimes Newspaper gets money based upon bing credible. Dominic Gates who wrote the article, is a professional reporter who can get into trouble including termination if his story is not accurate or misleading. It sound to me that you have had a least one bad experience with Goforth or you are rain man here. I do not think you are a austic savant, since you seem to express yourself often and display not genious character that I can find. You are a normal engineer , highly educated and experienced so there is something that dynamited you response to the mediator declared a cooling off period and for reasons unknow to me the name Goforth is doing something to your response that is not the usual reply to the mediator put a hold on the negotiations. I used both the mediators name and the SPEEA name given in the Seattletimes article author Dominic Gates and you then attacked both the Seattletimes and the reporter as being not credible. Don , apparently the key to this reply is only keyed by the word Goforth. not SPEEA, Boeing Seattle times or Dominic Gates. So maybe to made the report that there is a cooling off period between the SPEEA organization and Boeing that is what you and I should agree to look at. So I have tap danced all around Goforth for you. I suggest you start a blog on Goforth and list the issues you have with him.

It's known as the USCRN network. Many of the thermometer stations in the USA are cited such that they are influenced by things other than the temperature they are intended to read. The USCRN eliminates the errors found in the older NOAA network and was initiated in order to check the validity of the old network. The old network has required scientists to adjust thermometer temperatures to account for supposed errors and since the year 1900 the old network has been adjusted upward by .6 degreesF from raw data. So In July 2012 for example the older faulty climate network saw an average temperature of 77.6 for July which was the hottest and what you believe. The new network with the newest most accurate thermometers, USCRN, recorded a 75.5 temperature average for the month which was warm but not a record. The USCRN along with the fact that we are not seeing anything close to a record on global basis in 2012 leads me to believe that the old US temperature network is inaccurate and showing spurious warming from urban heat island effects and faulty adjustments.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355126879370</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 03:07:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355127729488-33</Id><Topic><Title>Mediator hits pause button between BA and SPEEA</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355115453594</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 23:57:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>custerisus I might as well post your time and date that you said you would put me on ignor , it was after one of your other harassing comments against the Yahoo message board user agreement "• Re: Re: Re: Boeing airplane order book,political spammers, uni-foul waynedickenson961by waynedickenson961.Oct 16, 2012 3:54 AM.Permalink.Go to topic custerisus, I will count on you putting me on ignor but you seem to be a liar, as you have... custerisus, I will count on you putting me on ignore but you seem to be a liar, as you have said that so many times when will you actually do what you say you will do; and really put me on ignore, and go ahead if you like cheap wine drink it.(plonk) and that must be why you are on the floor drunk and rolling(ROTFLMAO) around laughing, custerisus, that mad dog 20-20 wine you use, better stop adding sugar and grape seeds and putting a cork in it to act like you have any class like Charlie the Tuna.

The USA is not a participant in Kyoto but at Doha it was revealed that only the USA and Germany had reduced their CO2 emissions in 2011. This means that none of the countries that signed on to Kyoto actually reduced emissions from energy use* in 2011. Global emissions jumped up to 38.2GtCo2in 2011. * There are many sources of man made CO2 other than energy and many poor countries emit large amounts of CO2 and other gases from land use change. The UN does not account for these sources in determing who is at fault for emissions. I think they do this because if the truth comes out that poor countries pollute just as much as rich countries, they can't make claims that the rich countries are to blame and therefore they should pay compensation to poor countries. If this ever gets to court and all sources are accouted for, they will find that it hasn't just been rich countries emitting CO2. I recently reviewed the California ARB documents on CO2 emissions in California and found they include the CO2 absorbtion from their forests in determining net CO2 emissions. EIA data in 2012 shows that the USA will lower its CO2 emissions to 5.2Gt and when all forestry, public + private,are factored in the net USA CO2 emission drop to 4.4Gt on a nationwide basis.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355128844146</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 03:40:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355132052601-35</Id><Title>SPEEA UNION said..." there is a very high chance of a strike" with Boeing</Title><Msg>The spokesman for the engineering employees union at Boeing Co. says "there is a very high chance of a strike" in the new year, after suspension of contract talks.

That's why it's so disconcerting to learn that two big factors in President Obama's re-election was his electoral dominance among both unmarried Americans (at an all time high) and the religiously unaffiliated (also growing ever larger). The statistics about single voters are discouraging because marriage (and the formation of the family unit) has been one of the basic building blocks of a vibrant, interconnected society where citizens can depend on stable relationships and relatives as sources of social and economic support, without relying primarily or exclusively on the government. The statistics about religiously unaffiliated voters are disturbing, as well -- not because they are necessarily bad people, but because over time, without some kind of formal religion, there will be no informal but shared common moral code -- and thus, we'll need more laws just to spell out what we all think is "right" and "wrong" . . . and it will be less common for religious principles alone to serve as a curb on antisocial behavior; we'll have to rely on the threat of state punishment to deter it. If people increasingly need the state for support, and they increasingly need the state to enforce even basic behavioral codes, that's a recipe for bigger, more intrusive government and far less freedom. Every honest, thinking person probably knows that encouraging marriage and encouraging some kind of organized religious faith (of whatever denomination) is central to cultivating a healthy, growing society. The problem now, however, is that Democrats know they are prospering politically as a result of the breakdown of marriage and organized religion -- so what's their incentive to try to right the ship?

CAF’s co-director, Robert Borosage, explained the need for such a website, “America’s growing diversity and its increasingly socially liberal attitudes played a big role in this election. But looking back, we are likely to see this as the first of the class warfare elections of our new Gilded Age of extreme inequality. More and more of our elections going forward will feature class warfare ...only this time with the middle class fighting back. And candidates are going to have to be clear about which side they are on. In 2012, candidates who supported the economic interests of the many over the few won their elections. Populism was the voice, but economic opportunity was the message. The pundits may wring their hands, but in the future it won’t be values voters, angry white men or soccer moms that win elections. It will be class war.” The website does not feature a mission statement and is unclear about exactly how the group will go about attempting to wage class warfare. The site explains how Obama’s 2012 campaign utilized class warfare and set the stage for the deployment of such tactics in future elections. “Obama’s campaign built its message on class war battles that broke out in the Republican primary, as challengers sought to bring down ‘the main from Bain,’ Mitt Romney,” notes the site. “In the end, the keys to Obama’s reelection were his calls for raising the taxes of the wealthy and his support for reinvesting those revenues in education and jobs to rebuild the middle class and to protect programs like Medicare from cuts.” The site hails how Obama repeatedly portrayed Romney as a “walking example of the out-of-touch elite, an opponent of the auto industry bailout that saved an entire manufacturing sector, and a 1 percenter who would jeopardize social programs, education, and Medicare in order to cut taxes on his rich friends.” CAF writes that Obama’s reelection now sets the stage “for class warfare as a potent and necessary tool to promote rebuilding the economy from the bottom up, rather than perpetuate the right wing’s failed trickle-down policies.” Occupy, Soros, Democratic Party CAF has partnered with Occupy and is funded by Soros’ Open Society Institute as well as by the Soros-funded Tides Center, which channels funding to hundreds of progressive and far left groups. Tides has been connected to the Occupy movement since its beginning. Another grantee of Tides is Adbusters magazine, which is reported to have come up with the Occupy Wall Street idea after “Arab Spring” protests toppled governments in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. The Adbusters website serves as a central hub for Occupy’s planning. MoveOn org, which has joined Occupy, is funded by Tides. CAF’s board of directors includes MoveOn org President Eli Pariser. CAF’s co-founder and director Roger Hickey, who also co-founded the Soros funded Economic Policy Institute, was reportedly heavily involved in crafting the foundations for President Obama’s health care law. CAF campaigns for universal health care, immigration reform and progressive education initiatives and is deeply tied to progressive politicians from the Democratic Party, many of whom routinely are featured at CAF events. Last year, Nancy Pelosi was the featured speaker at CAF’s “America’s Future Now” conference in Washington, D.C. In 2008, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., was honored at CAF’s annual dinner for her “advocacy in Congress,” noted Discover the Networks. doublehaul32, do you subscribe to this system of class warfare?</Msg><Username>greedyoilbastards</Username><Timestamp>1355160576791</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 12:29:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355162393002-60</Id><Topic><Title>SPEEA UNION said..." there is a very high chance of a strike" with Boeing</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355132052601</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 04:34:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you don't how to design profitable airplanes, then do what you know best, act like the KKK without the white hood and gown and stand around the beer barrel.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1355162393002</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 12:59:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355162555297-61</Id><Title>Your GOP congress is not your friend</Title><Msg>unless you like being thrown over a cliff all because of a 2-4% change in the top tax rate</Msg><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1355162555297</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 13:02:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355162911414-62</Id><Topic><Title>CSU Researchers Say Sandy Wasn’t Influenced By Global Warming</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355066579229</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 10:22:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All the polls are skewed, too.

By legally funneling profits from overseas subsidiaries into Bermuda, which doesn’t have a corporate income tax, Google cut its overall tax rate almost in half. The amount moved to Bermuda is equivalent to about 80 percent of Google’s total pretax profit in 2011. The increase in Google’s revenues routed to Bermuda, disclosed in a Nov. 21 filing by a subsidiary in the Netherlands, could fuel the outrage spreading across Europe and in the U.S. over corporate tax dodging. Governments in France, the U.K., Italy and Australia are probing Google’s tax avoidance as they seek to boost revenue during economic doldrums. Last week, the European Union’s executive body, the European Commission, advised member states to create blacklists of tax havens and adopt anti-abuse rules. Tax evasion and avoidance, which cost the EU 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) a year, are “scandalous” and “an attack on the fundamental principle of fairness,” Algirdas Semeta, the EC’s commissioner for taxation, said at a press conference in Brussels. ‘Deep Embarrassment’ “The tax strategy of Google and other multinationals is a deep embarrassment to governments around Europe,” said Richard Murphy, an accountant and director of Tax Research LLP in Norfolk, England. “The political awareness now being created in the U.K., and to a lesser degree elsewhere in Europe, is: It’s us or them. People understand that if Google doesn’t pay, somebody else has to pay or services get cut.” Google said it complies with all tax rules, and its investment in various European countries helps their economies. In the U.K., “we also employ over 2,000 people, help hundreds of thousands of businesses to grow online, and invest millions supporting new tech businesses in East London,” the Mountain View, California-based company said in a statement. The Internet search giant has avoided billions of dollars in income taxes around the world using a pair of tax shelter strategies known as the Double Irish and Dutch Sandwich, Bloomberg News reported in 2010. The tactics, permitted under tax law in the U.S. and elsewhere, move royalty payments from subsidiaries in Ireland and the Netherlands to a Bermuda unit headquartered in a local law firm. Last year, Google reported a tax rate of just 3.2 percent on the profit it said was earned overseas, even as most of its foreign sales were in European countries with corporate income tax rates ranging from 26 percent to 34 percent.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1355162999433</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 13:09:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355163034029-65</Id><Topic><Title>Why Does McNerney Still have a Job ??????</Title><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1354759132676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 20:58:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Phil started the demise of the Boeing company without question.

I simply asked you the first time fora source ( there being several out on the net for about two days previous ) and why "you" collectively ( or anyone for that matter ) believed Goforth was any kind of spokesperson or leader of the union. The obvious answer has to do with the ASSUMPTION by most people that the Title of ED confers authority and responsibility of some sort. While the average poster here is entitled to such an assumption- the press ( not just GATES) has made the same but wrong assumption for a long time. Even SPEEA members who shoud know better- including the Board roll over as to the 'power' of the ED. Thus like any dictator wannabee - for decades- the SPEEA ED has bullied the board- sandbagged the press- and ripped off the members. For example - the previous ED Mr Boffferding during negotiations in 1999-2000 put out a memo saying in effect it would be useless to strike- and was very much against any such action. This P888 off way too many members and the result is history. In 2005 The same ED sandbagged the Negotiation Team and started to push for total conversion of the pension plan to the Boeing Pension Value Plan ( a cash balance plan with 401k features ). What he and the staff did not say was that said conversion would hose the older employees, benefit the younger, and most importantly give HIM unlimited continuing Boeing credited service towards HIS boeing pension plan. When a few tweaked just to the ho9se the older- a near email riot ensued- and Boffo had to drop the issue.

Nothing I see indicates the economy is getting better. The news papers are still filled of foreclosures and long lists of delinquent personal property taxes and very few job listings. There are more full used car lots than I can ever remember seeing in my lifetime. Nearly all the manufacturers, maybe all of them in my county, in the surrounding counties are gone, closed, nada. Workforce numbers ...Food Stamp numbers ...Nothing says there has been any sign that things are getting better ...Only worse! I read this somewhere else: The Fed realizes the American government is 16 trillion dollars (probably more) in debt.... so what? They also know the government can't and won't pay it down. Therefore, the Fed is going to print money out of thin air in order to continue the illusion of American prosperity. They have to. The alternatives are runs on grocery stores, runs on banks, and general chaos. The media knows this. That's why they broadcast inane, non-thinking TV shows.... so what? Keep the people as brain-dead as possible. Keep them happy until the SHTF.</Msg><Username>greedyoilbastards</Username><Timestamp>1355175942939</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 16:45:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355176436710-94</Id><Topic><Title>Your GOP congress is not your friend</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1355162555297</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 13:02:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The democrats think they won an election: What they've won is the GREATEST DEPRESSION EVER WITH THEIR NAME TAGGED TO IT!</Msg><Username>greedyoilbastards</Username><Timestamp>1355176436710</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 16:53:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355176586257-95</Id><Topic><Title>CSU Researchers Say Sandy Wasn’t Influenced By Global Warming</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355066579229</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 10:22:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unlike polls climate studies are peer reviewed Chris.

Just to get you caught up: "Psy" is a South Korean musical artist whose quirky hit, "Gangnam Style" went mega-viral over the summer. Catchy beat, instantly recognizable horse dance, pudgy foreign star, etc. When Psy was invited to gallop around on stage at this weekend's "Christmas in Washington" concert, some critics dug up lyrics from one of his previous diddies. Far from singing about "sexy ladies," Psy used his "art" to call for the murder of US troops, whose presence at a base on his native penninsula angered him: Kill those f*****g Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives Kill those f*****g Yankees who ordered them to torture Kill their daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law, and fathers Kill them all slowly and painfully After these lyrics came to light, concert organizers were pressured to disinvite Psy from the festivities. The Korean rapper issued a half-assed, quasi-contrite apology, expressing regret over how some people might have "interpreted" his hateful stylings. His invitation remained intact, and the White House confirmed that the First Family would attend the event as planned. They did, and a bedazzled Psy even garnered a presidential handshake.

You need to reference your source for your accusation that the study was funded by the fossil fuel industry. When you look for attribution in and event the challenge is to identify clear delineation between natural contributors and human contributors. The authors are saying that there in no human signal emerging in Sandy and that Sandy was not unprecedented on a historic basis as natural variation was the sole contributor for Sandy. NOAA/ESRL scientists have also suggested that natural variation rather than AGW was the culprit. I am always open to peer reviewed evidence that you can produce showing that Sandy was not a product of natural variation.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355179776232</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 17:49:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355179979292-105</Id><Topic><Title>CSU Researchers Say Sandy Wasn’t Influenced By Global Warming</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355066579229</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 10:22:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And please remember, libdems blamed GW BUSH for Katrina.

"Nobody asked you. Unlike Hostess, Boeing is wildly successful, highly profitable and we don't make Twinkies here. Wanna try again?" well vierzig_nachten, nobody needs to ask you, get it . now let's look at your content, vierzag_nachten, lets analyze it, Boeing is wildly successful, you claim. vierzag_nachten, Does that mean a out sourced Boeing 787 is highly successful and highly profitable too? - the Boeing 787 is 3 years late and 30 billion over cost, is that a example of your "wildly successful" Boeing company? I think not. vierzig_nachten, That does reflect in the BA stock price for the year. Boeing stock price is up 2.97% for the year, is that a wildly successful gain for you then? So, vierzig_nachten, Boeing compared to other stocks in the Dow jones Boeing is wildly a failureif you take a minute to check out your false claim. So Boeing is a failure if you actually compare Boeing to better Dow Jones stocks . For example BAC for the year is up 90% compared to Boeing up under 3% for the year, vierzig_nachten, get it , both are Dow stocks . Another is HD up 49% for the year, JPM is up 27% for the yar. Now especially this stock is important even MMM is up 12% for the year, now that the problem has left . You see vierzig_nachten, now that James McNerney, is no longer the CEO of MMM it is a better company now based upon shareholder value up 12% for the year. But it gets wrose for your false statment about Boeing, so vierzig_nachten , as I have pointed out on coal stocks ,which have been beat down for a long time by market timing even those stocks, for a short term gain today BA was up 1% great for Boeing. But vierzig_nachten, if you wanted to do a day trade and make some real money then coals stocks , as I have pointed out during the election run off went up over 100% in just a few weeks on Romney potential win as he was a coal guy then down on a short gain of over 80% on after election Obama clean energy result. So vierzig_nachten, you are wrong about Boeing it is a terrible stock for a shareholder, it makes no money and other stocks pay better dividends too. So vierzig_nachten, a day traders money maker like ANR up 9.65% today,wlt up 6.05% today JRCC up 4.65% all coal stocks. Tomorrow vierzig_nachten, if you can know how to read a stock chart they move slow it is easy to see the pattern. But Boeing highly successful , that is just a false and misleading statement .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355180606539</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 18:03:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355181672899-108</Id><Title>Global Warming is a Hoax</Title><Msg>Just another lame-brain excuse to tax the producers and make the fat cats like Gore rich without producing anything of value.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1355181672899</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 18:21:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355182036053-109</Id><Topic><Title>CSU Researchers Say Sandy Wasn’t Influenced By Global Warming</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355066579229</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 10:22:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think ExonMobile and Chevron both have openly subscribed to the global warming theory.

Barrett on November 01, 2012 Yes, yes, it’s unsophisticated to blame any given storm on climate change. Men and women in white lab coats tell us—and they’re right—that many factors contribute to each severe weather episode. Climate deniers exploit scientific complexity to avoid any discussion at all. Clarity, however, is not beyond reach. Hurricane Sandy demands it: At least 40 U.S. deaths. Economic losses expected to climb as high as $50 billion. Eight million homes without power. Hundreds of thousands of people evacuated. More than 15,000 flights grounded. Factories, stores, and hospitals shut. Lower Manhattan dark, silent, and underwater. An unscientific survey of the social networking literature on Sandy reveals an illuminating tweet (you read that correctly) from Jonathan Foley, director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota. On Oct. 29, Foley thumbed thusly: “Would this kind of storm happen without climate change? Yes. Fueled by many factors. Is storm stronger because of climate change? Yes.” Eric Pooley, senior vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund (and former deputy editor of Bloomberg Businessweek), offers a baseball analogy: “We can’t say that steroids caused any one home run by Barry Bonds, but steroids sure helped him hit more and hit them farther. Now we have weather on steroids.” It runs three pages and is a good overview of the controversy, and more importantly, the business impact of these storms that need to be addressed.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1355182893937</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 18:41:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355183403221-119</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Takes us Forward!</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1355149182399</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:19:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it's best to stay focused on the percentage of the workforce that is employed, and if Obama starts rearranging those figures, all we should need to look at are how many individual IRS tax filings there are, categorize them and compare them to total population.

Over the past two weeks his government has begun for the first time to recognise the scale of the country’s economic difficulties and to start to do the right thing to deal with them. In particular, in response to increasing alarm about France’s loss of competitiveness, it recently announced €20 billion ($26 billion) of tax breaks for companies to offset the country’s heavy payroll charges." (Isn't this what progressives accuse republicans of doing?) "Yet a fair chunk of its analysis touches home-grown problems that France cannot blame on others. Moody’s identifies two other reasons for its downgrade. First, deteriorating long-run economic prospects due to “the country’s persistent structural economic challenges”: “rigidities in labour and services markets” (high taxes and social contributions; high employment protection legislation), “low levels of innovation”, and a “gradual but sustained loss of competitiveness and the gradual erosion of its export-oriented industrial base”." (How about that. The very things that caused France's problems and a Moody's downgrade, are the same things Obama is selling as the new way forward for the USA. All you can do is laugh at Obama and people who support such lunacy.) "Second, Moody’s points to growing uncertainty about the fiscal outlook. It describes as “overly optimistic” the government’s forecast of GDP growth of 0.8% in 2013 and 2% from 2014. Mounting unemployment, and new tax increases, are likely to dampen consumption further. It anticipates fiscal slippage, and the likely need for more consolidation measures to meet budget-deficit targets." (Moodys economists recognize that the socialist plan will lead to more unemployment and lower productivity hurting France's competetiveness while Obama kool-aid drinkers think that the same plan from Obama is the way forward.) There's more but I think I made the point that Obama's way forward is eerily similar to France's way backwards.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355187227224</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:53:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355187266985-124</Id><Topic><Title>BA's JDAM tail kits to get big order from Israel...</Title><Username>dontgetoutoftheboat</Username><Timestamp>1355186733282</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:45:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's the hold up?</Msg><Username>greedyoilbastards</Username><Timestamp>1355187266985</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:54:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355188737075-125</Id><Topic><Title>Traitors of France</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1355183390416</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 18:49:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HAHAHA You braindead socialists still don't get it?

Next , makhoe, you might suggest that the CEO of Boeing match the demanded SPEEA worker cutback in wage package and benefits with his own cut back. Finally , makhoe, would you remind the CEO of Boeing that since he is working with a professional labor agreement, he should drop that and allow the BOD to terminate him at will without a golden parachute until he agrees to bargain in good faith with the SPEEA union responsible for representing the loyal, hard working and skilled engineers and technicians who were sent all over the world to fix the executive failure outsourcing the 787. Makhoe that 787 program is 3 years late and 30 billion over budget. Unfortunately, makhoe, youdo not see the Boeing bankruptcy comming, just like the MD bankruptcy came, it takes a long time to go out of business when the taxpayer subsidizes aerospace company projects like both MD and Boeing.
