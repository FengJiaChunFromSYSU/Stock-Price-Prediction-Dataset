Iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the United States and international peace and security in the Persian Gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by, among other things, continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability, actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability, and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations. Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-NY, February 5, 2003 2.“[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq’s refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.” — From a letter signed by Joe Lieberman, Dianne Feinstein, Barbara A. Milulski, Tom Daschle, &amp; John Kerry among others on October 9, 1998 3. If we wait for the danger to become clear, it could be too late. Sen. Joseph Biden D-Del., September 4, 2002 4. Senator Hillary Clinton's (Democrat, New York) address to the US Senate while voting YES to authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against Iraq: "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well, effects American security.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1368679775548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 00:49:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368682371524-8</Id><Topic><Title>4500 died</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368647971323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:59:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>was that john Kerry -oh you mean the guy that was decorated three or four times and was wounded as many in the war in nam hmmmmmm course we know that the idiot child of GHW Bush was too good a soldier to have Kerry's combat problems and proved it while he hid out in Alabama during the war</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368682371524</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 01:32:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368682469222-9</Id><Topic><Title>UNHOLY TRINITY: MONSANTO, BIG PHARMACY, NEW WORLD ORDER</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368635901230</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 12:38:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is a lot more wrong with Monsanto than there is right with it.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1368682469222</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 01:34:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368682473988-10</Id><Topic><Title>4500 died</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368647971323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:59:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>blah blah blah blah the stench of the drivel rolling out of the mouth of the infested one is over powering when he trys to justify criminal wars</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368682473988</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 01:34:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368692460086-11</Id><Title>Boeing stock gains value over 3 months !</Title><Msg>however AMD is up for the day, month and 3 months -+2.82% +82.50% +59.27% TSLA is up for the day , month and 3 months-+1.92% +95.94% +120.66% BA up .95% +11% +30% Remember the 787 is the 4 year late, and 30 billion over cost failure made by MD style out sourcing , a failure out of the blocks and Boeing needs twice as many orders as it has to break even if no other failure occurs.

The office's director is an Obama donor, too. The undue logistical hoops through which conservative groups were forced to leap are being document left and right; this one's especially egregious.

The New York Times editorial board has written a scathing response to revelations of secret monitoring, calling it a fishing expedition to intimidate whistleblowers. The Obama administration, which has a chilling zeal for investigating leaks and prosecuting leakers, has failed to offer a credible justification for secretly combing through the phone records of reporters and editors at The Associated Press in what looks like a fishing expedition for sources and an effort to frighten off whistle-blowers. We are not convinced. For more than 30 years, the news media and the government have used a well-honed system to balance the government’s need to pursue criminals or national security breaches with the media’s constitutional right to inform the public. This action against The A.P., as the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press outlined in a letter to Mr. Holder, “calls into question the very integrity” of the administration’s policy toward the press. The records covered 20 phone lines, including main office phones in New York City, Washington, Hartford, and the Congressional press gallery. The guidelines for such subpoenas, first enacted in 1972, require that requests for media information be narrow. The reporters’ committee said this action is so broad that it allowed prosecutors to “plunder two months of news-gathering materials to seek information that might interest them.” The Obama administration has indicted six current and former officials under the Espionage Act, which had previously been used only three times since it was enacted in 1917. One, a former C.I.A. officer, pleaded guilty under another law for revealing the name of an agent who participated in the torture of a terrorist suspect. Meanwhile, President Obama decided not to investigate, much less prosecute, anyone who actually did the torturing. The Justice Department is pursuing at least two major press investigations, including one believed to be focused on David Sanger’s reporting in a book and in The Times on an American-Israeli effort to sabotage Iranian nuclear works. These tactics will not scare us off, or The A.P., but they could reveal sources on other stories and frighten confidential contacts vital to coverage of government. Yesterday during testimony on Capitol Hill, Attorney General Eric Holder refused to comment on this case saying it was an "ongoing investigation" and that he "knows nothing" because he "recused himself early on." The question remainining is, did the Department of Justice only target AP reporters? Or did they secretly monitor reporters and editors from other outets as well?</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368716383884</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 10:59:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368717178343-55</Id><Title>White House’s Benghazi email dump shows critical two-day gap, CIA objection</Title><Msg>The Snow Job Continues The Benghazi-related emails released by the White House late May 15 exclude the critical emails between administration officials that were sent during the crucial first two days after the deadly jihadi attack that killed four Americans last September.

The emails provide further detail about the rewriting of the talking points during a 24-hour period from midday September 14 to midday September 15.

While the first reported instances of extra IRS scrutiny for conservative groups began in Cincinnati in March of 2010, the attacks began to pick up steam on a national level soon after Soros-funded groups began firing off letters to the IRS in October of that year - following the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling. The talking points of these groups then bounced around a carefully created progressive "echo chamber," until they eventually made their way into established media outlets. Key IRS policy changes about how it investigated conservative groups took place soon after it received three separate letters sent by Soros-funded liberal organizations. Several Soros-funded groups including the Campaign Legal Center, Democracy 21, the Center for Public Integrity, Mother Jones and Alternet have worked to pressure the IRS to target conservative nonprofit groups. The subsequent IRS investigation flagged more than 100 tea party-related applications for higher scrutiny, including applications that included the words "Tea Party" and "patriot." The IRS scandal can be traced back to a series of letters that the liberal groups Campaign Legal Center (CLC) and Democracy 21 sent to the IRS back in 2010 and 2011. Both groups were funded by George's Soros's Open Society Foundations. The CLC received $677,000 and Democracy 21 got $365,000 from the Soros-backed foundation, according to the Foundation's 990 tax forms.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368719965455</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:59:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368720035744-67</Id><Title>So how to trade a stock EGLE and,another 787 electrical problem on the 787 on a test flight</Title><Msg>EGLe just made 40% so how to make 40% on a stock in two hours today easy , egle, a coal shipper had a earnings report and did better than expected , yesterday egle closed at a price, way below the open today and so that is a get in signal. at 4.11 I got in then at the peak if you know how to, first, set up, and then read a stock chart it went to at $ 5.93 so I am out in two hours with a 40% gain.

Darrell Issa (R-California). “Scandal, scandal, scandal, and more scandal.” “You have called for investigations to get to the bottom of these scandals,” he added. “But the American thing to do is to quit.” Agreeing that America was suffering from “scandal fatigue,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R.-S. Carolina) said, “If even one of these scandals turns out to be real, it will be bigger than the creation of the universe,” adding that he and his fellow Republican senators were prepared to take turns standing in the well of the Senate chanting the word “scandal” until President Obama steps down. “Rand Paul has personally offered to say the word ‘scandal’ for eleven hours,” he said. On Fox News Channel, host Sean Hannity said that the American people were weary of hearing “nothing but scandal, scandal, scandal,” noting that Fox personalities had used the word “scandal” no fewer than thirty thousand times in the past four days. “The only way President Obama can bring these scandals to a satisfying resolution is by resigning from office. Otherwise, he’s subjecting the American people to the ugly spectacle of scandal upon scandal upon scandal,” he said, adding, “Upon scandal.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368720225035</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:03:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368720229583-72</Id><Topic><Title>EMAILS CONTRADICT WH CLAIMS</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368718042589</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:27:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wrong.

The CBS News report, citing anonymous sources, said that Tsarnaev used a pen to write the message on an interior wall of the boat, where police found him bleeding from gunshot wounds four days after the April 15 bombing. The note summed up with the idea that "when you attack one Muslim, you attack all Muslims," CBS News reported. CBS News did not make clear how its sources knew the information and Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the report. A spokeswoman for the FBI in Boston, Katherine Gulotta, declined to confirm or deny the report. The CBS News report said Tsarnaev, 19, described his older brother and fellow suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who died in a gunbattle with police, as "a martyr." "Basically, the note says ... the bombings were retribution for the U.S. crimes against Muslims in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and that the victims of the Boston bombing were 'collateral damage,' the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world," said CBS News reporter John Miller, who is a former spokesman for the FBI.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368720370359</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:06:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368720401717-77</Id><Topic><Title>Why is the "Most Transparent Administration in History Stonewalling?</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368717378283</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:16:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You channel dead men?

Split Over Whether to Waste Time Investigating Benghazi or Repealing Obamacare WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—A deep divide has emerged within the Republican Party over whether to waste Congress’s time investigating Benghazi talking points or repealing Obamacare, G.O.P. lawmakers confirmed today. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia), sounded the first discordant note at a press briefing this morning, telling reporters, “The time for wasting day after day investigating Benghazi is over. The American people are counting us to waste our time repealing Obamacare yet again.” Warning that “the American people don’t have an endless appetite for meaningless political theater,” Cantor added, “If we’re going to do something that’s purely symbolic, pointless, and detached from reality, I say it should be repealing Obamacare for the thirtieth or fortieth time.” Rep. Cantor’s comments drew a strong rebuke from Darrell Issa (R-California), who has spearheaded the investigation into Benghazi: “Quite frankly, we have all the time in the world to blow repealing Obamacare. The moment to waste our time investigating Benghazi is now.” Noting that previous attempts to repeal Obamacare had cost the taxpayers approximately fifty million dollars, Issa said, “I think we’re entitled to spend at least that much, if not more, investigating Benghazi again and again and again.” But even as the debate raged over whether Obamacare or Benghazi was more worthy of Congress’ wasted time, House Speaker John Boehner offered a third point of view: “Personally, I think the time we’re wasting on Benghazi and Obamacare could be better spent blocking progress on guns and immigration.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368723396882</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:56:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368723509864-95</Id><Topic><Title>Blaming Muslims for the Boston Bombing</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368720370359</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:06:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>are you talking about the white mu slim connection ? and how does a half dead teen have time to pen a confession - with a sharpie he just happened carry in his suicide vest ?</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368723509864</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:58:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368723625731-96</Id><Topic><Title>Hows that Benghazi scandal thing working for you GOP Toads</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368718896588</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:41:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How's corruption working out for you commie pinkos?

"I can assure you I certainly did not know anything about the IG report before it was leaked to the press," Obama said after being specifically asked to assure the American people that nobody in the White House had any knowledge of IRS targeting. "I promise you this, the moment I found out about it my focus has been to get it fixed. " President Obama went on to explain that when something in government is broken, it is his job to fix it. Yesterday Obama directed Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to handle holding people accountable for the IRS case. "The IRS may not have had enough guidance about what they were doing," Obama said after suggesting new laws are needed to prevent inappropriate targeting from happening again.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368730121257</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 14:48:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368730293065-117</Id><Title>Every effort to repeal Obamacare...</Title><Msg>... will cost Republicans a vote... so Go ahead Make my Day !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368730293065</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 14:51:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368730647674-118</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Fails to Deny White House Knew About IRS Targeting</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368730121257</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 14:48:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"failed to deny" ?

Obama continues to stand by Holder with full faith and confidence but liberal radio host Bill Press is calling for Holder to be fired. Press — a former California Democratic Party chairman who headlines a liberal radio show simulcast on Current TV — on Wednesday told his Twitter followers that Holder needs to be removed in the wake of the AP story. “I have no confidence in Eric Holder anymore, and you shouldn’t either,” Press wrote. “This AP story from the Justice Dept is too far-reaching. Seizing these phone records is a violation of freedom of the press. FIRE Holder.” On Thursday, Press renewed his call for Holder’s dismissal, writing, “I still haven’t heard a legit justification for the subpoenaing the AP phone records. They didn’t notify AP, they didn’t narrow search.” “What ‘breach of national security’ are we talking about re the AP story? It’s BS and Holder should be fired,” Press tweeted. “For people who say that Holder was ‘just doing his job,’ he didn’t ‘do his job’ by going after Cheney or Bush. He left THAT alone!” As a reminder, nearly 200 members of the House have no confidence in Holder and he was voted in contempt of Congress by both Republicans and Democrats in June 2012. The vote to hold Holder in contempt was supported by the majority of Americans according to a CNN poll.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368730672749</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 14:57:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368730683677-120</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is better than all Republicans Combined !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368719489012</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:51:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You know so much about gay clubs...</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1368730683677</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 14:58:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368730777574-121</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is better than all Republicans Combined !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368719489012</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:51:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're gedtting overexposure.

The law authorizes the IRS to share confidential taxpayer information with the Department of Health and Human Services for the purpose of determining those subsidies." "In addition, the IRS will keep track of even the smallest changes in Americans' financial condition. Did you get a raise recently? You'll need to notify the IRS; it might affect your subsidy status. Have your hours been reduced at work? Notify the IRS. Change jobs? Same." Those fears have been ongoing since Obamacare was first rammed through. Financial worries and concern over loss of property, along with the stress of a "new normal" sluggish economy have been at the top of the list of most thinking Americans. Knowing what we are truly facing in a fiscal sense has dominated our lives, but the real fear that this IRS scandal raises is whether the "confidential taxpayer information" that IRS and HHS will be sharing will include political information. If the IRS can flag your information and slow things down on something like tax-exempt status, can they do it when determining our use of health care? Clearly, the possibility is there. If you consider that the IRS can, while threatening financial penalties, force you to give them information that they will share with your political enemies and HHS, who could very well be the ultimate decision maker on whether or not you or your mother gets a life-saving procedure, well, that is fear, my friend. The way that the IPAB or "death panel" works is that if Medicare costs get too high, it triggers a 15 member panel of political appointees who will recommend what gets cut. If the panel doesn't do its job, Sebelius makes the recommendation and sends it to Congress. The whole thing is set up, on its face, as a bipartisan attempt to control costs in healthcare, because isn't that why the ACA was needed in the first place? Healthcare is just so darned expensive. The real target of the IPAB is end of life care, intensive care, life support, and quality of life management. We all remember Obama's reply to Jane Sturm when she questioned him about a pacemaker for her 100 year old mother. He said: "I don't think that we can make judgments based on people's 'spirit.' That would be a pretty subjective decision to be making. I think we have to have rules that say that we are going to provide good quality care for all people. End-of-life care is one of the most difficult sets of decisions that we're going to have to make. But understand that those decisions are already being made in one way or another. If they're not being made under Medicare and Medicaid, they're being made by private insurers. At least we can let doctors know - and your mom know - that you know what, maybe this isn't going to help. Maybe you're better off not having the surgery, but taking the painkiller." Obama has targeted the tea party in speeches and at fundraising events, and in doing so, apparently set policy for the IRS. The answer to Jane Sturm sets HHS policy, doesn't it? But here is the other side of that IRS coin: let's say that the IPAB determines that all pacemakers are outlawed over 75, and someone well-connected politically to the ruling party wants their mom to receive one. It's not a leap to understand that she'll get a waiver and your conservative mother will get a pill.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368733430713</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:43:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368733605276-138</Id><Title>Is the Kent Raven Defending Obama's Corruption and Lying?</Title><Msg>.....Of course he is......that's what he likes most about Democrats.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368733605276</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:46:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368733654987-139</Id><Title>Hillary Clinton fired for lies, unethical behavior</Title><Msg>Politics: Watergate-era Judiciary chief of staff: Hillary Clinton fired for lies, unethical behavior Published by: Dan Calabrese on Wednesday January 23rd, 2013 Dan Calabrese As Hillary Clinton came under increasing scrutiny for her story about facing sniper fire in Bosnia, one question that arose was whether she has engaged in a pattern of lying. The now-retired general counsel and chief of staff of the House Judiciary Committee, who supervised Hillary when she worked on the Watergate investigation, says Hillary’s history of lies and unethical behavior goes back farther – and goes much deeper – than anyone realizes. Jerry Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, supervised the work of 27-year-old Hillary Rodham on the committee. Hillary got a job working on the investigation at the behest of her former law professor, Burke Marshall, who was also Sen. Ted Kennedy’s chief counsel in the Chappaquiddick affair. When the investigation was over, Zeifman fired Hillary from the committee staff and refused to give her a letter of recommendation – one of only three people who earned that dubious distinction in Zeifman’s 17-year career. (Obviously a great judge of character) Why? “Because she was a liar,” Zeifman said in an interview last week. “She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality.” How could a 27-year-old House staff member do all that? She couldn’t do it by herself, but Zeifman said she was one of several individuals – including Marshall, special counsel John Doar and senior associate special counsel (and future Clinton White House Counsel) Bernard Nussbaum – who engaged in a seemingly implausible scheme to deny Richard Nixon the right to counsel during the investigation.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368733654987</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:47:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368733671480-140</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary Clinton fired for lies, unethical behavior</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368733654987</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:47:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would they want to do that? Because, according to Zeifman, they feared putting Watergate break-in mastermind E. Howard Hunt on the stand to be cross-examined by counsel to the president. Hunt, Zeifman said, had the goods on nefarious activities in the Kennedy Administration that would have made Watergate look like a day at the beach – including Kennedy’s purported complicity in the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro. The actions of Hillary and her cohorts went directly against the judgment of top Democrats, up to and including then-House Majority Leader Tip O’Neill, that Nixon clearly had the right to counsel. Zeifman says that Hillary, along with Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar, was determined to gain enough votes on the Judiciary Committee to change House rules and deny counsel to Nixon. And in order to pull this off, Zeifman says Hillary wrote a fraudulent legal brief, and confiscated public documents to hide her deception. The brief involved precedent for representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding. When Hillary endeavored to write a legal brief arguing there is no right to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding, Zeifman says, he told Hillary about the case of Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who faced an impeachment attempt in 1970. “As soon as the impeachment resolutions were introduced by (then-House Minority Leader Gerald) Ford, and they were referred to the House Judiciary Committee, the first thing Douglas did was hire himself a lawyer,” Zeifman said. The Judiciary Committee allowed Douglas to keep counsel, thus establishing the precedent. Zeifman says he told Hillary that all the documents establishing this fact were in the Judiciary Committee’s public files. So what did Hillary do? “Hillary then removed all the Douglas files to the offices where she was located, which at that time was secured and inaccessible to the public,” Zeifman said. Hillary then proceeded to write a legal brief arguing there was no precedent for the right to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding – as if the Douglas case had never occurred. The brief was so fraudulent and ridiculous, Zeifman believes Hillary would have been disbarred if she had submitted it to a judge. Zeifman says that if Hillary, Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar had succeeded, members of the House Judiciary Committee would have also been denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, and denied the opportunity to even participate in the drafting of articles of impeachment against Nixon. Of course, Nixon’s resignation rendered the entire issue moot, ending Hillary’s career on the Judiciary Committee staff in a most undistinguished manner. Zeifman says he was urged by top committee members to keep a diary of everything that was happening. He did so, and still has the diary if anyone wants to check the veracity of his story. Certainly, he could not have known in 1974 that diary entries about a young lawyer named Hillary Rodham would be of interest to anyone 34 years later. But they show that the pattern of lies, deceit, fabrications and unethical behavior was established long ago – long before the Bosnia lie, and indeed, even before cattle futures, Travelgate and Whitewater – for the woman who is still asking us to make her president of the United States.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368733671480</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:47:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368733747811-141</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Exemplifies Fears of Our Founding Fathers</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368722173628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:36:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's a really stupid thing to say.

President Obama and his Justice Department have no problems with national security leaks so long as they make Obama look good. i.e. the Osama bin Laden raid. For the past week, outrage has been expressed from Democrats and Republicans over the DOJ secretly monitoring the personal and work phones of Associated Press reporters. The monitoring was prompted by a national security leak. Speaking about the monitoring earlier this week, Attorney General Eric Holder made it a point to stress how "serious" of a leak this was. "It's in the top two or three most serious leaks I've ever seen," Holder said. But now, the Washington Post is reporting that the administration planned to brag about the very case that prompted the DOJ to secretly monitor the AP after reporters wrote about the case. For five days, reporters at the Associated Press had been sitting on a big scoop about a foiled al-Qaeda plot at the request of CIA officials. Then, in a hastily scheduled Monday morning meeting, the journalists were asked by agency officials to hold off on publishing the story for just one more day. The CIA officials, who had initially cited national security concerns in an attempt to delay publication, no longer had those worries, according to individuals familiar with the exchange. Instead, the Obama administration was planning to announce the successful counterterrorism operation that Tuesday. AP balked and proceeded to publish that Monday afternoon. Its May 2012 report is now at the center of a controversial and broad seizure of phone records of AP reporters’ home, office and cellphone lines. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the unauthorized disclosure about an intelligence operation to stop al-Qaeda from detonating explosives aboard a U.S. airliner was among the most serious leaks he could remember, and justified secretly obtaining records from a handful of reporters and editors over a span of two months. Now, some members of Congress and media advocates are questioning why the administration viewed the leak that led to the May 7 AP story as so grave. The president’s top counterterrorism adviser at the time, John O. Brennan, had appeared on “Good Morning America” the following day to trumpet the successful operation. He said that because of the work of U.S. intelligence, the plot did not pose an active threat to the American public. Basically, Holder's DOJ monitored AP phones because the administration was upset Obama couldn't brag about the bust before anyone else.

Dionne, Jr. WASHINGTON—“What if the government starts enforcing the espionage statute whenever there’s a leak?” Steve Roberts, a former New York Times journalist who teaches at George Washington University, observed to the Baltimore Sun. “It’s going to have a tremendously chilling effect on this interplay between sources and reporters.” But Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) insisted that stopping leaks should be a very high priority. “When national security secrets leak and become public knowledge,” he wrote in a letter to the president, “our people and our national interests are jeopardized. And when our enemies know our secrets, American lives are threatened.” As it happens, these two quotations are separated by seven years. Roberts was speaking in 2005 about the furor over Dana Priest’s important story in The Washington Post revealing that the CIA was maintaining a series of “black sites” abroad where terrorism detainees were interrogated. For this, Priest came under searing attack from allies of the George W. Bush administration. Smith’s letter was sent to President Obama in 2012. It complained about national security leaks that set off the very investigation which this week prompted fury over the Justice Department’s seizure of two months’ worth of telephone records from a group of Associated Press reporters. Isn’t it odd that many Republicans who demanded a thorough investigation a year ago are now condemning the Justice Department for doing what they asked for? Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus even called on Attorney General Eric Holder to resign, saying he had “trampled on the First Amendment.” Advertisement It’s a funny thing about media leaks: They are either courageous or outrageous, depending on whether they help or hurt your political party. Forgive me for feeling cynical and depressed about our nation’s political conversation. Scandalmania is distorting our discussion of three different issues, sweeping them into one big narrative—everything is a “narrative” these days—about the beleaguered second-term presidency of Barack Obama. What’s being buried under a story line? On leaks, I don’t believe that the media have unlimited immunity. But I am very pro-leak because such disclosures are often the only way citizens in a free society can find out things they need to know. The Justice Department’s actions in the AP case seem to go way beyond what is justified or necessary. There was no need to ignore guidelines suggesting that news organizations should usually have the chance to negotiate or challenge subpoenas. Holder recused himself from the case, and the White House, which is, in effect, a subject of the investigation, can plausibly claim it was unaware of the decision. Nonetheless, liberals have reason to contest the Obama administration on civil liberties questions. What’s entertaining is to watch so many Republicans (let’s exempt the consistent libertarians) reverse a decade of hard-line positions on national security matters and speak now as if they were card-carrying members of the American Civil Liberties Union. Then there is the IRS’s targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny in applications for 501(c)(4) status. Of course this was wrong—and stupid. Liberals were incensed when the IRS questioned the tax status of several progressive groups during the Bush administration. The IRS needs to be ultra-scrupulous about political neutrality, period. That’s why Obama came out late Wednesday to announce a shake-up at the agency. But the other scandal—as The Washington Post’s Ezra Klein and Ruth Marcus and MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell have all suggested—is that any groups involved in partisan electioneering are being granted standing as “social welfare” organizations, allowing them to hide the identity of their donors. A bad mistake could compound the IRS’s timidity on the 501(c)(4) issue. And finally, Benghazi, the “scandal” that seems to be all smoke and no gun. The House could have spent its energy trying to figure out what led to this tragedy, why diplomats were in such a dangerous place and how to protect brave Foreign Service officers in the future. Congress could even have asked itself whether it’s providing enough money for the task. But focusing on the narrow concern of who did what to a set of talking points (and bloviating about this episode as a new “Watergate”) takes what could be a legitimate inquiry and turns it into a political carnival. I know, I know: This “confluence” of “scandals” spells “trouble” for the Obama administration. Well, sure, this has been hell week for the president. But what spells trouble for our country is our apparent eagerness to avoid debate about discrete problems by sacrificing the particulars and the facts to the idol of political narrative. It’s a false god.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368750389013</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 20:26:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368750617779-180</Id><Topic><Title>Thing Were so Much Better When we had an Intelligent President like Gorge Bush</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1368748613204</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 19:56:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mir was saving that e just incase someone called you a asshol.</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1368750617779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 20:30:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368751014630-181</Id><Title>Voters trust Clinton over GOP on Benghazi</Title><Msg>Voters trust Clinton over GOP on Benghazi PPP's newest national poll finds that Republicans aren't getting much traction with their focus on Benghazi over the last week. Voters trust Hillary Clinton over Congressional Republicans on the issue of Benghazi by a 49/39 margin and Clinton's +8 net favorability rating at 52/44 is identical to what it was on our last national poll in late March. Meanwhile Congressional Republicans remain very unpopular with a 36/57 favorability rating. Voters think Congress should be more focused on other major issues right now rather than Benghazi. By a 56/38 margin they say passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill is more important than continuing to focus on Benghazi, and by a 52/43 spread they think passing a bill requiring background checks for all gun sales should be a higher priority. While voters overall may think Congress' focus should be elsewhere there's no doubt about how mad Republicans are about Benghazi. 41% say they consider this to be the biggest political scandal in American history to only 43% who disagree with that sentiment. Only 10% of Democrats and 20% of independents share that feeling. Republicans think by a 74/19 margin than Benghazi is a worse political scandal than Watergate, by a 74/12 margin that it's worse than Teapot Dome, and by a 70/20 margin that it's worse than Iran Contra. One interesting thing about the voters who think Benghazi is the biggest political scandal in American history is that 39% of them don't actually know where it is. 10% think it's in Egypt, 9% in Iran, 6% in Cuba, 5% in Syria, 4% in Iraq, and 1% each in North Korea and Liberia with 4% not willing to venture a guess. At any rate what we're finding about last week's Benghazi focus so far is that Republicans couldn't be much madder about it, voters overall think Congress should be focused on other key issues, and Hillary Clinton's poll numbers aren't declining on account of it.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368751014630</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 20:36:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368751088814-182</Id><Topic><Title>Thing Were so Much Better When we had an Intelligent President like Gorge Bush</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1368748613204</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 19:56:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, don't get angry.

But it wasn’t the one that Republicans set out to find. By John #$%$erson|Posted Thursday - Slate - May 16, 2013, at 12:54 PM The White House Benghazi emails show little evidence of a concerted effort to cover up what happened in Libya last September I was told there was going to be a cover-up. After reading the 100 pages of emails related to the Benghazi media talking points, I’m hard-pressed to find evidence for the most damning accusations against the president and his staff. If they were involved, they were once again leading from behind. The most incendiary charge aimed at the president is that, in order to insulate himself in an election year, he and his team made up a fake story about a "spontaneous uprising" in Benghazi and downplayed intelligence that it could have been a premeditated attack by known terrorist organizations. There has been so much spinning from the president and his staff in the aftermath of the attack, this storyline seems possible—when the public spin is this bad it is easy to imagine deeper rot. The emails help your imagination along. They destroy the impression left last November by White House spokesman Jay Carney that only a single word was changed in the process, which can get your adrenaline up. But when you pull on the thread in search of evidence for the Big Story, your heartbeat slows. The emails show a lot of CIA and State Department action, but comparatively little White House meddling, and certainly nothing near the level of meddling that would be required to put in the big fix. One of the challenges of figuring out what's a cover-up, what's a lie, and what's just spin in this Benghazi drama is that this entire discussion is about media talking points. Talking points produced to guide members of Congress in their conversations with the media are not the product of sodium pentothal. They are created to put the best face on an event and to coordinate spin so that everyone in the administration, campaign, or party caucus has the story straight. That means if you don't see bureaucratic #$%$-covering and efforts to make the interesting appear bland, you're not reading talking points. So, for example, when House Speaker John Boehner and President Obama have a contentious meeting, their aides agree on talking points in which they tell the media the two men had a "frank exchange." Not a lie, but not an expletive-laden transcript either. In this case, the talking points were being created on the fly as information was coming in about the attack and an investigation was underway. So, in addition to the normal m#$%$aging of language, there was a good deal of imprecision, too. Given that context, what do the emails tell us about the Obama election-season cover-up story? First there is the matter of the "spontaneous demonstration" that ignited the violence. The president’s critics contend that the Obama team put United Nations Amb#$%$ador Susan Rice on the Sunday talk shows to promote a false story about a link between the violence in Benghazi and the demonstrations in Cairo over an anti-Islamic video. If this were true, it would indeed make the whole business a cover-up. Talking points may not be suitable for stone tablets, but you're not supposed to actually lie. But the one thing that is consistent throughout the talking-point editing process is the very first sentence of the CIA #$%$essment: "The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Emb#$%$y in Cairo." Advertisement There is no mention of a video in the talking points, which Rice brought up on television that Sunday, but the video was the pretext for the Cairo protests. (You may remember that before the State Department was covering its behind about the Benghazi attack, it was doing so over the Cairo emb#$%$y apology for the video.) In 1992, if you'd talked about the riots in Los Angeles it would have been reasonable to refer to them as the riots that were based on the Rodney King video. Let’s not fixate too much on the video, though. It's less important to the cover-up narrative than the idea that the attack was a spontaneous event. What administration critics find risible about the reliance on the video is the thinking behind it: that this level of violence could ever be considered spontaneous. Fair point, but that's a problem with the CIA's first #$%$essment, not evidence that supports a White House cover-up. The cover-up story relies on the premise that Obama administration officials pushed the idea of spontaneity in order to obscure the fact that they had missed warnings of planned terrorist attack. It's plausible that someone was pushing that story for parochial reasons in these email exchanges. Perhaps the CIA put that idea in its first #$%$essment and kept it there in every subsequent version to cover for its failure to stay on top of the al-Qaida affiliates in Benghazi, even though there was a CIA outpost there. It's also obvious that the State Department wanted to shift blame away from its failure to protect its people in Benghazi. But there's no evidence in the emails that the idea of spontaneity was initiated by anyone #$%$ociated with Obama, the White House, or the president's wider political fortunes. Did Obama benefit from the spontaneity narrative? Yes. But to embrace intelligence from your CIA that is favorable to you—when you have no reason to doubt your intelligence service—is not the same as making up a false story. It’s not even a sin. Next we come to the claim that the president and his team removed the references to al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations as well as references to prior warnings about terrorist activity. If this were the case, you would expect to see some effort by the White House voices in the email traffic toward this goal. It’s not there. The opposite is the case. In the initial round of emails, one CIA official reports that the White House signed off right away on the full initial CIA #$%$essment. "The White House cleared quickly, but State has major concerns," reads an email that a CIA official sent to CIA director David Petraeus. So rather than being the authors of the bowdlerizing effort, the White House was just fine with the fully caffeinated version that mentions Ansar al-Sharia, al-Qaida, and that the CIA had produced numerous warnings about extremists in Benghazi. White House aides reviewed the talking points, made no substantive changes, and moved them along. When the language does eventually change in the talking points, it is clear that it is at the behest of State Department officials, not anyone in the White House. When Obama’s aides do come on stage, it’s pretty far in the background. One State Department official writes, "Talked to [NSC spokesman] Tommy [Vietor], we can make edits.” This is hardly the vision of a campaign-obsessed Obama operation pushing a storyline. There have been some sloppy Nixon analogies thrown around this week, so let's remind ourselves for a moment of what a real cover-up sounds like. "I don't give a #$%$ what happens,” President Nixon was recorded saying. “I want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up or anything else if it'll save it—save the plan. That's the whole point. … We're going to protect our people, if we can." Aides to Republicans pushing for additional investigations concede that the leaked emails don’t show much White House involvement. That takes the heat off of Obama and puts it on Hillary Clinton—who was always an ancillary target of the Benghazi inquest. In congressional testimony, Secretary of State Clinton said, “It was an intelligence product,” referring to the talking points and adding later that the “intelligence community was the principal decider about what went into talking points.” That doesn’t stand up now that we can see how thoroughly the State Department was reworking the language. The original talking points authored by the CIA were wrong about the spontaneity of the uprising, but they substantiated the idea that there was a broader terrorist threat on the ground. The final product that informed Susan Rice's talk show appearances was both wrong and bland. What's clear from the email exchanges is that the State Department insisted on the changes for a mix of #$%$-covering and self-defense reasons. Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokesperson, didn't want to give Congressional critics talking points that could be used against the State Department. That would no doubt please her former boss, Vice President #$%$ Cheney, who had a very stingy view about what Congress had a right to hear when it came to national security matters. Cheney was among those this week pushing the idea that the president concocted the story of a spontaneous riot to protect his election chances. That the CIA analysts fed the president intelligence that turned out to be imprecise would no doubt be insufficient for the former vice president, though Cheney had a similar experience. He cites the CIA as the source of his long-held incorrect view that Iraq played a role in the 9/11 attacks. (If he weren't on the other side of the ideological divide, perhaps he and the president could commiserate over how hard it is to get a story straight.) Just because there's no real evidence of the grand White House conspiracy doesn't absolve the president of responsibility for the underlying failures and the shoddy efforts to explain the whole affair. From his first remarks in the Rose Garden, to the exchanges in the debates with Mitt Romney, to the present day, the president has been shading and back-dating what he said shortly after the attack to make it seem like he was aware it was a planned attack when at the time he was encouraging the view that it was a spontaneous one. That's spin and it's lame, but it's a present-day failing unconnected with White House actions last fall. So the president and his aides are guilty—guilty of doing a bad and misleading job of explaining why there was no cover-up. But that’s not the smoking gun Republicans set out to find.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1368755500383</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:51:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368755628626-193</Id><Topic><Title>The trouble with hooze is he doesn't get enough oxygen.......</Title><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1368753502382</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:18:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An impartial 3rd party observer would question why somebody like you has this continuous preoccupation with somebody else's private parts (on a Yahoo stock bulletin board).
