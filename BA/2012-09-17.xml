The Yahoo financial message board is to compare notes and not to advertise for Boeing. I have given you information comparing a bad stock Boeing to a good stock Apple and yes I have had both stocks and you can tell I do not like the share price of Boeing compared to apple and I am swing trading BAC and I was swing trading BONT until a week ago and I watch stocks and charts and the overall stock market, I am ready for this week and have four stocks on my short list to make a swing trade on now. i will start looking now and then tomorrow morning by checking the overseas market and then the averages and various index funds I watch to predict what the stock market will be doing I like certain commodity based stocks, some bank stocks and always love apple , Boeing is not a buy or a short it is a dead cat bounce stock. my opinion is the company will be bankrupt in 5 years if the 777X and the 737Max has the same problems as the 747-8 and the 787, china will have their 737 buster going in 5 years and EADS and their new military side if the deal is made will kill off Boeing which has massive debt on the 787 and will not make a dime on the 767 tanker on a fixed cost basis. The spare parts will make money for the vendors not Boeing. Simply put Boeing is mis managed and since Frank when he said he would bury airbus and sold 747-400 at a loss to compete with a heavily subsidized company, the entire management of Boeing has be incompetent. They took a company that had killed MD off with their outsourcing model and Phil purchased a bankrupt MD and then with Phil and harry, now Boeing is being run into the ground the same way MD was lost. An expert employed by Boeing said the same thing years ago, he was laughed at, You need to learn which companies make money and go with them Boeing makes 5.7% net Apple makes 26.97 net and it had been going up on margins of profit, and the debt of apple zero and billions in the bank Boeing has probably 30-40 billion in debt on the 787 alone, that is the facts not the bash. Get with it simomaximo, nice try indeed. a definition of insande behavior it to continue to do the same activity that does not work, saying nice try and basher does not change the fact that apple has made any shareholder 1777 % more than Boeing sicne James took over in 2005 and my opinon is apple with make another 1777% for shareholders going forward for 7 more years , why because unlike MSFT apple has not split their shares.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347856664344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 00:37:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347857142792-2</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing stock price goes down while the stock market goes up ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347656942743</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:09:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your theory on recent does not explain that BA was a 65 dollar stock 7 years agoe and is a 71 dollar stock now and at no time in the seven years while apple went from 35 to 691 did Boeing hist 85 dollars or stay at 80 for more than 4 days but has been at mid 50 dollar range many times so it is not recent problems but continual basis problems mainly the outsoucing on the 787 which has const the shareholders about 20 to 30 extra billion dollars so the plane will never break even and my be cancelled if a problem like the engine causes a grounding and the 747-8 is 2 years late and 2 billion over budget so at 5.75 net and 2000 million to break even at 350 million per palne with a 20 million net it takes 100 of the 110 on order if delivered on time without a penailty for late edlivery to break even not considering more problems like the GE engine. AS to comparing apple products to the dreamliner I am apple products make 26 % profit and have very little risk, apple just won a billion lawsuit against a copycat and their latest phone is compatible with the largest Chiense phone company if tha ttakes off in China them apple stock wil jump unlike Boeing stock if the GE engine is a major setback.

Here are the facts lets look first at the 747-8, Boeing shareholders, here is a reason your stock has gone down 3% this year. The 747 has 111 orders, if none are cancelled, the Boeing “key statistics” shows a profit margin of 5.71% the 747-8 is 2 billion(2000 million) over budget and 2 years late (meaning the full 5.71% profit margin is less due to late delivery charges which will lower the shareholders stock price. The 747-8, a new plane, two years late to market, is priced at 350 million @5.71% full profit margin that would be a net of 20 million profit per delivered plane , if on time with no rework. So . taking the 2 billion over budget so far to develop the 747-8( , that is 2000 million) and dividing by the profit of 20 million per plane at maximum profit, well that means it will take 100 planes delivered for the the 747-8 model if they were sold on time and without any rework and no discount for large plane orders just to break even! So the latest China delivery and those 111 other ordered 747-8 planes will not cover the costs to date. So thanks for the update on the 111 orders from the user who thinks building 747-8 on a late and over budget basis will mean nothing to the Boeing shareholders except no more money in stock price valuation.. You need to read up on the 787 it is a fact that each plane delivered costs the Boeing shareholder millions in late delivery fees, jus t Google it, your wrong but hey now you know ! The 787 is 4 years late and 20 to 30 billion in cost over runs with only a fraction of the planes on order to break even and that is if they werew actually on time and with no other problems so that plane will at best not be cancelled adn most likely bankrupt Boeing within 5 years have a good day , think about a stock that has no debt billions in the bank and makes over 26% profit like apple eh !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347858315294</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 01:05:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347858752070-6</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing stock price goes down while the stock market goes up ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347656942743</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:09:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dell, no one, and I mean no one, has any interest in your crappola.

Several major polls showed similar results, including a New York Times/CBS News poll released September 14, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released September 13, an ABC News/Washington Post poll September 11, and several statewide polls in key battleground states like Florida and Ohio. The New York Times/CBS News polls found Obama with a 49 percent to 46 percent lead over Romney among “likely voters” and a 51 to 43 percent lead among registered voters. Obama’s approval rating also stood at 51 percent, the first time Obama had topped the 50 percent mark in more than a year. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll found that Obama had significant leads, above the margin of error, in Ohio, Virginia and Florida, three of the nine states identified by both Democratic and Republican strategists as the “battlegrounds” in the Electoral College. The Wall Street Journal—whose editorial line is adamantly pro-Romney—noted in its analysis of the poll results, “Mr. Obama’s support as a candidate is at or near 50 percent in all three states, suggesting that Mr. Romney must peel off voters who now support the president to win.” The ABC News/Washington Post poll found Obama with a 50 percent to 44 percent lead among registered voters, although his margin was only 49 percent to 48 percent among likely voters. Similar figures were reported over the weekend of September 8-9 by Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos and the Republican-leaning Rasmussen Reports, all suggesting that favorable press coverage of the Democratic National Convention had boosted Obama’s poll numbers.</Msg><Username>dexter.bernanke</Username><Timestamp>1347884258853</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 08:17:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347885704192-14</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Obama and the Democrats lie so much?</Title><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1347843880221</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 21:04:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To be a Democrat you have the mentality of a hypocritical lying thief and think it's OK to take money from people who earned it and give it to people who didn't earn it.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1347885704192</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 08:41:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347886280334-15</Id><Topic><Title>Clintons speech actually hurt Obama</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1347742799253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:59:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually I am.......bright enough to know that 1992 is 20 yrs ago from present day.

The plane-maker, which doesn't disclose detailed investment costs, took $2.04 billion in charges as postponements pushed back the jet's debut by two years before the cargo version entered service in 2011. So the cost of development is more like 8 billion and only 110 planes on order that leaves 300 more 747-8 to be ordered and delivered to break even .only 110 have been ordered to date.

Boeing, , this is not a stock to risk your valuable shareholder money, Boeing , well it is losing money and the net profit is 5.7% but with a real problem in controlling expected cost.

The Wall Street Journal—whose editorial line is adamantly pro-Romney—noted in its analysis of the poll results, “Mr. Obama’s support as a candidate is at or near 50 percent in all three states, suggesting that Mr. Romney must peel off voters who now support the president to win.” The ABC News/Washington Post poll found Obama with a 50 percent to 44 percent lead among registered voters, although his margin was only 49 percent to 48 percent among likely voters. Similar figures were reported over the weekend of September 8-9 by Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos and the Republican-leaning Rasmussen Reports, all suggesting that favorable press coverage of the Democratic National Convention had boosted Obama’s poll numbers.</Msg><Username>dexter.bernanke</Username><Timestamp>1347893751377</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 10:55:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347894193250-29</Id><Title>Socialist Democrats Eating Themselves....</Title><Msg>CHICAGO TEACHERS STRIKE ENTERS 2ND WEEK BY SOPHIA TAREEN AND TAMMY WEBBER ASSOCIATED PRESS AP Photo/Sitthixay Ditthavong US VIDEO BUY AP PHOTO REPRINTS CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is turning to the courts to try to put an end to a teachers strike that's entering its second week and has left parents scrambling to make alternative child care arrangements for at least two more days. The union and school leaders seemed headed toward a resolution at the end of last week, saying they were optimistic students in the nation's third-largest school district would be back in class by Monday. But teachers uncomfortable with a tentative contract offer decided Sunday to remain on strike, saying they needed more time to review a complicated proposal. Emanuel fired back, saying he told city attorneys to seek a court order forcing Chicago Teachers Union members back into the classroom. The strike is the first for the city's teachers in 25 years and has kept 350,000 students out of class, leaving parents to make other plans.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1347894193250</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:03:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347894572581-30</Id><Topic><Title>Obumma behind in most accurate polls</Title><Username>tminusten</Username><Timestamp>1347892620297</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 10:37:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>RE: RASMUSSEN POLLS IS OWN BY CARL ROVE BROTHER BOO,,,you Moore-on</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1347894572581</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:09:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347894630431-31</Id><Title>Obama Caught Lying Again...

Jamal Mabrouk, a member of the February 17th Brigade, told CNN that he and a battalion commander had a meeting about the economy and security. He said they told the diplomats that the security situation wasn't good for international business. "The situation is frightening, it scares us," Mabrouk said they told the U.S. officials.

Four percent (4%) prefer some other candidate, and four percent (4%) are undecided. See daily tracking history. Eighty-five percent (85%) of conservatives support Romney, and 91% of liberals plan to vote for Obama. As they have throughout the campaign, voters under 40 tend to prefer the president, while their elders favor Romney. When “leaners” are included, the race is tied with both Obama and Romney at 48%. Leaners are those who are initially uncommitted to the two leading candidates but lean towards one of them when asked a follow-up question. Voters are fairly evenly divided as to which candidate they trust more to handle events in the Middle East: 48% say Obama, 45% Romney. Unaffiliated voters have a slight preference for Romney. By an overwhelming 72% to 15% margin, voters believe it is more important to guarantee freedom of speech rather than making sure nothing is done to offend other nations and cultures. Half (51%) think it’s likely the government of Libya was involved in the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and other Americans.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1347900576070</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 12:49:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347900822667-53</Id><Title>Obama Caught Lying Again About the Murder of Our Ambassador</Title><Msg>Obama administration, Libyan president clash over explanation on consulate strike Published September 17, 2012 Was deadly attack in Libya 'spontaneous' or planned? Did US policy or anti-Muslim film spark Mideast... The Obama administration is doubling down on its theory that the attack a week ago on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was a "spontaneous" act, despite the Libyan president calling that idea "preposterous." The sharply divergent views on what led to the deadly strike in eastern Libya played out across the airwaves Sunday and are sure to generate more questions this week. In two interviews over the weekend, Libyan President Mohammed el-Megarif joined other members of his government in declaring the attack a planned assault, possibly by an Al Qaeda-tied group. "The idea that this criminal and cowardly act was a spontaneous protest that just spun out of control is completely unfounded and preposterous," Megarif told NPR. But U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, in a string of interviews, stood by the administration's position that the Libya attack was just part of the wave of protests over the anti-Islam video circulating on the Internet. "What sparked the violence was a very hateful video on the Internet," Rice said on "Fox News Sunday." "It was a reaction to a video that had nothing to do with the United States." She also repeated the administration's message that the attacks, which started Tuesday in Egypt and spread to more the 20 U.S. posts in the region, were "spontaneous," not planned or timed for the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. "The best information and the best assessment we have today is that this was not a pre-planned, pre-meditated attack," Rice also told Fox News. "What happened initially was that it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired in Cairo as a consequence of the video. People gathered outside the embassy and then it grew very violent. And those with extremist ties joined the fray and came with heavy weapons, which unfortunately are quite common in post-revolutionary Libya, and that then spun out of control." It was a message that Rice would recite nearly verbatim on the other network shows.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1347900822667</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 12:53:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347900823739-54</Id><Topic><Title>Uh-oh, Ryan Runs Into The Truth</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_001</Username><Timestamp>1347898012571</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 12:06:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>imaccom what is the name for that alternate reality world you live in?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1347900823739</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 12:53:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347900874680-55</Id><Title>Layoffs big numbers</Title><Msg>Layoffs big numbers</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1347900874680</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 12:54:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347901487389-56</Id><Title>Oct 1 layoffs</Title><Msg>Oct 1 layoffs</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1347901487389</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 13:04:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347901491343-57</Id><Topic><Title>Obama 332, Romney 206</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_001</Username><Timestamp>1347901314280</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 13:01:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But, What Counts is What Will it be in November in Election Day...

Following a $50 billion bailout in 2009, the U.S. taxpayers now own almost 27% of the company. But the newspaper said GM executives are now chafing at that, saying it hurts the company's reputation and its ability to attract top talent due to pay restrictions. Earlier this year, GM GM -1.16% presented a plan to repurchase 200 million of the 500 million shares the U.S. holds with the balance being sold via a public offering.

It predicts Romney winning the electoral college by a 320-218 margin and winning 52.9 percent of the popular vote when only the two major parties’ candidates are considered, the Associated Press reported Thursday.

Brisbane Times: A mob of Indonesian Islamists waving jihad flags attacked the US embassy yesterday, throwing rocks and bricks, but they were repelled by tear gas and riot police. About 500 people from a number of radical groups were protesting against the movie The Innocence of Muslims by calling for the arrest and death penalty for the movie’s director Sam Bacile and the Florida preacher Terry Jones who had planned to show the film. Shouting ”Allahu Akbar” and ”F— America,” the mob, many of whom were masked, marched on the embassy and began to attack. Riot police were initially caught unprepared and without their shields. Volleys of rocks and bricks, broken from the pavement, rained on the police and embassy guards. Local television stations were also reporting that petrol bombs were thrown. One guard was separated from the building and pursued by a mob. It appeared he was eventually caught by a large group of protesters and surrounded, though it is not known what happened to him. A police officer was carried from the scene by his comrades, with reports variously suggesting he had been hit by a rock or stabbed in the face.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1347905399987</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 14:09:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347905499805-76</Id><Topic><Title>General Motors Wants to Distance Itself from Obama</Title><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1347901704602</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 13:08:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GM and the Treasury department knocked down the Journal’s story, calling it mere speculation and saying there have been no such discussions recently.

Boeing sold customers 747-8 and 787 airplanes late and with defects to begin with so the customers negotiated a lower initial price. Now since the cost of inspection is being done by the customer and the plane is new, the customer will, per the contract go back to Boeing first or GE and demand compensation, per the sales contract. Just like Boeing has been paying 20 to 30 billion over budget, to fix all the subcontractor problems on the 787, have you not learned this by now, no matter what, zosimomaximo, Boeing pays. If Boeing pays then as I told you already with a comparison of Apple stock price to Boeing, your stock value goes down. I told you this today and yesterday, and yes all new products like a plane or a car come with a warrantee, and the plane is guaranteed to work for as much as 30 to 50 years on the 787 with proper maintenance, but this airplane and engine failure is almost immediate so you can count on the cost to be underwritten by the Boeing shareholder. So the Boeing shareholder stock value over time will not go up and most likely will at best, stay in dead cat bounce or worse go down! So Boeing shareholders will and to a lesser degree GE shareholders both be holding the bag. And as I told you this does affect BA stock price, example today Boeing is down about 1.9% while apple is up again and par for the course up 1.24% on a general down day in the stock market. A strong stock goes up in a down day like Apple, get it yet? . If you would listen and learn, you should know by now that the saying is "don't fight the Fed" that means the Fed is with QE4 basically insuring that the overall stock market will be going up, but only for a good stock all you have to do is pick a good stock, if you can't or will not then you are not going to participate in the rally, all you have to do is buy apple or any other money making stock , you cannot make money on Boeing that should be obvious to you after 7 years of nothing while apple went up 1777 percent . But then I can lead you to water, but you have be able and willing to drink don’t you! eh !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347912674427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 16:11:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347912956344-95</Id><Title>We need an Economic Report from Harrycaul</Title><Msg>Ne need to know what Obama screwed up today.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1347912956344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 16:15:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347912968947-96</Id><Topic><Title>The Obama News Meadia is in Disarray</Title><Username>tomfranklin96753</Username><Timestamp>1347909945927</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 15:25:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then after the election the trials will start!

As fatigue had clearly not been a factor in the fractures and crack, the NTSB report suggested that what had happened was "environmentally assisted cracking," caused by galvanic corrosion in a moist environment. Shortly after the NTSB released its recommendations, General Electric released a statement, concurring with the NTSB, pledging further cooperation and noting a new preventive measure. "As a result of findings to date, GE has introduced changes in the production process that address environmentally assisted cracking, including changes to the dry-film coating applied to the mid-shaft, as well as changes to the coating lubricant used when the retaining nut is clamped to the mid-shaft," the statement said. Hans Weber, a California aviation consultant who has advised the FAA on jet-engine inspection procedures, said he is surprised such a defect could have eluded testing at GE, which he described as "the world's most experienced jet-engine maker." "This sort of thing happens, but it is unexpected. To have a shaft fail is very unexpected," Weber said. "The shafts are made of high-strength steel, and [GE] likely developed what they thought was a better type of high-strength steel. And it's biting them." Weber said the NTSB-recommended inspection regime is likely not the end game here. "This looks like something where they have to replace the shaft, and in the meantime, the NTSB takes the classic approach that you have to inspect them," he said. According to GE, 10 GEnx-1B engines and 108 GEnx-2B engines have been delivered to customers. Weber said all of those engines might have to come off their respective 787s and 747s to be outfitted with new fan midshafts. He said GE will also have to look at any other parts of its engine with the same metallurgy as they could be vulnerable to cracks, too. "Those questions are there and are being addressed there's no doubt about it," he said. "If they see a problem with metallurgy, that's a systemic problem."</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1347916195278</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 17:09:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347916360461-105</Id><Topic><Title>How Braindisfuntional Do You Have to Be to Support Obama?</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1347912313766</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 16:05:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DRAMA QUEEN, that's marxblunder!
