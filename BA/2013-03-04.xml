In 1986 Phil Condit, was appointed Executive Vice President of Commercial Airplane Operations and then, in 1989, took over general management of the new airplane division. In 1990, representatives of eight airlines from around the world began regular "working together" meetings with Boeing. Under Condit's leadership, design/build teams of customers, suppliers, and employees designed the 777. They used a computer-aided design system that fit parts together in cyberspace before any metal was cut. Their work earned the Collier Trophy in 1995 for the year's greatest achievement in aeronautics and astronautics in America. Allan Mulally, worked on the 777 program first as director of engineering and, from September 1992, as vice-president and general manager reporting to Phil Condit , his boss. . I was there and loaned to the first build teams as a expert and training team member. The first 3 airplanes were designated WA 1-2-3 planes for United I was loaned in as key team member in the build process of the first 3, 777 airplanes . Both men took time out to meet me and shake my hand and to personally thank me for my help !

So for the two ignorant users , sheelshearer48( that sounds like your real occupation and loftndude2000 and yes you are dude as in old west a dandy or a dude read on "Philip Murray Condit has a confession. The man who will take over tomorrow as chief executive of The Boeing Co. plays host to presidents, dines with kings and huddles with the captains of global industry. But when he enters his company's cavernous assembly plants to talk to the workers who build Boeing airplanes, Condit said he often feels shy. "I get this feeling deep in my stomach," he said, "and don't know what to say." The feeling doesn't last long because Condit, Boeing's president, has a reputation for being one of the most approachable and easy-to-talk-with executives on the planet. And he makes a habit of doing just that - on production lines, in offices, anywhere. He's just plain friendly. It works both ways, too. He also is known by colleagues as an aggressive listener, hearing all sides before making a decision. "As a boss, he makes you feel you can participate," said Alan Mulally, who worked with Condit on the 777 and now is a senior vice president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. Mulally calls Condit a mentor for all at Boeing. "He's a champion for everybody. If you want to be a team player, you can count on Phil being there." Neil Standal, who also worked closely with Condit on the 777, said, "He's a great idea person and is willing to try different ways."

" Boeing terminated Mr. Sears on November 24, 2003 as the result of corruption allegations relating to the improper hiring of Darleen Druyun For his part in the Darleen Druyun scandal, Mr. Sears was sentenced to four months in prison, a $250,000 fine, and 200 hours of community service. I had to shake Mulally's hand and Condit, as they both cornered me as I was working, they snuck up on me . they knew who I was as the company keeps record on their top performaers and moves them to the programs that need the most skilled help ususally new programs like when the 747-400 was 12000 jobs down I was there too. I was working and could not hide from them . Mulally noticed my Venice Beach T- shirt and asked if I had lived in California, I said no, I buy these shirts at value villiage . On my pay I can not afford to buy new shirts and work on the airplane, if I damage a value village shirt it is a 50 cent loss. Condit cornered me twice and just had to shake my hand, once on a stariway on the 777 and the other time on the 737 line, the guy was sneaky, He got me as I was coming down and stopped me to visit. Once more I was working and did not see him coming. I did block his entrance into a new Cadillac on display at the Seattle new car show, each time he tried to get in the car I was moving to the same door and trying it. My work partner was with me and started laughed as Condit walked away, and told me i was really having fun with the CEO. I said I did not notice him and it was an accident . But I took about twice as much of his time from him as he took from me to interrupt my work at Boeing. His job was to make sure the airplanes were engineered right , my job after they tossed the engineering over the wall was to make it fit and work. That is a lot harder than the design, try to make a 787 work impossible so far</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362382256332</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 02:30:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362382895458-6</Id><Topic><Title>Why was the 777 such a great success?</Title><Username>defense_junky</Username><Timestamp>1362275149784</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 20:45:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wayne, you took the bait.

Mr. Sears also received a $250,000 fine and two years probation, after previously pleading guilty to a single count of aiding and abetting illegal employment negotiations. Ms. Druyun, who also pleaded guiltyJudge Gerald Lee, during a hearing at U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia, said Mr. Sears's sentence reflects the impact his offense had on the government and taxpayers. Under federal sentencing guidelines, Mr. Sears was eligible for a maximum sentence of six months. Speaking at the hearing, Mr. Sears apologized for what he described as an impulsive decision to pursue Ms. Druyun in October 2002 even though she hadn't removed herself from authority over Boeing contracts. "I take full responsibility for this bad decision on the 17th of October. I know what I did was wrong and I'm truly sorry for that error," Mr. Sears said. Boeing has been angling to avoid facing a corporate charge in the case, but culpability on the part of Mr. Sears, one of Boeing's top executives, doesn't help its caseAt a press conference Friday, U.S. Attorney Paul McNulty said Boeing remains under investigation regarding the procurement scandal, but declined to give details of the investigation or discuss the possibility of a settlement with the company. However, he acknowledged the government could choose to try to recover taxpayer money spent on the Druyun investigation. " Meanwhile, Boeing's lawyers want to hammer out a comprehensive agreement covering the myriad civil, criminal and administrative investigations pending against the company. Those include a separate, two-year grand-jury investigation in Los Angeles targeting Boeing for improper acquisition of thousands of pages of proprietary Lockheed Martin documents. In a setback for Boeing, the General Accountability Office on Friday said it was sustaining a protest by Lockheed over a Druyun-tainted contract that Boeing won to build small-diameter bombs. The GAO recommended that the Air Force hold a competition for any additional orders.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362387803273</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 04:03:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362395810749-22</Id><Title>787 will fly in 2015 if ever.</Title><Msg>The plane is disaster.</Msg><Username>food_stamp_nation</Username><Timestamp>1362395810749</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 06:16:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362401625466-23</Id><Topic><Title>787 faces extensive tests to return to air, FAA chief says</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362073547586</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:45:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) is done all the time on components such as this.

Are they finally prepared to challenge the President’s untruthful assertions on facts that are crucial to understanding policy? None other than NBC’s David Gregory today pressed Obama’s chief economic advisor, Gene Sperling, whether his boss told the truth in the third presidential debate that “the sequester is not something that I’ve proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed.” Sperling finally wilted under the pressure of tough questioning to admit that “yes, in fact, the sequestration was President Obama’s plan.” ___________________________________________ A man that has clearly lied his way into the presidency will soon pay the price of his deceit. He needs to apologize for lying and misleading people to cover for his inept handling of fiscal matters and he needs to make an attempt at trying to be a real president and start working toward real solutions and stop demagoguing.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362406502471</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 09:15:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362406722863-30</Id><Topic><Title>Ann Romney Does What Conservatives Do Best</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362404665944</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 08:44:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go away, moron, and don't come back.

Swiss voters voiced their anger at perceived corporate greed Sunday by approving a plan to boost shareholders' say on executive pay. Some 67.9 per cent of voters backed the "Rip-Off Initiative," with 32.1 per cent against, according to the official count broadcast by Swiss public television station SRF. The outcome of the referendum was considered a foregone conclusion after opinion polls in recent months showed strong public support for the initiative. News last month that the outgoing board chairman of Swiss drug maker Novartis AG, Daniel Vasella, was to receive a leaving package worth 72 million Swiss francs ($77 million) further fired up public sentiment against "fat cat" bosses. Vasella later said he would forego the deal, but by that time the incident had dashed opponents' hopes of stopping the initiative. "Today's vote is the result of widespread unease among the population at the exorbitant remuneration of certain company bosses," Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga told a news conference in the capital Bern hours after polls closed. Swiss lawmakers will now have to draft a law giving shareholders the right to hold a binding vote on all compensation for company executives and directors. The law will also ban "golden hellos" and "goodbyes" — one-off bonuses that senior managers sometimes receive when joining or leaving a company. It also promotes greater corporate transparency, for example by requiring that all loans to executives be declared and forcing pension funds to tell their members how they voted at shareholder meetings. The measure targets all Swiss-based companies as long as their shares are publicly traded. Breaching the rules could lead to a fine of up to six annual salaries and up to three years in prison. "It's a powerful signal," said Thomas Minder, an independent lawmaker and businessman who was one of the main forces behind the Rip-Off Initiative. Opponents conceded that their efforts to warn voters of the possible risks to the Swiss economy had failed. "We will respect the will of the people," said Pascal Gentinetta, chairman of the powerful business lobby group economiesuisse. But Christa Markwalder, a lawmaker with the pro-business Free Democratic Party, said foreign firms could now think twice about moving their headquarters to Switzerland. In recent years the country has attracted firms such as oil rig owner Transocean Ltd., fire and safety company Tyco International Ltd., and bakery conglomerate Aryzta AG thanks to its comparatively low taxes and light-touch regulation. In Europe, some other countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark already have similar legislation allowing shareholders at least a binding vote on executive compensation. But in the U.S. and Britain such "say-on-pay" votes are non-binding. The Swiss decision comes on the heels of a European Union decision this week to cap bankers' bonuses at one year's base salary except in the case of overwhelming shareholder approval. The idea that shareholders should have a strong say in their company's affairs chimes with Switzerland's tradition of direct democracy. Voters in the country who collect 100,000 signatures can force a binding referendum on any issue.</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1362412462364</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:54:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362412622196-51</Id><Topic><Title>Maobowa defunds Military</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362407600374</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 09:33:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>kinda like the one i received, only worse, i really didn't know better but i was suspicious of the #$%$ they were trying to pump into my head in the 70s. the key to (commie) success, is getting to the li'l ones before they know better, why do you think maobowa won't give those DC city kids school choice. federal taxpayers spend in excess of 25K per kid for their child abuse / indoctrination / dependence factories.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362412622196</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:57:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362412773256-52</Id><Topic><Title>BA CEO Buying Shares!</Title><Username>tasha_cook</Username><Timestamp>1361981972208</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 11:19:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>cindydugas57</Username><Timestamp>1362412773256</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:59:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362413086794-53</Id><Topic><Title>Record number of billionaires - and the Mediocre Class....well......</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362408145942</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 09:42:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the race is on to be the first trillionaire and you are still in last place and to think msnbc featured warren buffett this a.m. not, you</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1362413086794</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:04:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362413292734-54</Id><Title>Occupier takes another day off....no sequester excuse req'd</Title><Msg>oops, sorry looks like he's holding a pretend cabinet meeting / scheming session after lunch.... 9:30 AM The President receives the Presidential Daily Briefing 10:15 AM The Vice President delivers remarks at the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) 2013 Policy Conference 10:15 AM The President makes a personnel announcement 12:00 PM Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney 1:00 PM The President holds a Cabinet Meeting; the Vice President also attends</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362413292734</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:08:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362413499709-55</Id><Topic><Title>BA CEO Buying Shares!</Title><Username>tasha_cook</Username><Timestamp>1361981972208</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 11:19:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good work, thanks.</Msg><Username>haynesrobert78</Username><Timestamp>1362413499709</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:11:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362413521288-56</Id><Topic><Title>Record number of billionaires - and the Mediocre Class....well......</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362408145942</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 09:42:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the black mariah, err contard, psychotic gay pedophile is onboard to represent dem progressives / parasites</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362413521288</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:12:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362413839414-57</Id><Topic><Title>Record number of billionaires - and the Mediocre Class....well......</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362408145942</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 09:42:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And under a fascist regime like we have now there are a number of billionaires created by sucking off of the hard work of others via crony capitalism.

The Straussian neo-conned Repubes must be checked, and re-checked at every stroke of the provebial hockey-puck in the hockey-game of polical and real lifr. Leo Strauss Grandfather Of Both The Neocons And The Age Of Tyranny. Leo Strauss is the father of the NeoConservative movement, including many leaders of the current administration. Indeed, some of the main neocon players were students of Strauss at the University of Chicago, where he taught philosophy for many years. Strauss, born in Germany, was an admirer of #$%$ philosophers and of Machiavelli. (So was Michael Ledeen.) He rejected this view of natural rights in favor of Plato’s “philosopher-king” model of government. The students of Leo Strauss left the University in search of political power; these took root in the Republican Party, formed neo-conservatism and became known as Neocons. These see themselves as “philosopher kings”. Straussians assign dignity to the few, and see weakness and corruption among the Many. "Following Machiavelli, he maintained that if no external threat exists then one has to be manufactured." (quote is by one of Strauss' main biographers) "Perpetual war, not perpetual peace, is what Straussians believe in." (Ledeen says the same thing.) The superiority of the “ruling philosophers” is an intellectual superiority and not a moral one. Straussian teaching holds that those who are fit to rule realize there is neither morality nor any God. There is only one Natural Right – the right of the superior to rule over the inferior. Human beings are born neither free nor equal. The natural human condition is not one of freedom, but of subordination. Followers of Leo Strauss favor strict accountability for others, but reject accountability for themselves, as do many tyrants, but Straussians suggest that as a philosophy and a"natural order" , so they don't have to call it tyranny. Moreover, Strauss said: "Only a great fool would call the new political science diabolic . . . Nevertheless one may say of it that it fiddles while Rome burns. It is excused by two facts: it does not know that it fiddles, and it does not know that Rome burns." So Strauss seems to have advocated governments letting terrorizing catastrophes happen on one's own soil to one's own people -- of #$%$" on one's own people, to use his Gulliver's travel analogy. And he advocates that government's should pretend that they did not know about such acts of mayhem: to intentionally "not know" that Rome is burning. He advocates messing with one's own people in order to save them from some "catastrophe" (perhaps to justify military efforts to monopolize middle eastern oil to keep it away from an increasingly-powerful China?). Worshipping is a characteristic of the Age of Tyranny. Leo Strauss taught that the Elite Few are to "ennoble" the Vulgar Many. Straussians must exercise their right to rule: "philosopher kings" are to extinguish rabble fire, ennoble the Vulgar Many, and to fight unending war to protect the homeland If the Few were to give the Many, such things as freedom, happiness, and prosperity, in Strauss's estimation, this would turn them into animals. The goal of the wise is to ennoble the vulgar. But what could possibly ennoble us vulgar ones? Enforced self-sacrifice, via permanent war. Only weeping, worshipping, and sacrificing ennobles the many. If you're already Noble, you don't have to bother going to war, you can be a Noble Chickenhawk Philosopher-King. Leo Strauss taught that an elite, wise ruling class must rule the unsophisticated masses by telling them noble lies for their own good. Leaders must use religion to control the masses. Plato on steroids. Although Strauss plainly espoused the utility of religious belief, there is some question of his views on its truth. In some quarters the opinion has been that, whatever his views on the utility of faith, he was personally an atheist. “Because mankind is intrinsically wicked, he has to be governed,” Strauss wrote. “Such governance can only be established, however, when men are united - and they can only be united against other people.” Leaders must always provide an enemy. "We need a common enemy to unite us" - Condoleezza Rice, March 2000 Neocon papers are thick with delusional paranoia like the following from Richard Perle, National Security Council and Defense Policy Board: “No stages, this is total war. We are fighting a variety of enemies. There are lots of them out there. All this talk about first we are going to do Afghanistan, then we will do Iraq . . . this is entirely the wrong way to go about it. If we just let our vision of the world go forth, and we embrace it entirely and we don't try to piece together clever diplomacy, but just wage a total war . . . our children will sing great songs about us years from now.” Michael Ledeen, American Enterprise Institute Fellow, former NSC, State, and Defense Department consultant and influential White House advisor writes, “We can lead by the force of high moral example ... [but] fear is much more reliable, and lasts longer. Once we show that we are capable of dealing out terrible punishment to our enemies, our power will be far greater.

That is just too funny and spot on! The poster in the front window of Collectable Arms &amp; Ammo has a picture of President Obama with the title as Firearms Salesman of the year and two AK-47rifles below his picture. In another poster next to this one features pictures of Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin and Mao Zedong with a statement that reads “All Experts Agree, Gun Control Works”. I like these guys! The co-owner of the store makes no apologies and says, “We like to have the creative storefronts which are sort of fun in one aspect and in another aspect if we have an opportunity to make a statement we’ll do that as well”. He made sure to explain that he has made no effort to connect President Obama to the multiple dictators shown in the other poster. He says he chose the picture of Obama to thank him for making the sales of guns skyrocket after all of the gun control debate in Washington. Although there have been many complaints from the town’s residents, it is clear the store is not breaking any town ordinances. What we can all agree on is that this store has taken the opportunity to voice their first amendment rights to free speech. Additionally, we know that gun sales shot through the roof after all of the talk in Washington about trying to reduce the number of guns throughout the country. So I guess the store had it right, thanks President Obama for being such a great help to the gun industry over the last several months!</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362419390786</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:49:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362419457923-101</Id><Title>Dem Yahoo Fascists</Title><Msg>won't allow me to post perspective on quantity of current wealth verse quantity current obligations dem fascists are tools for the dumbocrat, i mean communist, party</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362419457923</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:50:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362419540206-102</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes 500 Rich List Acquiring BA Shares!</Title><Username>james.tingle</Username><Timestamp>1362414215788</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:23:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awesome report !</Msg><Username>ann.lacoste</Username><Timestamp>1362419540206</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:52:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362419936652-103</Id><Title>Media: Actually, This White House Threatens Us All The Time</Title><Msg>But they know deep down that President Obama still loves them, and that it was kind of even their fault anyway. The New York Post's Maureen Callahan chronicles the abusive and intimidating tactics the current administration employs against the press: This administration is more skilled and disciplined than any other in controlling the narrative, using social media to circumnavigate the press. On the flip side, our YouTube culture means even the slightest gaffe can be devastating, and so you have an army of aides and staffers helicoptering over reporters. Finally, this week, reporters are pushing back. Even Jonathan Alter — who frequently appears on the Obama-friendly MSNBC — came forward to say he, too, had been treated horribly by the administration for writing something they didn’t like. “There is a kind of threatening tone that, from time to time — not all the time — comes out of these guys,” Alter said this week. During the 2008 campaign swing through Berlin, Alter said that future White House press secretary Robert Gibbs disinvited him from a dinner between Obama and the press corps over it. “I was told ‘Don’t come,’ in a fairly abusive e-mail,” he said. “[It] made what Gene Sperling wrote [to Woodward] look like patty-cake.” “I had a young reporter asking tough, important questions of an Obama Cabinet secretary,” says one DC veteran. “She was doing her job, and they were trying to bully her. In an e-mail, they called her the vilest names — #$%$, c--t, #$%$.” He complained and was told the matter would be investigated: “They were hemming and hawing, saying, ‘We’ll look into it.’ Nothing happened.” He wound up confronting the author of the e-mail directly. “I said, ‘From now on, every e-mail you send this reporter will be on the record, and you will be speaking on behalf of the president of the United States.’ That shut it down.” One correspondent says that when he inquired about a staging choice for the president’s speech, he was steamrolled. “There was one specific White House aide calling me up, yelling and screaming,” he says. “It was condescending and abrasive: ‘Why is this a story? Why are you doing this? This is of no consequence. You’re making a mountain out of a molehill.’” This went on for two days. “All I wanted,” says the reporter, “was an answer to a question. It’s not like I was looking to do a 12-page exposé to take down an aide. It was unnecessary vociferousness.” He eventually got his statement. Another White House correspondent says that last week’s blowup over pool reporters’ access to the president’s golf game with Tiger Woods — which was none — is indicative of a larger problem. “Today’s a perfect example,” he says. “Jack Lew is sworn in” — as US Treasury secretary, on Thursday — “and they didn’t even allow a photographer in there. A reporter asked [press secretary] Jay Carney why, and his answer was, ‘It’s a family ceremony.’ No! This is a high-ranking government official whose salary is paid for by taxpayers. No.” “This administration has tools to reach people on their own,” CBS White House correspondent Bill Plante said this week. “They don’t need us as much. And to the extent that they’re able to do that, they’re undercutting the First Amendment, which guarantees a free press through many voices. If they put out their own material, it’s state-run media.” So Team Obama isn't averse to punishing even overtly friendly media figures who step out of line, and the president who pushed a "war on women" meme in his re-election campaign employs high-level advisors who call female journalists the C-word for asking inconvenient questions. Hope and change. National Journal's Ron Fournier wrote last week about an escalating series of emails he received from a senior White House official, which eventually became so vitriolic that Fournier decided to "ice" -- or cut off -- the source altogether. In justifying both that decision and his choice to go public, Fournier cited the administration's successful bullying of younger reporters: I changed the rules of our relationship, first, because it was a waste of my time (and the official’s government-funded salary) to engage in abusive conversations. Second, I didn’t want to condone behavior that might intimidate less-experienced reporters, a reaction I personally witnessed in journalists covering the Obama administration. This was the same concern Bob Woodward raised when he initially told CNN's Wolf Blitzer about the infamous "regret" email: "I've tangled with lots of these people," he said. "But suppose there's a young reporter who's only had a couple of years — or 10 years' — experience and the White House is sending him an email saying, 'You're going to regret this.' You know, tremble, tremble. I don't think it's the way to operate." Though the context of the email exchange between Woodward and Gene Sperling clearly diminished the severity of the "threat" involved, subsequent anecdotes and confessions from other journalists have vindicated Woodward's critique of the White House press shop's culture and standard operating procedures. This isn't about one controversial email; it's about a pattern of behavior -- to say nothing of the Obama gang's subsequent campaign to marginalize and malign Woodward's reputation. Allahpundit notices that even the media whistle-blowers exhibit a strange compulsion to go out of their way to distance Obama himself from the sleazy actions of his top staff: "[Fournier] ends, as did Woodward and as any indictment of White House boorishness evidently must as a matter of professional obligation, by noting that St. Barack would surely frown upon such treatment — even though Obama chooses to surround himself with people like Rahm Emanuel and Fournier’s source and he not-so-secretly disdains the media despite their adulation of him." Yes, because surely St. Barack would never condone such boorish and acerbic treatment of reporters, right? Ahem: It's not quite eight in the morning and Barack Obama is on the phone screaming at me. He liked the story I wrote about him a couple weeks ago, but not this garbage. Months earlier, a reporter friend told me she overheard Obama call me an #$%$ at a political fund-raiser. Now here he is blasting me from hundreds of miles away for a story that just went online but hasn't yet hit local newsstands. It's the first time I ever heard him yell, and I'm trembling as I set down the phone. I sit frozen at my desk for several minutes, stunned. The fish rots from the head.

You're still in idealistic fantasy bubble and without any true knowledge. ___________________________ Was Sir Paul's FIRST marriage really such a fairytale? During one of her unrelenting tirades on television this week, Heather Mills claimed she had told Sir Paul McCartney: "You know why we split. You need to stand up and say: "I am responsible for the breakdown of this marriage." Of course he didn't. Who would believe him, anyway? The commonly held view is that the former Beatle was the unwitting victim of a calculating harpy, who ensnared him when his guard was down and he was vulnerable - lonely and grieving for his beloved first wife, Linda. But is this the whole truth? Heather is now threatening to go public with her own 'Maccagate tapes', which she promises will shed a different light on her marriage, as well as McCartney's marriage to Linda. The tapes are said to be recordings made by Mills of intimate discussions between herself and McCartney of their marital problems, made in the months leading up to the split in May last year. They are believed to make up the 'box of evidence' that 39-year-old Heather has been referring to all this week. One such tape played off-camera during one of Heather's interviews is said to contain an admission by Sir Paul to Heather that he hit Linda 'once or twice' during their marriage. It may well be true that Sir Paul believed his marriage to Linda to be idyllic. But that, say friends, was because the marriage was all about Linda making him happy; mothering him, pandering to his every whim, dropping everything to be with him when he so demanded it. In short, everything revolved around him. "It was his way or no way," says a friend. "Linda had to fit in with him, with whatever he wanted." In other words, his ego was big enough for both of them.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362426015858</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 14:40:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362426175803-144</Id><Topic><Title>We Truly Rich Guys...</Title><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1362414251556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:24:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>now i get it death to the one legged women who is twice the man you ever could be</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1362426175803</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 14:42:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362426298271-145</Id><Title>Boeing starting to believe own lies about 787 all hosed up !</Title><Msg>good bye 787. you will never fly</Msg><Username>food_stamp_nation</Username><Timestamp>1362426298271</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 14:44:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362426416749-146</Id><Title>BA floats genaric progress messages each day with ZERO content.</Title><Msg>Boeing pumps out around two generic message about progress but contain no facts just "thay are making progress".

They forget that, as the last election shows, most American voters did NOT just fall off the turnip truck.

I might have to leave the Dems and join such a middle party; but the problem is the right-fringers seem determined to take down the nation with them. We can only hope the coup de grace (sp?) comes quickly, while there is still an America left. Michigan's emergency manager law serves to remind us just how fast a normally level-headed populace (well, Michigan conservatives, anyway) can go for a fuhrer.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1362446192526</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 20:16:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362446431318-241</Id><Topic><Title>Is there an antidote to laughing gas?</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1361902324623</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 13:12:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this is skyfox12312123 12312123 over</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1362446431318</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 20:20:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362446790715-242</Id><Topic><Title>Wast hrust into a room with 500other kids and #2 pencil</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1362439129675</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 18:18:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumbfascists think not it is not a fair game to this day... from the beginning... -Emerson,Lake, and Palmer/E/L/P/</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1362446790715</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 20:26:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362446949849-243</Id><Title>St Louis residents get strange Text message from Feds</Title><Msg>One more step toward taking over the communications...Big Brother tightens its grip Users cannot opt out of presidential alerts, meaning the government has a direct line to every cell phone user in the country, something which spooks big government critics and those who fear a state takeover of communications. “Consumers will have the option….to block all PLAN alerts except for those issued by the president,” the L.A. Times reported in 2011. The emergency alert system went into place in April last year. The KDSK report credits the system with finding a lost girl. “It really engages more people,” said St. Louis resident Megan Abbott, who was initially baffled by the message she received on Saturday. “Because if you’re not seeking out that information you’re not getting it. So by reaching everybody, more people can be involved and thankfully the little girl was found safely. So obviously the large range of audiences worked.” Early tests of the emergency alert system in New Jersey caused panic after Verizon customers received text messages warning them that a “civil emergency” was in progress and to “take shelter,” prompting alarmed citizens to flood 911 lines with anxious calls.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1362446949849</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 20:29:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362447067636-244</Id><Topic><Title>St Louis residents get strange Text message from Feds</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1362446949849</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 20:29:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've always said, along with several other astute conservaitives ...watch out when the wheels start coming off the Regime's Express.

Let's see, the FAA grounded the Dreamliner on January 16th. 200 engineers working 200,000 hours since then works out to 1000 hours per engineer over 47 days which is about 21.3 hours a day. Those poor engineers. Talk about overtime. Did I miss something? Don`t you need to know what caused the problem before you can fix it? What was the cause of the fires? And putting the batteries in a fireproof box is not a `fix`.A long time ago Boeing's slogan was "Pride in Excellence"; now there is neither. Please, FAA have the spine to stand up for the public, don't be rushed, do your job properly. Because we can't trust Boeing. I hope the FAA takes their time and does a thorough review before approving any fixes. Not like they did last time. Dont be rushed by BOEING urgency. Boeing just wants to get the planes flying again to minimize financial impact Catch a clue, Mr. ray Connor: Passengers do not want to know how FAST you can fix the safety of flight problems of the 787. They want to know how WELL you have tested and PROVED the repairs to your flawed and dangerous 787. This is an excellent example of why Boeing should be doing all their work in-house. The batteries, and all other parts should be made with the same managment for quality control. all this comes from a salesman and a CEO, how well do you trust those two professions? Boeing’s Conner says 787 fix can ‘move really fast’ The FAA may have different ideas. I feel for Ray - Sales great, but has no clue technically.And then there is the leader hiding in his hole - Jim, admit the fact you should not be in this position and fade away -- please. "Really fast"=Before the truth catches up: Boeing execs had six years to get control of their incendiary creation. US and foreign media, Capitol Hill staffers and the flying public are starting to ask pointed, informed questions; you'll get your speedy approval-just in time to see your credibility shredded. Step carefully, Mr. Conner, Mr. McNerney; enough Boeing insiders have come forward to fill volumes-not everyone is going public, but the discussion is flowing, and you're hopelessly outnumbered. Maybe a little time in Seattle coffee shops instead of the board room will do you good. Boeing's 787 has been synonymous with fires and explosions ever since the maligned battery first met with the under reported charging system. That's right; the battery doesn't erupt into flames or burn buildings down until you combine it with the charging system (November 2006) or put both aboard the aircraft (which is why we're having this discussion)</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362458384513</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:39:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362458523572-265</Id><Topic><Title>We Truly Rich Guys...</Title><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1362414251556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:24:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now, that is funny.
