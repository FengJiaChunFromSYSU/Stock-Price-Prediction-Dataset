But they are heavily involved in progressive political activisim for the Left. The American People know that. That is why NBCs ratings continue to fall. They merge stories with subjective politics to sway the viewer's opinion. They do a nice job of it too if your I.Q. is 100 or below. Media for the Masses. Don't think! We'll do the thinking for you! Edward R. Murrow would be stunned by the high level of Communist Media Personnel embedded within NBC today. This information is only a personal opinion by sdmiller.

Defense</Title><Msg>All Animals in nature have an innate instinct to defend themselves. This is Natural law and common Sense. Kurt Nimmo July 17, 2013 Obama’s Attorney General, Eric Holder, went before the NAACP on Tuesday and called for examining the idea that individuals have a natural right to self defense. He said government must work to eliminate “Stand Your Ground” laws in states like Florida. In defense of self defense and open carry. “It’s time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,” the nation’s top cop said. “We must examine laws that take this further by eliminating the common-sense and age-old requirement that people who feel threatened have a duty to retreat, outside their home, if they can do so safely. By allowing and perhaps encouraging violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety,” a clear reference to the trial of George Zimmerman. “George Zimmerman is not guilty of murder,” said George Zimmerman’s attorney, Don West, during the trial. “He shot Trayvon Martin in self-defense after being viciously attacked. The evidence will show you how and why it happened the way he did.” The jury agreed and acquitted Zimmerman.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374145583404</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 07:06:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374145751001-18</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmerman suing NBC for $1 billion for being race pimps</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1374064682101</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 08:38:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Edward R.

The NAACP and other civil rights groups have lobbied, so far without success, to have “stand your ground” laws repealed. “Stand Your Ground laws license vigilantism,” Ben Jealous, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said following Holder’s speech. On Wednesday, the Rev. Al Sharpton told NAACP attendees he will lobby against Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law prior to next month’s 50th anniversary of the 1963 march on Washington, D.C. He characterized the self defense law as the “worst violation of civil rights in the country.” “Until we can overturn ‘Stand Your Ground,’ we risk more Trayvon Martins,” Sharpton said. “We cannot have our sons’ and daughters’ lives on the line for anybody who wants to pursue them and shoot them and say it was self-defense.” In addition to rolling back laws permitting self defense, the NAACP and other liberal groups, including the Soros-funded MoveOn.org, are pushing to have Zimmerman retried on civil rights charges. “Everywhere you go, people are talking about this,” said Curley Clark, leader of an NAACP chapter in Pascagoula, Mississippi. “We are hoping the Department of Justice will take up the cause. A lot of the rights the NAACP fought for and won years ago are now being lost.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374146284971</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 07:18:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374146362927-20</Id><Topic><Title>Help</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1374122417863</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 00:40:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Multiple ID wacko from Kent does not believe in "Stand your Ground" laws...he believes in "Cower and wet your pants" laws</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374146362927</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 07:19:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374147280661-21</Id><Topic><Title>Help</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1374122417863</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 00:40:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, he would have wet himself if he was Zimmerman.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1374147280661</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 07:34:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374147406977-22</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmerman suing NBC for $1 billion for being race pimps</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1374064682101</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 08:38:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Raven thought he was a reporter......</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1374147406977</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 07:36:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374147500769-23</Id><Topic><Title>Jimmy Carter: "Zimmerman jury made 'right decision'"</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374122217362</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 00:36:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They have more in common with the national socialists from 1930-40's Germany.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1374147500769</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 07:38:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374147528311-24</Id><Title>To All of you Right-Wingers</Title><Msg>Thanks for making my job so much easier.

About to Skyrocket for 100%+ Gains!</Title><Msg>A major wave of M&amp;A activity is beginning in the cable TV industry. Programming costs are soaring through the roof and cable TV operators need to consolidate and gain leverage to push costs down. As cable TV operators merge and achieve big cost savings, they will rapidly increase their spending on technologies that will fuel the industry's future growth. Cable TV operator stocks are rallying, but the biggest gainers during this summer's consolidation wave will be the industry's leading technology vendors. We could soon see the largest tech vendors like Cisco (CSCO) rapidly acquire smaller cable TV tech pure plays like Seachange (SEAC) and Concurrent (CCUR). An analyst at Brean Capital issued a research note about SEAC in December, which speculated that it's a takeover target, "Because of SEAC's leading position in key areas of MSO investment, it is not likely to remain an independent company in an industry consolidation scenario." The consolidation scenario they alluded to is now getting underway, much sooner than expected. SEAC reached new 52-week highs the past three trading days! Yesterday, SEAC hit a new 52-week high of $12.72 and closed at $12.58. It has a market cap of $412mm with $114.23mm in cash and an enterprise value of $297.77mm or 1.91X revenues of $156.11mm. SEAC is rising due to takeover speculation and CCUR will likely be next to explode! Search for and read the article 'Motorola, Cisco Buyouts Vex VOD Market' to see how CCUR is also a takeover target with Arris reported to have shown interest. CCUR just surpassed SEAC to become the #1 VOD tech vendor, while Arris is #4 and could easily acquire CCUR to dominate the market - both companies based are in Atlanta! CCUR needs to rise to $16.35 just to match SEAC's enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.91! When CCUR files their 10-K next month, their trailing non-GAAP EPS will likely reach $0.50 and surpass SEAC's non-GAAP EPS of $0.44!</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1374154595524</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 09:36:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374155042526-44</Id><Topic><Title>Winning One For Trayvon...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374152385718</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 08:59:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As the worthless hoozes once said, "The Black person.s vote is a lot more important than their lives."

They have built institutions to assure failure in the Black community as they need to expand the number of failed and dependent minorities in order to maintain power and control. The victims of institutionalized Progressive failure experience Stockholm Syndrome tendencies towards those that hold power over them and keep them as hostages.

The AAIB is calling for the disabling of the ELT from all 787s and a review of the use of lithium ELTs on all other plane models.

Now Mr. Martel, a criminal investigator for the Treasury Department’s inspector general for tax administration, was telling her that an official in Delaware state government had improperly accessed her records on that very same day. Beyond that, Ms. O'Donnell and Senate investigators who have tried to help her have run into a wall of silence, leaving more questions than answers about whether abuses of the IRS system extend to private individuals and not just the tax-exempt groups already identified as victims."

"I really didn't believe that he was not guilty," Sybrina Fulton said today on "Good Morning America." "My first thought was shock, disgust." Zimmerman had been accused of second-degree murder for shooting Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old, Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford, Fla. He said from the beginning that he had shot Martin in self-defense, but many questioned his account of the incident. "I think people are forgetting that Trayvon was a teenager so he probably thought as a teenager," Fulton said. "I really do believe he was afraid because he did call George Zimmerman creepy. So he was afraid and if you are 17 years old and you are afraid, you may not know what to do." The verdict from the all-female jury of six was met with a wave of public outcry, including protest marches across the country. "As parents understanding how they reached the verdict, I'll never grasp that concept," said Martin's father, Tracy Martin. "Just as loving parents and God-fearing people, we just continue to pray that whatever was in their heart was what they intended to do. But we didn't feel it was fair and, of course, it was devastating." The outcry intensified two days after the verdict when a literary agency announced it was working with one of the jurors, identified only as juror B-37, on a book about her experiences on the jury. The plans for the book were scrapped later that day. Zimmerman Juror B37 Drops Plan to Write Book Martin's parents said today on "GMA" that they wish the members of the jury had gotten a chance to know more about their son during the trial. "I wish they really knew Trayvon for who he was and knew that he was a kid," Martin said. "They didn't know him as a human being, a very decent human being, a fun-loving kid. He loved kids. "I just wish they had an opportunity to really know who Trayvon was and to put that in context with what their decision was." Zimmerman has gone into hiding since the verdict, but in an interview this week with ABC News, his parents, Gladys and Robert Zimmerman Sr., said that if they had the chance, they would tell Trayvon Martin's parents they are truly sorry about what happened the night their son fatally shot the 17 year old. When asked whether he was comforted by the Zimmermans' apology, Martin called it a "hard and fair question." "There's no winner in this situation," Martin said. "Obviously, we are devastated more." "I just think that all the circumstances surrounding books being written and the mischaracterization of us as parents, I just really don't feel that it's real sincere," he said. "But we continue to pray that we'll find peace and strength to be forgiving parents." Martin and Fulton have started a foundation named after their son and say they hope his death and the trial can serve as a catalyst to bring the country together. Learn more about the Trayvon Martin Foundation "I think moving forward we need to educate ourselves as a community on the gun laws, on the laws, on the statutes," Martin said. "We need to come together more as a whole, not individual people, not individual races, religions. We need to come together as God's people. "We need to start learning each other, understanding each other. You can't just judge a book by its cover," he said. "Something is wrong in so many ways to say that someone is suspicious just because you don't know them." Fulton says the outpouring of support the family has received shows the effect the case has had across the nation. "It's not just about the Trayvon Martin case," Fulton said. "Now it's about your kids. It's about other kids. "What do we tell our sons?" she said.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374169271423</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 13:41:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374169397019-115</Id><Title>Retiring US Envoy to Hong Kong</Title><Msg>The retiring US Envoy to Hong Kong, a Mr. Young is an idiot.

In a video posted online, the 63-year-old singer told the crowd Tuesday: "We'll send this as a letter back home for justice for Trayvon Martin" after noticing a fan's sign that read "American Skin (41 Shots)." George Zimmerman was acquitted Saturday of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in Martin's death. Zimmerman said he fired his gun in self-defense during a February 2012 confrontation with the 17-year-old in Sanford, Fla. Lyrics in the song include "you can get killed just for living in your American skin." Springsteen wrote the song about the 1999 police shooting death of Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374172105653</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:28:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374172371571-125</Id><Topic><Title>Bruce Springsteen dedicates song to Trayvon Martin</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374172105653</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:28:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Glad to see people getting involved.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374172371571</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:32:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374172408500-126</Id><Topic><Title>Bruce Springsteen dedicates song to Trayvon Martin</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374172105653</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:28:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bruce never even knew Martin, and no doubt was willing to avoid the facts.

Not good will…that’s for sure.</Msg><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1374173111765</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:45:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374173145482-132</Id><Topic><Title>Would you buy a plane that can't have it's fusealge repaired?</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1374171684437</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:21:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I presume by your handle this must be Fox and Friends posting and by the stupidity of the comment it must be Steve Doocy.

People are calling on Walmart to pay its employees living wages, saying that if Costco, Trader Joe’s, Wegman’s, and more, can do it and still turn hefty profits, then Walmart should have no problems with it. Then there are those on Walmart’s side of the issue (which are many), who believe that no company should have to pay what they consider “high wages” for unskilled labor. However, there’s another way to look at it, which is from a business standpoint. Here’s what happens: You keep your employees happy by paying them a living wage and providing benefits, and generally treating them well at all levels, to keep their morale up. They, in turn, become more productive employees and, because they have a good job, are less likely to leave the instant something else comes along. This, in turn, drives down your turnover costs. As businesses *ought* to know, turnover costs more money than investing in your workforce does. You have lost productivity during the hiring and training process, higher recruiting costs, and more, averaging to about 20% of an employee’s annual pay, for jobs that pay $50,000 per year or less. For jobs paying $30,000 per year or less, replacing one employee amounts to roughly 16% of their annual salary, but if your turnover is even 30% per year, which is lower than average turnover across the food service and hospitality industries, that still adds up. Roughly 70% of Walmart employees leave within the first year, meaning most, if not all, Walmart stores have near-constant turnover. And those are just the costs that can be easily quantified. There are “ripple effects” with turnover also, as the employees left to pick up th</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1374184847206</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:00:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374184871764-177</Id><Topic><Title>Not gonna fly 777 &amp; 787</Title><Username>stefankim</Username><Timestamp>1374174473194</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 15:07:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Me too.

There are “ripple effects” with turnover also, as the employees left to pick up the slack generated by the vacant positions become less productive in their own jobs. When that’s a constant problem across your entire workforce, your productivity potential is never realized. At the same time, when your turnover is low, you’ve got employees with growing experience, which not only adds to their productivity, but also makes your customers more happy and more likely to return, because they like the staff. Customer acquisition can cost six to seven times more than customer retention, and having a strong, experienced, knowledgeable and productive workforce with high morale helps to keep customers coming back. This obviously applies to some industries more than others, but even the retail industry, where customer loyalty can be difficult to come by, can save money by improving customer retention. Is it perfect? No. You’ll always have that dissatisfied customer. You’ll always have some poor employees. But with this type of employment model, it’s easier to sift your bad employees out from your good employees, and advance your good employees. It also means you can be more discerning when hiring. You’ll likely have a larger pool of candidates to choose from when you have an open position, so you can pick and choose. With Walmart’s employment model, oftentimes all you get are bad employees, for these reasons: You can only attract the bottom of the barrel, and/or you do get some good employees, but they become so demoralized so fast that they stop going above and beyond, and they stop caring about the job they do, and become weak employees until they get a better job. Then they’re someone else’s good employee. There’s no point in caring about your job when the company you work for doesn’t care about you. This is such a basic and sound philosophy that it should be practiced far more than it is, not out of social responsibility, but rather because it makes good business sense over the long term. When you have an employment model that minimizes turnover as best as possible for your industry, they help grow your company, and you can focus harder on other problems your business faces. This is not an argument about minimum wage, or about small businesses, which face problems and challenges that large corporations do not. This is an explanation of how companies like Walmart are hurting themselves. Walmart would probably be able to end its PR nightmare and raise its profits by changing its employment model to one that nurtures employees, instead of one that treats them like dirt. Those who support Walmart’s employment practices do not support strengthening the economy in real, sustainable ways, nor do they support business longevity. They are unbelievably shortsighted.</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1374184896974</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:01:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374184935276-179</Id><Topic><Title>Winning One For Trayvon...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374152385718</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 08:59:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooz The Martin family did not want race injected into the trial and on numerous occasions stated this was not a trial about race.

It's the entire planet's history worth of plant matter, and every bug, plankton, and animal that ever died. Oil is mostly ancient pine forests. Pine trees are intense concentrators of sugars and fats, and they drop and regrow needles constantly. Over time, that builds up thousands of feet deep over thousands of square miles. That can be covered by dirt due to geologic activity. With heat and pressure, the biomass is converted chemically into numerous hydrocarbons; i.e., crude oil. We locate these pockets of goo, pump them to the surface, split them into various grades of fuel, gas, lube, and gunk, then burn most of them, returning the carbon to the air as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (and realeasing a lot of other nasty pollution as well). What nature took a billion years to remove from the atmosphere, man is putting back up there in a century. The fact that temperature has fluctuated due to other reasons is totally dwarfed by the fact that we are causing it to rise, more rapidly than the fossil record has ever recorded, and to levels not seen since the biggest animals were microscopic. And the only determinant of whether someone will deny the science is that they vote for Republicans. That correlation is also caused by things they don't understand.</Msg><Username>yourbestfriendintheworld</Username><Timestamp>1374188224186</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:57:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374188233210-206</Id><Topic><Title>It's the fuel pump, it appears</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1374187204225</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:40:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get back to us when you know something fuel pumps &amp; valves, defuel, crossfeed, jettison, defuel, main tanks, auxiliary, surge, etc. That should take 5 or 10 years.</Msg><Username>orly_taint</Username><Timestamp>1374188233210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:57:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374188285249-207</Id><Title>After Hours trading stopped at 6:42</Title><Msg>Gee, I wonder what tomorrow's opening will be like?</Msg><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1374188285249</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:58:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374188323266-208</Id><Topic><Title>After Hours trading stopped at 6:42</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1374188285249</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:58:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>107.63 Up 2.84(2.71%) 4:02PM EDT|After Hours : 105.75 Down 1.88 (1.75%) 6:42PM EDT - Nasdaq Real Time Price</Msg><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1374188323266</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:58:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374188327334-209</Id><Topic><Title>God bless Travon and his family</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1374187645122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:47:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The "Stand Your Ground" law should be renamed the "Don't Need a Throw-down Gun Any More" law.

And – like many other top American officials – Carter also said that Edward Snowden’s revelations do not harm our national security, but are “useful”.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374192133515</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 20:02:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374192506839-230</Id><Topic><Title>Trayvon Martin's Parents 'Devastated' by Not Guilty Verdict</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374169271423</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 13:41:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lots of blacks need counceling help about this.

Police initially told Martin’s family that George Zimmerman, 28, admitted to shooting Martin, 17, on Feb. 26, after he called 911 and reported a suspicious person, said the attorney, Benjamin Crump. Zimmerman said the shooting was in self-defense, police said. Zimmerman, who is white, has not been charged in the death of Martin, who was black. Police in Sanford, where the shooting occurred, told Martin’s family that Zimmerman had a “squeaky-clean” record and that’s why they had not arrested him, according to Tracy Martin, the teen’s father. Crump said public records show that Zimmerman was arrested in Orange County in 2005 on charges of resisting arrest with violence and battery on a law enforcement officer. “They just lied to the family,” Crump said. “They just couldn’t see why [Zimmerman] would do anything wrong or be violent. But not only do you know the guy killed this kid, because he admitted to it, you knew that he has a propensity for violence because of his past record.” The Orange County Clerk of Courts website shows a man named George Zimmerman, 28, was charged in July 2005 with resisting arrest with violence and battery on an officer. The charges appear to have been dropped. An email to Sanford Chief Bill Lee was not immediately returned on Friday evening. A phone number for Zimmerman has been disconnected. He could not be reached for comment. In an interview with HuffPost on Thursday, Tracy Martin said that when he asked police why Zimmerman hadn't been charged, officers told him "they respected [Zimmerman's] background, that he studied criminal justice for four years and that he was squeaky clean." He continued: "My question to them was, did they run my child's background check? They said yes. I asked them what they came up with, and they said nothing. So I asked if Zimmerman had a clean record, did that give him the right to shoot and kill an unarmed kid?" Crump has asked law enforcement officials to turn over the 911 tapes recorded the night Martin was killed. He has since filed a public records lawsuit to get the recordings. The teenager was on his way back from a convenience store during halftime of the NBA All-Star game when Zimmerman began following him in his car, police said. Chief Lee on Thursday said that Zimmerman called 911 and reported a suspicious person. “For some reason he felt that Trayvon, the way that he was walking or appeared, seemed suspicious to him,” Lee told HuffPost. “He called this in and at one part of this initial call [the dispatcher] recommends him not to follow Trayvon. A police officer is on the way at that point.” Lee said Zimmerman instead followed Martin. A confrontation ensued, and soon after he shot the teen, the chief said.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374198574035</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 21:49:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374199469172-237</Id><Title>BA target $150 in 18 months dreamliner success is huge</Title><Msg>eom</Msg><Username>the_dudster_2014</Username><Timestamp>1374199469172</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 22:04:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374199674933-238</Id><Topic><Title>BA target $150 in 18 months dreamliner success is huge</Title><Username>the_dudster_2014</Username><Timestamp>1374199469172</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 22:04:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>COULD N'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER!</Msg><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1374199674933</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 22:07:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374200156440-239</Id><Title>A Legacy of "The Community Organizer"</Title><Msg>Illinois: Schoolkids and gangs Chicago children displaced by public school closings may be forced to step into the line of fire between warring gangs as they walk to their new schools each day, a gang expert told a U.S judge who will rule on a request that he stop planned closings in the nation's third largest school district.

Wu, Once again you are asking God to bless someone while you issue statements that are false. Read Proverbs 12:22. The right to self-defense in Florida does not specify a skin color. Unless you were born in an alternate universe, it was Trayvon that was first beating up Zimmerman. How do I know? Simple logic. Imagine you have simply and unavoidably encountered Zimmerman and he, without provocation, shoots you in the heart (i.e., Zimmerman is the aggressor). What do you think is the probability that, now having been shot in the heart, you would then proceed to beat the daylights out of the shooter for about twenty or thirty seconds? And what is the likelihood that Zimmerman would only have one bullet in his gun? Only one shot was fired. The only ones that believe that Trayvon is an "innocent" are those that regularly lie to themselves.
