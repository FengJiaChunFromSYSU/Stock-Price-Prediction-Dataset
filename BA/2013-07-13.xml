It has not been confirmed but, if true, would be a good news - bad news situation. There is no way a coffee pot should be able to overheat or, if it did, cause that serious a fire on a modern commercial airliner. That would indicate a serious flaw in the electrical system associated with the galley and a lack of thermal protection to prevent the ignition of galley components. The Boeing design philosophy is that a single failure of a component should not cause the loss of an aircraft which mandates redundancies to compensate even for something as mundane as a coffee pot.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1373723567842</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 09:52:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373724517792-59</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking News....787 Fire Caused By Rosie O'donnell Phart</Title><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1373668617679</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 18:36:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rumor is that Rosie was hired by airbutt to fly on the ill fated 787 and to soil it.</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1373724517792</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:08:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373725238223-60</Id><Topic><Title>The BOEING 787 FIRE SHOULD HAVE SOME INFORMATION THE FIREMEN WERE THERE AND THEY KNOW</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373698708860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 02:58:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pics have been available within an hour or two- so stick it in your e a r</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1373725238223</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:20:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373725288139-61</Id><Topic><Title>787 continued</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1373658466692</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:47:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>British aren't like Americans.

They support their own and attack foreigners. It better serves euro government-subsidized airbutt to let everyone speculate all weekend about the fire. Actually, I think this bodes well for Boeing. If it were an engineering or manufacturing problem, them euro-trash limeys would have it plastered all over the papers and filling the airwaves. I would not rule out airbutt being involved. I realize this sounds a little crazy but consider this : Last year Ernie Els won the british open golf tournament. At the post tournament interview, the initial camera view included Els' face and upper torso which revealed the word BOEING and the logo on his shirt. ( Pro golfers look like walking billboards now a days ) As the interview progressed, the camera zoomed in incrementally until the Boeing logo was no longer in the picture. Never mind the camera now looking up the full bore of Els' nostrils, at least the BOEING logo wasn't being advertised all over the world. Think about that. This was the action of a euro telecast team. This would never happen in America. Many Americans are completely into bashing everything American, like these goofy posters on this message board. Of course, now a days, many Americans aren't even American !!!</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1373727774529</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 11:02:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373728185633-75</Id><Topic><Title>Trayvon Martin’s Dad Is A ‘Grand Master’ Freemason</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373724789413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:13:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Trayvon Martin’s Dad Is A ‘Grand Master’ Freemason" Is that a rapper?</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373728185633</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 11:09:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373728283505-76</Id><Topic><Title>787 FIRE may have been "burning coffee pot"</Title><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1373718034734</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 08:20:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Depends on the coffee.</Msg><Username>argyle46</Username><Timestamp>1373728283505</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 11:11:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373728297613-77</Id><Topic><Title>Trayvon Martin’s Dad Is A ‘Grand Master’ Freemason</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373724789413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:13:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's also a racist</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1373728297613</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 11:11:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373728309882-78</Id><Topic><Title>787 FIRE may have been "burning coffee pot"</Title><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1373718034734</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 08:20:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Concur</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1373728309882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 11:11:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373728474194-79</Id><Topic><Title>787 update</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1373727089918</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:51:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Statement from Ethiopian Airlines: ET-AOP landed at Heathrow on 12 July 2013 after normal flight from ADD to LON.

It could all meltdown next week or even this weekend as investigation shows major problems with 787.</Msg><Username>casesuzz</Username><Timestamp>1373732369172</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 12:19:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373732448348-104</Id><Title>common sense , if there is any fire on a 787 then that is a bad thing! barkers !

Clinton holds a 46 percent to 40 percent lead over the New Jersey governor, according to the Quinnipiac poll out Friday. The former secretary of state also would beat the Kentucky senator in a head-to-head, the poll found. Clinton led Paul 50 percent to 38 percent. (PHOTOS: 2016: Who’s next?) Vice President Joe Biden, another Democrat rumored to be in the mix for 2016, didn’t fare as well. Biden was trailing Christie 35 percent to 46 percent and was in a dead heat with Paul at 42 percent. Part of the explanation may be in the favorability numbers: 55 percent of those surveyed said they viewed Clinton favorably, compared with 38 percent who viewed her unfavorably. Biden, however, was underwater, with 44 percent viewing him unfavorably and 38 percent viewing him favorably. (PHOTOS: Who’s talking about Hillary 2016?) Christie was viewed 45 percent favorably to 18 percent unfavorably, and Paul was viewed 31 percent favorably to 28 percent not. Christie, however, was the only candidate that was viewed more favorably than not by members of the opposite party. Forty-one percent of Democrats surveyed viewed him favorably and 19 percent did not. Quinnipiac surveyed 2,014 registered voters by phone from June 28 to July 8 for the poll, which has an error margin of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373732719020</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 12:25:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373732807506-108</Id><Topic><Title>Trayvon Martin’s Dad Is A ‘Grand Master’ Freemason</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373724789413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:13:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't you think you should wait to see what the verdict is before you start to impugn the entire system?

So if one cell goes into thermal runaway and catches on fire, it's going to cascade into the other cells. The long term solution for having a battery pack that's reliable and safe and lasts a long time is to reduce the size of the cells, and have more cells that are smaller and have bigger gaps and better thermal insulation between the cells. In other words, though Boeing added more insulation, along with other fixes, that may not be enough to guarantee the safety of the battery. Musk believes that for Boeing's battery to be reliable in the long term, the company needs to redo its battery design with more, smaller cells. Considering Musk's reputation as a li-ion pioneer and battery expert, Boeing may want to heed his warning. my stock TSLA with Elon Musk as CEO is up 283% year to date. Your stock Boeing is up 35% year to date, Airbus stock is up 37% year to date. over time , 5 years, Airbus stock is up 219% compared to Boeing stock only up 61% so Airbus has bettered Boeing by 158% even a school child of the 3rd grade can tell you Boeing investors your in the wrong stock. Disney is better and more than 120% better than Boeing over five years and at no time was not better than Boeing for the entire 5 years and it does pay a dividend similar to Boeing . Boeing investors what are you thinking ? get over it until Boeing management is changed you need to be out of Boeing stock the 787 is now 8 years and counting past failure . If this is another electrical issue and a grounding occurs and more problems Boeing stock can go down by 50% just as fast as Friday your a fool to be in Boeing stock</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373733225063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 12:33:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373733341974-114</Id><Topic><Title>Trayvon Martin’s Dad Is A ‘Grand Master’ Freemason</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373724789413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:13:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a Stallone movie.

The Secretary of the Air Force said there will be no cuts on the 767 tanker contract. He said that flying 50 year old KC-135 tankers posses a major risk to air crews. The current tanker contract is good until 2020 with 179 aircraft to be delivered in the in the initial contract. The Air Force needs to replace 500 tankers. The 777 is the best aircraft in the world. AirBus has had a hard time dealing with the 777. 777X will improve an already great aircraft. The 737 and 737 Maxx programs are flying high. 747 is not dead.

The fire broke out on the plane, operated by Ethiopian Airlines, on Friday afternoon, when it was parked at a remote stand with no passengers on board, eight hours after arriving from Addis Ababa. No one was injured. External scorching could be seen close to the plane's tail, in a different area from the bays containing batteries. There was no official indication of what could have caused the fire. "The aircraft has been moved to a secure hangar at Heathrow and the investigation has begun," said a spokesman for Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). The AAIB will lead the investigation, working alongside the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Ethiopian Airlines and Boeing, he said. Separately, engineers from Britain's Thomson Airways were inspecting their own Boeing Dreamliner after it had to turn back during a flight on Friday from Manchester in England to Sanford in Florida because of an unspecified technical issue.

Also I think it is too early to speculate on this incident with the little information that has been release. So far I think we can safely assume the batteries are unlikely the cause of the fire because of their location and that of the fire. Also I am sure if the investigators even remotely thought the batteries were remotely the cause of the fire the whole 787 fleet would have been grounded by now.</Msg><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1373742940801</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 15:15:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373742972525-177</Id><Topic><Title>BA Going Back To New Highs Of $112.55 Within A Week:</Title><Username>rogerdonna_1988</Username><Timestamp>1373653844876</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 14:30:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just watch &amp; learn!</Msg><Username>rogerdonna_1988</Username><Timestamp>1373742972525</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 15:16:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373743157674-178</Id><Topic><Title>To what standards do you build something new and innovative like the 787 (learning experiences)</Title><Username>sidesaddlex</Username><Timestamp>1373741981525</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 14:59:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are right.

This does look too large for that approach. They may have to cut out the area of damage and replace with a new composite panel(not the whole barrel of the plane) by splicing the areas a newly fabricated panel. I'm sure they will have a fix for it , those AOG people can do alot that you would be surprised at there skills. As Don states, there will be no need for an autoclave at the repair site, much easier to just manufacture a new panel for the area needing repair at the production facility where they build that section of the plane in the first place, then splice in the new panel.

My point is that an autoclave is needed somewhere to fix the plane. I see a major fuselage part changed out. This cannot be done in the field.

Remove vertical fin(if needed) and any other items in the way for access. Get a new composite partial panel fabricated at the OEM with their autoclave and tooling/mandrels, cut out the old area the panel will replace, splice in the new panel with most likely metalic parts. Probably have to fly it to a paint facility and interiors restoration facility, after that as I doubt they would waste the AOG peoples with thoxe items. A field repair is possible.</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1373768099316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:14:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373769430689-270</Id><Topic><Title>Why is the New Black Panther party ALWAYS on hand to fan the flames of hatred</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373729977709</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 11:39:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... by a perfect idiot .

With the persistent problems, who is going to want to fly a 787? The problem is when Boeing tried to save on fuel use, they took power from the engines which was used for systems of the plane and loaded it with batteries, which are problematic to begin with now you've complicated things there. On top of it they rode the "composites" wave of incorporating all this new technology into stuff where a lot of it has been unproven. Remember the composite tail which fell off the American Airlines plane in New York City which crashed? The 787 is going to be plagued by continuous problems and the next issue it faces will continue to erode public confidence in it. The public already doesn't trust a plane built from 100's of different suppliers all at the lowest cost.</Msg><Username>brad_welsh</Username><Timestamp>1373771886873</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 23:18:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373772048390-276</Id><Topic><Title>zimmerman not guilty</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1373767624960</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:07:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They gave extra consideration to the lesser charges, but still found him to not be guilty of intending to kill the boy.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1373772048390</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 23:20:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373772246461-277</Id><Topic><Title>Opem $95 or $90 on Monday? - Read Why</Title><Username>justkeepushin</Username><Timestamp>1373771473897</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 23:11:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dude, Pay attention.
