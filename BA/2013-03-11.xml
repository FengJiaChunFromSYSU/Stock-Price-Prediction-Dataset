Although the party is being touted as private and therefore paid for by the Obamas, taxpayers will still have to foot the bill for secret service and other accommodations at the White House for the event. Meanwhile, President Obama just held a fancy dinner for Republicans just six blocks away from the White House and of course he took his massive motorcade to get there. Charles Cooke over at NRO has tallied up the total for the Obamas' cost of living in the White House: $1.4 billion per year. The executive mansion is not in that much trouble, of course. It’s certainly not in sufficiently dire straits for Air Force One ($181,757 per hour) to be grounded, or to see the executive chef ($100,000 per year) furloughed, or to cut back on the hours of the three full-time White House calligraphers ($277,050 per year for the trio), or to limit the invaluable work of the chief of staff to the president’s dog ($102,000 per year), or to trim his ridiculous motorcade ($2.2 million). If Ellen DeGeneres wants another dancercize session or Spain holds another clothing sale, the first family will be there before you can say “citizen executive.” Fear ye not, serfs: Austerity may be the word of the week, but the president is by no means in any danger of being forced to live like the president of a republic instead of like a king. The current annual cost of the White House — just in household expenses, not the policy operations for which it exists — is $1.4 billion: Annually, presidential vacations cost $20 million (the low estimate for one presidential vacation to Hawaii is $4 million, but the true cost is probably five times that); the first family’s yearly health-care costs are $7 million; more than $6 million is spent on the White House grounds each year. Transporting the president cost $346 million last year. But as Michelle Obama might say, America is basically a downright mean sort of place, so the tours will just have to go. One hopes at least that the calligraphers were recruited to sign the docents’ pink slips. So there you have it folks. While the White House has given out talking points to every federal agency telling them to make sequester as painful as possible through canceling meat inspections, forcing long delays at the airport and releasing thousands of criminal illegal aliens into the streets of America, the Obamas are planning their next vacation at the expense of the American people. Last week Sean Hannity and Eric Bolling of Fox News offered to pay for at least one week of White House tours, a cost of $74,000.

That should be some party . . . It's hard to believe that the politics of the sequester have worked out the way the Obama administration intended. Even their usually-reliable friends in the media have been skeptical, as this report from ABC News demonstrates: Jonathan Karl concluded the report by noting that the President took a 20-car motorcade to travel a short distance to eat with Republicans -- and suggested that next time he save money by eating at home. It seems to me that it's time that Republicans pointed out the many, many ways The White House could manage to reallocate funds to allow the American people to visit their White House. The President and Mrs. Obama have enjoyed to the fullest every perquisite of their rank; with that enjoyment should come some scrutiny, especially in a time when regular tourists are being told that there simply isn't a dime to spare on something for them, the taxpayers who subsidize it all.

It's Time For A National Conversation</Title><Msg>The Denver Post, on February 15th, ran an Associated Press article entitled Homeland Security aims to buy 1.6b rounds of ammo, so far to little notice. It confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security has issued an open purchase order for 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. As reported elsewhere, much of this purchase order is for rounds forbidden by international law for use in war, along with a frightening amount specialized for snipers. Also reported elsewhere, at the height of the Iraq War the Army was expending less than 6 million rounds a month. 1.6 billion rounds, therefore, would be enough to sustain a hot war for 20+ years. In America. Add to this perplexingly outré purchase of ammo, DHS now is showing off its acquisition of heavily armored personnel carriers, repatriated from the Iraqi and Afghani theaters of operation. As observed by “paramilblogger” Ken Jorgustin last September: “[T]he Department of Homeland Security is apparently taking delivery (apparently through the Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico VA, via the manufacturer – Navistar Defense LLC) of an undetermined number of the recently retrofitted 2,717 ‘Mine Resistant Protected’ MaxxPro MRAP vehicles for service on the streets of the United States.” … “These MRAP’s ARE BEING SEEN ON U.S. STREETS all across America by verified observers with photos, videos, and descriptions. “Regardless of the exact number of MRAP’s being delivered to DHS (and evidently some to POLICE via DHS, as has been observed), why would they need such over-the-top vehicles on U.S. streets to withstand IEDs, mine blasts, and 50 caliber hits to bullet-proof glass? In a war zone… yes, definitely. Let’s protect our men and women. On the streets of America… ? “They all have gun ports… Gun Ports? In the theater of war, yes. On the streets of America…? “Seriously, why would DHS need such a vehicle on our streets?” Why indeed? It is utterly inconceivable that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is planning a coup d’etat against President Obama, and the Congress, to install herself as Supreme Ruler of the United States of America. There, however, are real signs that the Department bureaucrats are running amok. About 20 years ago this columnist worked, for two years, in the U.S. Department of Energy’s general counsel’s office in its procurement and finance division. And is wise to the ways. The answer to “why would DHS need such a vehicle?” almost certainly is this: it’s a cool toy and these (reportedly) million dollar toys are being recycled, without much of a impact on the DHS budget. So… why not? Why, indeed, should the federal government not be deploying armored personnel carriers and stockpiling enough ammo for a 20-year war in the homeland? Because it’s wrong in every way. President Obama has an opportunity, now, to live up to some of his rhetoric by helping the federal government set a noble example in a matter very close to his heart (and that of his Progressive base), one not inimical to the Bill of Rights: gun control. The federal government can (for a nice change) begin practicing what it preaches by controlling itself. And … remember the … Sequester? The president is claiming its budget cuts will inconvenience travelers by squeezing essential services provided by the (opulently armed and stylishly uniformed) DHS. Quality ammunition is not cheap. (Of course, news reports that DHS is about to spend $50 million on new uniforms suggests a certain cavalier attitude toward government frugality.) Spending money this way is beyond absurd well into perverse. According to the AP story a DHS spokesperson justifies this acquisition to “help the government get a low price for a big purchase.” Peggy Dixon, spokeswoman for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center: “The training center and others like it run by the Homeland Security Department use as many as 15 million rounds every year, mostly on shooting ranges and in training exercises.” At 15 million rounds (which, in itself, is pretty extraordinary and sounds more like fun target-shooting-at-taxpayer-expense than a sensible training exercise) … that’s a stockpile that would last DHS over a century. To claim that it’s to “get a low price” for a ridiculously wasteful amount is an argument that could only fool a career civil servant. Meanwhile, Senator Diane Feinstein, with the support of President Obama, is attempting to ban 100 capacity magazine clips. Doing a little apples-to-oranges comparison, here, 1.6 billion rounds is … 16 million times more objectionable. Mr. Obama has a long history of disdain toward gun ownership. According to Prof. John Lott, in Debacle, a book he co-authored with iconic conservative strategist Grover Norquist, “When I was first introduced to Obama (when both worked at the University of Chicago Law School, where Lott was famous for his analysis of firearms possession), he said, ‘Oh, you’re the gun guy.’ “I responded: ‘Yes, I guess so.’ “’I don’t believe that people should own guns,’ Obama replied. “I then replied that it might be fun to have lunch and talk about that statement some time. “He simply grimaced and turned away. … “Unlike other liberal academics who usually enjoyed discussing opposing ideas, Obama</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1363019421196</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 12:30:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363019446504-70</Id><Topic><Title>Obamas' Cost of Living in the White House: $1.4 Billion a Year</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1363011946730</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 10:25:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fox News reported the time Obama attended Rev.

Bush created his place in history. Remember the USA before 911? Bush did so much to destroy our culture. He may not have been smart enough to deal with the 911 attack or the economic collapse, but his mindless response killed so many, caused so much suffering, and put the country on the road to what we are now becoming, a failed nation. We need a smart inspired leader to restore our old values, not a frat boy robber baron to organize the further dismemberment of the country. The examples are obvious to anyone paying attention. In any event, nominating Jeb Bush will only make the left a more powerful and destructive force in America. Not many will vote for another Bush and not many will support a party that puts forward such destructive candidates as Bush and Romney.</Msg><Username>zombiegrunt</Username><Timestamp>1363023542940</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 13:39:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363023924645-94</Id><Topic><Title>Jeb Bush might be running in 2016</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363007992296</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 09:19:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you tell em moore-on, i mean zombie, you speaking for spart or chrissie?</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363023924645</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 13:45:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363024134423-95</Id><Topic><Title>Jeb Bush might be running in 2016</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363007992296</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 09:19:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I finally agree with you, censored.

According to the establishment media, neocons are conservatives, hence the “con,” and as such you’d think they’d line up with other supposed conservatives on supporting the Second Amendment. Not to worry. The police will protect you. So, turn in your gun. It’s the right thing to do for the children. Illustration: Anthony Freda. Neocons, however, are not Republican conservatives. They are more accurately of a socialist pedigree. Early neocons had a falling out with Democrats and liberals over the Vietnam War and other less than palatable aspects of the so-called New Left in the late 1960s. Francis Fukuyama, the political economist who experienced an epiphany and subsequently fell out of the neocon orbit, attributes the political movement to Leninism, while other critics point to the influence of the Bolshevik Leon Trotsky. Either way, the neocons are avid proponents of state power over the individual. On the other hand, their supposed Republican friends, at least in theory, are more libertarian in thought, though not necessarily in action. So it is really quite natural that a guy like David Frum, a former neocon who found his calling as a CNN and Daily Beast contributor, is warning the public about the dangers of guns, a warning that runs parallel to a concerted government campaign to strangle the Second Amendment. Unlike his Democrat friends, though, David is not calling for a sledge hammer approach. He argues instead that America is a safe place and guns are not necessary. “The good news is that as America becomes safer, fewer and fewer Americans feel the need for a weapon,” he writes in a post-Newtown era of shrill calls repeated daily for everything from exorbitant taxes on ammunition to downright gun confiscation disguised as “sensible” buyback programs. Frum’s argument is at best fictional: “Only one-fifth of young Americans own a gun; one-third of over-50 Americans do.

The federal government can (for a nice change) begin practicing what it preaches by controlling itself. Remember the Sequester? The president is claiming its budget cuts will inconvenience travelers by squeezing essential services provided by the (opulently armed and stylishly uniformed) DHS. Quality ammunition is not cheap. (Of course, news reports that DHS is about to spend $50 million on new uniforms suggests a certain cavalier attitude toward government frugality.) Spending money this way is beyond absurd well into perverse. According to the AP story a DHS spokesperson justifies this acquisition to “help the government get a low price for a big purchase.” Peggy Dixon, spokeswoman for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center: “The training center and others like it run by the Homeland Security Department use as many as 15 million rounds every year, mostly on shooting ranges and in training exercises.” At 15 million rounds (which, in itself, is pretty extraordinary and sounds more like fun target-shooting-at-taxpayer-expense than a sensible training exercise) … that’s a stockpile that would last DHS over a century. To claim that it’s to “get a low price” for a ridiculously wasteful amount is an argument that could only fool a career civil servant. Meanwhile, Senator Diane Feinstein, with the support of President Obama, is attempting to ban 100 capacity magazine clips. Doing a little apples-to-oranges comparison, here, 1.6 billion rounds is … 16 million times more objectionable. Mr. Obama has a long history of disdain toward gun ownership.
