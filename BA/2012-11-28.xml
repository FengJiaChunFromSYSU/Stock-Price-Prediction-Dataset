The Board of Elections are good people. They have checks and balances … but we want to make sure everything is fair.” She said a number of people contacted her after the Nov. 6 election to report that they pressed a touch-screen button for GOP candidate Mitt Romney, but the vote registered for Barack Obama. WND has reported a number of first-hand accounts of similar anomalies during the election. One touch-screen technician reported that voters in another state were getting error messages on their touch-screens when they tried to vote for Romney. Also, suspiciously, a number of precincts reported a 100-percent vote for Obama, and some even reported beyond 100 percent. “My request [to the FBI] is … I want them to take these machines. Let an FBI computer expert analyze them,” she said. She said that among those who contacted her with concerns were two officials, including a state lawmaker who personally experienced a vote machine changing his vote three times to the party whose agenda he opposed. The lawmaker told her that his computer background left him confident that the problem was beyond a technical glitch, and he insisted that the election judge take the machine out of service and lock it up.</Msg><Username>spartacus8463</Username><Timestamp>1354104079185</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 07:01:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354104177826-4</Id><Title>FBI to probe Vote changing machines</Title><Msg>Seems there were reports from all over the country of folks votong for Romney BUT being tallied for the Kenyan</Msg><Username>spartacus8463</Username><Timestamp>1354104177826</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 07:02:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354108407155-5</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP Leaves No Billionaire Behind, Part 672</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_667</Username><Timestamp>1354061542051</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 19:12:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How many Billionaires did the present administration indict after the bailouts scams in 2008 ?</Msg><Username>spartacus8463</Username><Timestamp>1354108407155</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 08:13:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354111451007-6</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP Leaves No Billionaire Behind, Part 672</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_667</Username><Timestamp>1354061542051</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 19:12:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Billionaires are in the pocket of the left donating huge sums of money to the left, and then getting tax exemptions, special regulations.

A gang of brazen CEOs has joined forces to promote economically disastrous and socially irresponsible austerity policies. Many of those same CEOs were bailed out by the American taxpayer after a Wall Street-driven financial crash. Instead of a thank-you, they are showing their appreciation in the form of a coordinated effort to rob Americans of hard-earned retirements, decent medical care and relief for the poorest. Using the excuse of a phony, manufactured crisis known as the “fiscal cliff” – which isn’t a crisis at all, as economist James K. Galbraith has succinctly explained -- they are gearing up to pull the wool over the public's eyes by cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The CEOs are part of the Fix the Debt campaign run by the Peter Peterson-backed Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, which plans to unleash tens of millions pushing for a deficit reduction deal that favors the rich. You can be sure that many more CEOs in addition to the names on the list below sympathize with plans to shred the social safety net and enjoy windfall tax breaks. But these Scrooges are so bold as to publicly announce their desire to pick the pockets of fellow Americans while simultaneously pigging out at the corporate welfare trough. Multitasking! A generation ago, an American CEO would think twice about announcing utter disregard not only for his neighbors and employees, but also for the economy, which can’t prosper when income is consistently redistributed upward (see Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz’s The Price of Inequality for more on that theme). But in the present culture -- even after the Occupy Wall Street movement – these business barons feel perfectly comfortable trumpeting their desire to get richer at your expense. Here’s a sample of the Fix the Debt CEO Council Hall of Shame. (Download the complete list at the organization’s Web site.) 1. Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 2. Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and CEO, General Electric Company. 3. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. 4. W. James McNerney, Jr., chairman, president and CEO, the Boeing Company. 5. David Cote, chairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc. 6. Glenn Britt, chairman and CEO, Time Warner Cable Inc 7. Reid Hoffman, cofounder and executive chairman, LinkedIn Corporation. 8.

Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. Blankfein, infamous for describing his financial activities as “God’s work,” shared his attitude toward society with CBS news recently. He explained his keen desire to see Americans lowering their sights for the future. You really have to watch the interview to get the full flavor of Blankfein’s smug assurance that predation can be sold as concern for the nation’s well-being. In addition to trotting out several myths about Social Security’s design and functions, including the bogus notion that retirement age must be raised, he gives a pithy summary of what life is going to be like for the 99 percent: “You’re going to have to do something, undoubtedly, to lower people’s expectations of what they’re going to get, the entitlements, and what people think they’re going to get, because you’re not going to get it.” Not if Lloyd Blankfein has anything to do with it. He calls it managing expectations. Here’s another word: theft. Since the financial crash, Blankfein’s company, Goldman Sachs, has received tens of billions of dollars in what the Economic Policy Journal describes as “direct and indirect succor from the Fed." In sharp contrast to average Americans, when Goldman needed help in the 2008 crisis, a friendly Federal Reserve let Goldman turn into a commercial bank almost overnight, so it could go to the Fed for help 24/7. 2. Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and CEO, General Electric Company. In 2011, President Obama welcomed outsourcing pioneer Jeffrey Immelt to his White House inner circle as chair of a newly created jobs council – a move that was a sharp slap in the face to American workers. Immelt returned the favor by dumping Obama in favor of Mitt Romney in the recent election. Obviously, supporting disastrous financial deregulation, dodging taxes and helping to destroy American manufacturing has not satisfied Immelt. He’d like to add insult to injury by making sure that people who have been screwed by the reckless activities of short-sighted corporate titans like himself are left to starve in their golden years and go without medical care. And as for the poor, well, couldn’t they be just a little bit poorer? Immelt thinks that would be swell. After the 2008 crash, the government gave a giant boost to hard-pressed GE Capital, the company’s financing arm, through the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. GE has also helped itself to enormous taxpayer-funded subsidies, especially in green energy. And guess how much GE paid in taxes in 2010? Nothing. In fact, using what the New York Times describes as its “innovative accounting practices,” it claimed a tax benefit of $3.2 billion! 3. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. At a recent gathering of the Council on Foreign Relations, Jamie Dimon vented his feelings about a number of things that peeve him, from a federal lawsuit brought against JPMorgan Chase to Obama’s failure to adopt the harmful and misguided Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan, which, among other things, recommended reducing the tax rate for top earners. Dimon has claimed that his bank did not need the TARP funds bestowed on it by the federal government, but there is no question that today his bank borrows funds more cheaply than smaller banks because of the federal government’s implicit too-big-too-fail guarantee. Dimon is deploying a familiar scare tactic on the topic of the so-called fiscal cliff. He’s claiming that his company will be forced to cut down on hiring and so on if a budget plan is not tailored to enrich the wealthy. During a recent visit to India, he issued warnings to CNBC-TV18: "I've spoken to CEOs who say, you know, absolutely, we are making decisions to protect ourselves from the ‘fiscal cliff’ and those are like investment decisions and hiring decisions.” Maybe Dimon’s company would be better served figuring out what happened to the $6 billion that recently went up in smoke in the “London Whale” derivatives fiasco. 4. W. James McNerney, Jr., chairman, president and CEO, the Boeing Company. McNerney launched at Procter &amp; Gamble, reached high altitude at GE and shot to the stratosphere by becoming head honcho at Boeing in 2005. Boeing has been a long-time beneficiary of the government’s Export-Import Bank, which has financed sales of many of its planes. McNerney chairs President Obama's Export Council, where he works hard to arrange policies that benefit his company. He spent much of 2011 slugging it out with the National Labor Relations Board over moving assembly plants from Washington to South Carolina, a right-to-work state. That got settled, but now the profitable company is in a fight with engineers who don’t want their pensions chopped nearly in half. Boeing’s excuse? It wants to keep the engineers “competitive.” Union members have reported intimidation from the company’s management as the dispute has intensified. The Boeing boss is now crying “deficit” and asks for your retirement money. Pretty brassy, considering that the company paid not a single penny in taxes between 2008 and 2011. In fact, Citizens for Tax Justice calculates that Boeing actually got money back from the U.S. government over the past decade, “paying a negative 6.5 percent tax rate, even though it was profitable every year from 2002 through 2011.” 5. David Cote, chairman and CEO, Honeywell International Inc. David Cote is a veteran of GE and also sits on the board of JPMorgan Chase, where he is one of three members of the risk committee that failed to prevent the disastrous $6 billion trading loss mentioned above. Cote has led Honeywell, one of the world’s largest industrial conglomerates, since 2002. Along with GE and Boeing, Honeywell shares the distinction of being a top corporate polluter. Obama invited Cote to join the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission in 2010, where he worked hard to create a flawed plan meant to reward the rich and cut vital services for the 99 percent. Meantime, sales of mostly aerospace-related Honeywell products sold to the government make up about 12 percent of Honeywell’s total revenues. Here’s the 2009 figure for what Cote raked in as Honeywell’s CEO: $12,839,038. In response to the recession, Cote forced Honeywell's employees to take unpaid furloughs of between two and five weeks during 2008 and 2009. 6. Glenn Britt, chairman and CEO, Time Warner Cable Inc. Maybe the head of one of the world’s largest media conglomerates is ticked off because his compensation dropped from $17.4 million in 2010 to $16.4 million in 2011. Whatever it is, he is channeling his frustration by setting his sights on your wallet. As a telecom giant, TWC is part of one of the most despised industries in America, and it’s no wonder. Whether it’s offering terrible customer service (Britt is devising a special “white glove” package for the affluent), leaving customers disconnected during Hurricane Sandy, or lobbying for laws that squash competition and lead to telecom oligopolies, Britt seems out to prove that his company can only succeed if the rest of the country suffers. And with his Fix the Debt campaign, he’d like to make that suffering just a little more intense. 7. Reid Hoffman, cofounder and executive chairman, LinkedIn Corporation. Reid Hoffman brought us LinkedIn, possibly the most annoying social media network on Planet Earth. Why is it necessary to send scores of nagging emails to accept invitations to "link" to people you don’t even know? No one can say. But it sure is irritating. LinkedIn, along with his investments in companies like Facebook, has made Hoffman a billionaire. He’s ready to start giving – to the rich. Hoffman hails himself as the champion of entrepreneurship. What he fails to mention is that entrepreneurship gets stifled when people don’t have a decent social safety net. You can’t take risks starting a new business if there’s nothing to fall back on. That’s why Norway is considered an entrepreneur’s heaven: the social safety net is strong and there’s far less shoveling income toward the rich. Fix the Debt proposals would shred the social safety net, increase income inequality and make entrepreneurship less attractive for Americans. Hoffman’s presence on this list means only one thing: he wants to make it harder for you to be an entrepreneur like him. He’s made his money. And now he’s bent on kicking the ladder out from under the rest of us. 8. Richard Anderson, CEO, Delta Air Lines, Inc. Historically, airlines have been recipients of enormous subsidies from the federal government; after 9/11, many of those subsidies increased. Delta CEO Richard Anderson enjoyed a 10 percent raise in 2011, bringing his compensation to $8.9 million. Not bad for a year when the company's stock price fell by more than a third. Delta employees didn’t fare so well as the boss. In 2010, Delta flight attendants lost their battle to protect their pay and benefits. According to Labor Notes, Anderson was quite creative in his effort to crush the American dream of those hard-working folks: “[Anderson] played up a culture clash between Northwest’s Northern base and Delta’s Southern workforce, attacking AFA [Association of Flight Attendants] in one company-called meeting for being ‘un-Christian’ and ‘immoral.’ A DVD of the meeting was sent to every flight attendant.” As the head of an airline, Anderson knows that his business would not have been possible but for the taxpayer-funded research and development that led to the creation of passenger jets, along with enormous air mail subsidies. He returns the favor by screwing workers and attempting to pass austerity measures designed to stick it to working people whose tax dollars make his job possible. 9. Dave Barger, president and CEO of JetBlue Airways Corp. Sky’s the limit to Dave Barger’s fondness for right-wing politicians. And he’s quite proud of being the only major U.S.-based airline that’s “100% union free.” Several grassroots attempts at unionization have failed in recent years, much to his delight. JetBlue has been running Fox shows on its in-flight entertainment network since 2004. Recently, the company pulled its sponsorship of Yearly Kos, a convention held by liberal Web site DailyKos, in response to pressure from Fox’s Bill O’Reilly. Like Delta CEO Richard Anderson, Dave Barger understands very well that the airline industry has enjoyed enormous benefits thanks to the U.S. taxpayer, from the massive airports built at government expense to air traffic control infrastructure, which is heavily subsidized. And, like Anderson, he'd like to deliver a sharp kick in the teeth to the customers who support his business and would like to have a decent retirement and, oh, maybe some quality care when they're sick.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354120913733</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 11:41:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354121003518-17</Id><Topic><Title>Nine CEOs Pigging Out on Corporate Welfare !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354120846834</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 11:40:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Traitors of the worst sort, all of them.</Msg><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1354121003518</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 11:43:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354121263447-18</Id><Title>What do gay me do together ?</Title><Msg>So what do they do and who does what?

Stripped to essentials, the fiscal cliff is a device constructed to force a rollback of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, as the price of avoiding tax increases and disruptive cuts in federal civilian programs and in the military. It was policy-making by hostage-taking, timed for the lame duck session, a contrived crisis, the plain idea now unfolding was to force a stampede. In the nature of stampedes arguments become confused; panic flows from fear, when multiple forces – economic and political in this instance – all appear to push the same way.

That is the beauty of allowing me to make the choice for myself through the free market systems. This is not the case for government and union pigs that conspire to create government mandates, irresponsible government practices and government welfare that impacts me and does do harm to me directly. The ratio of government/union pigs to private sector pigs is enormous as just about every politician in Illinois, a Blue state, is an unethical greedy pig that has put the state into the worst financial position in the country. The political bandits in Illinois put the guys you list to shame. For example: SPRINGFIELD — — Two lobbyists with no prior teaching experience were allowed to count their years as union employees toward a state teacher pension once they served a single day of subbing in 2007, a Tribune/WGN-TV investigation has found. Steven Preckwinkle, the political director for the Illinois Federation of Teachers, and fellow union lobbyist David Piccioli were the only people who took advantage of a small window opened by lawmakers a few months earlier. The legislation enabled union officials to get into the state teachers pension fund and count their previous years as union employees after quickly obtaining teaching certificates and working in a classroom. They just had to do it before the bill was signed into law. Preckwinkle's one day of subbing qualified him to become a participant in the state teachers pension fund, allowing him to pick up 16 years of previous union work and nearly five more years since he joined. He's 59, and at age 60 he'll be eligible for a state pension based on the four-highest consecutive years of his last 10 years of work. His paycheck fluctuates as a union lobbyist, but pension records show his earnings in the last school year were at least $245,000. Based on his salary history so far, he could earn a pension of about $108,000 a year, more than double what the average teacher receives. His pay for one day as a substitute was $93, according to records of the Illinois Teachers Retirement System. Over the course of their lifetimes, both men stand to receive more than a million dollars each from a state pension fund that has less than half of the assets it needs to cover promises made to tens of thousands of public school teachers. With billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities, the Illinois Teachers' Retirement System, which serves public school teachers outside of Chicago, is one of several pension plans that are in debt as state government reels in a fiscal crisis.

Anonymous claims to have foiled Karl Rove's Plans to Steal Election by RMForbes Nov 17, 2012 The Daily Kos Two days after the Nov 6th election Anonymous posted an open letter. Partial text from the Letter from Anonymous explaining how they discovered Rove's election scam and blocked it from flipping the election in three key States [Ohio, Virginia and Florida] on election night follows; “ 8 November 2012 …. We chose to take action against those who have subverted the will of the people in past elections, which resulted in terrible destruction across the globe. We began following the “digital traffic of one Karl Rove, a disrespecter of the Rule of Law, knowing that he claimed to be Kingmaker while grifting vast wealth from barons who gladly handed him gold to anoint another King while looking the other way. After a rather short time, we identified the digital structure of Karl’s operation and even that of his ORCA. This was an easy task in that the barn doors were left open and the wind swept us inside.So what do we do with these doors? Do we leave them open and catch the thieves as they steal the prize? Or do we close them so they cannot steal the prize?Our decision —protect the citizensWe coded and created, what we call, The Great Oz. A targeted password protected firewall that we tested and refined for the past weeks. We placed this code on more than one of the digital tunnels and their destinations that Karl’s not so smart worker bees planned to use on election night. We noticed that these tunnels were strategically placed to allow for tunnel rats to race to the server sewers from three different states. Ah yes, Karl tried to make it appear that there were more than three but we quickly saw the folly of his ploy.We watched as Karl’s little boys and girls confidently ran their tests while Karl told his barons to smoke cigars. We watched as Karl’s speared ORCA whale was beached, rotting with a strong stench across his American plalyground, unable to be resuscitated. We watched as Karl’s weak corrupters repeatedly tried to penetrate The Great Oz. These children of his were at a loss–how many times and how many passwords did they try–exactly 105. We work without remuneration. Karl, on the other hand, takes ships of gold from barons to do their bidding. We sank those ships and we have a warning for Karl–sail again at your peril. We may just put all the evidence into a tidy little package and give it to a painfully bored nemesis hanging out in a certain embassy in London. " Thom Hartmann featured a story titled "Karl Rove Loses Election After Being Checkmated By Cyber Sleuths?" on Occupy for Accountability's website on his show yesterday. Personally I'm surprised this hasn't been news everywhere before this. Occupy for Accountability "urged computer experts to contact us with information about any election manipulation of the tabulation results." The Anonymous group "The Protectors" responded to the call but did not claim the Million Dollar prize because they began their election protection weeks before Occupy for Accountability posted their reward. On November 12th, we received a letter from “The Protectors,” apparently a group of white hat cyber sleuths, mentioning our reward and stating that two months ago, they began monitoring the “digital traffic of one Karl Rove, a disrespecter of the Rule of Law, knowing that he claimed to be Kingmaker while grifting vast wealth from barons who gladly handed him gold to anoint another King while looking the other way.” “The Protectors” said that they had identified the digital structure of Rove’s operation and of ORCA, a Republican get out the vote software application. After finding open “doors” in the systems, they created a “password protected firewall” called “The Great Oz,” and installed it on servers that Rove planned to use on election night to re-route and change election results “from three states.” The letter indicated that “ORCA Killer” was launched at 10am EST and “The Great Oz” at 8pm EST on November 6th. “The Protectors” watched as ORCA crashed and failed throughout Election Day. They watched as Rove’s computer techs tried 105 times to penetrate “The Great Oz” using different means and passwords. Finally, they issued the following warning to Mr. Rove: don’t do it again or they would turn over the evidence to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. I almost wish Karl Rove tries again so we see the actual evidence plastered all over the net.</Msg><Username>mocking_heads</Username><Timestamp>1354134295849</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 15:24:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354134381611-29</Id><Topic><Title>Nine CEOs Pigging Out on Corporate Welfare !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354120846834</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 11:40:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>whats your point... that gluttony is acceptable... ?</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354134381611</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 15:26:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354134504518-30</Id><Topic><Title>Why We Have to Raise Taxes on the Rich</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_667</Username><Timestamp>1354117240907</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:40:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The answer lies within the question. Your premise that the 1%ers don't invest or create jobs is a false one. 1%ers do invest and create jobs. Still it is interesting that a "TAX REFUND" is a refund on taxes withheld from earnings but people who had no taxes withheld can get a tax refund or a a refund greater than what was withheld. And no the 1%ers don't want people starving-----that will only lead to rioting and anarchy.

Ignore the real voter corruption (ACORN, ACORN-lite, the 27 ballot man, unusual "default to Obama" electronic voting, etc.), lies about Benghazi and Fast and Furious, but harp on Romney's success by making "Bain Capital" a curse word, all the while voters worship Obama as a false-messiah. Then, once elected, Obama invites Romney to "have lunch in private" and "maybe there is something Romney could do to help" with unemployment. Now, the real Obama, the socialist, communist Obama is "leaking out". Latest incarnation: "wealth tax". The voterbots will be carried away, swooned, by the covetous notion of "tax the other guy", this time going after the other person's wealth, setting the threshold at say $500K, maybe $1M, maybe $250K. And why should the 401K's and pensions be exempt? Another revenue grabber being dangled: government appropriation of everyone's 401K's with a "government defined and provided" annuity.

Here is a lesson in writing: do not address directly with derision. Do it indirectly. Don't make it personal. Here are a couple of your examples: "dufus" - (directed toward) me "fartonus" - spartacus My examples: "voterbots" - ?? "incredible gullibility" - ?? By making it indirect, the reader is more inclined to read the message without immediately dismissing it. The derision may be ultimately comprehended but the reader has to detemine that according to the content. I try to always follow this rule, though I may have slipped up. If we take time to post, we are trying to persuade, as opposed to simply lobbying insults. And I said "And you believed this?". It could have been stated, "Do you believe this?" Indeed, a challenge; either way, there is no specific derision involved.

But critics say federal spending is so massive that the wealthy don't have enough money to cover the nation's unprecedented debt. In an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell, rep. Tom Price said President Obama's plan on the wealthy would only generate enough revenue to fund the federal government for eight days. " The President's plan to increase taxes on the upper 2 percent covers the spending by this federal government for not 8 years, not for 8 months, not for 8 weeks but for 8 days, 8 days only," said Mr. Price.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1354152788070</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 20:33:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354160475910-59</Id><Topic><Title>Removing the smog from a smug Lib's brain</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1354152788070</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 20:33:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guess who pays when the libs find out that raising taxes on the rich doesn't make a dent in their massive spending?...the Middle Class pay the brunt of the massive debt like they always will.
