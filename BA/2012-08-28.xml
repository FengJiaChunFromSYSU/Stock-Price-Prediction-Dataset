If we are in the middle of an “economic recovery”, how can this possibly be happening? Stunning new statistics compiled by Sentier Research show that the U.S. economy is not nearly as healthy as we have been led to believe. According to the study that Sentier Research has just released, median household income in the United States was sitting at $55,470 back in January 2000. In December 2007, when the recession began, it was sitting at $54,916. In June 2009, when the recession supposedly ended, it was sitting at $53,508. Today, it is sitting at $50,964. This is a long-term trend that is definitely going in the wrong direction. The fact that median household income in the U.S. is now 4.8 percent lower than it was when the last recession ended is incredibly disturbing, especially since all of the things that we buy on a regular basis just keep going up in price. Food, gas, electricity, car insurance and health insurance all cost a whole lot more today than they did back in the year 2000, and yet median household income has dropped 8.1 percent since that time. So what does all of this mean? It means that American families ARE getting poorer. con't ........ http://www.infowars.com/it-is-not-just-your-imagination-american-families-are-getting-poorer/</Msg><Username>skeptically99</Username><Timestamp>1346168379000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 11:39:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346168674000-25</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Plays The Race Card</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_007</Username><Timestamp>1346090208000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 13:56:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't have to work at Bletchley Park to decode all the racist tripe put out by the repub propaganda apparatus.

Because under their plan the amount of seniors’ vouchers will not keep pace with rising health care costs. These numbers, the Center for American Progress points out, are even worse for future generations. In today’s dollars, seniors who qualify for Medicare in 2030 would see an increase of $124,600 in Medicare costs over their retirement. Seniors who qualify for Medicare in 2040 will see an increase of $216,600. And by 2050 newly eligible seniors will pay $331,200 more in Medicare costs over their retirement. That's the voucher portion of their plan. The privatizing portion of the plan is more problematic. There is a danger of insurance companies cherry picking, choosing to insure only the healthiest of policyholders. Because more emphasis will be made on private companies insuring seniors, Medicare would no longer enjoy a balanced risk pool and seniors choosing traditional Medicare could wind up paying an extra $29,000 on average, according to the American Center for Progress. The "repeal" of Obamacare is also problematic for seniors for several reasons, says the study.</Msg><Username>natsu4fun</Username><Timestamp>1346177557859</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:12:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346178146995-47</Id><Topic><Title>yearly defict grew at a rate on 150 billion a year under bush</Title><Username>andse2003</Username><Timestamp>1346163014339</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 10:10:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>~~~"First of all, I don't see America having (Financial) problems." -- GW Bush (R) Summer 2008~~~ He was correct however he was talking about the top .001% With the top .001% not paying their fair share and the middle class carrying that burden it shall continue till the middle class vote them radical right wingers out for good!</Msg><Username>natsu4fun</Username><Timestamp>1346178146995</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:22:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346178430293-48</Id><Title>Left wing Extremism...

Jackson asks why GOP 'spared' by tropical storm By Daniel Strauss - 08/27/12 04:53 PM ET Samuel L. Jackson on Monday tweeted it was "unfair" that Tropical Storm Isaac had spared the GOP convention in Tampa and appeared to be heading for New Orleans. Jackson said in a profanity-filled tweet that he was "not understanding God's plan" given the fact that the storm was not disrupting the Republican gathering. "Unfair s---," the Oscar-nominated actor known for his colorful language said on Twitter. "GOP spared by Isaac! NOLA prolly f----- again!" Less than a half-hour later, Jackson apologized for the earlier tweet, writing that it had stirred up a hornet's nest. "Apologies to God, Tampa, da GOP&amp; Isaac(sp)! Who played the Race card?!," he said on Twitter. Jackson isn't the only one to issue strongly worded language questioning a link between politics and Isaac. Over the past few days, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has suggested that serious warnings about tropical storm weather by the federal government was the Obama administration attempting to scuttle the Republican National Convention. Earlier on Monday, MSNBC host Chris Matthews accused presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans of playing the race card against Obama.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346178430293</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:27:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346179165492-49</Id><Title>The Best News Romney ca Have!</Title><Msg>Chinese media slams Romney as convention begins Posted By Josh Rogin Tuesday, August 28, 2012 - 1:08 PM Share China's state-controlled media lashed out at GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney Monday, warning that his policies would poison U.S.-China relations. "By any standard, the U.S. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's China policy, as outlined on his official campaign website, is an outdated manifestation of a Cold War mentality," read a commentary in Monday's China Daily. "It endorses the ‘China threat' theory and focuses on containing China's rise in the Asia-Pacific through bolstering the robust U.S. military presence in the region." The Chinese state-owned outlet said that Romney was "provoking" China by promising to supply Taiwan with aircraft and other military platforms and called his China approach "pugnacious." "[H]is China policy, if implemented, would cause a retrogression in bilateral ties and turn the region into a venue for open confrontation between China and the U.S.," the commentary stated. China Daily also compared Romney's approach with President Barack Obama's "pivot" toward Asia. The current administration is adding "fuel to the fire" in the South China Sea by involving itself in regional disputes, the commentary argued, but Romney's China policies would sour relations even further. "It requires political vision as well as profound knowledge of Sino-U.S. relations as a whole, to make sensible policy recommendations about what are widely recognized as the most important bilateral ties in the world," the commentary states. "Romney apparently lacks both." The China-East Asia page of the Romney campaign website promises that a Romney administration would increase U.S. naval presence in the Pacific and increase military assistance to regional allies "to discourage any aggressive or coercive behavior by China against its neighbors." The Romney campaign is also vowing to shine a brighter light on China's human rights abuses. "Any serious U.S. policy toward China must confront the fact that China's regime continues to deny its people basic political freedoms and human rights. A nation that represses its own people cannot be a trusted partner in an international system based on economic and political freedom," the website reads. But as the China Daily commentary notes, campaign rhetoric and government policy aren't always the same thing. U.S. presidential candidates of both parties have long taken a more strident tone toward China on the campaign trail, only to dial back their rhetoric while in office. Nor is the Romney team's position on China clear, as top campaign advisors disagree on how to deal with the Middle Kingdom's rise as a world power. The two co-chairs of Romney's Asia-Pacific policy team, former State Department official Evan Feigenbaum, a moderate realist, and Aaron Friedberg, a hawkish scholar, evince sharply different views on China. At the top of the Romney advisory structure, generalists like former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton are much more wary of a rising China than realists such as former World Bank President Bob Zoellick, who as a top State Department official urged China to become a "responsible stakeholder" in world affairs. As for Romney, he has promised to brand China a currency manipulator on day one of his presidency and the RNC draft platform posted by Politico calls on China to move toward democracy and condemns its South China Sea claims. "We will welcome the emergence of a peaceful and prosperous China, and we will welcome even more the development of a democratic China," the draft platform reads. "Its rulers have discovered that economic freedom leads to national wealth. The next lesson is that political and religious freedom lead to national greatness.

It wasn't me! That's Lindsay Lohan's claim in the investigation into the alleged theft of $100,000 worth of watches, sunglasses and monogrammed Tiffany tableware from a multimillionaire friend of hers. TMZ reports that Lohan is trying to pin the alleged burglary, which was reported to have happened during an all-night party at the home of her rich friend Sam Magid on August 20, on someone else. Magid initially called police after the all-nighter when he realized several items were missing. He recanted his report days later, but police continued with their investigation anyway. According to TMZ, under further questioning on Tuesday, Magid told police that Andrew Knight (who says he is record producer Suge Knight's son), said Lohan handed him and his friend a bag with stolen items wrapped in her shirt. Magid says Knight returned those items to him, but that other items were still missing. Wait, it gets weirder. Magid also said Lohan herself told him she had hidden several items in his house because she was afraid they would be stolen by burglars. TMZ's sources say Lohan told Magid she was on Ambien at the time, so she doesn't have a clear recollection of the night's events. Lohan also reportedly called Magid later and said: "I'm sorry. Please pray for me." Regardless, Lohan says Knight did it, but TMZ says law enforcement doesn't believer her, as she is still the target of the investigation, not Knight. Lohans rep did not return FOX411's repeated requests for comment. Lohan, 26, is also being investigated for lying to police after a car crash earlier this year in which she said she was just a passenger in the car. Cops think she was the driver. TMZ says the case will be referred to prosecutors and the L.A. City Attorney for a possible probation violation. Lohan is still on probation from an earlier theft case involving a necklace swiped from a Venice, Calif., jewelry store a year ago. If she’s found guilty this time, she could go to jail for violating her probation. And these are only the latest in a getting-long list of theft allegations involving the "Parent Trap" star. In 2008, she was accused by a model of stealing her mink coat from a coat pile at a party. In 2010, she was suspected of stealing a $35,000 Rolex watch. Both incidents were eventually called misunderstandings, and she was not charged.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346179468291</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:44:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346183286525-51</Id><Topic><Title>New air force 1</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1344854909000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 06:48:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>After the upcoming budget cuts the new Air Force 1 may be a Piper J-3.

Creationism is the religious belief[1] that humanity, life, the Earth, and the universe are the creation of a supernatural being, most often referring to the Abrahamic God. As science developed from the 18th century onwards, various views developed which aimed to reconcile science with the Abrahamic creation narrative.[2] At this time those holding that species had been separately created (such as Philip Gosse in 1847) were generally called "advocates of creation" but they were occasionally called "creationists" in private correspondence between Charles Darwin and his friends. As the creation–evolution controversy developed, the term "anti-evolutionists" became more common, then in 1929 in the United States the term "creationism" first became specifically associated with Christian fundamentalist disbelief in human evolution and belief in a young Earth, though its usage was contested by other groups, such as theistic evolutionists, who believed in various concepts of creation.[3]</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1346183500201</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:51:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346185645402-54</Id><Topic><Title>The Best News Romney ca Have!</Title><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346179165492</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:39:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Harry must have amnesia and forgot the 90`s, Republicans will have their little week in the sun this week, after this the election starts up and Romney wont even be able to buy this election.

Democratic State Representative Deborah Ross, the House Minority Whip from Wake County, is leading that charge. "It's clear that Romney-Ryan are wrong for us," Rep. Ross said. Joining her are other female Democratic leaders from around the state and the country, including congresswomen who served either with Ryan or while Romney was their governor. "He didn't run for re-election because he wasn't going to win re-election," Dem. Rep. Marty Walz, of Suffolk County, Mass. said. The women said their concerns range from healthcare to the economy. "Romney has said his first act would be to repeal the Affordable Care Act and that's something that we desperately need in North Carolina because we've had so much unemployment and those who have been unemployed just simply don't have access to healthcare," Dem. Candidate for Lt. Gov. Linda Coleman said. "We've had the old Romney-Ryan plan before the top-down, give wealthier folks more tax breaks and somehow that's going to trickle down, it didn't work, it led to this economic disaster that the president inherited. We tried that, it failed, the Obama plan is much better for North Carolina," Dem. Rep. Jennifer Weiss, of Wake County, said.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1346191565902</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 18:06:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346191766748-60</Id><Topic><Title>Romney is The Wrong Choice..!!!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1346191565902</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 18:06:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Obama Plan is indeed better.</Msg><Username>instant_karma48</Username><Timestamp>1346191766748</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 18:09:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346191811751-61</Id><Title>Mitt Romney Destroying the Republican Party</Title><Msg>TAMPA, Fla. - A last minute fight has erupted at the Republican National Convention over Romney campaign-supported rules that would allow Mitt Romney to "disavow" delegates, presumably Ron Paul's, that he doesn't want voting on his nomination. "This is like George Washington versus King George," said longtime Texas conservative activist and delegate Louis "Butch" Davis. "It's going to be a bloodbath." But the fight isn't between Paul and Romney, added Davis and activist groups like the Eagle Forum. What angers Davis and at least 12 state delegations is that the proposed rule would take away a state's right to pick their delegates. "That's the point of having an election," said Davis, who supports Romney. The Eagle Forum has led the assault on the GOP rules set to be approved by convention delegates on Tuesday. According to an emergency email sent by the Eagle Forum this week, "The proposed rule change would allow the residential nominee to 'disavow' duly elected delegates and force the states to hold new elections to replace any delegate or alternate deemed unacceptable by the nominee."</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1346191811751</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 18:10:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346192023609-62</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney Destroying the Republican Party</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1346191811751</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 18:10:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is going to be fun to watch.</Msg><Username>instant_karma48</Username><Timestamp>1346192023609</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 18:13:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346193120000-63</Id><Topic><Title>I srael Plans on COMPLETELY DESTROYING Iran's Infrastructure</Title><Username>skeptically99</Username><Timestamp>1346000055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:54:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.infowars.com/military-muppet-tv-character-urges-israelis-to-prepare-for-strike-on-iran/ &gt;&gt;But the ambition to set back Iran’s nuclear program could come at a high cost to I srael’s citizens, causing many I sraelis to protest a potential attack.

Much of the battle was over Mormons’ reluctance to give up polygamy. The very first Republican political platform, in 1856, condemned “those twin relics of barbarism—polygamy and slavery.” This was repeated in 1876 along with a demand for the “supremacy of American institutions in all the territories.” In 1884, Republicans bluntly took aim at the church by name, resolving “that it is the duty of Congress to enact such laws as shall promptly and effectually suppress the system of polygamy within our Territories; and divorce the political from the ecclesiastical power of the so-called Mormon church.” It added that the enforcement should be “by the military, if need be.” It was the first time—and, along with the 1888 Republican platform, the only time—in American history that any Republican or Democratic platform singled out a specific religion for condemnation. It was even more pointed in 1888, when the party declared, “The political power of the Mormon Church in the Territories as exercised in the past is a menace to free institutions too dangerous to be longer suffered.” It promised legislation “stringent enough to divorce the political from the ecclesiastical power, and thus stamp out the attendant wickedness of polygamy.” Now, 124 years after the party condemned the Mormon church as “a menace” and “too dangerous to be longer suffered,” the Republican Party is nominating for president a great-great-grandson of a church leader of that day and a man who, top aide Eric Fehrnstrom said on Monday, will talk in his acceptance address about his time as a Mormon bishop.</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1346200502439</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 20:35:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346201892952-81</Id><Title>The difference between Harry Reid and Willard Rmoney</Title><Msg>one is an astute politician, a smart man, a good man, and a faithful mormon (despite what he said about the tourists in august in d.c.)\ the other is a flip-flopping windsock who wants to buy the presidency and is lousy mormon who wants to bet/wager say $10,000.00 and who is going down in flames, big-time, along with the do-nothing teabaggerd republicons in November along with the lyin' ryan buh-bye</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1346201892952</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 20:58:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346202121132-82</Id><Title>Boeing update averagecardplayer</Title><Msg>so average card player how did you like the Boeing update eh! learning anything yet?
