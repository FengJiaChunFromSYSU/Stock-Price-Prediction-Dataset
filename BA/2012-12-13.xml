He got it completely wrong wrong but was still embraced by rich nut jobs on the left. His co-author was John Holdren another brain damaged nut job that was completely wrong in his thinking. That's who Obama has in his administration as an advisor and that who Obama is listening to for advice. Ehrlich and Holdren are arrogant delusional people who have a superiority complex (imagined because they are failures in the world outside of academia) and they are angry haters of humans. They see humans as stupid cattle that need to be controlled so as not to upset the delicate balance of Gaia. Truthfully though, when you read some of the views by clowns here who are thrilled to have government take control over their lives, don't you begin to understand where haters like Ehrlich and Holdren got the idea that humans are just stupid cattle that need to be controlled? ;-)</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355392465019</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 04:54:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355398189073-4</Id><Topic><Title>Unions Threaten Civil War</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355373122643</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 23:32:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"From what I saw they threw punches like girls."

"The Jeep ad was brazenly false," Angie Drobnic Holan wrote in her analysis. The Romney campaign ran the ad in the final weeks of the campaign, drawing sharp rebukes from the automakers and public condemnation from the Obama campaign. Romney first claimed Jeep was moving to China in a late October campaign speech in Ohio, citing "reports," which he later identified in his ad as a story by Bloomberg News. But Chrysler immediately rejected the claim, saying the company was reviewing adding production in China, not moving production out of the United States. Chrysler also noted that the Bloomberg story was misinterpreted. It appeared that the false interpretation was initially made by the Washington Examiner's Paul Bedard, who wrote about the Bloomberg story Oct. 25. Bedard's claim was then circulated by the Drudge Report. Democrats, including the Obama campaign, used Romney's decision to stand by the false claim against him, attacking Romney's honesty. "After Romney's false claim of Jeep outsourcing to China, Chrysler itself has refuted Romney's lie," an announcer read in an Obama campaign ad that painted Romney as "wrong on Ohio jobs." PolitiFact suggested Wednesday that the ad was partly responsible for Romney's loss. "People often say that politicians don't pay a price for deception, but this time was different: A flood of negative press coverage rained down on the Romney campaign, and he failed to turn the tide in Ohio, the most important state in the presidential election," Holan wrote.</Msg><Username>the_loading_dock_01</Username><Timestamp>1355398336055</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 06:32:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355400869860-6</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP is dying</Title><Username>spartacus778899</Username><Timestamp>1354884997085</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 07:56:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Notice how many ID's he has?

Study: Tax Cuts for the Rich Don't Spur Growth Cutting taxes for the wealthy does not generate faster economic growth, according to a new report. But those cuts may widen the income gap between the rich and the rest, according to a new report. A study from the Congressional Research Service -- the non-partisan research office for Congress -- shows that "there is little evidence over the past 65 years that tax cuts for the highest earners are associated with savings, investment or productivity growth." In fact, the study found that higher tax rates for the wealthy are statistically associated with higher levels of growth. The finding is likely to fuel to the already bitter political fight over taxing the rich, with President Obama and the Democrats calling for higher taxes on the wealthy to reduce the deficit and fund spending. Mitt Romney and the GOP advocate lower marginal tax rates for top earners, saying they fuel investment and job creation. The CRS study looked at tax rates and economic growth since 1945. The top tax rate in 1945 was above 90 percent, and fell to 70 percent in the 1960s and to a low of 28 percent in 1986. The top current rate is 35 percent. The tax rate for capital gains was 25 percent in the 1940s and 1950s, then went up to 35 percent in the 1970s, before coming down to 15 percent today - the lowest rate in more than 65 years. Lowering these rates for the wealthy, the study found, isn't aligned with significant improvement in any of the areas it examined. Pushing tax rates down had a "negligible effect" on private saving, and while it does note a relationship between investing and capital gains rates, the correlations "are not statistically significant," the study says. "Top tax rates," it concludes, "do not necessarily have a demonstrably significant relationship with investment." The study said that lower marginal rates have a "slight positive effect" on productivity while lower capital gains rates have a "slight negative association" with productivity. But, again, neither effect was considered statistically significant. Do higher taxes on the rich lead to faster economic growth? Not necessarily. The paper says that while growth accelerated with higher taxes on the rich, the relationship is "not strong" and may be "coincidental," since broader economic factors may be responsible for that growth. There is one part of the economy, however, that is changed by tax cuts for the rich: inequality. The study says that the biggest change in the distribution of U.S. income has been with the top 0.1 percent of earners - not the one percent. The share of total income going to the top 0.1 percent hovered around 4 percent during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, then rose to 12 percent by the mid-2000s. During this period, the average tax rate paid by the 0.1 percent fell from more than 40 percent to below 25 percent. The study said that "as top tax rates are reduced, the share of income accruing to the top of the income distribution increases" and that "these relationships are statistically significant." In other words, cutting taxes on the rich may not grow the economic pie. But the study found that those cuts can effect "how that economic pie is sliced."</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1355413175340</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:39:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355414086026-22</Id><Title>Republicans losing public opinion wars in "fiscal cliff" talks</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Negotiations are expected to continue Thursday on the "fiscal cliff" with Republicans at a growing public opinion disadvantage and approval ratings for President Barack Obama rising. Republicans are in a bad negotiating position. The Democratic-controlled Senate has already passed a bill preserving tax cuts for the middle-class, leaving the Republican-controlled House standing in the way. Polling shows strong support for Obama's position. According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC survey released late Wednesday, three-quarters of Americans say they would accept raising taxes on the wealthy to avoid the cliff. Among Republicans, some 61 percent say they would accept tax increases on high earners. An ABC News-Washington Post poll released Tuesday indicted that nearly half of Americans approve of Obama's handling of the negotiations versus the quarter of respondents who approved of Boehner's. At the same time, Obama's public opinion rating has reached about 54 percent . Boehner, meanwhile, faces increasingly conflicting pressures, from the right to hold firm, from the Republican center to be flexible and from the polls to abandon his position. A leading conservative who's resigning from the Senate is predicting that President Barack Obama will win the battle over raising taxes. South Carolina Republican Jim DeMint calls it "a political trophy" within Obama's grasp.</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1355414086026</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:54:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355414108509-23</Id><Topic><Title>Dreamliner starting to look like the Hughs "flying goose"</Title><Username>art.constantine</Username><Timestamp>1355406790763</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 08:53:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just flew the ANA flight last week from NRT to SEA and it was awesome.

Obama Sets Gas Prices? Just Another G.O.P. Myth! The issue of gas prices has not only been misunderstood but thoroughly distorted by relentless ideological spin from industry and its political allies, mainly Republican. Hardly a day goes by that some industry cheerleader somewhere — be it Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana or Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma — does not flay President Obama for driving up oil prices by denying the industry access to oil and gas deposits and imposing ruinous environmental rules. Senator John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, said last week that Mr. Obama should be held “fully responsible for what the American public is paying for gasoline.” If only the president had the power to give us $2.50-a-gallon gasoline, as Newt Gingrich promised to do if he got to the White House. It is ridiculous to think that a president can. One can sympathize with consumers feeling the pain of higher gas prices. But the fundamental truth is that those prices are tied to the price of oil, set by world markets. There are peaks and valleys, but their causes — a worldwide recession, an embargo or conflict in the Middle East — are beyond the control of any one country. As the chart below shows, gasoline prices rise and fall in the same pattern throughout the world. Americans historically pay much less at the pump because they pay lower taxes; when the price of a gallon spikes at $3.70 in the United States, it is closer to $8 in, say, Germany. Because oil is a global commodity, increasing domestic production will do very little to bring down retail prices, although it does help narrow the trade deficit as America spends less on imports. On this score, America is doing much better than the Republicans will admit. In 2005, oil imports accounted for nearly 60 percent of America’s daily consumption. In 2010, for the first time in recent memory, imports were less than half of consumption, and last year, imports were only 45 percent — 8.6 million barrels a day of the 19 million consumed. There are two reasons for this welcome shift: production is up and oil consumption is down. Production of crude oil and other liquid fuels, onshore and offshore, reached about 10.3 million barrels daily in 2011, its highest level since the late 1980s. Some of the biggest discoveries have occurred on private land in deep shale formations in Texas and North Dakota, and production on federal land is beginning to boom, too. The real issue, which industry’s allies never mention, is whether the oil companies are fully exploiting the federal resources they already control. Mr. Bingaman notes that 7,000 approved onshore drilling permits have been sitting unused by the companies that own them, and that millions of acres under lease in the gulf remain unexplored. The most encouraging news is on the consumption side. Americans are getting more miles to the gallon, which means there’s that much less carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere. We used 20.8 million barrels a day in 2005, the highest level in history. That dropped to just under 19 million barrels last year, and, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, is likely to stay there awhile. The recession has had a lot to do with the decline, but so has fuel efficiency. Ten years ago, cars and light trucks (including S.U.V.’s) averaged 24.7 miles a gallon. In 2011, the figure rose to 29.6 miles a gallon as consumers chose more efficient cars. Two landmark agreements between the administration and the automakers — aimed at improving efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases — could raise it to 55 miles per gallon by 2025. Despite this progress, ending dependence on foreign oil seems as remote as when President Richard Nixon proposed it. With developing countries like China and India demanding more petroleum, prices are likely to stay high. That’s reality — no matter what the Republican spinners say. Only a rounded policy mix of greater fuel efficiency, steady production and the aggressive development of alternative fuels can protect American consumers against what could be even greater price shocks in the years ahead.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1355414389724</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:59:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355414474734-26</Id><Title>SEIA Congratulates Obama on Re-Election, Praises Administration’s Energy Policy</Title><Msg>The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) today released the following statement from president and CEO Rhone Resch in reaction to President Barack Obama’s re-election for a second term: “SEIA congratulates President Barack Obama on his reelection. President Obama has been a tremendous supporter of solar energy and we look forward to continuing to work with the Obama Administration over the next four years. “To date, the Obama Administration has created and supported pro-solar policies that have been vital to the success of the industry. Solar installations and jobs have risen dramatically throughout the U.S, while costs have fallen. Today, the solar industry employs more than 119,000 Americans at 5,600 companies, mostly small businesses, across all 50 states – this is more than double the number of Americans working in solar in 2009. “Since President Obama took office, the amount of solar powering homes, businesses, and military bases has grown by 400 percent – from 1,100 megawatts in 2008 to more than 5,700 megawatts today. The Administration enacted a policy allowing solar installations for the first time on public lands and set a goal to permit 10 gigawatts of additional renewable energy projects on public lands by the end of 2012, which has been a great driver of this growth. The U.S. now has enough installed solar capacity to power nearly a million households, and 2012 will be another year of record growth for our industry. “Policy certainty is crucial to continue the growing role of solar in America’s energy mix. Stable policy frameworks at the federal and state level, including maintaining and expanding commitments to renewable energy initiatives, spur and leverage private sector investments in the solar industry to meet our nation’s future energy needs. “As we recover from the recession, America needs plentiful and diverse energy resources, including solar, to power our economy. Solar is clean, reliable, and more affordable than ever. Since the beginning of 2011, the average cost of solar panels has dropped more than 50 percent and the cost of a solar electric system has dropped by more than a third, thanks to innovation, entrepreneurship, and strong federal and state policies leveraging private investment. “More than nine out of 10 voters want the U.S. to develop and use more solar power, and the president understands the importance of solar to the American people. The solar industry looks forward to continuing our productive working relationship with the Obama Administration, the incoming 113th Congress, and state legislatures throughout the country to create smart policies that help power our homes and businesses with domestic energy and create jobs across America.”</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1355414474734</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:01:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355414564877-27</Id><Topic><Title>Every Dreamliner ever made may be grounded due to electrical issues.</Title><Username>art.constantine</Username><Timestamp>1355406976805</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 08:56:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You need to spend your time looking at all the problems with the Dreamliner 787.

But Unionizing Should Be</Title><Msg>The adoption of so-called "right to work" legislation in Michigan, of all places, represents an historic setback for organized labor. First, Republicans went after public employees in the birthplace of public unions, Wisconsin. And now they have taken the fight to private employee unions in the cradle of modern industrial unionism. Conservatives are right that, if they can win in Michigan, they can win almost anywhere. Despite the arguments advanced by right to work proponents that they are trying to make Michigan more attractive to businesses, this legislation was a calculated effort by conservatives and business interests like the Koch brothers to redistribute political power from Democrats to Republicans (hence the exemption for police and firefighters, who are friendlier to Republicans) and from workers to employers. Previously in Michigan, no one was forced to join a union, but workers who benefited from collective bargaining were required to pay fees to cover the cost of that bargaining. The new law eliminates that requirement, allowing employees to benefit without paying a fee, thereby weakening unions’ ability to participating in politics and negotiate for better wages. As President Obama noted, right to work legislation is really about "the right to work for less money." Nevertheless, there is an important lesson for liberals and labor in the Michigan story about the power of rhetoric. "Right to work" is a mendacious slogan but a politically resonant one. It's mendacious because everyone in every state has the right to work; the legislation simply gives employees the right to be free riders--to benefit from collective bargaining without paying for it. Yet members of the media mostly employ the phrase without qualification. (Even those that say "so-called" right to work repeat the phrase over and over again.) This past Saturday, the Washington Post'sfront page featured stories on gay marriage going before the U.S. Supreme Court and the right to work debate in Michigan--and a casual reader could assume that both stories were about "rights" ascendant. The brilliance of the slogan is that it pits the individual's "right" to choose whether to pay dues (and who likes paying dues?) against the interests of large institutions (labor unions). Labor responds with a justifiable plea about the need for workers to be united and pay their fair share for representation (and, ultimately, better wages). But when the fight is framed as individual rights vs. solidarity, rights usually win. Indeed, when asked to identify government's most important role, 59 percent said in a 2010 Rasmussen poll that it is to protect individual rights and liberty. Rather than continuing the losing battle of solidarity vs. rights, it's time for liberals and labor to engage in the battle over what kind of rights workers should enjoy. The most vivid way for labor to recapture the rhetoric of "rights" is to propose amending the Civil Rights Act to make it illegal to fire or otherwise discriminate against employees for trying to organize a union. Currently, employers frequently target the ringleaders in a union drive, terminate their employment, and scare everyone else, paying only very modest financial penalties for violating our labor laws. Making this behavior illegal under the Civil Rights Act would substantially toughen penalties and help Americans understand that such abusive employer behavior involves a violation of the basic individual right to choose to join a union. It would be much harder for legislators to vote against "civil rights" for workers than it is for them now to oppose "labor law reform." Some members of the labor movement are beginning to talk about labor organizing as a civil right. In Canton, Mississippi, the United Auto Workers has been arguing that “worker rights is the civil rights battle of the 21st Century” as its tries to gain collective bargaining for a mostly black workforce at a Nissan Motors plant. If successful, this effort would provide a powerful response to opponents of labor – in the heart of the anti-labor South no less. If organized labor is to survive in the United States, it can't just fight against the idea of individual rights. Instead, it needs to embrace them in a new campaign that makes Americans understand that the right to organize is being violated by employers every day -- and that the winners are the 1 Percent and their Republican allies. Richard D. Kahlenberg is a senior fellow at The Century Foundation and Moshe Z. Marvit is a labor and civil rights attorney.

Umm, okay. Fracking fluids contain chemicals and additives that these guys keep secret, but what's known is already a laundry list of known carcinogenics. To understand what they're doing, here's The Fracking Song to explain it: Lyrics: Fracking is a form of natural gas drilling An alternative to oil cause the oil kept spilling Bringing jobs to small towns so everybody’s willing People turn on their lights and the drillers make a killing Water goes into the pipe, the pipe into the ground The pressure creates fissures 7,000 feet down The cracks release the gas that powers your town That well is fracked….. Yeah totally fracked But there’s more in the water than just H2O Toxic chemicals help to make the fluid flow With names like benzene and formaldehyde You better keep ‘em far away from the water supply The drillers say the fissures are a mile below The groundwater pumped into American homes But don’t tell it to the residents of Sublette Wy-O That water’s fracked….

With the EPA out it was up to the states But they didn’t have the money to investigate Sick people couldn’t prove fracking was to blame All the while water wells were going up in flames Cause it’s hard to contain all the methane released It can get into the air, it can get into the streams. It’s a greenhouse gas, worse than CO2 Fracking done wrong could lead to climate change too Now it’s not that drillers should never be fracking But the current regulation is severely lacking Reduce the toxins, contain the gas and wastewater And the people won’t get sick and the planet won’t get hotter What the frack is going on with all this fracking going on I think we need some facts to come to light I know we want our energy but nothing ever comes for free I think my water’s on fire tonight</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1355416485610</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:34:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355416575032-36</Id><Topic><Title>I Love it when i wake up in the morning and Obama is President !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1355328693914</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 11:11:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>simple; I love it that repukes are bleeding, selling their kids fortune, in chaos, bailing on their principles...

The stock rose $3.09, or 38.6 percent, to $11.09 in afternoon trading, after reaching as high as $11.35 earlier. The San Mateo, Calif., company, started by PayPal founder Elon Musk, cut its expectations for the offer on Wednesday. It issued 11.5 million shares at $8 per share, for proceeds of $92M. SolarCity offers homeowners a "solar lease" that allows them to pay for the panels and electricity that they generate over time, often for less than it would cost to buy electricity from a local utility. The company has been growing quickly, aided by a huge decline in the price of solar panels. While that has crushed solar panel makers' profits, lower prices have also boosted installers' prospects by allowing them to sell solar-generated electricity cheaper than grid power with no upfront investment.</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1355418738866</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 12:12:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355418858435-49</Id><Topic><Title>Dreamliner - Breaking news</Title><Username>fortuneking1</Username><Timestamp>1355417333266</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:48:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“Two aircraft having the same problem -- the same major problem -- so quickly is a cause of concern,” Al Baker said, adding that Doha-based Qatar Air will ask Boeing to cover its losses. “Definitely we will demand compensation.

As politicians, businessmen and ordinary citizens brace for spending cuts and tax hikes in the new year, a long-term Republican advisor says the U.S. should take the "fiscal cliff" plunge. "Let the fiscal cliff happen and reduce the deficit very substantially as a consequence,"says Bruce Bartlett, author of The Benefit and Burden: Tax Reform--Why We Need It and What It Will Take. The combination of spending cuts and tax hikes will eventually strengthen the economy he says, citing CBO analysis. In contrast, Republicans' refusal to raise taxes would hurt the economy in the long run, Bartlett argues. Related: Higher Taxes Will Create Jobs and Cut the Deficit: David Cay Johnston Bartlett, a former advisor to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and Congressman Ron Paul, explains why the GOP tax pledge has harmful consequences for the economy. Government spending will rise over the coming decades as more baby boomers retire. But if tax revenues don't keep pace with spending, the federal government will be forced to increase borrowing, which will increase interest payments on the debt. According to Bartlett, a GAO report projects that the Republican plan to keep revenues at just under 18% of GDP will cause interest on the debt to surge from 19.2% of the deficit this year to 62% in 2020. Bartlett is not advocating big spending increases --- he'd rather trim spending-- but he says revenues must keep up with spending. Going over the fiscal cliff is a move in that direction because revenues would rise as the Bush-era tax cuts expire for everyone, not just the top 2%, at the same that spending is reduced.

But companies will only take ONE fixed amount fromm paychecks, so beck objectors have to pay in cash or by check or credit card a reduced amount at least on a quarterly basis. So there is a way out but unions do NOT make it obvious, and the audits are suspect. even then, the diversion of funds is not obvious. For example, at SPEEA, over 1 million of dues goes to IFPTE. Of that, according to IFPTE, about 30 percent goes to AFL_CIO for NON UNION business. ( read support the democrat of trumkas choice ). SPEEA is exactly correct when they say no money goes ( directly ) to support any political party or candidate. But indirectly, about $300,000 or more per year goes to AFL-CIO, who for some reason does NOT support very many republican candidates (;-PPPP) NOw if unions were more open and honest, and freeely published what the reduced rates were, and without a hassle, a lot of the arguments AGAINST agency fee would dissappear.

He said in this article: "We study GE more than anything....We want the GE culture and style to define the new culture and style of Boeing. I am very fond of Jack Welch It's a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one's safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a space ship or a 787 outsourcing )contract. Alan Shepard Boeing stock as usual and par for the dead cat bounce for years now , has hit the 75 barrier and is retreating, nothing new except more BA-GE-MD manangement failure. This all comes to the Boeing shareholder who pays, with excessive executive pay and bonus and failed outsourcing business plan. The failed , GE managment style as applied to the most complicated machine in the world to build is a airplane. It takes time and decades of experience to be a great Boeing Engineer(SPEEA) or a first class Install and assembly blue collar( IAM ) worker who can explain and help the engineer's fix the new plane problem's . It would help if all in the workers were located in the same Everett location. It does not help to have outsoruced contractors all over the world making the parts at teh cheapest possible price. All of these ,contractors are people who have the same different languages and written communication skills. . It sure helps to have over 100 years of same location worker base as with the 777 the last Boeing engineered airplan, to draw upon. . It make no sense to move the managment headquarters out of Washington State The fix for the 787 is simple, reorganize management and get rid of current failed managment and their failed outsourcing business plan.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355430586638</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 15:29:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355430624417-86</Id><Topic><Title>"Right to Work" Isn't a Civil Right.

The union says Boeing's current offer would cut retirement benefits 40 percent and salary growth 22 percent while raising medical costs 12 percent. SPEEA has struck twice before: a one-day walkout in 1993, and a 40-day stoppage in 2000. Both actions occurred early in the year and after talks with a mediator had failed to produce a labor agreement. If they walked out, SPEEA's engineers and technical workers could stop production of 52 jets a month, worth nearly $8 billion at list prices.</Msg><Username>fortuneking1</Username><Timestamp>1355431643877</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 15:47:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355432099563-90</Id><Title>Please, someone with the information please respond.</Title><Msg>One generator failure out of six is no big deal.

In the past( 100% success) , Boeing had given its suppliers very detailed specification ( like the 777). But with the 787, Boeing let the suppliers do the design and the manufacturing. The old way worked to perfection on the 777 after 100 years of perfecting the process but the inexperienced and new management team comprised of a man with zero airplane production experience( James McNerney) combined with a bankrupt MD airplane company executive( Harry Stonecipher) made a bad management plan. . The Boeing Company executives left out the 787 design and build plan were the experienced and skilled Boeing workers who just a few years earlier had designed and built the 777 airplane . The 777 came in on time and on budget, a perfect plane and no new plane problems . As AlBaker said, the 777 truly does provide Qatar Airways with global coverage and Al Baker, appreciates a Boeing designed and made 777. Compared to Al Baker on teh outsourced 787 plane, he is less than thrilled , to say the least with the new inexperienced Boeing management who gave the airlines and the Boeing shareholders the 787 (TL) business plan failure , Qatar Airways Chief on todays 787 , Al Baker , said” We will demand compensation (from Boeing)... we are buying planes from them to use them, not to put in a museum." Baker want's the lemon law refund . He should and the Boeing shareholders need to stay away from teh dad cat bouce Boeing stock price which moves slow ans goes to 75 and fails . year to date Boeing stock price is now at a gain of 1.32% and until the Boeing mangment team is removed and a new team installed this stock is not one to hold. Now the new tax plan increases the dividend tax from 15% to about 50% another reason to drop BA stock. Better Dow stocks to own are easy to find, BAC up 89% year to date for one example sure beats 1 % for Boeing .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355437713908</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 17:28:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355438292481-115</Id><Topic><Title>Susan Rice out of consideration for Secretary of State.</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1355435282668</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 16:48:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Democrats put up competent people and the gasbgs of the far right shoot them down with wild imaginings.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1355438292481</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 17:38:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355438440240-116</Id><Topic><Title>Abe Leboriel drummer with Paul McCartney concert for Sandy</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1355433252605</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 16:14:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good luck playing like ringo with paul but only as good or better the line for that job...starts where... i;ve got a whistle and would like to learn how to play 500,000 watt electric mouth organ you blow in one side and it comes out the other with it's tongue 777 beats eights and aces but that was a good try No Doubt - the fiscal cliff is in the : ON position</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1355438440240</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 17:40:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355438905222-117</Id><Title>Two leaders a Boeing Executive a American President both Harvard Graduates! result!</Title><Msg>Appraisals are where you get together with your team leader and agree what an outstanding member of the team you are, how much your contribution has been valued, what massive potential you have and, in recognition of all this, would you mind having your salary halved.

The latest in a long line of angry customer airlines is Qatar Ariways who calls the problems with the outsourced 787 unacceptable “They have to get their act together very fast because we at Qatar Airways will not accept any more defects.” As a customer or a passenger , It's a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one's safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a 787 outsourcing contract. . The 787 airplanes , have failed , from the launch customer to the latest customer in the 14 months , almost none of the 787 have been trouble free as yet. These 787 planes were tested and certified by both Boeing and FAA to work right from day one, just like all airplanes that Boeing has built.. The last 100% Boeing designed airplane was the 777 which has close to perfect record from day one to today. Boeing's SPEEA designed 777 was first placed into commercial airline service in 1995. on budget and on time . As of June 2012, 60 customers have placed orders for 1,372 aircraft of all variants, with 1,025 delivered. The current leader of Boeing is living in denial, he actually said all those 787 sitting around the Everett factory looked good waiting for fixes. This man needs to be replaced along with his ideas, but then MMM and GE already figured that out . Teh Jim plane is outsourced 60% and designed by non SPEEA engineers, the result is 3 years late to a angry customer base adn angry shareholder holding the 30 billion extra cost over the budget expected.
