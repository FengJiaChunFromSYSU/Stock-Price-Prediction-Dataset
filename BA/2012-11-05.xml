However since "ACORN" (a liberal group bent on corrupting the voting process), along with the ACORN wannabees, there are now questions as to who is voting. Eligibility (like citizenship, for example) and the number of times one thinks that they can vote seem to be a mystery to some people. We could do like is done in the Middle East - use an ink that is near impossible to clean off. Anyone with a "purple thumb", obviously a person who has already voted, cannot re-enter the polling place. And, we could also employ the Middle Eastern rule of cutting off hands just to scare the would be multi-voter. Still, eligibility, i.e., citizenship, is not validated by purple thumbs. Identification is the only way. What was done 25 years ago, just like Obama opined, however incorrectly, about our no longer using bayonets in the military, is simply not good enough today.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1352095126830</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 00:58:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352102863376-2</Id><Topic><Title>Romney/other Financiers Ruining USA</Title><Username>bobncarol1</Username><Timestamp>1352091343949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 23:55:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>God post... and to think that middle class folks will vote for for this parasite, amazes me.</Msg><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1352102863376</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 03:07:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352103513444-3</Id><Title>Republican Tax Priorities: Republicans would cut taxes for wealthy heirs and raise them for working families.</Title><Msg>If Congressional Republicans get their way, expiring cuts in the estate tax for America’s wealthiest families will be extended in 2013. But under their cruel plan, enhancements to tax credits for low- and moderate-income working families, which are also set to expire at the end of the year, would end. Extending the estate tax cut would benefit the estates of the wealthiest 0.3 percent of Americans who die in 2013 — about 7,000 people. Ending the tax credits would hurt some 13 million working families, including nearly 26 million children, many of whom live at or near the poverty line. Republicans in the House have already approved legislation — and similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate — that would undo a compromise tax plan approved in 2010. Back then, Republicans demanded estate tax cuts in exchange for extending the bolstered earned-income tax credits and child tax credits for working families that had been part of the 2009 stimulus. Under duress, the Obama administration agreed to temporarily raise the value of an estate that would be exempt from tax to $5 million ($10 million for married couples) from $3.5 million ($7 million for couples), the level in 2009. It also agreed to cut the top estate tax rate to 35 percent from 45 percent. In exchange for that tax cut, Republicans agreed to preserve improvements to the earned-income tax credit and child credit that help to ensure that low-income working families with children do not fall below the poverty line. Now, with another year-end showdown looming over expiring tax cuts, Republicans want to keep the generous provisions for the estate tax and end the enhancements to the working family tax credits. The winners would be the few and the wealthy: the Tax Policy Center has estimated that the estate tax breaks save wealthy heirs an average of $1.1 million per estate, compared with the 2009 estate tax law. The losers would be the many and the hard pressed: a married couple with three children and earnings at the estimated poverty line ($27,713) would lose $1,934 in tax credits in 2013, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The divide is especially noteworthy in the swing states. In Florida, 900 estates would get an estate-tax break, while nearly one million Florida families, with 1.7 million children, would see a tax increase. In Ohio, 140 estates would get a tax cut, while nearly 500,000 families, with nearly one million children, would face higher taxes. In Virginia, 220 estates would get a tax break, compared with 275,000 working families, with nearly 500,000 children, that would have their taxes rise. The heirs of the wealthiest people in America do not need continued tax breaks, nor can the nation afford the giveaway. Low- and moderate-income working Americans need all the help they can get. That is not the way Republicans see it, but that is the way it is.

Now, from a recent cable, we know that the latter was untrue, and that the only fog of war consisted in a handful of administration spokespeople frantically trying to get their stories straight. Real-time aerial video of a battle is not the fog of Wellington trying to figure out where Napoleon will strike next. The central issue of the entire Libyan debacle remains motive: Why did the administration ignore repeated warnings of the vulnerability of our people on the ground, and of likely Islamist attacks? Then, in the middle of a video-filmed assault, why were they frozen into inaction as Americans fought to the death, Alamo style? And then why in the aftermath did they they fob culpability off on an obscure two-month-old video, and arrest the director on trumped-up probation charges? And why now do they have no fallback narrative other than silence? In place of truth, we have only speculations about an upcoming election: Obama’s Libya-as-a-success narrative, and the greater Obama narrative of a Middle East Arab Spring in the post–al-Qaeda, post–bin Laden age were endangered by the truth of an al-Qaeda preplanned hit amid the chaos of post-lead-from-behind Libya. That was considered toxic, and meant that supposed foreign-policy competence could not offset, in the voters’ minds, economic incompetence. Until the attack, the administration had also squared the circle of quietly adopting the Bush anti-terrorism protocols, while waging a PC offense on citing radical Islam as the danger (e.g., man-caused disasters, workplace violence, overseas-contingencies operations, KSM in civil court, Mutallab and his Miranda rights, the al Arabiya interview, Muslim Outreach as NASA’s mission, the Cairo Speech, Muslim Brotherhood as secular, etc.). But the Libya hit also undermined that entire narrative, suggesting that the PC chickens had finally come home to roost with dead Americans precisely because of such politically driven laxity. We are now in a surreal situation in which the administration, its congressional protectors, and the compliant media are all in a no-comment holding pattern until after the election, when the truth will come out, in the same way that Watergate could no longer be suppressed after the 1972 election. It is only a matter of time when those who told initial untruths leak information about who told them to promulgate such unbelievable narratives. And we still do not know exactly why the ambassador was in Benghazi, with whom he was meeting, what exactly was the U.S. doing or not doing in postbellum Libya, and why did Stevens so fear for the safety of his people in a country declared a model of U.S. and allied intervention. The secretary of state is in a bind. Susan Rice was groomed to replace her, as she prepared to successfully bow out after the reelection of Barack Obama, ostensibly to ready herself for Clinton 3.0. Now she dares not leave, given that in her absence her directorship at State will be scapegoated by the administration and the Obama-fed media. So she stays, as Susan Rice recedes into the background after being used — and subsequently humiliated — in advancing a scripted administration falsehood about the video. Amid this chaos, there will be some officials, who warned of the danger, who knew Libya was not safe, who wanted to send help to our trapped contingent, who did not think the attack came from mere protesters angry over a video, who were enraged by the cover-up, who resented the blame-gaming — and who will ultimately not stay quiet.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1352124559578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 09:09:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352126443445-16</Id><Title>500 retired generals, admirals announce support for Mitt....</Title><Msg>Five hundred retired generals and admirals are running an ad in Monday's editions of The Washington Times calling on the country to elect Republican Mitt Romney on Tuesday.

CBS News' Political Director John Dickerson said Monday on "CBS This Morning" that after proportioning the states that will definitively vote for each candidate, Mr. Obama has 237 electoral votes and Romney has 191. "Obama has a head start," Dickerson said. He added that the president has 431 possible scenarios to win and Romney has far fewer, just 76. And if Romney wins Florida's 29 electoral votes, Ohio's 15, North Carolina's 15 and the 13 in Virginia, Dickerson said, Romney still needs another state. National Journal correspondent Major Garrett said on the same program that if the Obama campaign wins Florida, which they are more optimistic about this week after early voting tallies, the president needs just one more state to clinch victory.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1352127736868</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 10:02:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352128193140-21</Id><Topic><Title>Exclusive: Christie was Mitt's first choice for VP</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1351952489938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 10:21:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"bet that Mitt's wishing he could trade Ryan..." Not likely. Christie is a "colorful" and tough character, but often crude and rude. Ryan, for all the hissing that is caused of the liberals, is hard working, dedicated, and knowledgeable about the Federal budgetary process. That is going to be valuable in order to know how to clean up the Obama fiscal mess. And, with Paul Ryan, there will not be a need to order special, heavy-duty, furniture in the White House.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1352128193140</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 10:09:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352128282650-22</Id><Topic><Title>The Goofy Old Party way</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1351877161193</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 13:26:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That says that CRS is vulnerable to pressure from those who want a study to show a particular outcome.

Only God knows for sure what will happen. But I have been amused by these polls and predictions. I am surprised that the Democrats haven't employed an army of psychics, soothsayers, and mediums. Might as well. Nate Silver looks at poll data and the poll data has been shown to be biased by the liberal media (though lately it seems to be "dead even"). Integrating data that is skewed will derive a skewed result. Same problem with some of the global warming analyses. Som of the die hard and radical "Warmists" wanted there to be a certain answer so they "tweaked" the data. Or, more simply, lied. Nate Silver is a liberal embracing the full liberal agenda. Hopefully, the result of this "overwhelming 86%" prediction will deter some of the Obamaphiles and Voterbots to stay clear of the polls, those that have no more passion about America than stink bugs, by thinking that "it is in the bag".

L. Douglas Wilder, who backed Democrat Barack Obama for president in 2008, did not endorse Obama or Republican Mitt Romney in an opinion column released days before the election. "I have campaigned for and supported the president in the past and many people now want to discuss his job performance with me," Wilder writes in a column for Reuters. "They often note that Obama ran as a moderate — and that is the man they threw their support behind in 2008. But some look back and say that he has governed as a left-of-center liberal who did not keep the focus squarely on jobs and economic recovery. "Is that group of independent-minded voters enough to swing Virginia's 13 electoral votes away from Obama on Tuesday? The race is so close, we will have to wait until November 6 for a definitive answer. But for a state Obama may need to win, that uncertainty after almost four years on the job cannot be a great comfort to his campaign operatives." Wilder does not expressly back Romney, but he says the Republican has met the test to be president. "The Republicans endured a bad nominating process. Yet in the end, they seem to have chosen a credible candidate that many Virginians tell me they would feel fairly comfortable with in the Oval Office. "Democrats counted on using ad hominem attacks to make Romney seem too unworthy and too unsteady to be the country's chief executive because of the rough nominating process. But that has not been 100 percent effective. Will it be effective enough? We'll find out on Tuesday." Wilder, who served as governor from 1990-94 and as mayor of Richmond from 2005-09 has a long history of breaking with fellow Democrats.

In the news recently are several predictions and analyses: Labor Department "unemployment rate" (based upon telephone calls to homes); Nate Silver's Presidential election predict; and Jim Cramer's Presidential election predict. In the case of unemployment, it is a survey of 60K households (110K individuals). Large sample but still statistically small (less than 0.01%). However, the data is analyzed by a slew of folks and the results debated, challenged internally, and finalized before released to the public. In the case of Nate Silver and Jim Cramer, these are "committees of ones". I wasn't able to determine how Cramer does his analysis (I suspect he uses the "shoot from the hip" method), but Silver deserves some respect since he is a statistician that specializes in elections. However, these guys do not gather and produce the raw data. And who checks their work? So, maybe they are correct, but I have my salt shaker ready - just in case.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1352145225774</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 14:53:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352145311441-88</Id><Title>set your clocks back saturday 1 hour</Title><Msg>Vote Romeny on Tuesday set the country back 100 years!</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1352145311441</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 14:55:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352145602107-89</Id><Title>60 MINUTES IN TANK FOR OBUMA</Title><Msg>Obama suspects Libya attack targeted Americans November 4, 2012 3:53 PM In an interview with Steve Kroft conducted on Sept. 12, 2012, President Obama says he's suspicious that those who carried out the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, were "looking to target Americans from the start."

How is it that elections have been held for decades on a particular date, with successful results, but today, with the advent of easily available transportation, we need as much as a month to begin voting? The polls are open for twelve hours, typically. And, based upon what we have observed in Florida, with court ordered extensions of early "in person" voting, such voting arrangements seem superfluous and unnecessary. The absentee ballot achieves what this early voting claims to be its purpose - to increase voting participation and relieve congestion at the polls. However, in the news, we have observed block long lines waiting outside the few or reduced number of total polling stations that are otherwise fully available on election day. Only the military have reasonable excuses for needing this and they use absentee ballots as a rule. An improvement on the absentee ballot could be an on-line lookup for folks to see that their vote has been tallied. If they do not see that, perhaps it was lost in the mail, then they can file a "provisonal ballot" - on election day. Every vote should be counted - despite my earlier jab at Obamaphiles and Voterbots - and counted ONCE.

Turnout has been historically very low over the decades, early voting has made participation easier and more likely. I don't know what you do for a living, but this year is the first time I will be home on Election day in about a decade. Most of my trips are last minute, prior to early voting I used the absentee ballot, but it's easy to forget to order one or forget to mail it. Barb or not, the GOP shamelessly tried to limit early voting and wasn't even coy about why. Targeted districts in Ohio (surprise, they were traditionally democratic ones) and the amazing guy in PA who flatly stated this was so Romney could win. If you can't win the vote with big voter turnout, and think making it easy to vote is a problem, then you are the problem.</Msg><Username>freedumber</Username><Timestamp>1352147086188</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 15:24:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352147197312-94</Id><Topic><Title>Romney is a #$%$!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1352132832498</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 11:27:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds like you and Romney may have something in common after all.</Msg><Username>sheepshearer48</Username><Timestamp>1352147197312</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 15:26:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352147329976-95</Id><Topic><Title>A Vote for the Republicans is a Vote Against Yourself: 5 Reasons Why</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1352144611127</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 14:43:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>freeloader your welfare checks are about to disappear.. hahahahahahahahahaah</Msg><Username>hirtuism</Username><Timestamp>1352147329976</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 15:28:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352147483805-96</Id><Topic><Title>when you see the likes of Morgan Freeman, Colin Powel play the back card without any positive statistics you know this is a black verses white election</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1352098665065</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 01:57:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It will be interesting to see how many blacks vote for Romney.
