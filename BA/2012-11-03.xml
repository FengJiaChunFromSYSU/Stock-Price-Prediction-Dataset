As a result, the GOP core has pushed the Republican agenda so far to the right it has become unacceptable to the moderate Republican. In this, the GOP core also hastened the extinction of the moderate Republican. Moreover, Romney only spouts what his handlers tell him to. He only parrots what Karl Rove, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, and the other Right minstrels say because what these people say has been made the party credo. Unravel he will. What is more interesting is who gets blamed in a Romney loss. The Tea Party? The GOP core? The elite 1%?

If you ask the Romney campaign, they've got this thing in the bag. "The race comes down to independents. We lead among independents," Romney pollster Neil Newhouse said on a conference call with reporters on the state of the race this morning. "The firewall that I think [the Obama campaign] talked about was Iowa, Wisconsin and Ohio. Right now their firewall is burning," added Rich Beeson, Romney's political director. Meanwhile, Karl Rove predicts Romney will sail to victory with at least 279 electoral votes ("probably more"); the "unskewed" polls show Romney winning in a massive landslide with 321 electoral votes to Obama's 217; and Breitbart bloggers say "Mitt Romney is now running away with this election." Indeed, national polls slightly favor Romney. Of course, the state polls say something else, and state polls are what really count. Obama is ahead, if marginally, in almost every swing state. This means that Obama can afford to lose in a few states he's currently winning, while Romney has to win every single state he's currently winning plus steal a bunch of states from Obama, especially Ohio, where he's never fared well. Some recent polls even show Obama leading Virginia and Florida, both of which Romney needs. These numbers have made Nate Silver confident enough to bet $1,000 that Obama wins (his model gives Obama a 79 percent chance of victory at the moment). So who's right? Since we're now in a post-Nate Silver world, where pundits' gut instincts are more important than math, let's just throw his numbers out the window and look only at what the Romney campaign has been up to in the critical week before the election. Maybe we'll find some clues to what they really think about Mitt's chances. Today, we learn about a new ad the campaign released Tuesday - but did not announce to the press - that ties Barack Obama to Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez. "Who supports Barack Obama?" a narrator asks in Spanish before video clips play of Chavez and Castro's daughter praising Obama. The campaign also doubled down this week on its totally dishonest TV ad on the auto bailout with an even phonier radio ad, which it also did not announce to reporters. The ad suggests that Jeep, a division of Chrysler, which was bailed out by the federal government, is moving production and jobs to China. Jeep is doing no such thing and is actually expanding jobs in Ohio. The spot sort of backfired when the auto execs slammed Romney for lying about their companies, leading to less-than-flattering headlines in Ohio like this one from yesterday: "Obama devotes day to storm response; furor erupts over Romney auto ads." On top of that, the campaign released a third ad - again, without alerting the press - reviving the entirely false and vaguely race-baiting myth that Obama is gutting the work requirement in welfare. Does deploying these ads at the last minute really seem like a move from a campaign that feels confident it's going to win? These are some of the ugliest and most dishonest attacks of an unusually ugly and dishonest campaign. They're the kind of ads you expect from a secretive outside group, not the campaign itself. They're the kind of ads a campaign keeps in a glass case labeled, "Break in case of emergency." They feel desperate. Now take a look at where Romney is campaigning in the waning days of the campaign. There's no bigger weapon in the campaign's arsenal than the candidate himself, so where it sends him is a good sign of where its priorities are. The Romney campaign has been insisting that it's in such a strong position that it's expanding the map by making a play for mostly safe blue states like Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan and even New Mexico (where Obama won by 15 points in 2008). And indeed, both campaigns or the super PACs supporting them are now up with ads in these states. But Romney isn't going anywhere near those states. He's doing three events in Virginia today, which he should have put away weeks ago so he could concentrate on other states. Tomorrow he heads to Wisconsin, where's he's still the deep underdog, and after that Ohio, which he absolutely needs to win, but is still down. Then it's to Colorado, where he may win but Obama has been making a mini comeback. Then he's off to Iowa and New Hampshire, where he's down, but could really stand to win. More likely, the "expand the map" strategy is about his campaign and their allies having more money than they need in the real swing states and a desire to "keep the ‘momentum' storyline going," as Amy Walter notes, even if it's no longer true. As Steve Kornacki pointed out this morning, the entire "the polls are wrong" argument is based on a faulty reading about the role independent voters play in this election. Romney keeps winning among independents but losing overall in polls because lots of conservatives no longer self-identify as Republicans, but effectively vote that way. And at least in private, Republican leaders seem to be finally acknowledging the reality - well, at least part of the reality. Politico's Mike Allen reported this morning that "top Republicans are already hinting that if Romney loses, his people will blame the storm for stalling his momentum." Romney's momentum had clearly stalled before Hurricane Sandy struck, and there was really only a brief moment since Romney emerged as the GOP nominee in April that he looked like he was winning. But hey, whatever helps Republicans sleep until Election Day.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1351963892725</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 13:31:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351963910352-47</Id><Topic><Title>I work with sailors off the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan and they hate Obama, they also know that Obama is trying to interfer with their ballots</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1351913741841</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 23:35:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very clever to call people libdumbs....ask the economist why they pick obama..or mayor bloomberg.........face it....you will not vote with the black community cause you harbor sick un-christian racist thoughts..and have some mean-spirited generalizations regarding black folks...i feel bad for you!!</Msg><Username>hwardeinhorn</Username><Timestamp>1351963910352</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 13:31:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351964489184-48</Id><Topic><Title>I work with sailors off the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan and they hate Obama, they also know that Obama is trying to interfer with their ballots</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1351913741841</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 23:35:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, darn those Republicans for paving the way for a black man to become a President.</Msg><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1351964489184</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 13:41:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351964646980-49</Id><Topic><Title>I work with sailors off the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan and they hate Obama, they also know that Obama is trying to interfer with their ballots</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1351913741841</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 23:35:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How could anyone vote for a well-oiled, plastic weather vane like Willtard Rmoney?</Msg><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1351964646980</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 13:44:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351965119078-50</Id><Title>The Romneys: Mitt talks the high road, Tagg gets down and dirty</Title><Msg>Have you been following the career of Mitt Romney’s boy Tagg? As his dad runs for president denouncing “crony capitalism” and “big government,” Tagg has been gathering some of Mitt’s richest friends into a private-equity fund called Solamere — a clever instrument for pursuing government subsidies, contracts and tax breaks should Romney win. You see, disclosure laws would make it hard for a President Romney to hide many conflicts of interest. But if the money guys are in Tagg’s Solamere, we don’t know what conflicts of interest the Romney contributors are profiting from. We may not even know the investors’ names. “The close relationship with Romney and this investment opportunity looks to me like people are investing to buy access,” Bob Edgar, head of Common Cause, told me. “People are (literally) speculating that Romney may become the next president of the United States. It doesn’t smell good.” Before Solamere, Tagg’s main claim to business fame was as a marketer for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Now he’s playing financier. The interesting part is that whether Mitt wins or loses (and he and his wife have given Solamere $10 million), Tagg and Spence Zwick — his campaign’s finance chairman and a Solamere partner — make a pile. Here’s an example of the awful possibilities: One of Solamere’s founding partners is Marc Leder, whose Sun Capital owns the Scooter Store. (It was at a fundraiser in Leder’s Boca Raton, Fla., home that Romney dismissed 47 percent of Americans as wards of the government.) You can’t have missed those annoying Scooter Store ads. A senior citizen rolls around on her motorized wheelchair, proclaiming, “... and I didn’t pay a penny out of pocket for my power chair!” The message is that Medicare will pay. For a while, it did. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that 80 percent of the Scooter Store’s sales did not meet Medicare rules. In money terms, the Scooter Store had bilked taxpayers of nearly half a billion dollars. The Scooter Store has spent nearly $900,000 on lobbyists trying to stop Medicare from disqualifying its wares for taxpayer subsidies. Leder has also given a total of $525,000 to Romney’s campaign and a Republican PAC, and he’s letting Tagg enrich himself by managing his money in Solamere. Do you believe for one minute that Leder will want nothing back from a Romney administration? Fracking and other energy interests have put their money with Tagg. So have military contractors. Dental-management companies have been targeted for pressuring dentists to perform expensive work on low-income children, the bill sent to Medicaid. They’re in Solamere. So are the investor-owners of for-profit colleges, which Romney has praised from the stump. Known for providing weak education, the for-profit schools draw 85 percent of their revenues from taxpayers. Romney a small-government president? My foot. Solamere’s private-equity partners, meanwhile, would surely object to tax reform that messes with the outrageous deal that taxes their earnings at only 15 percent — the sort of loophole that served Romney well at Bain Capital. True to form, Solamere has set up shop in the Cayman Islands to shield its investors from U.S. tax liabilities. Let’s not play the innocent here. In every administration, Republican or Democrat, campaign contributors seek favors. What’s different is the awesome scope of the money involved and the unblushing sales pitch linking investments to an inside track that — via Solamere — would go under the radar. Last June, Solamere held an investor conference in a Salt Lake City building next door to a fundraising retreat for wealthy Romney donors. That Solamere touts its “unparalleled networks” so openly is the scariest part. Politicians used to do these things in secret. &amp;copy; 2012, The Providence Journal Co.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1351965119078</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 13:51:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351967273304-51</Id><Topic><Title>There is no doubt that the next President of the USA will have to deal with some difficult issues.</Title><Username>morons_finder</Username><Timestamp>1351962055550</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 13:00:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The average Chinese worker is far smarter than his counterpart in the USA.

According to the latest polls, the most likely outcome of Tuesday’s election is that Romney will lose. If he does, it will likely be a bitter pill to swallow. He would have come so close only to have fate and circumstances step in at the final hour and give President Obama a boost. How is Romney losing it? Let us count the ways: 1) The economy continues to improve. The argument for electing Romney hinges on a sour economy and his experience as a businessman with the expertise to turn it around. But, on measure after measure, the economy seems to be getting better. A Commerce Department report released last month found that housing starts jumped 15 percent in September — the largest surge in four years. The unemployment rate dropped below 8 percent in September and the October jobs report released on Friday was stronger than expected. Furthermore, according to a Gallup report also released Friday: “The U.S. Payroll to Population employment rate (P2P), as measured by Gallup, was 45.7 percent for the month of October, up from 45.1 percent in September, and reflecting the highest percentage of Americans with good jobs since Gallup began daily tracking of U.S. employment in 2010.” Romney needed gloom and doom on the economy, but Obama got some rays of sunlight. 2) Romney’s momentum is maxing out. There was a moment after the first debate when it appeared as if he might have a legitimate shot at winning. He surged in the polls. His forlorn followers found their faith. There was hope for their candidate. Momentum begot momentum. But it peaked a couple of weeks ago, and evidence amassed that the momentum has evaporated. Even so, the Romney campaign seemed to believe it could stick with the momentum meme even after that momentum had stalled because it had been effective at rallying the troops. As The Times’s Nate Silver wrote Friday about arguments touting Romney’s chances in the election: “A third argument is that Mr. Romney has the momentum in the polls: whether or not he would win an election today, the argument goes, he is on a favorable trajectory that will allow him to win on Tuesday. This may be the worst of the arguments, in my view. It is contradicted by the evidence, simply put.” Silver averaged the national polls of likely voters in his database and found that “there is not much evidence of ‘momentum’ toward Mr. Romney. Instead, the case that the polls have moved slightly toward Mr. Obama is stronger.” That’s right, it is the Obama campaign that has the rightful claim to having momentum. 3) Hurricane Sandy. The hurricane devastated the Northeast, which also happens to be the media center of the country. This diverted people’s attention from the rancor of the campaign trail, and they saw Obama being presidential in his response to the storm. They also saw bipartisanship. Obama was embraced by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who was the Republican National Convention keynote speaker. He won an endorsement from Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, an independent. For his part, Romney transformed an Ohio rally into a “storm relief event.” 4) Truth and lies. Evidence continues to emerge that Romney is one of the most dishonest, duplicitous candidates to ever seek the presidency. He criticized Obama for telling then-President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia that he would have “more flexibility” to deal with sensitive issues between the two countries after he won re-election. Romney said this was particularly troubling given that Russia “is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.” However, according to a report on Friday in The New York Times, Romney’s son Matt recently traveled to Russia and delivered a message to President Vladimir Putin: “Mr. Romney told a Russian known to be able to deliver messages to Mr. Putin that despite the campaign rhetoric, his father wants good relations if he becomes president, according to a person informed about the conversation.” It sounds as though he was signaling that Mitt would do exactly what he had castigated Obama for: operate with “more flexibility” after the election. This is the kind of hypocrisy that just makes you shake your head in disbelief. According to a Gallup poll released on Wednesday, Americans expect Obama to be re-elected by 54 percent to 34 percent. Among those believing that Obama will win were most independents and almost a fifth of Republicans. I cast my lot with those folks unless there is a seismic shift in the next few days. • By CHARLES M.

From LA Times 11/7/09 Last night former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura made a secret visit to the devastated military families at Fort Hood. The Bushes instructed the commander of the mourning military base that they wanted no publicity. With their Secret Service detail, Bush and his wife made the 30 mile trip unannounced from their ranch near Crawford, Texas Friday evening. Fox News broke news of the visit this afternoon. Other sources said the former first couple spent about two hours meeting with the wounded, family and soldiers, talking quietly and at times hugging them as they did in private at other times of crisis such as post-9/11.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1351989834449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 20:43:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351992868737-77</Id><Topic><Title>An Important Message ( Plea ) To My Fellow Obama Supporters</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1351985697706</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 19:34:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IDIOT</Msg><Username>mishaelena</Username><Timestamp>1351992868737</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 21:34:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351993638579-78</Id><Topic><Title>Want a strong economy?

His chances of winning it increased to 83.7 percent on Friday, his highest figure since the Denver debate and improved from 80.8 percent on Thursday. Friday’s polling should make it easy to discern why Mr. Obama has the Electoral College advantage. There were 22 polls of swing states published Friday. Of these, Mr. Obama led in 19 polls, and two showed a tie. Mitt Romney led in just one of the surveys, a Mason-Dixon poll of Florida. Although the fact that Mr. Obama held the lead in so many polls is partly coincidental — there weren’t any polls of North Carolina on Friday, for instance, which is Mr. Romney’s strongest battleground state — they nevertheless represent powerful evidence against the idea that the race is a “tossup.” A tossup race isn’t likely to produce 19 leads for one candidate and one for the other — any more than a fair coin is likely to come up heads 19 times and tails just once in 20 tosses. (The probability of a fair coin doing so is about 1 chance in 50,000.)</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1351998032743</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 23:00:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351999316815-84</Id><Topic><Title>Murdoch threatens Christie: Re-endorse Romney or else!</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1351988688494</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 20:24:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Christie just sees the handwriting on the wall.
