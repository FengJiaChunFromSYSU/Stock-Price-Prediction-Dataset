But I was trying to illustrate to you that the notion of torture or torment (and especially eternal torment) is NOT foreign to the principles of the Bible. You posed the question and, truthfully, there is little to be said in the Bible about the merits of “torture” in war. The Biblical record does not have to address this rather modern question because there was no attempt back then to do anything other than wipe out, completely, the enemy. Yes, Is.rael’s enemies were to be utterly destroyed. No survivors. All men. All women. All children. All of them. Thus, the refinement of strategy to achieve surrender – which torture might support – was completely unnecessary. Deception, on the other hand, was used to deceive, for example, the citizens of Jericho – and then they, save for the “traitor”, were all destroyed. It was harsh back then. I would agree with you that "torture" - if we can agree upon its definition - is not how a civilized society, one that a person could be proud of to live in, should conduct itself. The problem, the current debate, is the leap from "water boarding" to torture. You seem to be certain of its need for prohibition. I disagree. If we can agree that playing incessant loud music or forcing someone to stand beyond the normal state of exhaustion is NOT really torture but somewhat reasonable methods to achieve compliance, then how is pouring water over someone that produces no more harm that momentary panic, how is that “classic” torture? I would say that if a person equates all three as certain to be torture, then there is no available method for interrogation beyond asking politely of the captured enemy to "answer the questions". Are we that spineless? Here is real torture: connecting electrodes to various parts of the body; thrusting large splinters under the fingernails; cutting off a finger, breaking bones, etc. Anything that causes permanent physical harm. There is little debate about these. So you jumped into the discussion with questions of the Bible, which I believed was a non sequitor, and perhaps I answered it without giving your question it due consideration. And now, I have.

Sponsored LinksBut hang on to your wallets: Premiums averaged $15,745, with employees paying more than $4,300 of that, a glaring reminder that the problem of unaffordable medical care is anything but solved. The annual employer survey released Tuesday by two major research groups also highlighted another disturbing trend: Employees at companies with many low-wage workers pay more for skimpier insurance than their counterparts at upscale firms. Overall, "it's historically a very moderate increase in premiums," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducted the survey with the Health Research &amp; Educational Trust. "But even a moderate increase feels really big to workers when their wages are flat or falling," he said. The rise in premiums easily outpaced workers' raises and inflation. Following a 9% hike in premiums last year, the 2012 increase quickly became fodder for the political debate. Republicans said President Barack Obama's promises to control health care costs ring hollow. But the most significant cost-control measures in the new law have yet to take effect, and the president's big push to cover the uninsured doesn't start until 2014. Those measures include a new tax on the most expensive insurance plans and a powerful board to keep Medicare spending manageable. Trying to head off critics, the administration issued a report estimating that consumers have saved $2 billion as a result of the health care law. That's due to a combination of insurance rebates for employers and individual policy holders, as well as closer state oversight of proposed rate increases, facilitated by the new health care law. Still, the Kaiser survey shows premiums for job-based family coverage rose nearly $2,400 since 2009, with a corresponding increase of nearly $800 for employee-only coverage. "We aren't happy to see any increase in health insurance premiums," said Gary Cohen, head of the Obama administration's Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, adding that officials are "heartened" it was only a modest rise this year and look forward to slowing costs more as more provisions of the health care law take effect. Most independent experts say the fact that premiums keep rising faster than inflation reflects underlying problems with the health care system that have frustrated policymakers of both parties for years, as well as corporate benefit managers. Indeed, only last week an arm of the National Academy of Sciences estimated that about 30 cents of every dollar spent on health care â?? $750 billion a year â?? is wasted through unnecessary procedures, cumbersome paperwork, uncoordinated care and fraud. Obama says he's working to make health care more affordable for all by leveraging the power of government programs like Medicare to pay hospitals and doctors for quality results, rather than sheer volume of tests and procedures. But that will take time. Republican Mitt Romney wants to give future retirees a fixed amount of money to pick either private insurance or a government plan modeled on Medicare. He expects the private market will find ways to deliver quality service at lower cost. The GOP approach mirrors the shift away from traditional pensions, which pay a standard benefit, to 401(k) savings plans that limit the employer's exposure. The Kaiser/HRET survey found that employee-only coverage went up 3% this year, with annual premiums averaging $5,615. Companies usually pick up a larger share of the cost for employee-only coverage, so workers typically paid about $950 of that. The availability of employer-based coverage, a mainstay for working people and their families, remained stable this year, with 61% of companies offering health benefits. However, only half of companies with 3 to 9 workers offered health insurance, while virtually all large firms with 1,000 or more employees did so. Companies continued shifting costs to their workers, at a somewhat slower pace. A trend toward steering employees into plans with high annual deductibles eased a bit. The deductible is the amount you must pay each year before insurance kicks in. The survey found that 34% of workers are in plans with annual deductibles of at least $1,000 for single coverage, up from 31% in 2011. "We don't know if it's a timeout, or if it's reached some natural limit," said Altman. "It's really something to watch for in the future because (high deductible plans) have an impact both on people's budgets and on holding down overall costs." The survey's focus on health insurance provided to lower-wage workers highlights one of the major areas of uncertainty around the new health care law. If the president is reelected and the law goes into full effect, employers with lots of low-wage workers may be tempted to drop coverage and send their employees into new state-based insurance exchanges, markets that will offer taxpayer-subsidized private insurance. A separate survey this summer by the Mercer benefits consulting firm found that 9% of employers in the retail and hospitality industries say it's likely they will drop coverage, even if they have to pay penalties to the government. The survey found that workers in lower-wage companies pay $4,977 toward the cost of family coverage, compared with an average $4,316 for all workers. And the policy they get for their money is less generous, typically worth about $1,000 less. "They are really paying more and getting less," said Altman. Although employers and government are doubling down on efforts to keep health care costs manageable, most experts believe the sluggish economy provides the likeliest explanation for the moderate rise in premiums. Last year's spike is blamed on a mistaken bet by insurers that the economy would recover faster. The survey includes more than 2,000 small and large employers. Asked what kind of increase they're expecting for 2013, employers said their best estimate at this point is 7% -- sure to prompt more pain.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347451441065</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:04:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347453156408-5</Id><Title>I agree, Bush gave us the volt, Bush gave us the defict</Title><Msg>Volt was well underway when Obama took over, all he did was try to support the battery design that would have saved them</Msg><Username>andse2003</Username><Timestamp>1347453156408</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:32:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347453227544-6</Id><Title>that's not all Bush gave us</Title><Msg>[Ed. Note: Our thanks to this SGTreport reader for allowing us to post his 9/11 awakening testimony.] by Army4Ever, I enlisted in the Army because of 9/11. Left my cushy job at a fortune 500 law firm to be a green-suiter. I will admit that when I watched the two towers collapse I thought how strange it was that both actually collapsed and in the same manner but I never suspected an inside job. Eleven years ago I didn’t know about WTC7. During my first deployment a senior enlisted and I got into a conversation and he brought up the secret government subject and gave me a book. It was Bill Moyer’s ‘Secret Government – Constitution in Crisis’. He tells me that there is a handful of powerful people that actually run everything. Nothing more was discussed. At the time I was still very naive and uneducated with regards to real US and world history but I took it. It wasn’t until April 2011 that I was reading a CNN article about a 9/11 widow that I noticed in the comments someone mentioned Architects &amp; Engineers. The second I found out there was a third building and watched it collapse I knew it had all been a lie. I went to my family with it. You know, the same ones that have always told you how smart, brave, resourceful blah blah you are. I got the giggle, “you can’t be serious” response. It was a year later that my brother came around on his own. The look on his face was pure shock. He started siting all the facts and asking me questions like did I know this and that. Yea! I’ve been trying to tell you this #$%$ for a year now. My parents still cover their ears and say stuff like “the TV says it’s Muslims” and “we need more security to protect us.” They just want the comfortable lies. Almost a year ago our company got a new 1SG (First Sergeant). I didn’t know it at the time but he had been in the Pentagon when it happened. He was always real personal with his troops and one day he told me something I will never forget. We got on to the subject of history politics etc and he knew my views. He said, “Staff Sergeant I want to tell you something I haven’t talked about in years. I was in the Pentagon when it went down. What you have been told was a lie. There was no airliner. Something hit the building but it wasn’t a plane. When I arrived to work that day there was something off. Certain people weren’t behaving normally but that stuff gets dismissed around that place. The first explosions were inside the building. That was obvious just from the sound and it reaked of cordite. Then something hit the building but it was different. It made the walls shake and the sound traveled inward. When we made it to that section it looked like an arrow pierced a straight line through. Almost immediately someone started saying a plane hit the building. I thought he was full of #$%$ because we couldn’t find a single piece of luggage or body or anything. We were looking around for wounded when we were told to get out of the area because there was risk of collapse. About fifteen minutes later there were more pops and the outer walls collapsed. Later on some civilians came and asked us what happened. I told them what I told you. We were told that we must be mistaken. That’s when they started telling us the official version and we needed to stick to that. I said bull #$%$ that’s not what happened. We were told to keep our mouths shut or we would have problems. We all knew the truth. There wasn’t a soul in that building that doesn’t know what really happened.”</Msg><Username>bdannye</Username><Timestamp>1347453227544</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:33:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347453297342-7</Id><Title>Politcal talk is pretty much over</Title><Msg>No one is giving Rmoney a chance</Msg><Username>andse2003</Username><Timestamp>1347453297342</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:34:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347453644425-8</Id><Topic><Title>Who Really built America</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1347159898016</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 23:04:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As unions decline, so do the benefits enjoyed by the workers, union and non-union. Pensions and healthcare insurance are two of the most visible. I'm not saying that unions were perfect, they developed an adversarial relationship with management and continually asked for "more". More money, more benefits, more of everything. The USA used to be the greatest steel producer in the world but the United Steelworkers of America drove the business overseas. Unions need to develop more of a "partnership" relationship with management. Instead of continually asking for "more", the unions need to ask, what can the workers do to improve the company so we all benefit. Then maybe union jobs won't be shipped overseas and the word "union" won't have the negative meaning it currently has.</Msg><Username>gpd8252</Username><Timestamp>1347453644425</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:40:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347454551880-9</Id><Title>SO now we are building jets with untrained labor just off the street</Title><Msg>Last week they were flippin bugers, this is why we have unions, to support worker training</Msg><Username>andse2003</Username><Timestamp>1347454551880</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:55:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347454803098-10</Id><Title>Oil Pushes Up US Import Prices for First Time in 5 Months</Title><Msg>U.S. import prices rose in August for the first time in five months as the cost of imported oil jumped, a factor that could weigh on American consumers and boost inflation. Import prices climbed 0.7 percent last month, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. The cost of petroleum imports increased 4.1 percent. Higher prices at the pump threaten to hurt consumers' pocket books. Analysts had expected overall import prices would rise 1.4 percent in August. Many economists expect higher fuel costs will contribute to a short-term rise in inflation. At the same time, the U.S. Federal Reserve is still widely expected to ease monetary policy this year, possibly launching a new bond buying program as soon as this week. There was little sign of broader inflation pressures in the import data. Non-petroleum imports declined 0.2 percent, a sign that the cooling global economy is reducing companies' ability to raise prices. Import prices were flat from major trading partners Japan and China. Import prices from the European Union fell 0.4 percent. The Labor Department report also showed export prices rose 0.9 percent last month. Analysts had expected export prices to rise 0.4 percent.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347454803098</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:00:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347458988028-11</Id><Topic><Title>Ambassador to Lybia killed.</Title><Username>tminusten</Username><Timestamp>1347457732187</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:48:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOS ANGELES (AP) — An Israeli filmmaker based in California went into hiding after a YouTube trailer of his movie attacking Islam's prophet Muhammad sparked angry assaults by ultra-conservative Muslims on U.S. missions in Egypt and Libya. The U.S. ambassador to Libya and three American members of his staff were killed. Speaking by phone Tuesday from an undisclosed location, writer and director Sam Bacile remained defiant, saying Islam is a cancer and that the 56-year-old intended his film to be a provocative political statement condemning the religion. Protesters angered over Bacile's film opened fire on and burned down the U.S. consulate in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi. Libyan officials said Wednesday that Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed Tuesday night when he and a group of embassy employees went to the consulate to try to evacuate staff as the building came under attack by a mob firing machine guns and rocket propelled grenades. In Egypt, protesters scaled the walls of the U.S. embassy in Cairo and replaced an American flag with an Islamic banner. "This is a political movie," said Bacile. "The U.S. lost a lot of money and a lot of people in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we're fighting with ideas."</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1347458988028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:09:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347459539650-12</Id><Topic><Title>SO now we are building jets with untrained labor just off the street</Title><Username>andse2003</Username><Timestamp>1347454551880</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:55:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unions Just Take Your Money and Spend it Anyway They Wish...

Jack VanDerhei, research director at E.B.R.I., says some studies have suggested that by working to age 70 — five years past the traditional retirement age of 65 — nearly 80 percent of pre-retirees, including lower-income Americans, could have adequate retirement income. But such models, he said, don’t fully take into account changes in the retirement system, such as the shift away from pension plans and toward 401(k) accounts, or the potential for a catastrophic health event that would require a stay in a nursing home. When those factors are accounted for, he said, the outlook is less optimistic, especially for lower-income workers. E.B.R.I.’s analytical model, he said, indicates that for those in the lowest quarter of incomes, workers would have to toil until age 84 before 90 percent of them would have at least a break-even chance for success. That doesn’t mean, he said, that he is advocating that everyone work until their 80s, or that working that long is feasible. But it does suggest, he said, that it is a risky notion to think that you can work until you’re 65 and then simply work five more years if you don’t haven’t saved enough. If a couple near retirement age has one member who become ill and requires a lengthy nursing home stay, he said, a good chunk of their savings may be exhausted. “How can you ignore that?” he said. It’s much less of a gamble, he said, to save more while you’re working, if you can: “It’s much less risky than waiting until you’re 65 or 67 and seeing what happens.” =========================================== Everybody should be felling better and better, so says Obama.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347470115893</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 13:15:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347470138398-23</Id><Title>Who is gonna pay for a new Iran War ?</Title><Msg>Ryan and Romney imply it will be paid for with Social Security and Medicare funds!</Msg><Username>clowncramer</Username><Timestamp>1347470138398</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 13:15:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347470146679-24</Id><Topic><Title>There will be blood</Title><Username>zosimomaximo</Username><Timestamp>1347467426013</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 12:30:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is Too Much of a Coward to Do anything Except Apologize and Bow Down...

Also Obamacare will save the life of Stacey and Caleb Lihn’s daughter Zoe, the couple told Lawrence O'Donnell Monday. Stacey Lihn won admirers across the country last week when she spoke movingly at the Democratic National Convention in support of Obamacare. “If Mitt Romney becomes president and Obamacare is repealed, there is a good chance she’ll hit her lifetime cap,” Lihn told convention-goers, stressing the need to maintain Obamacare’s ban on lifetime coverage caps. “There’s no way we can afford the care she needs to survive.” Zoe Lihn was born with a heart defect. At just two years old, she’s already had two open-heart surgeries. She’ll need another in a year or two, at which point she’d likely reach her lifetime cap on insurance coverage—long before she can even vote. “She has a chronic condition, she’s going to need care for her life,” Stacey told O'Donnell on The Last Word Monday. “Those medical bills just keep adding up and adding up and it’s frightening to think about her appeal and losing that coverage.”</Msg><Username>clowncramer</Username><Timestamp>1347470666692</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 13:24:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347471039435-28</Id><Topic><Title>Retiring at 70 May Still Be Too Soon</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347470115893</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 13:15:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Social Security has a very easy fix: "Everyone pay the FICA Tax on all income"</Msg><Username>clowncramer</Username><Timestamp>1347471039435</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 13:30:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347471145867-29</Id><Topic><Title>Who is gonna pay for a new Iran War ?</Title><Username>clowncramer</Username><Timestamp>1347470138398</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 13:15:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a bunch of Crap</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1347471145867</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 13:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347473517221-30</Id><Topic><Title>There will be blood</Title><Username>zosimomaximo</Username><Timestamp>1347467426013</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 12:30:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you are American, act like one!</Msg><Username>zosimomaximo</Username><Timestamp>1347473517221</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 14:11:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347473643847-31</Id><Topic><Title>Who is gonna pay for a new Iran War ?</Title><Username>clowncramer</Username><Timestamp>1347470138398</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 13:15:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fat bank account is useless if one is six feet under!</Msg><Username>zosimomaximo</Username><Timestamp>1347473643847</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 14:14:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347474927094-32</Id><Title>Obama: OK to offend Catholics just don't offend Mooslums</Title><Msg>OK for Democrats to offend Catholics and force them to pay for abortions and contraception.

The administration issued an apology to the protestors for offending them. Here is the entire statement from the U.S. Embassy to the protestors. " The Embassy of the United States in Cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Mooslims -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions. Today, the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy. Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy. We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others." You read that correctly. The U.S. Embassy isn't scolding protestors for attacking the Embassy, but instead are attacking free speech itself by condoning radical Mooslims who were protesting against....free speech, or in other words, protesting because someone simply said something they didn't like.</Msg><Username>chinamanpro</Username><Timestamp>1347475327354</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 14:42:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347476070145-35</Id><Title>This board is too political.</Title><Msg>Why has this board turned to a politics soap box??

Companies get the unions they deserve. It’s an old saying and oh so true. If Boeing offers the engineers and techs a reasonable contract, they will have no problems. If they don’t. If they play hard-ball and try to stick it to them, the engineers and techs will walk and shutter the place. They did it before and they’ll do it again if forced to, which will mean no deliveries and at delivery is when Boeing receives most of the payment for a new A/P. About moving all production and engineering to the Carolina’s … Yeah, that’s not a realistic option. South Carolina is one of the poorest states in the country, with an educational system and work force to match. I know a few people who have been sent there on temporary assignment to help fix the mess. It’s not a place you want to be trying to build something as heavily engineered and complex as a commercial A/P.

Barack is accomplishing what he has set out to do,undermine American influence abroad and cripple America domestically. Obama is making America more vulnerable. The world has become a more dangerous place to live while Obama has been president. Obama will except a nuclear Iran not because he feels he has no choice but because of his thinking as a progressive muslim who despises Israel. Every action Obama has chosen to make demonstrates a policy of anti American fervor. Every move has been exact to his wishes. But,in my heart, I feel that Obama was reluctant in taking those final steps to have bin Laden murdered. Obama would have been faced with the obvious if he had not have chosen to have eliminated bin Laden. Obama's cover would have been blown and in the bigger picture Obama did not want to lose credibility with the American people at a time when his greatest goal was in making the United States vulnerable to others outside the influence of America. Obama was willing to sacrifice bin Laden in order to keep his primary goal secret from the American people: The singular goal of deminishing American power throughout the world.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1347504493791</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 22:48:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347505912556-81</Id><Title>Bush's Fault</Title><Msg>... or dim Freudian slip ?
