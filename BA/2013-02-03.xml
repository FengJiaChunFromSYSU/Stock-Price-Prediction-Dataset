Ron, you also pointed out that Boeing is losing 300 million on each 787 delivered and I was putting a K instead of a M symbol on the over 200 million loss per plane. Ron, I suggested you stop attempting to be my critic and editor, but as you wish. So Ron your point is? Ron, since you’re myself appointed editor and critic, what is your point about a 47 year old stock price is that a long term trend Ron, for many people, another 47 years to go to 150 would mean most stock investors holding Boeing from 1966 to 2013 missed MSFT and APPLE and many other better stock deals . Ron you did not comment on WNR compared to Boeing for 1day to max on the Yahoo financial chart, any more nitpicking on showing this message board a better stock compared to Boeing? Ron as you know for 15 years I angered the Boeing police here with my showing how much better Apple was than Boeing. Ron, as you know until Steve Jobs died Apple was much better stock to hold than Boeing for investors. It all changed once Mr. Jobs died. The reason for the Apple stock price fall is the same as for the failure of Boeing stock price to rise. Poor overpaid management of Apple is like Boeing. Steve Jobs worked for 1 dollar per year and stock valuation increases. Mr Jobs did not get paid as much unless his stock value went up and as you Know Ron it really went up until he died. Now both Boeing leadership and Apple work only for high paid executive compensation and free stock options not related to long term stock price appreciation the same as for the shareholders value. .. Ron, we all know you keep deliberately missing the point of shareholders of Boeing stock. Ron the stock price is flat, for the year while the 3 major averages are up 10 to 15%. Ron, , many people who invest are not counting the 47 year ago Boeing stock price. They are living in 2013 and want to know about the cheap outsourcing business plan and if it is working. Ron the answer is no. The cheap outsourcing plan is a failure. Ron, the 787 is 3.5 years late and 33 billion over budget. The 747 is 2 years late and 2 billion over budget, as a nitpicker you have nothing to show for the big picture. Ron, Boeing did not stay at over 150 dollars that is a peak when TA Wilson was the CEO and engineering was done 100% inside Boeing. Ron, once more you are making my point in 1966 Boeing used SPEEA 100% to design and control the plane engineering and the company was worth a lot more in 1966. Now the 787 failure costs have led to a much lower value on Boeing. .. Stock price reflects the value of a company, so a 2013 failed late and over cost cheap outsourced planes787, and 747 value the company at 74 dollars Ron how did you like my comparison for the year between Boeing and WNR, or for 2 3 5 or max years comparison between WNR and Boeing , no comments from the critic ? What about Barbing and her predictions a year ago for a Boeing 150 stock price or her 2010 call on a biopharmaceutical company that used to be located in Bothell and her expert self qualification. It went down from 18019 per share to 3.10 today. Ron, it is easy to trade day to day and more fun and a lot more profitable than to be a Boeing yahoo police board member or a long term Boeing stock holder. . I enjoy reading all the Boeing rapid reply users try to prop up Boeing at my expense. Name calling, vulgar words, character assignations, all TOS violations notice how Mrs. Stock said in one of the person user comments he turns users in who do that and yet he does it to me all the time. That just means he is an angry Boeing Management enabler who identifies with power by being pro Boeing. It is a prejudice he feels comfortable using. As my critic , self appoints and your point is what?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359869659556</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 00:34:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359869888360-2</Id><Topic><Title>BOEING SHOULD REMOVE THE WINGS OF THE 787 AND THEY WILL HAVE A PLASTIC BUS READY FOR SALE</Title><Username>communicator_777</Username><Timestamp>1359832246774</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:10:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree with you, the 787 without wings will be great for diners.</Msg><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1359869888360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 00:38:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359870174318-3</Id><Topic><Title>How does Boeing stock perform for the present, past and future stock owners?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359838663072</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:57:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for two thumbs up, what are the Boeing mismanagement enabling police going to do to me now ?

Agreed ... and you appear to be among them. Boeing's own analysis shows that the "enhanced" 401(k) that they want to replace the pension with is worth 33% less. SPEEA's analysis shows that it's actually worth 40% less. Regardless of the true number, it's a pretty big reduction in retirement benefits. "You could really make mucho money on a plan that you could invest your retirement dollars in! a 401K!" Yeah, just ask all of those retirees relying on a 401(k) how they fared in 2008 when the stock market #$%$ its pants. Overnight, most people's 401(k) shriveled up like a raisin in the hot Arizona sun. That's why companies prefer 401(k)s over defined benefit pension plans. With a 401(k), all of the risk is on the employee.</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1359891877892</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 06:44:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359897426579-14</Id><Title>It’s Coming: The Government Wants to “Help Manage” Retirement Accounts</Title><Msg>It’s Coming: The Government Wants to “Help Manage” Retirement Accounts Mike Krieger Liberty Blitzkrieg February 3, 2013 Many people, including myself, have discussed this threat over the past several years. The obvious concept is that when the government runs out of money, or they face a drying up in interest for its debt, they will come for the $19.4 trillion in American’s retirement accounts. It seems that day may be finally drawing near. I stopped contributing to my 401k back when I worked at Bernstein, and I will probably now have to give more serious consideration whether I want to take the penalty and move the funds out of my retirement account entirely. I haven’t made any decisions, but will be watching closely. I’m sure the government is just trying to protect your retirement account from terrorists. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is weighing whether it should take on a role in helping Americans manage the $19.4 trillion they have put into retirement savings, a move that would be the agency’s first foray into consumer investments. “That’s one of the things we’ve been exploring and are interested in in terms of whether and what authority we have,” bureau director Richard Cordray said in an interview. He didn’t provide additional details. The bureau’s core concern is that many Americans, notably those from the retiring Baby Boom generation, may fall prey to financial scams, according to three people briefed on the CFPB’s deliberations who asked not to be named because the matter is still under discussion. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Labor are the main regulators of U.S. retirement savings vehicles and funds. However, the consumer bureau — established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act — sees itself as a potential catalyst for promoting a coherent policy across the government, the people said.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359897426579</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 08:17:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359898875133-15</Id><Topic><Title>September Morn: 9-11 movie with Woody Harrleson and Ed Asner refutes official verion</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359855430162</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 20:37:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Happy 2nd Amendment to everyone!"

Shipments of other lithium ion batteries greater than 11 pounds are still prohibited. The 787's two batteries weigh 63 pounds each. It's the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which weigh less and store more power than other batteries of a similar size. The aircraft battery exemption was created for the convenience of the airline industry, which wants to be able to quickly ship replacement batteries to planes whose batteries are depleted or have failed.

The numbers are just about right: $17T in debt vs. $19T in retirement assets (provides for some additional deficit spending for a couple years). Further, like any annuity, there is no survivor beneficiaries other than spouses. Big additonal bonus for the government. Way too tempting.

By Jon Talton Special to The Seattle Times Boeing has deployed hundreds of engineers to fix the battery-related trouble that grounded the 787. But what about its 10 supposedly independent directors, who serve on the board chaired by Chief Executive James McNerney? In storybook capitalism, the board oversees management, looking out for the interests of shareholders and the broader health of the company. This is rarely the way it works in practice, even after the so-called shareholder-rights movement that began in the 1980s as a backlash against “imperial management.” Most major companies have more independent directors today and trumpet rigorous standards of corporate governance. But most boards remain too close to management, usually from the same class, sharing the same world views. Activist proposals go nowhere at annual meetings. Compensation for top management continues to rise astronomically. Also, most major corporations don’t separate the top jobs, having one person serve as chairman and chief executive, an inherent conflict of interest. On the other hand, JPMorgan Chase’s board last month cut the compensation of Jamie Dimon by half for the “London Whale” trading debacle. Dimon will still make $11.5 million, but at least it’s a symbolic attempt at accountability. It usually takes a financial calamity to wake up a board. In 1992, the late John Smale led an independent directors revolt at General Motors that forced out the chairman/CEO and, as Automotive News put it, “sent tremors through most of corporate America.” Alas, Smale’s reforms didn’t spread. Ahead were Enron, WorldCom, HealthSouth, Tyco International, and then the run-up to the financial crash, including a starring role for Washington Mutual. GM required a federal bailout. And after each costly, job-killing calamity, we were left to ask: Where was the board? In Boeing’s case, I asked Nell Minow, of GMI Ratings, an independent research company, and an expert on corporate governance. “Boeing has poor corporate governance, most notably a board that repeatedly approves an executive-compensation plan that fails to impose meaningful consequences for failure to perform,” she said. Indeed, McNerny never suffered a financial penalty as the Dreamliner endured repeated, costly delays and became a case study in how not to outsource a revolutionary new airplane. Minow told me that if board members wanted to signal they are on top of the crisis, “they will have to take immediate steps: Adding a new director with expertise in engineering and operations, setting up an independent board committee to evaluate the aircraft thoroughly and determine that all problems have been identified...” In addition, the board should independently investigate the failures in communication and testing, “improving the alignment of pay and performance throughout the company. They should also designate one or more directors to meet with shareholders to answer their questions,” she said. None of this has happened. Instead, last week Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith stated that the earnings forecast, “assumes no significant financial impact resulting from the FAA directive on the 787 program.” He left the door open to the possibility. “If this assumption changes after we have gained greater fidelity, we will let you know,” Smith told analysts and reporters. The board is filled with heavy-hitters. Among its members: Reagan chief of staff and uber-schmoozer Ken Duberstein; retired Admiral Edmund Giambastiani (a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff); and former U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab; Nor is the board lacking in business expertise. David Calhoun is chief executive of Nielsen Holdings. It has four former CEOs: Lawrence Kellner (Continental Airlines), Arthur Collins (Medtronic), Ron Williams (Aetna) and Mike Zafirovski (Nortel). Linda Cook was a senior executive at Royal Dutch Shell. Boeing’s board even has a man experienced in crisis management and its perils: Ed Liddy. He was picked by then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to run AIG as the financial crisis was turning into panic. Although Liddy took a token $1 salary (plus expenses), the insurer was bailed out with $84 billion in taxpayer money. He defended a lavish company retreat at the St. Regis Resort in California. He presided over $165 million in bonuses handed out to employees at a company that nearly pushed the world economy into a depression. McNerney, Calhoun and Zafirovski all come out of high positions at General Electric, where McNerney was the runner-up to succeed Jack Welch as chief executive. Taken together, it’s a cozy board largely of elite professional managers and political movers. The risk of living in a bubble is significant. There’s no shareholder activist. No union member. No cantankerous John Smale to ask tough questions and demand change. Not one aircraft engineer. The latter is no cure-all: Phil Condit, who moved the headquarters from Seattle to Chicago and underestimated the Airbus threat among other blunders, was an engineer. He served as Boeing’s chairman and chief executive from 1996 until he was forced out in a scandal involving bidding for the Air Force tanker in 2003. It was also the last time this weak board showed any spine.</Msg><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1359924524710</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 15:48:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359924558163-57</Id><Title>OXF - Best Value of 2013</Title><Msg>Energy Boom Massive Breakout Trade!</Msg><Username>soundenergypartners</Username><Timestamp>1359924558163</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 15:49:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359925523759-58</Id><Topic><Title>It’s Coming: The Government Wants to “Help Manage” Retirement Accounts</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359897426579</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 08:17:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny you should mention Fluoride use.

Nobody is going to buy into this pig in a blanket fix (vented encasement). Having flown Lead-Acids batteries to Silver-Zinc batteries and everything in between, including one NiCad thermal run away on the ground, I can assure you that you don't want to be airborne when a battery gets away from you. Until this battery chemistry get's many years of abusive airline use under it's belt, I'm not flying on the airplane. A carbon fiber airplane with TWO VERY high energy density batteries in confined compartments (both ambivalent to Halon) sounds more like a matchstick than an airplane to me. If BA stops production it's going to show up as a very big number that analysts care about. Combined with the upcoming Obama cuts (defense cuts) stockholders may suffer bigtime.

Skunked, I simply pointed out what the government IS doing (holding hearings on the subject of confiscating 401K's) and what are the stated opinions of the folks that work at the GAO. Now, perhaps, Dr. Ghilarducci is simply a (albeit rare, I am sure the liberal side of board would say) LWNJ. Something to think about: if the Congress feared the incipient deafening and scathing roar from the electorate, why would they even entertain such concepts? Imagine going directly to the people, in their work place, and telling them, "we are holding meetings in Congress to consider taking over your 410K's and giving you an IOU. But because Congress has become so insular, they don't see such discussions as "non-starters". Tell me that you do or do not feel represented by Congress? "Ghilarducci’s work focuses on the need to restore the promise of retirement for every American worker. To do so, she has put forth a bold reform idea – the creation of Guaranteed Retirement Accounts (GRAs) – to solve the many problems Americans now face in planning for retirement: decreasing coverage and contributions, increasing investment risk, portability, leakage, high fees, and the drawdown of benefits in retirement. "Ghilarducci’s proposal has been met with critical success from high level opinion leaders. In February 2010, the White House Middle Class Task Force issued a report calling Ghilarducci’s proposal a viable option to help American families save for retirement, irrespective of their of financial sophistication, and called for further research on the plan. In July 2009, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified GRAs as one alternative to overhaul the U.S.retirement system. In 2008, New York Times Magazine named the GRA Plan one of the best ideas of the year." (from TOPWONKS) It is easy to "envision" the retirement accounts as subject to a "fairness" test - not unlike taxes under the Obama Administration. Following the "tax the rich to make them pay their fair share", the Democrats have floated the idea of a "wealth tax". Not too distant are the pensions. "It isn't fair that this other person has this amount of money and I do not have any or less." Since this country only seems to operate at the "one bullet" level of thought process, no one asks this new class of "victim" whether he actually tried to save money during his lifetime and career. Because the answer will be no. And, the bloated and unsupportable obligations of the various states that kowtowed to public employee unions to obligate pensions, where there is inadequate funding, is a prime example of a disaster in the making, that the White House has previous intoned, "that should not go to waste." The federal government would see the "GRA" as a way of leveling the playing field, "righting a wrong" of "unfair" unequal wealth, while solving the obligation of the Federal Government regarding pensions in general. Why cut spending to cover the disaster when there is one heck of a pension plum waiting to be picked? You just have to have the right disaster and the right politics and the right President. Now the real reason for the confiscation is not about "fairness". It never is. "Fairness" is the manipulation of the "bots" to achieve the larger goal of more spending. Once the deficit slate is wiped clean, they can start all over again - only now they can go into spending overdrive. Even the Republicans will go along. Now, what have I said that is paranoid?</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359928889712</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 17:01:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359929452155-68</Id><Topic><Title>SEAL shot gto death in TEXAS</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1359873167086</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 01:32:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Why do you think he told a story?"

A Boeing Engineer said, Unlike earlier Boeing jets, he said, the innards of the 787 power distribution panels — which control the flow of electricity to the plane’s many systems — are “like Radio Shack,” with parts that are “cheap, plastic and prone to failure.”This is classic short term penny pinching business baloney. Save money on paper, make Wall Street happy Outsource, so you don't have to employ the people doing much of the work, to save money. It works on paper, and in the boardroom. It doesn't "fly" so good out here in the real world though. Oh look, business school graduates ran into reality.] John Hart-Smith was one of the visionaries who clearly knew what was going to happen. He also spoke up. Speaking up was a dead end. t all goes back to former CEO Harry Stonecipher... the only way to convince him and the Board to go ahead with the 787 was to show a cost model they'd buy into. Outsourcing and risk sharing with partners was the model that sold it. Whoops. You've got it exactly right. Everyone I know at Boeing saw this coming. The unions are our last connection to the organizational knowledge that predates the McDonnell Douglas heads-in-their-whatever takeover. 1. CLEAN HOUSE Starting at the top 2. CLEAN UP the Board of Directors who enabled this cluster fluck 3. RETURN HQ to the Pacific Northwest so that they can actually mind the store.
