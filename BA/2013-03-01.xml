This drama is a play by Boeing and the FAA to fool the flying public into a feeling of safety. The bottom line is any plane with a proven fire issue is not safe to fly, and the fix is nothing more than a containment box of failure to solve the root cause. All the statements by the FAA and the NTSB about safety of the flying public being the most important job fails, once the 787 is in the sky without a 100% determination of the cause or causes of the battery fire and the fix. Any fire contained in a box on a flying 787 is a emergency landing situation so the containment box is not a fix, it is a episode incident protector like a air bag in a car, it may stop the death of the passenger, but it may also only act as a short term incident partial fix that still leads to death of the passengers, they need to get the plane on the ground with any fire. Planes have insulation blankets that are supposed to be fire resistant too. Any passenger should know that both a flame resistant blanket and a containment battery fire resistant box are not a fix for a fire. . If you place yourself on a 787 as a passenger you need to know the cause of the fire has not been determined and it will occur again most likely. The fire temperature is over 1000 degrees F so testing may occur and remember the lithium battery was tested and it still caught on fire so much for testing and the 1 in 10 million hours for a fire statistic. It is real simple the political and financial pressure is on the government to subsidize Boeing and to support the return to flight of the 787. Both the FAA and the NSTB can only hope that plane has another close call, or a chronic problem and not an acute crash and death issue. As long as the plane continues with all these close calls the FAA and the NTSB are going to</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362135726167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 06:02:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362142003358-13</Id><Topic><Title>Should a passenger on a 787 feel safe with a fix that does not address the cause &amp; fix of the fire incident ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362135726167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 06:02:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wayne please, your spin on this problem is beyond the pale.

Historically Democrats are the ones who get the USA into wars. Add them up. "Fascist ideology consistently invoked the primacy of the state.... " That is Obama's ideology....fair share and obligation to the state rather than the individual self reliance. "Fascism borrowed theories and terminology from socialism but applied them to what it saw as the more significant conflict between nations and races rather than to class conflict, and focused on ending the divisions between classes within the nation." This doesn't describe the Bush Doctrine at all. If you think it does provide examples. Obama is certainly the one borrowing from socialist and fascists in his desire to create a society where the good of the collective trumps individual rights similar to the German Socialist Party.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362142228270</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 07:50:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362142428079-16</Id><Title>Can BA lose even more than it has already?</Title><Msg>We preferred to present this link with all of us.

Now we often hear that college loan debt is getting worse and that costs are skyrocketing, but now we have a new study proving it. According to a new report from the New York Federal Reserve, total student loan debt has tripled over the last 8 years. The report finds a correlation between student debt and future issues with borrowing in other borrowing situations in life. For instance, the percentage of people who are buying homes and have student loan debt has fallen from 9 to 4 percent. The mortgage market is not so favorable to those with a large amount of debt already. Many people are now thinking about the domino affect of student debt on the economy. Now young adults who are dealing with student loan debt are dealing with the choices of what to do about paying back their loans. In the previous decades, many would use large portions of their paychecks to pay down the debt. But instead it is looking like many students now are using their paychecks to spend on other things and are simply paying minimal amounts down on their debts. The growth in student loan debt is due to more students attending college, more parents taking out loans to cover their child’s education and not having many options to discharge the debt. With the sequester slowly approaching it is no surprise that this is just another issue that we must all think about when it comes to budgeting the future. Spending is a major issue in this country right now, and until the economy gets better, it seems that this will continue to be one of those cyclical issues that will fix itself when things get better.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1362147565693</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:19:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362147633375-31</Id><Topic><Title>Should a passenger on a 787 feel safe with a fix that does not address the cause &amp; fix of the fire incident ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362135726167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 06:02:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You put your head in the dark!</Msg><Username>jackrip_eu</Username><Timestamp>1362147633375</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:20:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362147656456-32</Id><Topic><Title>I used to Balme Obama for the Damage done to the Mediocre Class</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362092636909</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 18:03:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You get weened, and lied to day after day, and you are of the low level class that has difficulty connecting the dots, and you become an air breathing mass of ignorance that has to be bused to the polls to even vote.

The slump in incomes in January was the biggest since January 1993 and followed a 2.6 percent jump in December. Some companies paid dividends and employee bonuses earlier than usual before tax rates went up this year, removing a gain usually seen in January. The Commerce Department estimated the January level of wages was reduced by about $15 billion and December was boosted by about $30 billion, reflecting the timing of the bonuses. The saving rate dropped to 2.4 percent from 6.4 percent. Disposable Income Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, dropped 4 percent after adjusting for inflation, the biggest plunge since monthly records began in 1959. The drop also reflected the lapse of the payroll tax holiday. Excluding the effect of the tax and other special factors such as the timing of bonuses and dividends, disposable personal income would have increased 0.3 percent in January, the same as in December, the report said.

By Friday, one of the reasons behind the protest was highlighted when unemployment hit its highest level in at least two decades. Official figures Friday showed that unemployment in the country in January rose to 11.7 percent from the previous month's 11.3 percent. January's figure was the highest since the current way of measuring unemployment was introduced in 1992. The unexpectedly large monthly spike was one of the key backdrops to the election results earlier this week that reignited concerns over Europe's dormant debt crisis. No party, or coalition of parties, emerged with enough votes to govern alone, triggering uncertainty in the markets about the future course of Italian economic policy.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1362150494524</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:08:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362150849619-45</Id><Title>Unemployment: Italy hits 21-year high... 26.2% in Spain...</Title><Msg>Italy's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate jumped to 11.7 percent in January from 11.3 percent the month before to hit its highest level for at least 21 years, data showed on Friday. 26.2% for Spain</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1362150849619</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:14:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362150971346-46</Id><Title>Britain heads for new recession</Title><Msg>(Reuters) - The risk that Britain is entering its third recession in four years grew on Friday with figures showing that manufacturing shrank unexpectedly last month and mortgage approvals for home buyers dropped in January Gross domestic product fell at the end of last year, bringing Britain within sight of another recession and the latest data suggested the central bank may need to do yet more to revive the economy. The pound sank to its lowest level against the dollar in more than 2-1/2 years, while prices of British government bonds - which the Bank of England could resume buying - rose after the releases. The Markit/CIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 47.9 from a downwardly revised 50.5 in January, confounding forecasts for a rise to 51.0. It was the first reading below the 50 line that separates growth from contraction since November. A separate release showed that mortgage approvals fell unexpectedly despite the authorities' efforts to boost lending. "It's a bit of a double whammy of disappointing news," said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank. "Not a good start (to the year) and really shouldn't change anyone's view that there's precious little growth momentum in the UK and particularly not in manufacturing." The numbers are the latest in a string of bad news for the Conservative-led coalition government and its finance minister George Osborne. Moody's downgraded Britain's triple-A rating last week, prompted by weak economic growth prospects.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1362150971346</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:16:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362150972934-47</Id><Topic><Title>What zoo animal does Michelle Obama look like ?</Title><Username>art.constantine</Username><Timestamp>1362149785362</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:56:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of those red butt babboons that spends it's days throwing it's #$%$ at the visitors while shrieking...</Msg><Username>king_kwanza</Username><Timestamp>1362150972934</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:16:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362151165651-48</Id><Topic><Title>What zoo animal does Michelle Obama look like ?</Title><Username>art.constantine</Username><Timestamp>1362149785362</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:56:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"What zoo animal does Michelle Obama look like ?"

Which is probably just as well for Obama, given how embarrassingly unbalanced it is. Last week, New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote about how Obama "hasn't actually come up with a proposal to avert sequestration, let alone one that is politically plausible." Turns out, Obama did have one, although Brooks can be excused for not knowing it, since the administration hasn't exactly been promoting this so-called plan. That, too, is understandable, since it isn't a plan at all, just a list of numbers with little to back them up. There are no details, for example, about the $200 billion in cuts to defense and domestic discretionary programs, other than that Obama wants them split evenly. And while he offers $400 billion in "health savings," 30% are lumped in a bucket labeled "other." Worse, Obama's "balanced" plan actually counts hundreds of billions of new revenues from taxes, fees and rebates as "spending reductions." Examples: • His plan to "strengthen" unemployment insurance is labeled as a cut, but it's really a $50 billion tax hike. • The $35 billion from the federal worker retirement programs involves boosting worker contributions. • Most of the $35 billion in Medicare savings comes from charging wealthy seniors more. • The $140 billion in "reduced payments to drug companies" are in fact rebates Obama wants drugmakers to pay Uncle Sam for selling drugs to poor seniors. • Then there's the $45 billion in spectrum fees and asset sales that Obama lists as spending reductions. Viewed correctly, it turns out that more than $300 billion — about a third — of Obama's proposed "spending cuts" are actually revenue increases. As a result, instead of $1.2 trillion in spending cuts called for by the sequester over the next decade, Obama would add more than $1 trillion in re</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1362151675166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:27:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362151879189-51</Id><Topic><Title>I used to Balme Obama for the Damage done to the Mediocre Class</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362092636909</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 18:03:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>instant_karma48 needs to read Mir's post.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1362151879189</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:31:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362152340571-52</Id><Topic><Title>President's plan: $1 trillion in new taxes...</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1362151675166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:27:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes Obama is the disinformation king.

No weapons. Why? What is holding back the Obama administration in helping people in a dire situation? Well over 60,000 people have died there since the violence began. Basically, then, we are doing and intend to do nothing to help. Yet, we bombed the heck out of Libya and orchestrated Ghaddafi’s death because there was a perceived (likely contrived) threat to the “good” (radicalized) people of Benghazi. This is a question for Hooz and Chris. You guys are die-hard Obama fans. Obama has or has had predator drones arbitrarily and capriciously killing people in eight different countries, but Syria is, effectively, “hands off”. Thus, there is no way that Obama is operating out of a moral ethic in not helping. There has to be another reason. Well, I suspect that you will not respond because you have no answer. On the other hand, rumors going back ten years are that the Iraqi chemical and biological WMDs were moved to Syria before we invaded Iraq. There is no way that the Obama administration is going to ALLOW the Syrian rebels to succeed and reveal a truth that would kill the Democrat Party.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1362162559586</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 13:29:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362162570444-80</Id><Title>'I am Not a Dictator.

How soon Boeing can fix the problems, which have led to the 787s being grounded worldwide for over a month, depends partly on the approval process by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, said Shinichiro Ito, who took up the positions of president of ANA Holdings Inc. and chairman of All Nippon Airways on Thursday.

Go to NGRAMS. It appears that this is part of the evolvement of the English language which occurs over time and a result of the attempt at making English a universal language. That is, "aircraft", just as "software", as plural does not conform to the "rules" of singular/plural - by adding an "s". It may be easier for you or I to follow english language, grammar, and spelling rules resulting from immersion since childhood, but folks, say, from China, are very apt to incorrectly pluralize something due to lack of such immersion in the English language.

The speculation about Syria came a couple years later. Say that Bush had determined that to be the case (i.e, WMDs moved to Syria). Was he not in enough "hot water" for invading Iraq? What would have been the reaction if he then put his "focus" on Syria. Basically, it would have been too late. No way would the country put up with going after Syria - just to prove the existence of WMD. Bush's credibility was zilch by then. But, I created too much diversion for the two of you with my speculations. You did not answer my question: why is Obama not doing anything about the situation in Syria? At least at the level of Libya - with now nearly one hundred times the number of deaths. As I said, I did not expect you to answer the question.

It was one lie after another, and there are pages of them. The facts will come out on Syria, but I don't have them at this time. But Bill Clinton, a Democrat, faced impeachment hearings, and the media covered them. Lying us into Iraq started 13 years ago. I waited four years before speaking on Iraq. I'll give Barack Obama the same consideration.</Msg><Username>the_loading_dock_01</Username><Timestamp>1362169413983</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 15:23:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362169461575-101</Id><Topic><Title>'I am Not a Dictator.

One can always nitpick past events and comments, especially in the days before internet and 24 hour coverage, etc. But now with videos, cell phone cameras, tweets, etc and the easy ability to selectively edit videos ( a la NBC , MSNBC or shoud I say MSDNC ) facts and dagta seem to be able to slowly surface to a degree never before possible. methinks the ObUma group should update Sol alinsky rules for radicals to accomodate the internet. Lacking that, history lessons may be needed. - Nixon said I am not a #$%$ - and splitting hairs he was correct. But simply substitute dishonest - and the results are obvious. The sun came up today in seattle, and I expect it will tomorrow- despite Obamageddon Given the chance to make any cut he so desired, ObUma backed down No doubt above his pay grade - or beneath him takes time away from giving policy direction to God !!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1362172094233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 16:08:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362172166219-110</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Gets Economic Advice from Al Sharpton</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1361556219752</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:03:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The pimp with the limp was invited but had to do his radio show....</Msg><Username>king_kwanza</Username><Timestamp>1362172166219</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 16:09:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362172492294-111</Id><Topic><Title>Barry says, "...I should somehow.....uh.....you know....do a Jedi mind meld..."</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362167923366</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 14:58:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have to weigh in on this one....(the bulbous Raven becomes self concious when you mention "weigh in"..so I will make an observation instead)....The mainstream media is BOUGHT AND PAID FOR .....

" When you have directors who are busy with their own companies [like Mr . McNerney], that limits time they have for P&amp;G and that ca n be problematic. " Mr. McNerney should follow the example of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings who left the Microsoft board in October 2012. "I've decided to reduce the number of boards I serve on, so that I can focus on Netflix, " said Hastings.

Boeing is trying to convince federal regulators that it has found ways to prevent the hazards with the lithium-ion batteries that led to the grounding of the new planes in January. On Friday, the company met for several hours in Seattle with technical representatives of the airlines to go over those plans. Since mid-January, the eight carriers that received 50 787s have canceled thousands of flights and scrambled to rearrange their schedules. Boeing hopes the 787s, can fly passengers again in April. But aviation analysts said it could be three to six months before that happened. Michael P. Huerta, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, told Congress this week that agency experts were evaluating Boeing’s plans to redesign and test the battery. He said his staff would provide him with its assessment of Boeing’s proposals next week. “Once we approve a plan, then we have to go through the process of actually implementing the plan, which would involve a great deal of testing, a great deal of further analysis and re-engineering before those planes will be flying again,” Mr. Huerta said. Officials from the federal agency said Boeing needed to conduct more laboratory tests on the proposed changes before they would consider test flights. Safety investigators are still not certain what went wrong in two separate incidents in which one battery caught fire and another emitted smoke. Besides dealing with the hazards, Boeing will probably end up paying the airlines tens of millions in compensation for the disruptions, analysts said. Japan’s All Nippon Airways, has canceled over 3,600 domestic and international flights through May. United declined to say how much revenue it had lost because of the 787’s grounding and what type of compensation it would seek from Boeing. Poland’s national airline, LOT, has taken its two 787s out of its schedule through the end of September and will also seek compensation from Boeing. One of its planes is still parked at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport. Air India has said Boeing might provide compensation for the difference in the costs of operating a larger 777 instead of the more fuel-efficient 787. The other 787 operators are Japan Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, LAN Airlines of Chile and Qatar Airways. Boeing has orders for about 800 additional jets. All Nippon has said that its 150 787-trained pilots have been forced to remain at home while pilots for other types of planes take on the additional workload.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362195112586</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 22:31:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362195197452-163</Id><Topic><Title>Jay Carney Embarrasses Himself – Can’t Back Up Obama’s Sequester Claims</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1362159634720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 12:40:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Woodward is showing a little integrity .

The pack was triple-wrapped in fibreglass cloth, about 12 layers, altogether. The purpose was to test whether the apparatus would contain a large LiPo pack ignition and direct the effluent outside through the pipe. Details of the apparatus (window closure, pipe installation, etc.) are moot. The ignition blew the ammo box lid open and a three-foot diameter fireball erupted. ...Tj cooper has done considerable LiPo ignition testing and has expressed an interest in testing large packs in a sealed ammo can. I would advise against it, since even a generously vented can will not withstand the initial pressure buildup. In my test, that buildup occurred over a timespan I would estimate at about a half-second. There was no supplementary air introduced into the box during the pressure buildup.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1362198486356</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 23:28:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362198852292-168</Id><Topic><Title>The BA BATTERY flamethrower</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1361587230282</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 21:40:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and this was in 2005 !! now BA uses a more volitile battery than the li - polymer type and a much larger battery cell(s) " fire in the hole " clear the ramp move on move on nothing to see here !!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1362198852292</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 23:34:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
