They don’t realize that by indulging the Tea Baggers they have vastly diminished their value to contemporary society. They don’t see just how badly their power is fading. The more the youth becomes eligible to vote and the old white folks fade into the dust the more power for the Democrats. The youth are not fooled by the archaic reactionary thought process of Republicans/Tea Baggers. Basically, this was the analysis of a Republican, George Will, during the presidential election. The country's demographics are shifting to the Democrats and this mind boggling acrimony and insult they serve daily is only back firing on themselves. Most of the previous well thought of and respected Republicans such as Eisenhower, Howard Baker, Ronald Reagan, Jacob Javits, Rockefeller, the Republicans Members of the Watergate Committee etc. to name but a few, would not even be allowed into the current Republican Party with the political platforms they espoused while they were active politicians. That's because they still had some humanity and integrity; something that Tea Baggers and right Wingers decry. Even Nixon would be too liberal for the current gaggle of Republicans. They old guard were much more willing to negotiate and compromise, but they’d all be considered Liberals now for sure. They must be turning over in their graves to see their party turned into trash by these miserable misanthropes. The current group are simply acrimonious bigots with warped arguments that they have gleaned from the Fox News brainwashing machines. First thing they ought to realize is that they lost the election and next that the era of White Supremacy in politics is over in America. Then they should boot out all the Tea Baggers and let then run on their own ticket. Of course, either way they lose.</Msg><Username>rumi1one</Username><Timestamp>1369801262824</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 00:21:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369802547870-5</Id><Title>Re: Chris Genna</Title><Msg>I was gagged, tied, and thrown out of a VC chopper ]when Chris Genna showed up</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369802547870</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 00:42:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369804476254-6</Id><Title>Every-=body is learning a new BA dance now</Title><Msg>apparentlty it was NOT BTO but Grand Funk Railroad called the loco rwnj mmmotion</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369804476254</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:14:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369804774951-7</Id><Topic><Title>Every-=body is learning a new BA dance now</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369804476254</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:14:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>111.11.11.11 there is no way i9n the universe</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369804774951</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:19:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369805645357-8</Id><Title>Bomb somethining - Paperback writer</Title><Msg>a llittle pre-woodstock thingy the rive is runnining high an cold hippies willing to jump of bridge for one dollar over 10,000 vertical can you ]picke me up up in Mariposa I will be wearing the the broken tube bicycle when the cowsd mate ihn the valley]we will czall it jake ] until the morrow/week</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369805645357</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:34:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369805674819-9</Id><Topic><Title>Why Democrats Will Win the House in 2014</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369790457799</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 21:20:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The flaw in that analysis is in assuming that the Democrats want to win Congress. They don't. Both the Republicans and the Democrats want a Dem in the WH and a Republican Congress. That way neither side is expected to actually do anything, each side can blame the gridlock on the other side, and both can use breaking the gridlock and defeating the danger of the others as a selling point in raising campaign funds.

Market dynamics have worked very beautifully in your favor, and there is - by definition - not a long out there right now that isn't happy with his/her purchase. For me its nice to be already in the next big winner as it to is heavily shorted and like with TSLA as one stock is done the next one will kick in for me. Boeing longs your waisting your time with BA . So you missed a huge deal and I todlyou all about it . BA longs , you did not make 13% today and 5 % the previous day or almost( 17% on the short squeeze I called in the premarket this morning on my first user comment ) and you missed a 100% since I called it on may3. just 15 trade days ago. Next time you better stop your BA gibberish and take advantage of what I tell you. However, I will have been in the next huge gainer for a while( I am already building my position ) as with TSLA , before I clue you loser BA gibberish shills in as usual. I did this with Apple many years ago too . I just want you BA shills to be exposed for the worthless gibberish BA shills that you are. Any investor in BA per hart-smith , is not making good money over time unless your ok with less than 100% gains every 15 days. Right now if you had dropped your BA gibberish on May3 you would be almost 100% ahead of any TSLA pull back and able to watch with a built up gain or pad or in the wood of 100% gain to make a decision as to if you want to hold or get out. However , Now any BA long is too late to the party and would be chasing the tail of the starship TSLA .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369806318694</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:45:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369806459802-12</Id><Topic><Title>Every-=body is learning a new BA dance now</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369804476254</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:14:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well....</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369806459802</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:47:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369806648804-13</Id><Topic><Title>Tesla in short squeeze and I called it this morning befor the stock market open, how did I know read here</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369784065405</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 19:34:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its time to say goodnight, as I take my two day 18% short squeeze TSLA gain and my 15 day 100% gain are you BA gibberish stock market shills happy with your very small BA gain up less than 22% in 5 years on BA stock now ?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369806648804</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:50:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369806790546-14</Id><Title>1-3-5 out of 200</Title><Msg>apparently somebody gave me the complete set of chemistry work and test answers ironed and pressed with a hot iron up until the third quarter the rest I hads to figures out</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369806790546</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:53:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369806972048-15</Id><Topic><Title>1-3-5 out of 200</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369806790546</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:53:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as in: ooottafagvah the 12 cranial nerves but, hey, what about ]doin' the loco-motion</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369806972048</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:56:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369807615021-16</Id><Topic><Title>1-3-5 out of 200</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369806790546</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 01:53:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>twenty Tuesdays</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1369807615021</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 02:06:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369808012130-17</Id><Topic><Title>CEO of BA and the CEO of TSLA which is better ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369772198649</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 16:16:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A look at BA CEO as of March 15, 2013, for all Boeing investors did your stock gain 61% in the same time frame that the Boeing CEO goat a 61% pay increase?

Agriculture in America and in any other country on Earth would not be able to produce the amount of food they do with out manufactured fertilizer, manufactured pesticide and manufactured herbicide. Industry and agriculture that use these chemicals have to attend classes on safe use which includes safe time frames for application. It is the few who vary from that who are dangerous. When I say genetically modified seed hasn't been tested enough, it is to say nothing has been shown to be bad yet. Problems could take longer to manifest with that than with agent orange. One problem so far is gmo cross pollinating with crops on Organic farms. They work to maintain the integrity of heritage seed. Further, companies like Monsanto are very harsh in dealing with agriculture that fails to tightly control the patented seed. Very harshly.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1369846021921</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 12:47:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369846151386-60</Id><Topic><Title>Obonzo's bus gonna roll over Eric Holder</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369837781513</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:29:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama never was a leader.

After reaching final orbit, WGS-5 will complete several maneuvers and tests before beginning operations. WGS-5, part of the upgraded Block II series, will continue to extend the global reach of the WGS system to more users. The spacecraft and its ground terminals can operate in X- and Ka-band frequencies, and coverage areas can be shaped to meet users’ needs.

I provided EPA findings on those products and they are safe. Those who still think Monsanto is killing people are anti-science deniers. My comments on GM crops is also backed up by the latest scientific assessment that the net result of using GM crops is better for the environment than regular crops. Several famous anti-GM crop activists have now apologized for publishing anti-GM crop articles and are now supporters after having reviewed the scientific literature. With respect to population concerns my answer is that overpopulation problems will NOT disappear and that we need to grow much more food. My research via agricultural research centers like U of I, show that progess on hybrids will soon lead to yield of 300 bushels/acre of corn (twice what it is now) which will accomodate the growing population headed for 9 billion people by 2050. My views on this issue match the majority of scientists dealing in these areas as I have read a broad swath of literature and peer reviewed studies on this. I reject bad science, like that of Paul Ehrlich, which fails to account for the continual discovery/creation of new resources to help sustain a growing population. The key to population control is education and economic development. All developed countries are losing domestic population and relying on immigration to sustain population levels. if you go to the Population Reference Bureau Fact Sheet: World Population Trends 2012, you will see that population in developed countries is stagnant and undeveloped countries will see population taper off as they become more developed. The problem that offers the fix to sustainability is economic development according to the scientific research.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369854605699</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:10:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369854937465-78</Id><Topic><Title>Clinton killed 500,000 children according to a '60 Minutes' May 12, 1996 broadcast</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369840516641</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 11:15:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>typical toad... croaking at anything that will give it attention !!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369854937465</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:15:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369855138310-79</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Democrats hate the Private Sector so Much?</Title><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1369854387287</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:06:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The catch 22 here is the fact they need the private sector to fund their big govt socialist policies.

To say that it is is a stretch. What the military is is a two edge sword. The military can either be used to abuse our rights or to protect our rights. When government is of the elite, by the elite, and for the elite, government uses military force to control the means of production or distribution — and the People. When government is of the People, by the People, and for the People, government uses military force to protect the People’s rights to life, liberty, and property (i.e., pursuit of happiness). In the first case military forces exist as parasites feeding upon civilization. In the second case, military forces protect civilization from predators and parasites. Providentially, the United States military still serves as our protector. Our military forces exists as an organ of our government. Thus what is true of our military is also true of limited government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. — James Madison from The Federalist No. 51 Consider our Courts, Congress, the IRS, US Customs and Border Protection, the Patent and Trademark Office, and so forth. Much the Federal Government, particularly those parts which existed before the 20th Century, exist solely because we are not angels.</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1369855271040</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:21:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369855507307-81</Id><Topic><Title>Google "Monsanto" and "Evil"</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369742540846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 08:02:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>toad... then you dont mind if i spray you with Herbicide Orange !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369855507307</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:25:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369855916234-82</Id><Title>Who is the most greedy?</Title><Msg>A.

I'm not talking about the public programs that come to many minds when socialism is discussed in an American context. These programs often help people in need and do many other useful things, but they don't attempt to change the underlying systemic design and the political power it confers on corporate actors. I'm talking about the (efficient) government ownership of businesses, some set up in the past and still working very nicely, thank you, and many new efforts now also flourishing big-time. For a start: It's often forgotten—or simply not known—that there are more than two thousand publicly owned electric utilities now operating, day by day, week by week, throughout the United States (many in the conservative South). Indeed, 25 percent of US electricity is supplied by locally owned public utilities and co-ops. Moreover, most of these now conventional "socialist" operations have a demonstrated capacity to provide electricity at lower cost to the consumer, not to mention cheaper and more accessible broadband. (Nationally, on average, customers of private utilities pay 14 percent more than customers of public utilities.) One obvious reason: Public utilities and co-ops simply don't pay the same exorbitant executive salaries common in the private sector. They get pretty much the same work done for far less. General managers of the largest class of publicly owned power companies earned an average salary of roughly $260,000 in 2011. Average compensation for CEOs of large investor-owned utilities was $6 million—almost twenty-five times as much.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369863932996</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 17:45:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369863944842-93</Id><Topic><Title>This is a mediocre board with rabid liberals.....</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1369833778668</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:22:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nope- a mediocre board with ignorant liberals ( oops a redundancy ) pushing a marxist theory Commies are the eventual results of marxism ...</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1369863944842</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 17:45:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369863960591-94</Id><Topic><Title>clsn, so I told you I was working another short squeeze like TSLA today I took it gained 35% hows your BA doing ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369857196424</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:53:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Forgot, I can claim the following buys and short's I participated in yesterday as another example.

Cynthia Weidner, an executive at the benefits consultant High Roads, agreed that the tax appeared to be having the intended effect. “The premise it’s built upon is happening,” she said, adding, “the consumer should continue to expect that their plan is going to be more expensive, and they will have less benefits.” The trend is accelerating. The percentage of employers revising their plans as a result of the tax has increased to 17 percent this year from 11 percent in 2011, according to a survey of U.S. companies released this month by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. Although the tax does not start until 2018, employers say they have to start now to meet the deadline and they are doing whatever they can to bring down the cost of their plans. Under the law, an employer or health insurer offering a plan that costs more than $10,200 for an individual and $27,500 for a family would typically pay a 40 percent excise tax on the amount exceeding the threshold. “I’m actually much more focused on the Cadillac tax in 2018 than on 2014,” Steve First, a benefits executive at Pfizer, said at a recent meeting of employers. “For us, 2018 is a challenge.” Raising deductibles is one way to lower the cost.</Msg><Username>verycraftytoo</Username><Timestamp>1369864929716</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 18:02:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369867809578-99</Id><Topic><Title>Baggers WRONG Five Years in a Row</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1369750053468</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 10:07:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When was the biggest prevarication from gregjanetommax: 1.

That’s so Bachmann: All smiles and chirpy optimism, she’s going to tell you up front that the swirling scandal and her dropping poll numbers aren’t the reason behind her departure – when they are precisely the reason. Bachmann came to national public attention when she told Hardball’s Chris Matthews in 2008 that she thought the media ought to investigate the anti-American views of the Democratic presidential nominee, Barack Obama. That wasn’t all: “I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out: Are they pro-America or anti-America?” Our 21st century Joe McCarthy had arrived, in a perfectly highlighted helmet of hair and bright lipstick. She became a self-anointed leader of the fledgling Tea Party that next year, and ably represented its toxic blend of fear and misunderstanding: anti-Obama, anti-government spending, anti-science. She accused Obama of running a “gangster government,” suggested a cluster of 2011 earthquakes and hurricanes were God’s punishment for the “morbid obesity diet” of federal spending, and maybe most famously, insisted the HPV vaccine caused “mental retardation.” Who can forget when she was chosen (or chose herself?) to deliver the official Tea Party response to the 2011 State of the Union address – and spent the entire time staring a little alarmingly at the wrong camera?. In some ways, that was the beginning of the end for Bachmann as national leader – but she ran for president anyway. In that great primary season of 2012, in which all of the subpar GOP candidates got to take their turn at the top, (kind of like a children’s T-ball game where everyone’s a winner!), Bachmann, unbelievably, went first: She won the Ames Straw Poll, which made her the front-runner for a minute. What a campaign! She confused John Wayne and John Wayne Gacy in a stop at Waterloo, Iowa, and wished Elvis Presley a happy birthday on the anniversary of his death. Maybe most memorably, in a peroration on the greatness of the Founders, she insisted they had “worked tirelessly to end slavery,” when they had not done any such thing, and particularly praised Founder John Quincy Adams, who was in fact not a Founder but the son of one. Actually, “most memorable campaign moment” has to go to her attempts to eat a corn dog on camera, which were only topped by her husband Marcus’s efforts to do the same thing. Marcus, the psychologist who worked to get gay men to give up their gayness, who told reporters he was the “high maintenance” Bachmann, and greeted campaign reporters with balloons. Wednesday morning, Joe Scarborough was just one of several Republicans to note the impact Bachmann made on the 2012 race, even as she lost Iowa and quickly dropped out. Still, her strong Ames showing knocked Tim Pawlenty out of the race, which apparently secures her place in history. You know the GOP has big problems when folks are still looking back at 2012 and missing Tim Pawlenty, They won’t miss Bachmann. She combined a crackpot appeal to the far-right with an apparent tolerance, if not encouragement, of ethical lapses and campaign finance dodges that threatened to damage not only her but her party. The Office of Congressional Ethics is investigating claims by former Bachmann campaign aides that she illegally used money from her House campaign to pay for her unsuccessful Iowa caucus bid. A government watchdog told Salon’s Alex Seitz-Wald that the ethics questions “could be a career ender for Michele Bachmann.” She ended her congressional career herself – but unless she faces ongoing legal troubles, Bachmann will no doubt remain in public life, joining Sarah Palin on the ex-politician/grifter gravy train. There’s a lot of money to be made out there. As Bachmann exits one door and opens another, we only have one request: Can she please take the Ames Straw Poll with her? Oh, and leave us Marcus.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369874779740</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 20:46:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>15</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369874878717-113</Id><Title>Part 1 Confidential report lists U.S. weapons systemdesigns compromised by Chinese cyberspies</Title><Msg>Believe that China is your ally. Now drink the coolaid and repeat after me, "China is our ally" "China is our friend." "peoples form the peoples republic are good." By Ellen Nakashima, Ellen Nakashima May 27, 2013 10:54 PM EDT The Washington Post Designs for many of the nation’s most sensitive advanced weapons systems have been compromised by Chinese hackers, according to a report prepared for the Pentagon and to officials from government and the defense industry. Among more than two dozen major weapons systems whose designs were breached were programs critical to U.S. missile defenses and combat aircraft and ships, according to a previously undisclosed section of a confidential report prepared for Pentagon leaders by the Defense Science Board. Experts warn that the electronic intrusions gave China access to advanced technology that could accelerate the development of its weapons systems and weaken the U.S. military advantage in a future conflict. The Defense Science Board, a senior advisory group made up of government and civilian experts, did not accuse the Chinese of stealing the designs. But senior military and industry officials with knowledge of the breaches said the vast majority were part of a widening Chinese campaign of espionage against U.S. defense contractors and government agencies. The significance and extent of the targets help explain why the Obama administration has escalated its warnings to the Chinese government to stop what Washington sees as rampant cyber­theft. In January, the advisory panel warned in the public version of its report that the Pentagon is unprepared to counter a full-scale cyber-conflict. The list of compromised weapons designs is contained in a confidential version, and it was provided to The Washington Post.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1369874878717</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 20:47:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369877059890-114</Id><Topic><Title>Bye-bye, Bachmann</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369874779740</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 20:46:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A bad day for Teahadists.

He continued to blame the Army for sending him back to war in the first place. "He's broken, and we broke him," Browne said. The massacre raised questions about the toll multiple deployments were taking on American troops. For that reason, many legal experts believed it that it was unlikely that he would receive the death penalty, as Army prosecutors were seeking. The military justice system hasn't executed anyone since 1961. We ( Americans ) chose not to have a Draft throughout the many years of Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts requiring the "Stop Loss" program that fell on Soldiers like SSgt Barnes.... Rapid 're'deployments took our Military personnel away from friends and family and put them in harms way ( with ALL that implies ) .. . This Soldier was deployed to remote and dangerous posts for extended period over several years, decorated, seen comrades wounded / killed and had to Kill and was wounded. We ( Americans ) sent him back for four tours !!! .This Blood is on ALL our hands, JMHO.. I hope we learn about all the costs in War besides Blood and Treasure. All the Chairborne CommanDoes can now feel free to abuse me and the Right of free Speech that SSgt Barnes and others provide them. .</Msg><Username>tcmoiba</Username><Timestamp>1369877515405</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 21:31:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369878193539-117</Id><Topic><Title>Bye-bye, Bachmann</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369874779740</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 20:46:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No matter how you spin it, you can't remove the leftist smell in congress, and in the White House.
