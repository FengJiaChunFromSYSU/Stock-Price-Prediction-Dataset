Even those 129 were not all about Boeing stock. My posts are relevent to Boeing and are factual. I have posted before in the past that Boeing was the dog of the DOW before when it was. This year it isn't the dog of the DOW Why must you attempt to degrade everyone who has facts to present. Boeing has been the second best DOW index company this year. Also probably the highest contributer to the DOW point rise this year. It has not been the DOG of the DOW this year. "Before your degrading response is posted, I should mention I do not own Boeing/TESLA/Airbus nor do I intend to", those are my words hoping to just post some truth on how Boeing has done this year</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1378624392711</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-08 03:13:12

But how many innocent civilians will be killed in the attacks as the cruel Assad uses women and children as human shields. If we aren't going to really get involved in removing Assad then I think our best efforts should be to provide humanitarian and medical aid for the refugees of the war, and not by sending more destruction into Syria.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1378675370226</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-08 17:22:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378675609246-37</Id><Topic><Title>NSA spying on US citizens, Obama supporting AlQaeda ..Concept of False Flags...</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378484947587</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-06 12:29:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Americans now understand what a false flag attack is.....they know Obama is aiding Alqaeda...they are weary of Obamas warmongering and the polls support it...Real Americans are waking up....now YOU wake up...anyone who supports Obamas illegal attempt to circumvent Congress and attack Syria is aiding Alqaeda...Why do yousupport terrorists ?

Based in frontier Tennessee, Jackson was a politician and army general who defeated the Creek Indians at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814), and the British at the Battle of New Orleans (1815). A polarizing figure who dominated the Second Party System in the 1820s and 1830s, as president he dismantled the Second Bank of the United States and initiated forced relocation and resettlement of Native American tribes from the Southeast to west of the Mississippi River. His enthusiastic followers created the modern Democratic Party. The 1830–1850 period later became known as the era of Jacksonian democracy.[1] Jackson was nicknamed "Old Hickory" because of his toughness and aggressive personality; he fought in duels, some fatal to his opponents.[2] He was a wealthy slaveholder. He fought politically against what he denounced as a closed, undemocratic aristocracy, adding to his appeal to common citizens. He expanded the spoils system during his presidency to strengthen his political base. Elected president in 1828, Jackson supported a small and limited federal government. He strengthened the power of the presidency, which he saw as spokesman for the entire population, as opposed to Congressmen from a specific small district. He was supportive of states' rights, but during the Nullification Crisis, declared that states do not have the right to nullify federal laws. Strongly against the national bank, he vetoed the renewal of its charter and ensured its collapse. Whigs and moralists denounced his aggressive enforcement of the Indian Removal Act, which resulted in the forced relocation of thousands of Native Americans to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Historians acknowledge his protection of popular democracy and individual liberty for United States citizens, criticize him for his support for slavery.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378681548165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-08 19:05:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378682966447-44</Id><Topic><Title>Anybody Know Why Obama and Hillary Lied about Benghazi?</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378413726605</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 16:42:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who says they lied about Benghazi?.
