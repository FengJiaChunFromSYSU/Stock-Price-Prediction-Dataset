Not all the airport excitement is happening in Moscow. Please imagine that you were one of the 325 happy passengers leaving Manchester, England, on Monday on your way to the Dominican Republic. You are cheery because the weather in the Dominican is likely to be rather more divine than the weather in Manchester. Your Airbus 330 (operated by vacation airline Thomas Cook) is picking up speed in order to take you skyward. And then perhaps you are in the "F" seats or to the right and you hear a loud bang and espy flames leaping from the engine. You might just offer an "F" or two of your own. I must confess that, should I have been a passenger on this plane, I might have felt a twinge of anguish that reversed the thrust of my breakfast croissant.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1372343692255</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 10:34:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372343840905-47</Id><Topic><Title>Wayne doing a great job!!!</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1372340263398</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 09:37:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CMOA wayne,,,go into a posting frenzy its always good for a laugh.</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1372343840905</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 10:37:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372343980686-48</Id><Topic><Title>AIRBUST ENGINE FAILS ON TAKEOFF-STOPS SAFELY</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1372343692255</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 10:34:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't be so smug.

Roberts, and Samuel Alito reportedly realized today that they would someday be portrayed as villains in an Oscar-winning film about the fight for marriage equality. “Oh, God, the major social ramifications, the political intrigue, all the important people involved in the case—I’m going to be played by some sinister character actor in a drama with tons of award buzz, aren’t I?” said Scalia, joining his fellow dissenting justices in realizing they would be antagonists in a film potentially titled Defense Of Marriage and probably written by Tony Kushner. “I’m going to be portrayed as a closed-minded Neanderthal and the very symbol of backward thinking. And at the end of the movie, when my character realizes he’s on the wrong side of history, the audience will feel emotionally fulfilled because the hero attorney, probably played by George #$%$#$% Clooney, will have won. Great.” While they added that they aren’t looking forward to being vilified on screen, Scalia, Roberts, Alito, and Thomas all agreed that the movie would probably be pretty good, and that they could see Paul Dano getting his first Academy Award nomination for his supporting role as a gay rights crusader.

Was slavery moral where “A majority of those who represent the citizenry voted for it?” According to genna, it was. What about the 3/5ths rule......genna would say that was moral too.

Now there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with that. But what is problematic, I think, is the nature of the appeal. Here’s the text of the e-mail Huckabee sent out: Dear Friends, My immediate thoughts on the SCOTUS ruling that determined that same sex marriage is okay: “Jesus wept.” Five people in robes said they are bigger than the voters of California and Congress combined. And bigger than God. May He forgive us all. Elections matter and our fight to protect Traditional Marriage continues. If you want to help elect men and women who support Life and Marriage, I urge you to make an immediate donation of $3 or more today to Huck PAC. As the Left wing media and activists cheer today’s rulings, help me show them the fight to preserve Traditional Marriage is far from over. Please donate today! Sincerely, Mike Huckabee Based on the character portrait of Jesus as laid out in the New Testament, my own guess is that Jesus would be less likely to weep at Supreme Court decisions that (a) declare federal benefits can’t be denied to gay couples who are already legally married and (b) decline to rule on Proposition 8 than he would in reaction to, say, tens of thousands of innocent people dying in the Syrian civil war; or those who perish in natural disasters; or young children who die of AIDS and malaria in Africa; or Christians being persecuted in Egypt. Or the couple who learn their child will be born with severe handicaps, the husband whose wife is afflicted with Alzheimer’s Disease, the parents of a son who suffers from schizophrenia, or the wife, daughter and sister who dies of cancer, leaving a grieving family and friends behind. I cite these examples in part because they better approximate the circumstances in which we read that Jesus wept (John11:35). This verse, in which Jesus is reacting to Mary and Martha after the death of their brother Lazarus, underscores Jesus’ humanity and his mercy. His tears were not based on judgment but emerged out of a deep compassion, tenderness and sympathy for human suffering. (Even in the less familiar episode where Jesus weeps over Jerusalem, there is no evidence that homosexuality played any role in Jesus’ sorrow. He knew what was going to happen to the city of peace; its destruction in AD 70 had to do with factors wholly unrelated to sexual matters.) I don’t agree with Garry Wills on every matter to be sure, but he rightly points out that Jesus was found in the company of those society deemed as lowly, despised, and defiled – and was himself judged to be unclean, a consorter with Samaritans and loose women, a glutton and a drunkard, and a mocker of the law. “In truth I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes are entering God’s reign before you,” Jesus says to the elders and chief priests of the Temple. And of course Jesus was thoroughly non-political. “He walks through social barriers and taboos as if they were cobwebs,” according to Wills. “People and practices other men were required to shun he embraces with an equanimity that infuriates the proper and observant in his culture.” This doesn’t mean, of course, that Jesus would embrace same sex marriage. Those who make this claim, it seems to me, are disfiguring the Scriptures to match their ideological preferences. It does mean we need to be careful not to reduce Jesus into a caricature that fits neatly into our existing political categories. But my concern goes well beyond this. Mike Huckabee is not only recruiting Jesus to be a foot soldier in the culture wars; he’s trying to raise money for his political action committee on it. I understand that how one views this is entirely subjective, but I for one find this kind of thing to be, at a minimum, tasteless and crass. We all get the game that’s being played: the Supreme Court renders a verdict on a hot-button social issue –and within hours “Jesus wept” is used as a fundraising tool. One has to strike while the iron is hot, after all. Still, you might think that a Christian would use a good deal of caution when it comes to leveraging poignant verses about Jesus into three dollar donations for HuckPAC. In saying all this I’m fully aware of the type of blowback this invites. Why pick on Mike Huckabee? At least he has the courage to stand up to the liberal assault on traditional values. Can’t I distinguish between the fire brigade and the fire? And so forth. I will say that on policy, Mr. Huckabee and I are fairly close in the views we hold (though certainly not identical). But what troubles me, and what I would hope would trouble Huckabee, is we’ve seen what happens when Christians use their faith as a blunt political instrument. It isn’t good for politics; but it’s a good deal worse for Christianity. A politicized faith is discrediting. It pushes people away. And it frankly distorts who Jesus was. I don’t pretend it’s easy to navigate the tricky waters of faith and politics. There are close calls and difficult judgments. When and how to make a moral stand isn’t always self-evident. But what Mike Huckabee has done, in my estimation at least, is not simply cross over a line, but obliterate it. And because he’s a gifted man, and I’m sure in many respects an admirable one, I hope he rethinks his approach.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372352148776</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:55:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372352188390-89</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Chrissie/Hoozedik think Slavery is Moral?</Title><Username>carlosslimrichguy</Username><Timestamp>1372349270663</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:07:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is immoral to put words into the mouth of another.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1372352188390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:56:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372352252069-90</Id><Title>If you built a factory.......you didn't build it....</Title><Msg>.....after the EPA, FDA, OSHA, AFT, TSA and IRS heard about it.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1372352252069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:57:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372352369603-91</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Chrissie/Hoozedik think Slavery is Moral?</Title><Username>carlosslimrichguy</Username><Timestamp>1372349270663</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:07:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, if that's where they came from.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1372352369603</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:59:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372352456119-92</Id><Topic><Title>This Supreme Court is a disgrace</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372293408402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 20:36:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pretty sure I don't qualify.

After the Supreme Court invalidated a key part of the Voting Rights Act that specifically covered Texas, state Attorney General Greg Abbott promised that his state, newly freed from federal oversight, would "immediately" implement its previously blocked voter ID law. The law's a zinger: It requires voters to display proper identification, such as a concealed-weapons permit, while disallowing the use of student ID's from state universities. By the state's own data, Hispanics are markedly less likely to possess the required identification. And some citizens seeking proper ID may have to pay for a copy of a birth certificate in order to obtain it. Having promised to resurrect what is arguably the nation's most partisan voter ID law, Abbott mentioned one more thing: "Redistricting maps passed by the Legislature may also take effect without approval from the federal government.” The maps in question were adopted with "discriminatory purpose," according to a federal district court panel, whose ruling, it seems, was just rendered moot by the Supreme Court. Three facts explain how the panel reached that conclusion. Population growth over the past decade gave Texas four new seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Almost all of that growth resulted from Hispanic and black population increases. Yet once state Republicans finished drawing their election maps, the number of Texas districts in which racial minorities are a majority actually declined. Texas, like California and New Mexico, is already a minority-majority state, with non-Hispanic whites accounting for less than 45 percent of state population. Demographics are changing fast. According to demographer William Frey at the Brookings Institution, only 31.1 percent of Texans under the age of 5 are non-Hispanic white. The demographic wave exposes a peculiar bind Republicans face in redistricting. Democratic majorities use redistricting to maximize their political power. But because the Democratic Party is a multiracial coalition, the redistricting process is partisan without necessarily being racial. For Republicans, partisan is racial. In a diverse state such as Texas, when Republicans aim at Democrats, they inevitably hit minorities. And each hit risks deepening the alienation that many minorities already feel from the Republican Party. There is little public polling on minority awareness or reaction to voter-suppression efforts, so it's hard to gauge the impact. Via e-mail, pollster Matt Barreto of Latino Decisions passed along a line from a November 2012 survey, in which more than nine in 10 black voters said there is "a need for the federal government to play a role in protecting the interests of racial and ethnic minorities in the area of voting rights." That's not much to go on. Whether Hispanic voters share that "concern," however, and whether such concern translates into anger will influence the next few years of Texas politics. The state is basically a vast untapped Democratic well. "There are currently 2 million Latinos eligible to vote who are not registered in Texas. There are 800,000 African Americans eligible to vote, but not registered in Texas," Baretto said. "Registration rates are comparatively low in Texas because historically it has not been competitive and the Democratic Party in Texas has an abysmal record of outreach to minorities." That's changing. Democrats are now investing in organizing the state. They have a long way to go. But if the combination of Republican redistricting and voter ID regulations -- both of which inhibit minority power -- wake the sleeping nonwhite majority, the state's demographic wave could hit shore sooner than many realize. Under optimal circumstances, Barreto said the state could become a battleground in four to eight years. Republicans seem perversely eager to bring it on. After spending the morning gearing up to annoy blacks and Hispanics, Texas Republicans inspired a fiery filibuster by Democratic state legislator Wendy Davis that stretched into the night. By trying to regulate abortion rights out of existence, Texas Republicans made a national hero of Davis, who is already talking of running for governor. Altogether, quite a day.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372358354084</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 14:39:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372358439709-124</Id><Topic><Title>Hoozedik and The evolution of Sex Organs</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1372353839083</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:23:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tee hee.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1372358439709</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 14:40:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372358859005-125</Id><Title>Pelosi Praises Obamacare: “The Implementation of this is Fabulous"</Title><Msg>She is try to imitate the denial of Baghdad Bob McDermott.

BY Trudy Ring Sen. Rand Paul made a remark yesterday about same-sex marriage paving the path for marriage between humans and nonhumans, but he quickly backtracked on it, with an aide characterizing it as “sarcasm.” Discussing the Supreme Court’s marriage equality rulings on Glenn Beck’s radio show, after Beck raised the possibility of polygamous marriage, Paul said, “It is difficult, because if we have no laws on this, people will take it to one extension further — does it have to be humans?” Paul spokeswoman Moira Bagley then told The Washington Post, “Sarcasm sometimes doesn’t translate adequately from radio conversation. “Senator Paul did not suggest that striking down [the Defense of Marriage Act] could lead to unusual marriage arrangements. What he was discussing was that having the state recognize marriage without definition could lead to marriages with no basis in reality.” Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, also backed off from the remark in an interview with Fox News. “Like I said, I don’t think it will be with multiple humans, and I think it will be human and human,” he told Fox’s Megyn Kelly. “And so I didn’t mean that to mean anything other than that I think the government will still probably be involved in defining marriage to a certain aspect. I don’t think we’re going on towards polygamy or things beyond that.” Then, talking with ABC News, he praised Justice Anthony Kennedy’s majority opinion in the DOMA case, striking down the law’s ban on federal government recognition of same-sex marriages. Kennedy “tried to strike a balance,” Paul said, noting that the ruling will not keep states from defining marriage as they choose. “As a country we can agree to disagree,” he added.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372360227332</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 15:10:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372361089267-138</Id><Topic><Title>If you built a factory.......you didn't build it....</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1372352252069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:57:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You wouldn't have built it if you couldn't 1) find a reasonably well-educated workforce to run it 2) have adequate shipping infrastructure to support it 3) have the local population well-enough fed and housed so that you don't have commando raids on your facility 4) have your workforce reasonably well protected from burglars, robbers, and drug dealers 5) have reliable supplies of electricity, water, and natural gas from well-regulated utilities--instead of from extortionists always threatening to cut you off 6) get financing from a regulated lender</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1372361089267</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 15:24:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372361176850-139</Id><Topic><Title>If you built a factory.......you didn't build it....</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1372352252069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:57:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You guys live in a "little ranch by the corner of the river" fantasy world.

Airbus ended with new commitments of $68.7 billion. Airbus has now booked 758 jets for the year of 2013. This impressive number, reached in June, is up against a company target of 800 for the year. Boeing, on the other hand, lost the orders race with a total of $66 billion in commitments. Boeing added 442 plane orders at Paris and now has a total of 692 commitments from the 2013 year. Airbus is also set to launch the A350-900, which will compete with Boeing’s 787-10. The A320 single aisle pulled in an incredible 371 orders during the week’s event. The company now has over 2,400 orders for the A320, which was a big seller at the last Paris Air Show in 2011. In fact, Airbus claims they have a 61% market share in the re-engined single aisle market. Boeing launched their new 787-10 Dreamliner at the Paris Air Show. The newest plane received 102 orders from five different companies. The plane will be delivered in 2018 to the first customers., sure you betya! In five of the last 7 trade days the Boeing market maker has , per regulation requirements reported within 15 minutes of the close that there are a huge amount of sellers o boeing stock and not enough buyers. I called the short squeeze on TSLA last month, this is not a short squeeze on Boeing , but the Boeing market maker is going into his book to cover the shortfall. This is a pattern of sell off . If it continues then boeing stock will ring the bell at 107 the last high in 2007 and sell off over time to the 71 range per Ton O”Brien. The Jim Cramer and James Mcnerney interview, w is paid by Boeing shareholders, and it is a scripted presentation. Jim Cramer is not an independent analyst he is a employee of the network. A paid barker for each and every interview he sell.

Prior to 1655 there were no legal slaves in the colonies, only indentured servants. All masters were required to free their servants after their time was up. Seven years was the limit that an indentured servant could be held. Upon their release they were granted 50 acres of land. This included any Blacks purchased from slave traders. Blacks were also granted 50 acres upon their release. Anthony Johnson was a Black man from modern-day Angola. He was brought to the US to work on a tobacco farm in 1619. In 1622 he was almost killed when Powhatan Indians attacked the farm. 52 out of 57 people on the farm perished in the attack. He married a female black servant while working on the farm. When Anthony was released he was legally recognized as a “free Black man” and ran a successful farm. In 1651 he held 250 acres and five black indentured servants. In 1654, it was time for Anthony to release John Casor, a black indentured servant. Instead Anthony told Casor he was extending his time. Casor left and became employed by the free white man Robert Parker.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1372368354422</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 17:25:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372369455175-151</Id><Title>The Norther States were Where Slave Trading Took Place</Title><Msg>Few know that most slave ships arriving in America flew the flag of “Great Britain”. Once the United States became an independent country, it was the U.S. flag which flew over slave ships, sailing out of “northern” ports, legally and then illegally for over fifty years; the Confederate flag NEVER flew over a single slave ship. Slavery was NOT a product of the south as is falsely stated, but solely created and ran by wealthy northern merchants. It was not for “humanitarian reasons”, but was operated solely for economic profit, power and cheap labor in the establishment and construction of major northern cities and plantations; before being introduced to rich land owners in the south who migrated from the north. African Chieftains who captured their own race in raids on rival tribes sold their own people for a “few gallons of rum”; to New England slave traders. The slaves were then transported on northern slave ships and sold in New England slave markets at fantastic profits; at least those who survived the torturous and horrendous voyage. Even after slave trading was banned in 1808, Northern slave traders continued to smuggle 40,000 slaves a year to America; saying little for the U.S. Government's laws and policing of the problem.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1372369455175</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 17:44:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372370055044-152</Id><Topic><Title>Many African Americans are Descendents of Black Slave Owners</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1372368354422</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 17:25:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, one of the first things you see when you examine the South is that all of the wealth was in the hands of African-Americans... the White folks had nothing.

Your words were " that long-standing American ethos that — simply stated — the U.S. never leaves anyone behind. ... the U.S. always runs to the guns when one of our own is threatened." You seemed nonplussed when my H.S. alarm sounded. I replied, "if we left no one behind in Vietnam, what do all the black flags mean? It's touchy-feely nonsense conservatives propagate to show how much more patriotic they are than the rest of us." I tried to respond but was unable to get it posted. I'll try again in hopes the board regulators ease up this time. Basically, my response was that individuals ennoble themselves by showing the courage necessary to rescue their buddies. But it is an individual attribute and should not be interpreted as a national standard -- if it were, then it's to be expected and there's nothing unusual or exemplary about it. A commander can't really order you to do it because losing a combat effective or 2 or 3 to save one wounded is poor military tactics. (I think it was well-covered in the episode of "Band of Brothers" that was about Bastogne.) And in your example, a C-in-C has to weigh the good that might be accomplished against the losses that could result -- losses for which he ALSO would be blamed. In 1969, the 101st Airborne Div. had ALL its members SIGN an oath to rescue/recover any comrade IF POSSIBLE. There was no requirement to risk your life to do so. That a lot of guys DID risk their life is to THEIR credit, not the division's, not the Army's, not the nation's. So your saying that it's a tradition our military has long had is incorrect. It is common that individuals in our military do it. Because they fight, after all, for each other.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1372377272047</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 19:54:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372379604407-171</Id><Topic><Title>Is Texas Now A Blue State?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372358354084</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 14:39:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey now hold on just a minute!

The colonel (?) at the time supposedly remarked he was paraphrased ( amazed )- and I think he- the colonel is next up in the public hearing(s) on the issue. The reason that since one willing to go was a medic and would be more effective to treat incoming is probably valid - but that means an assumption that the other ( two ) volunteers would be o9f no use- and that the attack was ' deemed" to be over. It is more telling that those on the ground and rescued have been to date hidden- IMO- the very bottom line is that the whole mess was driven- covered up for political reasons, instead of reasonable military options.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1372382906915</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 21:28:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372383274982-177</Id><Topic><Title>Is Texas Now A Blue State?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372358354084</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 14:39:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's the difference between red and blue.................
