Lincolnton Furniture Company was silent Friday, a day after shutting down. President Bruce Cochrane and other company officers did not return messages to The Associated Press. Company financial officer Ben Causey said manufacturing operations were stopped indefinitely because orders were insufficient. He told The Charlotte Observer that only a few people would remain employed and the next steps were uncertain.</Msg><Username>jetstream_2010</Username><Timestamp>1357365457842</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 00:57:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357367735895-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama the Job Creator !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>jetstream_2010</Username><Timestamp>1357365457842</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 00:57:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When you state that "Obama the Job Creator", I assume you are being sarcastic. There has been so much uncertainty within the business world since Obama took office. Nobody knows what the new rules and regulations are. After Obamacare was passed and VP Biden whispered, "This is a big #$%$ Deal", only to be captured on videotape, yes, this is true, this is a big "#$%$ deal", since there has been complete mayhem within the business world. If Joe Biden is such a good, self-proclaimed Catholic, why should he use the "F" word? Also, it will be very interesting to see what happens with Hobby Lobby, since Hobby Lobby refuses to recognize the Obamacare contraception mandate, since it violates their religious beliefs. Why should the President refuse to recognize key religious beliefs of American people? That is so sad.</Msg><Username>wannabe_mbfield</Username><Timestamp>1357367735895</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 01:35:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357368592011-3</Id><Topic><Title>Our decadent democracy</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1357312484166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:14:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, fatness is the new norm.

Over the last year or so parking has become a MAJOR problem. Many of us are now having to essentially park at Renton Stadium and walk over a mile to get to our desk. No joke. It's now taking me an average of 18 to 20 minutes to walk from my car to my desk. That's why you see a new parking lot being built directly west of the 10-20 building (northeast corner of 6th and Logan). It's scheduled to open sometime this March and is supposed to have capacity for 570 vehicles. If I'm remembering the number correctly, BCA currently has a total backlog of 4,373 A/P orders, an all time record, and 70% of those orders are for 737s. We literally cannot build the A/Ps fast enough, which as you said is a good problem to have if you're the company or an employee of it. A year ago, we were building 32 737s per month. We're now building 35 737s per month, but in the 1st quarter of this year the production rate is being increased to 38 737s per month. Then in mid 2014, the production rate is being increased again, to 42 737s per month. No decision has been made yet, but there are serious studies being conducted to see if we can go to 60 737s per month. If the suppliers can support that rate (unknown), I personally think 60 737s per month is do-able.</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1357384687585</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 06:18:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357385113343-10</Id><Topic><Title>Karma can bite you in the buns</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1357333466522</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 16:04:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too funny...

The clip (you have to google it since Yahoo does not all links in an increasing Orewellian censored world) shows FSA members and their supporters in the city of Idlib chanting anti-American songs at a rally while waving flags and banners. “They (Twin Towers) have gone with the blink of an eye, oh how sweet is the memory,” the crowd sings in Arabic. “Our leader Osama Bin Laden, America’s worst nightmare,” the song continues as the crowd cheers, “If they call me a terrorist I will consider it an honor, our terror is blessed, a divine call, A llah is our goal we strive to reach him.” The footage is just the latest illustration of how the Obama administration, which has supported S yrian rebels with over $200 million dollars in aid while the CIA has helped other gulf states oversee weapons transfers, is backing terrorists who openly espouse extremist anti-American ideologies. Back in August, Obama signed a “secret order” authorizing U.S. support for the rebels. Last month, 29 different S yrian opposition groups pledged their allegiance to Al Nusra, an Al-Qaeda-affiliated group which, as the New York Times reported, “killed numerous American troops in Iraq.” The White House has supported the FSA militants in their bid to overthrow President Bashar Al-Assad despite the fact that S yrian rebels have been responsible for a plethora of atrocities, from terrorist attacks and massacres, to forcing people to become suicide bombers, to attacks on Christian churches and making children carry out grisly beheadings of unarmed prisoners. A S yrian rebel recently quoted by McClatchy Newspapers was overheard to remark, “When we finish with Assad, we will fight the U.S.!” Other militants have appeared in You Tube videos speaking of their desire to see the Al-Qaeda flag fly over the White House and impose S haria law once the rebels are victorious across the region.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357398835787</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 10:13:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357402257665-13</Id><Topic><Title>Why most people in the Mediocre Class will Always be Just Mediocre</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357321915961</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:51:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My sentiments exactly, TC.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1357402257665</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 11:10:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357402516095-14</Id><Topic><Title>Why most people in the Mediocre Class will Always be Just Mediocre</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357321915961</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:51:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I believe him</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357402516095</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 11:15:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357402885632-15</Id><Topic><Title>The rich should pay more not only because</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357338492668</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 17:28:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a twisted bundle of fable, misinterpretation and misrepresentation, Bulk. Re "sharing among themselves," how do you explain Christ's story of the Good Samaritan? A Samaritan was not "one of us" in Christ's time, was he? The flip side of "If a man will not work, he shall not eat" is that if a man DOES work, then he should be able to eat, and feed his family. Similarly, the reverse of "God loves a cheerful giver" could just as well mean God hates a grumbling giver. See it the way you want to see it, Bulk, but don't try to impose your preaching on me.

We should look at what we are told in the Bible, and we will find that it was initially the religious leaders (is that what you meant?) that sought to kill Jesus: "So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him. Jesus said to them, 'My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.' For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God" (John 5:16-18). "Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor (Pilate)" (John 18:28). " 'You are a king, then!' said Pilate. Jesus answered, 'You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.' 'What is truth?' Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, 'I find no basis for a charge against him. But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release ‘the king of the Jews’?' They shouted back, 'No, not him! Give us Barabbas!' Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion" (John 18:36-40). So, we can conclude that it was the religious leaders that sought the death of Jesus with the approval of the common people and the acquiescence of the rulers (Roman authorities) to then execute the order to crucify Him. In other words, everyone was guilty.

What switched on the the Boeing is the use of electric for many systems rather than bleed air (ECS, anti ice, hydraulic pumps, etc). The only use of bleed air on the 787 is for cowl anti ice. This improves fuel economy as the use of bleed air is less efficient than electric.

There was no fault that they held back any of the money. In fact, the Apostle Peter (I misstated as Paul) said that that would have been OK: "Then Peter said, 'Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? Didn’t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God.' ” (Acts 5:3-4) Under no circumstance would I ever conclude that Islam was peaceful. I have stated previously that Islam, through the writings of the Koran, specifically states Jesus was NOT Diety (but only a lesser prophet), that He was NOT the Son of God, and that He was NOT crucified. Both the Bible and the Koran cannot both be true. The are polar opposites. Further, the Koran states that the non-believer in Islam (specifically Christians and Jews) must be either killed, subjugated, or pay a fine (I love the ultimate in compromise of belief for the love of money).

You are way to venomous. My breath is taken away. The Book of Acts, which is the source of Hooz' Bible quotes, were the account of the early Christians, the church, and the Apostles. Those quoted verses of scripture were precisely about the Christians "voluntarily" (note this word) selling all they had and pooling their resources to help each other. The account of the death of Ananias was about his lying to God about his giving - not about keeping some portion of his own money - which he was entitled. If you recall, the Christians were under persecution, many martyred. Pooling resources made sense. The believers were still told to work if they wanted to eat and not be lazy. That particular statement was made multiple times in the epistles. I am not in disagreement with your counter argument regarding being able to feed one's family. Jesus gave several examples of land owners paying their servants fair wages and even allowing the cattle to eat of the harvest. But, don't miss the point that Jesus gave examples of people "working". I don't recall any "beggar parables", though Jesus did heal disabled folks that were beggars. Regardless of your own personal philosophy, the Bible does not tolerate people that are lazy. Psalm 37:25: "I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread." Proverbs 20:4: "A sluggard does not plow in season; so at harvest time he looks but finds nothing." 2 Thessalonians 3:10: "For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: 'If a man will not work, he shall not eat.' " Now, regarding the "Good Samaritan", if you want to believe that that is the role of government, that is your perogative. There is no Biblical basis for it, however. In reading your Bible, you will find that Jesus never discussed with Pilate or anyone else what the government should do relative to re-distributing wealth. He did, however, discuss the concept of helping the poor - but it was a message to individuals. While, you may want an unBiblical government that re-distributes wealth, that is your choice. It is not mine. I will vote for the person that believes in personal responsibility.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1357413280687</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 14:14:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357413394994-34</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is the first president since Ike to win two terms with over 51 percent of the vote</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1357345143931</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 19:19:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What about Andy Coulter?</Msg><Username>georgewbushisachickenhawk</Username><Timestamp>1357413394994</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 14:16:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357413471441-35</Id><Topic><Title>the new WORD of the day is ......

Not always the case, however. Remember that Nicodemus was a "rule of the Jews" and he had a heartfelt discussion with Jesus about salvation (John 3). While your point is not wrong, it is not complete: we should be careful to acknowledge that all folks (religious leaders, common Jews, and the Romans) agreed to have Jesus crucified. Hence, it was truly man, Jew and Gentile, that made that happen. And, lest we think of Jesus as a victim, He freely gave His life for this purpose (Isaiah 53).

Hood (labeled as) "work-place violence" terrorist and murder attack has been going on for about four years; dissing Israel's Prime Minister several times (except just before re-election), and claiming NOT to be a Muslim; etc., etc. Taqiyya is all about deception and is endorsed in Islamic teachings which purpose is to fool the infidels and conquer them.

Their daughter Rebecca Nash died in an airplane crash on February 11, 1977 with her husband, businessman Marshall Nash. Their elder son, Ronald Roberts, committed suicide by shooting himself in the heart on 10 June 1982, five months after receiving a court order to undergo counseling at a drug treatment center and six months after coming out as gay. The other two Roberts children are son Richard, an evangelist and former president of Oral Roberts University (ORU), and daughter Roberta Potts, an attorney. Roberts' gay grandson, Randy Roberts Potts, talked about his uncle Ronald Roberts, and wrote an article discussing growing up gay in the Oral Roberts family. Oral Roberts died on December 15, 2009 at the age of 91. From the Bible: "Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man sows that shall he also reap." (Galatians 6:7) What takes place in this life is nothing compared to what awaits one for eternity - whether that is reward (or loss thereof) for the believer or that is punishment for the non-believer.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1357422971822</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 16:56:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357423364821-63</Id><Topic><Title>The Rich Should Not Hat to Pay Taxes at All</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1357412477116</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 14:01:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nah, IMO.

How long have we traded "jabs-and-barb-posts" over the years? To what extent do I ever seem subdued in offering my perspective? But, believe it or not, I DO indeed hold back, as that is appropriate - despite some crass invective (not so much on yours or Hooz' part). In this case, I was simply pointing out to you what I thought was an over-stressed reaction. To wit, "Last time we did that, we burned people at the stake." I am a conservative. I think that the primary purpose of government is to facilitate freedom - for the country as a whole and for the individual. The socialist philosophy of wealth re-distribution is something that I cannot support, though a safety-net for dire, not average, circumstances makes sense. How God's Word plays into this, in the civil sense, is that it does not. In my study of the Bible, God's Word is mute in the extreme relative to God regulating how man determines his fate, in governmental matters. I have said this many times - that political philosophy is not proscribed in any form the Bible. Here are the few (and only, I believe) examples of God commenting on civil matters: 1) capital punishment to be imposed by man (Genesis 9:6); that He was displeased with Israel wanting to have a king, though He permitted it (1 Samuel 8); 3) Jesus' words to render to Caesar, etc. (Mark 12:17); and 4) that government leaders are "ministers of God for our good" (Romans 13:4). Are there principles of personal responsibility that can be applied to social and economic policy? Yes, I think so. But, I think that we should be cautious regarding excessive governmental charity as it seems to paralyze initiative. So, we differ in our understanding of the Bible. I offered that perspective.

See this, this, this and this. As just one example, in 2010 the war in Afghanistan became the longest war in U.S. history. But – no matter what you’ve heard – there are no plans to get out any time soon. As Glenn Greenwald notes today: Despite the happy talk from [the Pentagon's top lawyer, the war on terror] is not ending soon. By its very terms, it cannot. And all one has to do is look at the words and actions of the Obama administration to know this. In October, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the administration was instituting a “disposition matrix” to determine how terrorism suspects will be disposed of, all based on this fact: “among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade.” As Miller puts it: “That timeline suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism.” The polices adopted by the Obama administration just over the last couple of years leave no doubt that they are accelerating, not winding down, the war apparatus that has been relentlessly strengthened over the last decade. In the name of the War on Terror, the current president has diluted decades-old Miranda warnings; codified a new scheme of indefinite detention on US soil; plotted to relocate Guantanamo to Illinois; increasedsecrecy, repression and release-restrictions at the camp; minted a new theory of presidential assassination powers even for US citizens; renewed the Bush/Cheney warrantless eavesdropping framework for another five years, as well as the Patriot Act, without a single reform; and just signed into law all new restrictions on the release of indefinitely held detainees. Does that sound to you like a government anticipating the end of the War on Terror any time soon? Or does it sound like one working feverishly to make their terrorism-justified powers of detention, surveillance, killing and secrecy permanent? Why is the war of terror being waged indefinitely? Many have said that “war is the health of the state”, and Thomas Paine wrote in the Rights of Man: In reviewing the history of the English Government, its wars and its taxes, a bystander, not blinded by prejudice, nor warped by interest, would declare, that taxes were not raised to carry on wars, but that wars were raised to carry on taxes. George Washington – in his farewell address of 1796 – said: Overgrown military establishments are under any form of government inauspicious to liberty. James Madison said: In time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate. Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body. A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defence against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people. Madison also noted that never-ending war tends to destroy both liberty and prosperity: Of all the enemies to public liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied: and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of the people. The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war, and in the degeneracy of manners and of morals, engendered by both. No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare. Greenwald noted in October: As the Founders all recognized, nothing vests elites with power – and profit – more than a state of war. That is why there were supposed to be substantial barriers to having them start and continue – the need for a Congressional declaration, the constitutional baron funding the military for more than two years at a time, the prohibition on standing armies, etc. Here is how John Jay put it in Federalist No 4: “It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.” In sum, there are factions in many governments that crave a state of endless war because that is when power is least constrained and profit most abundant. Indeed, top American military officials and national defense experts say that our specific actions in the “war on terror” are creating more terrorists and more war. As Greenwald points out today, the endless nature of the war on terror is a feature, not a bug: There’s a good reason US officials are assuming the “War on Terror” will persist indefinitely: namely, their actions ensure that this occurs. *** There’s no question that this “war” will continue indefinitely. There is no question that US actions are the cause of that, the gasoline that fuels the fire. The only question – and it’s becoming less of a question for me all the time – is whether this endless war is the intended result of US actions or just an unwanted miscalculation. It’s increasingly hard to make the case that it’s the latter. The US has long known, and itsown studies have emphatically concluded, that “terrorism” is motivated not by a “hatred of our freedoms” but by US policy and aggression in the Muslim world. This causal connection is not news to the US government. Despite this – or, more accurately, because of it – they continue with these policies. *** There is zero reason for US officials to want an end to the war on terror, and numerous and significant reasons why they would want it to continue. It’s always been the case that the power of political officials is at its greatest, its most unrestrained, in a state of war. Cicero, two thousand years ago, warned that “In times of war, the law falls silent” (Inter arma enim silent leges). *** If you were a US leader, or an official of the National Security State, or a beneficiary of the private military and surveillance industries, why would you possibly want the war on terror to end? That would be the worst thing that could happen. It’s that war that generates limitless power, impenetrable secrecy, an unquestioning citizenry, and massive profit. Just this week, a federal judge ruled that the Obama administration need not respond to the New York Times and the ACLU’s mere request to disclose the government’s legal rationale for why the President believes he can target US citizens for assassination without due process. Even while recognizing how perverse her own ruling was – “The Alice-in-Wonderland nature of this pronouncement is not lost on me” and it imposes “a veritable Catch-22″ – the federal judge nonetheless explained that federal courts have constructed such a protective shield around the US government in the name of terrorism that it amounts to an unfettered license to violate even the most basic rights: “I can find no way around the thicket of laws and precedents that effectively allow the executive branch of our government to proclaim as perfectly lawful certain actions that seem on their face incompatible with our Constitution and laws while keeping the reasons for their conclusion a secret” (emphasis added). Why would anyone in the US government or its owners have any interest in putting an end to this sham bonanza of power and profit called “the war on terror”? Johnson is right that there must be an end to this war imminently, and Maddow is right that the failure to do so will render all the due-process-free and lawless killing and imprisoning and invading and bombing morally indefensible and historically unforgivable. But the notion that the US government is even entertaining putting an end to any of this is a pipe dream, and the belief that they even want to is fantasy. They’re preparing for more endless war; their actions are fueling that war; and they continue to reap untold benefits from its continuation. Only outside compulsion, from citizens, can make an end to all of this possible. Indeed, the American government has directly been supporting Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups for the last decade. See this, this, this, this and this. (Remember, if there aren’t scary enough enemies in real life, we’ve got to create them. Oops … did I say that out loud?) And the American government lies – and even kills its own – to justify new wars. Top American economists say that endless war has ruined our economy. It benefits a handful of elites, while levying a tax on the vast majority of Americans. Congress members – part of the super-elite which has made money hand over fist during this economic downturn – are heavily invested in the war industry, and routinely trade on inside information … perhaps even including planned military actions.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357444198261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 22:49:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357445766936-99</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Expanding Rapidly</Title><Username>bearnz1</Username><Timestamp>1357334652937</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 16:24:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great information I am happy to see a Boeing insider is as bullish as I am based off what I see when I drive by the 737 plant in Renton and also from the research I have done.
