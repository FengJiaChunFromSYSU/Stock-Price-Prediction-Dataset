During an interview shown on Comedy Central, Obama responded to a question about his administration's confused communication after the assault by saying: 'If four Americans get killed, it’s not optimal.'

York: Entering stretch, Obama campaign running on empty Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has finally cleared what many aides have long seen as his biggest hurdle: A majority of voters now like him. According to multiple polls, Romney's favorability rating has surged since the Republican National Convention and in most he equals or bests President Obama's favorables. And late Thursday, the Pew Research Center, the poll that has been toughest on Romney's favorability, released results showing that Romney is ahead of Obama by a point, 50 percent to 49 percent. That is a stunning turnaround from March, when Obama's favorable rating in Pew was about twice Romney's, 55 percent to 29 percent. Gallup also has Romney beating Obama on the favorability rating, 52 percent to 48 percent. Even the liberal DailyKos/SEIU/PPP poll has Romney beating Obama on the fave rating, 49 percent to 46 percent. Romney campaign officials attribute the change to the stories told about the candidate at the Republican convention in Tampa, and his commanding performance in the first presidential debate.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350680412904</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 17:00:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350680648005-47</Id><Title>Put Virginia in Romney's Column...

ANDERSONSingle PagePrintLarger TextSmaller TextAlerts The $831,000,000,000 economic “stimulus” that President Obama spearheaded and signed into law requires his administration to release quarterly reports on its effects. But “the most transparent administration in the history of our country” is now four reports behind schedule and has so far not released any reports whatsoever in 2012. Its most recent quarterly report is for the quarter than ended on June 30, 2011. One wonders how the administration would treat a private citizen who acted like such a scofflaw in response to one of Obama’s principal legislative initiatives. It certainly appears that this administration, which is so very fond of regulating Americans’ lives — witness the 13,000 pages of Obamacare regulations it has already penned — doesn’t hold itself accountable to the same set of rules that it’s so eager to compel the American people to obey.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350680942266</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 17:09:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350681006931-49</Id><Topic><Title>Put Virginia in Romney's Column...

Boeing for the year is flat as a pancake on stock price up a basic zero from January 1 to today in 10 months it has made a .50 of 1%. compare that to a failed Bank .Like BAC up 70% just go to Yahoo financial page enter BA and then mouse to the 1 year chart and enter , next click on the year to date chart then click the compare and enter BAC and as you can see any investor in Boeing has missed a 70% gain compared to BAC. next compare to the DOW since BA is part of the Dow 30 and the dow is up 9% so Boeing is a dog of the dow. Next SPEEA has a "government protected strike" now going for the reason the dummies at Boeing Mangment filmed their workers at lunch on company property conducting a peacefull rally , that is harassment. . Now it is not a economic strike, if the Boeing management had left the workers alone then the union workers could have been replaced or laid off and fired, now it is a unfair labor practice strike, totally protected, . This is probably good for Boeing , not the shareholders, because all that cheap outsourcing of the 787 Boeing management took a great opportunity to get rid of workers and now they have to negotiate with them and can not fire them. Next earnings report by the foul one on another post, all his figuring tells the pump story, of a constant pumper for the Boeing Company, Here is the truth the earnings prediction is for a 21% loss from last year, that is the expected figure so the foulmister, has make up an untruth and not explained the figure and what it means, and frankly ,most likely the company wants a strike because they do NOT want to pay the workers for a while. The reason, the outsouced engineered 787 is so far behind that the American dreamliner scheduled for 2014 the first improved plane, has already been put on "production"delay ! Boeing shareholders, that means engineering and production of parts is way behind. A stike puts the local engineers on a unpaid leave this is tradition Boeing unethical behavior , Boeing Company does , need time to fix the next version of the 787, due to the failed outsourced engineering problems.. Next the foulone has stated that the "floodgates of deliveries" is comming that is a flawed claim., Thetruth is that most of the planed delivered are costing the shareholders money, the 747 is late and 2 billion over the cost budget so each of the total order this year of only 5 ( 747 planes)will be sold at a loss, the 787 has a minus 22 on order and with a cost to build of 310 to 400 million and a discounted sale price each plane is costing the shareholder 210 to 300 million loss, the 767 and the 777 some profit there , but one airline is now competing with Boeing and wants to sell 5 of their 777's not a good signe for the 777X. The only plane that makes any real money for Boeing is the 737 the old version Union made and union Designed, but look out for Airbus who has 50% of the market and the Chinese 737 buster comming on line in 2015 will the 737MAX be built on time and budget , just look at the 747 and the 787 to get yoru answer. Her is how to debunk short tem stock price too for Boeing , if your a figure man like the foul one this is his type of figures don't lie but figuerers do From October 10 to October 18 Boeing went up 7 straight days that is a 5.6% gain or $3.92 we will not count today. Sounds good until you look at BA for the year nothing but .30 of a 1%. A better short term stock that was mentioned her is JRCC a coal stock inthe same time frome Oct 10 to OCt 18 it gained 53.4% on a price of $3.16 to $4.85 a gain of $ 1.69 and we will not count today but fyi it was up 3% while BA was down today. Also jrcc trades a huge amount of shares and was able to sell 30% of it volume in the first hour , a good trade sign whil Ba was not able to do much. So is Boeing a good stock ot invest in well if your looking for no gain in 10 months an want to pass on 70% gain then yes risk, well if airplane companies need less planes due to the econoimy Ba stock price goes down, if the banks get in trouble the Fed bails them out so trade a stock with no support or a bank which is guaranteed as "too big to fail" or if you have stock trade brains go with JRCC but do not listen to the Boeing pumps look at the BA stock price 65 to 75 and down at best for 15 years</Msg><Username>foulunipumprepudiate</Username><Timestamp>1350681313277</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 17:15:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350681370914-52</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's Disgusting and Insensitive Joke About our Slain Ambassador!

Orlando Sentinel Endorses Romney!</Title><Msg>Romney Receives Endorsement of Orlando Sentinel By JEFF ZELENY ORLANDO, Fla. – Mitt Romney, who often grouses that he is simultaneously running against President Obama and the mainstream media, will be greeted upon his arrival in Florida on Friday by a headline with which he cannot quarrel: The Orlando Sentinel is endorsing him. Four years after The Sentinel, central Florida’s largest newspaper, endorsed Barack Obama’s candidacy for president, the newspaper’s editorial page said Mr. Romney is the better choice this time. “We have little confidence that Obama would be more successful managing the economy and the budget in the next four years,” the editorial in Friday’s edition said. “For that reason, though we endorsed him in 2008, we are recommending Romney in this race.” A little more than two weeks before the election, newspaper endorsements are steadily trickling in across the country. Both campaigns have spent considerable time trying to win endorsements, particularly from newspapers in battleground states, like The Sentinel. The Obama campaign has assigned top advisers to talk with editorial boards, trying to win endorsements from the newspapers that supported his candidacy in 2008. Mr. Romney has also been meeting with some editorial boards during campaign trips. The campaigns are bracing this weekend for several newspaper endorsements to be released in key states. The recommendation of Mr. Romney by The Sentinel, whose readers live in a battleground area within a battleground state, stopped short of being a ringing endorsement. But the editorial page firmly declared that it was time for a change in the White House, arguing that Mr. Romney’s business experience and record of leadership prepared him for the Oval Office. “Romney is not our ideal candidate for president,” the editorial said. “We’ve been turned off by his appeals to social conservatives and immigration extremists. Like most presidential hopefuls, including Obama four years ago, Romney faces a steep learning curve on foreign policy.” He is expected to tout the endorsement on Friday when he arrives for a campaign visit in Daytona Beach. He will stay in Florida until Monday, when he meets Mr. Obama for the third presidential debate in Boca Raton. Florida, with its 29 electoral votes, is the biggest battleground state in the nation. The editorial made clear that its endorsement was for one campaign cycle at a time. “This is Romney’s time to lead, again,” the editorial said. “If he doesn’t produce results — even with a hostile Senate — we’ll be ready in 2016 to get behind someone else who will.”</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350681694562</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 17:21:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350681910502-54</Id><Title>Virgina Sheriff Investigating GOP Tie To Trashed Voter Form</Title><Msg>A Virgina sheriff confirmed to TPM on Thursday that his office is investigating whether a man seen tossing completed voter registration forms into a dumpster is con nected to the state Republican Party.

Hairy is represented PRECISELY in that recent survey comparing folks' knowledge and where they got their "facts," The people who got the most test questions right were the non-Fox viewers. Next group--the people who watched NO news AT ALL. The Fox viewers finished last and actually knew LESS than the people watching NO NEWS. Fits Hairy to a tee. Name a time he actually got one right. I am a little worried, though. Now that the President has regained the momentum and is increasing his lead again, Hairy must be identified as a potential suicide on election night.
