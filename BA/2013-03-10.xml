The problem with the 787 battery was that they made the cells in the battery too large and it caused too much heat in the battery which caused thermal runaway which acts as a short circuit in the battery.

Rationale for the intervention included Mossadegh's socialist rhetoric and his nationalization, without compensation, of the oil industry which was previously operated by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (which later changed its name to The British Petroleum Company) under contracts disputed by the nationalists as unfair. A particular point of contention was the refusal of the Anglo-Iranian Oil company to allow an audit of the accounts to determine whether the Iranian government received the royalties it was due. Intransigence on the part of the Anglo-Iranian Oil company led the nationalist government to escalate its demands, requiring an equal share in the oil revenues. The final crisis was precipitated when the Anglo-Iranian oil company ceased operations rather than accepting the nationalists' demands. The newly state-owned oil companies saw a dramatic drop in productivity and, consequently, exports; this resulted in the Abadan Crisis, a situation that was further aggravated by its export markets being closed. Even so royalties to the Iranian government were significantly higher than before nationalization. Without its own distribution network it was denied access to markets by an international blockade intended to coerce Mossadegh into reprivatization. In addition, the appropriation of the companies resulted in Western allegations that Mossadegh was a Communist and suspicions that Iran was in danger of falling under the influences of the neighboring Soviet Union. But Mossadegh refused to back down under international pressure. For the U.S., an important factor to consider was Iran's border with the Soviet Union.

(March 9, 2013, by FloridaResident) ;What three words come to mind when you think of the Boeing 787... While working furiously to diagnose and correct the smouldering-battery problem that grounded its 787 fleet in mid-January, Boeing also is playing catch-up on its PR problem. An initial step, more than a month into the crisis, was depositing a pile of background documents on its 787 website, including the first detailed graphic of the battery system’s layout. Another element may have been a late February profile of CEO James McNerney in The Wall Street Journal, which painted him as a decisive behind-the-scenes leader pressing Commercial Airplanes executives to “turn up your game.” This past week the company took another step, one evidently intended to assess whether the Dreamliner brand has been tarnished. Boeing emailed a short survey to people enrolled in what the company grandly calls its 787 “World Design Team” — members of the public who signed up as long ago as 2003 to get additional information on the cutting-edge plane and offer their reaction.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1362928922627</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 11:22:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362929882280-26</Id><Topic><Title>Birther Conspiracy Quiz!</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362850520425</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 12:35:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am surprised at birthers before they even get to the question of a birth certificate how do they really know that there is a human being in the White House namely President Barack H.

If the economic crisis happened four months later it would be Obama who would be the scapegoat and not Bush.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1362934025582</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 12:47:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362935712987-34</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes 500 Rich List Acquiring BA Shares!</Title><Username>james.tingle</Username><Timestamp>1362414215788</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:23:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good report</Msg><Username>austinfields87</Username><Timestamp>1362935712987</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 13:15:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362935740659-35</Id><Topic><Title>HIstory Will Be Kind to GW Bush</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1362934025582</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 12:47:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think not!

With this newfangled demand BrahMos aims at creating an export order of $13 billion for the indigenously-built Brah-Mos. Although there are over 60,000 cruise missiles worldwide, most of them are pretty archaic, having been developed in the 1970s. This explains the reason for the spurt in demand for the new BrahMos fleet, say defence officials.The supersonic cruise missile system has also caught the attention of many countries such as Brazil, South Africa and Chile because it has been developed at a low-cost budget of $300 million. Named after India’s Brahmaputra river and Russia’s Moskva river, the Brahmos missile can travel at nearly three times the speed of sound and hit targets up to 300 km away. It can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft or land. “It is the best missile — simple but universal. We are working along with the state-owned Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) labs and PSUs such as DRDL and BEML. Private players such as Larsen &amp; Toubro, Godrej are also collaborating for the project”, Alexander B Maksichev, deputy general director at NPO Mashinostroyenia and managing director at Brah-Mos Aerospace, told ET. “BrahMos is moving in a new direction with airborne missile version,” he added. “The negotiations and ground work to export these missiles to other countries have started. The export of BrahMos will start once the requirements of Indian defence are met”, said a senior defence official speaking on condition of anonymity. On its part, India has already placed $3 billion of missile orders including ground systems and receivers with BrahMos for next 7-8 years.

LYNN LUNSFORD and ELLEN SCHULTZ Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A U.S. District Court Judge in Tulsa, Okla., handed Boeing Co. a surprising defeat Wednesday in a class-action lawsuit filed in 1994 by more than 1,000 older McDonnell Douglas Corp. workers. The workers alleged that the company closed their plant in order to avoid paying pension, health and retiree medical benefits. Judge Sven Erik Holmes issued a 90-page opinion that found among other things, the company "engaged in a course of obstruction, inconsistent representations and outright falsehoods" during the course of the lawsuit to keep the truth from coming out about the 1993 closure of a McDonnell Douglas plant in Tulsa. +++ And the mendacity went on with Sears-Dryun - tanker - etc</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1362937872549</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 13:51:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362938591485-44</Id><Topic><Title>just released report on battery fire, MIT professor said 787 box not good enough to allow 787 back into the sky !</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362760135091</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:28:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've never said anything about Dell, Fred, of Wayne being fired.

The economy grew for 116 consecutive months, the most in history.[79] Creation of more than 22.5 million jobs—the most jobs ever created under a single administration, and more than were created in the previous 12 years. Of the total new jobs, 20.7 million, or 92%, were in the private sector.[80] Economic gains spurred an increase in family incomes for all Americans. Since 1993, real median family income increased by $6,338, from $42,612 in 1993 to $48,950 in 1999 (in 1999 dollars).[81] Overall unemployment dropped to the lowest level in more than 30 years, down from 6.9% in 1993 to just 4.0% in January 2001. The unemployment rate was below 5% for 40 consecutive months. Unemployment for African Americans fell from 14.2% in 1992 to 7.3% in 2000, the lowest rate on record. Unemployment for Hispanics fell from 11.8% in October 1992 to 5.0% in 2000, also the lowest rate on record.[80] Inflation dropped to its lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration, averaging 2.5%, and fell from 4.7% during the previous administration.[82] The homeownership rate reached 67.7% near the end of the Clinton administration, the highest rate on record. In contrast, the homeownership rate fell from 65.6% in the first quarter of 1981 to 63.7% in the first quarter of 1993.[83] The poverty rate also declined from 15.1% in 1993 to 11.8% in 1999, the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. This left 7 million fewer people in poverty than there were in 1993.[84] The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.[83] Clinton worked with the Republican-led Congress to enact welfare reform. As a result, welfare rolls dropped dramatically and were the lowest since 1969. Between January 1993 and September 1999, the number of welfare recipients dropped by 7.5 million (a 53% decline) to 6.6 million. In comparison, between 1981–1992, the number of welfare recipients increased by 2.5 million (a 22% increase) to 13.6 million people.[85]</Msg><Username>instant_karma48</Username><Timestamp>1362949182476</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 16:59:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362949270355-54</Id><Topic><Title>Yes, Glenn Beck Is Still With Us...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362932285693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 12:18:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's a shame.</Msg><Username>instant_karma48</Username><Timestamp>1362949270355</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 17:01:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362951103588-55</Id><Topic><Title>just released report on battery fire, MIT professor said 787 box not good enough to allow 787 back into the sky !</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362760135091</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:28:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>money has nothing to do with Boeing and my user comments, you are the retired MD engineer, who for reasons you keep to yourself fluctuate between semi honest and liar statements toward me and you seem to basically be a Boeing hack, that is my impression of the what the contra costa retired MD engineer behavior seems to be here.
