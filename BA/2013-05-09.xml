Gosnell's clinic hadn't been inspected by health officials for years, was unsanity as he kept the feet of babies in a jar on his desk and was a place where helpless human beings had their spinal cords snipped with scissors. Democrats, of course, objected to his resolution and specific targeting of abortion clinics: Democratic senators offered objections to Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee’s Gosnell resolution Wednesday, responding with their own resolution to condemn illegal activities in all health-care settings. Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee attempted to bring his resolution to express “the sense of the Senate that Congress and the States should investigate and correct abusive, unsanitary, and illegal abortion practices” to the floor Wednesday afternoon for consideration under unanimous consent. Lee’s resolution highlights the alleged crimes of Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell, currently awaiting judgment on more than 250 charges, including first-degree murder in the deaths of four babies born alive in attempted abortions and third-degree murder for the death of a woman from a drug overdose during an abortion. Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal objected to Lee’s resolution, which focuses on abortion crimes, and offered his own resolution with California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer and New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen condemning “all incidents of abusive, unsanitary, or illegal healthcare practices.”</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368104427551</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 09:00:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368107501834-22</Id><Title>Come Boeing break in that new HIGH$$$</Title><Msg>Janpan will be flying June 1st , This Baby will be hitting a new soon$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1368107501834</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 09:51:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368107951700-23</Id><Title>Dems think animal cruelty is more important then baby cruelty.

The participation rate refers to the number of people who are either employed or are actively looking for work. The number of people who are no longer actively searching for work would not be included in the participation rate. During an economic recession, many workers often get discouraged and stop looking for employment, as a result, the participation rate decreases."</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368127931939</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 15:32:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368128289812-97</Id><Topic><Title>Fewer People Working today than When Obama first took Office</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368118824674</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 13:00:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The professor is correct.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported unemployment fell to 7.7% from 7.9%, but the drop was at least partially attributable to a decline in labor force participation, Baker says. The employment-to-population ratio (EPOP) was unchanged at 58.6 percent, exactly the same as the rate in February of 2012 and just 0.4 percentage points above the low hit in the summer of 2011.

Firearm-related homicides dropped from 18,253 homicides in 1993 to 11,101 in 2011, and nonfatal firearm crimes dropped from 1.5 million victimizations in 1993 to 467,300 in 2011. The number of firearm homicides declined from 1993 to 1999, rose through 2006 and then declined through 2011…In 2004 (the most recent year of data available), among state prison inmates who possessed a gun at the time of the offense, fewer than two percent bought their firearm at a flea market or gun show. About 10 percent of state prison inmates said they purchased it from a retail store or pawnshop, 37 percent obtained it from family or friends, and another 40 percent obtained it from an illegal source. The federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, after which point gun crime and murders continued their sharp downward trajectories. Weird, right? Allahpundit underscores that second bolded statistic, which demonstrates that Democrats' obsessions with gun shows is driven more by emotion than empirical data. In any case, gun crime is way, way down over the last 20 years. So say the official government numbers from the Obama Justice Department. But what about Newtown and Virginia Tech? The numbers show that school shootings are down by 33 percent over the same time period. Which brings us to the chaser (via Pew Research): Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence, most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago. According to a new Pew Research Center survey, today 56% of Americans believe gun crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12% think it is lower.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368129787689</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:03:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368130604140-101</Id><Topic><Title>The U-6 number under the BLS</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368129068665</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 15:51:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kinda addicted to that gloom and doom, are ya?</Msg><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1368130604140</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:16:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368130722262-102</Id><Title>Democrat's LeaderShip Caught Lying</Title><Msg>Then punished the whistle blowers for telling the truth.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368130722262</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:18:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368130845702-103</Id><Title>Thursday 787 flights</Title><Msg>Two 787 pre-delivery flights today out of everett.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1368130845702</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:20:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368131233822-104</Id><Title>POLL: 61% of College-Age Students Want Gov't Out of Their Lives...</Title><Msg>Since I graduated from college in 2009, the economy has remained stagnant and the job market has remained weak, with no sign of improvement. Just last week, the Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported that the unemployment rate hit 7.5 percent. While the mainstream media and our leaders in Washington want you to believe that the economy is getting better, thanks to more spending, higher taxes, and more regulation, six million people have dropped out of the work force since the recession began in 2008. Young Americans, especially, have it bad. About 45 percent of 18 to 34-year olds are unemployed according to a recent poll by Demos, a public policy firm. I still know of college classmates who have yet to find meaningful jobs or are severely underemployed almost four years after graduation. However, a recent poll on young people's views of limited government, free markets, and economic liberty suggests some may be waking up to the conclusion that government, over-regulation, and more spending will not turn our futures around. YAF Poll of College-Age Students YAF Poll of College-Age Students In a survey launched by Young America's Foundation and conducted by the polling company, Kellyanne Conway, Inc., more than 60 percent of college-age students feel that government should not take an active role in their day-to-day-lives, and half of respondents believe that the federal government is mostly hurting economic recovery. President Ronald Reagan said, "Entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the United States." And, as the poll suggests, young people share this belief: 66 percent of the students polled had a positive opinion of "entrepreneurship," 44 percent found "free markets" positive, and 42 percent believe the federal government is an opponent rather than a partner in the pursuit of the American Dream. It seems every time we turn on the TV or visit our favorite news site, the media is telling us what issues should matter to us, such as gun control and abortion. However, in YAF's study, neither of those issues ranks in the top five for the respondents, who cited the economy (21 percent), jobs (16 percent), education (16 percent), and the national debt (14 percent). We went to college or received an advanced degree in hopes of bettering our situation and having a productive and fruitful life. Isn't that the goal of every generation? The poll seems to indicate that our leaders in Washington are keeping us from doing that. Six-in-ten young people are displeased with the way that their public officials represent young people. That shouldn't surprise many, judging by the approval rating for Congress. The respondents felt that our leaders have bungled the recovery and are out to score points on each other, rather than solve the problem.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368131233822</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:27:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368131489660-105</Id><Topic><Title>POLL: 61% of College-Age Students Want Gov't Out of Their Lives...</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368131233822</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:27:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Welcome to the real world.</Msg><Username>dirtpoordog</Username><Timestamp>1368131489660</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:31:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368131628130-106</Id><Title>starbucks and Boeing humm</Title><Msg>I will give you Boeing hacks, a give me.

Darrell Issa (R-California), “Hillary Clinton’s suspiciously high poll numbers and what can be done to make them lower.” “With the help of Fox News, we have brutally attacked Hillary Clinton for months, and yet she remains more popular than ever,” Rep. Issa said. “This committee needs to know how that happened, and how we can keep it from happening in the future.” Rep. Issa pointed to recent polls showing the former Secretary of State trouncing every potential G.O.P. Presidential candidate, “even a skinnier version of Chris Christie.” “We demand an answer to one simple question,” he said. “What does Secretary Clinton know that none of us knows?” In his boldest allegation of the day, Rep. Issa accused Secretary Clinton of “cynically using her post as Secretary of State to become wildly popular with the American people.” “I invite her to these hearings to answer those charges,” he said. Wrapping up for the day, Rep. Issa warned the former Secretary of State that he was just getting started: “Once we Republicans decide to investigate someone, we don’t stop. If Secretary Clinton doesn’t believe me, she should ask her husband.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368133970392</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 17:12:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368134012053-111</Id><Topic><Title>Registering Democrats at a record rate...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368049054429</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 17:37:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And another great day of registration...</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368134012053</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 17:13:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368134167088-112</Id><Topic><Title>Democrat's LeaderShip Caught Lying</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368130722262</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:18:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's just they way they roll</Msg><Username>zombiegrunt</Username><Timestamp>1368134167088</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 17:16:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368134323559-113</Id><Title>Why did Obama and Hillary Lie?</Title><Msg>.....then try to cover up the truth about their incompetent leadership.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1368134323559</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 17:18:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368134412887-114</Id><Topic><Title>POLL: 61% of College-Age Students Want Gov't Out of Their Lives...</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368131233822</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:27:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LMAO you assume way too much , I would work you under the table before lunch time !</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368134412887</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 17:20:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368134538823-115</Id><Topic><Title>Sanford's comback gives hope to womanizers, adulterers and all kinds of Republican perverts</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368114400678</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 11:46:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Black and totally Corrupt</Msg><Username>zombiegrunt</Username><Timestamp>1368134538823</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 17:22:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368135359776-116</Id><Topic><Title>Sanford's comback gives hope to womanizers, adulterers and all kinds of Republican perverts</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368114400678</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 11:46:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sodomy ?????

Dionne, Jr. WASHINGTON—“I want to publicly acknowledge God’s role in all of this,” declared a victorious Mark Sanford as he celebrated an unlikely political rebirth Tuesday night with a sermon praising the Supreme Being and the many “angels” who helped the once-disgraced former governor along the way. Perhaps the Almighty did inspire those who drew the boundaries of South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District. They packed it with so many Republicans that Sanford was able to engineer a comeback in the polls by debating a flat piece of cardboard bearing the image of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Voters in the Lowcountry may have been weary of a man who made a national spectacle of himself by covering up an affair when he was chief executive and then hanging around in office. But when called to arms against liberals and spending and big government, they were prepared to forget Sanford’s hike on the Appalachian Trail, the one that never happened but was his attempt at a false alibi for being in Argentina to see his lover-now-fiancee. His Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch, tried everything she could to shove party and philosophy out of the voters’ minds and keep them focused on the man they had once loathed and laughed at. She made herself relatively scarce when it came to campaign appearances and her advertising was out of a Chamber of Commerce promotion. “Elizabeth knows jobs” was the opener on a spot that touted her as a “Charleston businesswoman” and spoke of the importance of math and science—hard to argue with that. She closed by telling voters: “I’m running for Congress to create jobs in South Carolina. That’s what I know.” Advertisement What she and her handlers did not know, or hoped wasn’t true, was how deep our regional and partisan divisions are. You can run from ideology but you can’t hide. Ironically, it is Colbert Busch’s brother Stephen Colbert who became one of the era’s most entertaining and astute political satirists by understanding the power of ideology. You might say that Sanford’s whole campaign was drawn from a Stephen Colbert sketch. And, yes, this was South Carolina. Remember that when Newt Gingrich ran for the Republican presidential nomination last year, he won only two primaries: in his home state of Georgia, and in the state where the Civil War began. It’s funny, by the way, that Sanford’s full-page ad defending his visit to his ex-wife Jenny’s house in violation of a court order referred to the battle of the Alamo but misstated the year it happened as 1863. This would move that fight to the death into the middle of the War of Northern Aggression, as some Southerners still see it. Was this evocative error entirely accidental? Gingrich has also led what we can politely call a colorful personal life. But he knew that South Carolina was one place where he could argue that Mitt Romney was a kind of crypto-liberal and make it stick. It was the perfect setting for a contest against a Pelosi photo. In light of all the money the Democrats spent, it’s still remarkable how loyal Republicans were to the man who once represented them. In the end, Colbert Busch ran only five points ahead of President Obama’s 40 percent in the district in 2012. In two of its more conservative counties, Dorchester and Berkeley, she hardly gained anything on Obama’s share. Democrats insisted as soon as the results were known that Sanford’s triumph will prove to be an embarrassment to congressional Republicans. It will be, at least for a while, especially since the newly minted House member has to show up in court Thursday on his wife’s trespassing charge. Jesse Ferguson, the spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was quick to note that there are 119 Republican incumbents in districts more Democratic than South Carolina’s 1st. Sanford’s win, he insisted, does not tell us much about the 2014 midterm elections. That’s probably right. But it does say a great deal about America in 2013. God may well have moved Sanford to turn his life around and to run a scrappy campaign without any assistance from the big honchos in Washington. But his resurrection was a phenomenon not of the next world but of this one—of a country so torn by party dogma that an imaginary walk along the Appalachian Trail counts for little when compared with the chance to beat the other guys, even when they’re made out of cardboard.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368138436422</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 18:27:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368139975126-120</Id><Topic><Title>POLL: 61% of College-Age Students Want Gov't Out of Their Lives...</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368131233822</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:27:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does the Seattle School of Mixology call themselves a "college" now?

Bush</Title><Msg>By Paul Krugman I've been focused on economic policy lately, so I sort of missed the big push to rehabilitate President George W. Bush's image in the run-up to the opening of his presidential library in Texas recently; also, as an anti-Bushist who pointed out how terrible a president he was back when everyone else was praising him as a Great Leader, I'm kind of worn out on the subject. But it does need to be said: Mr. Bush was a terrible president, arguably the worst ever, and not just for the reasons many others are pointing out. From what I've read, most of the pushback against pro-Bush revisionism focuses on just how bad his policies were, from the disaster in Iraq to the way he destroyed the Federal Emergency Management Agency; from the way he squandered the budget surplus to the way he drove up the costs of Medicare, the health insurance program for older Americans. And all of that is fair. But I think there was something even bigger, in some ways, than his policy failures: Mr. Bush brought an unprecedented level of systematic dishonesty to American political life, and we may never recover. Think about his two main "achievements," if you want to call them that: tax cuts and the Iraq war, both of which continue to cast long shadows over our nation's destiny. The key thing to remember is that both were sold with lies. I suppose one could make an argument for the kind of tax cuts Mr. Bush rammed through — tax cuts that strongly favored the wealthy and significantly increased inequality. But we shouldn't forget that Mr. Bush never admitted that his tax cuts did, in fact, favor the wealthy. Instead, his administration canceled the practice of making assessments of the effects of tax changes, while their pitches to voters promoting the cuts amounted to an expert class in how to lie with statistics. Basically, every time the Bushies came out with a report, you could be sure that it was going to involve some kind of fraud, and the only question was which kind and where. Even more important, Mr. Bush lied us into war. Let's repeat that: He lied us into war. I know, the apologists will say that "everyone" believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but the truth is that even the category "W.M.D." was a con game, lumping together chemical weapons with nukes in an illegitimate way. And any appearance of an intelligence consensus before the invasion was manufactured. Why did the Bush administration want war? There probably was not a single reason, but can we really doubt at this point that it was partly to prepare the ground for the 2004 election? And right there you have something that should block Mr. Bush from redemption of any kind, ever: he misled us into a war that probably killed hundreds of thousands of people, and he did it in part for political reasons. There was a time when Americans expected their leaders to be more or less truthful. Nobody expected them to be saints, but we thought we could trust them not to lie about fundamental matters. That time is now behind us.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368140406303</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 19:00:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368141242044-122</Id><Topic><Title>CEOs Rank 2013 Best and Worst States for Business</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1368137558331</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 18:12:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmmm mm.......top 5 states have GOP governors.......bottom 4 all Dems and one RINO is 5th from the bottom.</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1368141242044</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 19:14:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368141270723-123</Id><Title>Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis warned against creating a “police state”</Title><Msg>Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis warned against creating a “police state” in the aftermath of the marathon bombings during testimony in front of a congressional hearing today. “We do not, and cannot, live in a protective enclosure because of the actions of extremists who seek to disrupt our way of life,” Davis told lawmakers, adding “I do not endorse actions that move Boston and our nation into a police state mentality, with surveillance cameras attached to every light pole in the city.” The hearing is designed to examine circumstances leading up to the bombings and find ways of decreasing the likelihood of similar attacks in future. Despite Davis’ call for the public’s privacy to be protected, he did call for more surveillance cameras as well as more undercover officers to increase security around big events. In the aftermath of the Boston bombings, numerous political figures and talking heads seized upon the attacks to call for big brother measures. Both Republican Congressman Peter King and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg cited the attack to justify increased surveillance. “So, I do think we need more cameras. We have to stay ahead of the terrorists and I do know in New York, the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative, which is based on cameras, the outstanding work that results from that,” said King. “So yes, I do favor more cameras. They’re a great law enforcement method and device. And again, it keeps us ahead of the terrorists, who are constantly trying to kill us.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368141270723</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 19:14:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368141285167-124</Id><Topic><Title>No Redemption for George W.

That's an understate- ment. China's is the world's fastest growing economy. China's five year planned economy works. It's some kind of partnership of Gov't &amp; private industry. It's not communism &amp; it's not really socialism in the traditional sense. The US should look into adopting some of China's Ideas in order to keep America as the world's largest economy in the future.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1368146809711</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 20:46:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368147022216-137</Id><Topic><Title>No Redemption for George W.

Did you see the proceedings? I did - there is no question hiliarious and friends lied- security was denied, and troops were told to stand down ( eg NOT to travelo to benghazi ) plus a bit of retribution re Mr Hicks, and facts that most everyone KNEW via cable within a few hours that a video or protest mantra was not an issue. The best word is lie and coverup and retiribution as in preventing personal conversations with a Congressperson. Of course its difficult to figure out was it coverup based on incompetence or deliberate ignorance.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368153089778</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 22:31:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
