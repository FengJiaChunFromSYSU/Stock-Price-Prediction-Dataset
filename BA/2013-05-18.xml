Air India - ZA241 (LN 72, VT-ANM) - so far had 5 test flights and may have one more before being delivered Hainan - 2 787 from Charleston - ZA431 (LN 76, B-2722) &amp; ZA433 (LN 81, B-2723) pending certification and customer test flights China Southern - ZA380 (LN 34, B-2725) pending certification and customer test flights JAL - ZA184 (LN 89, JA830A) had three test flights thus far, may have one more to do Thomson Airways - ZA317 (LN 92, G-TUIA) - Thomson's first 787 has had 5 test flights thus far. These six together with the two already delivered would allow Boeing to claim 8 deliveries in May which would be a very healthy re-start to deliveries after three and a half months of growing inventory at Everett and Charleston.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1368886792634</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 10:19:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368888292694-18</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Woodward: " Dont let Obama off"</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368831793262</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 19:03:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sparticus, and most all conservatives don't think anyone is GOD.

What happened with Piers Morgan is a good sign...but they HAD to finally admit the Fraud in Chief was going rogue or the media loses all credibility. here is the rest of the story It took the IRS scandal for British anti-Second Amendment advocate Piers Morgan to understand government is the source of tyranny. Morgan has told Penn Jillette that the IRS targeting of Tea Party and constitutionalist political groups and the Department of Justice’s seizure of AP phone records without a warrant are “vaguely tyrannical.” They’re more than vaguely tyrannical. Morgan’s admission, though, reveals that there may be hope for the CNN talk show host after all. His call for the destruction of the cornerstone of the Bill of Rights – the Second Amendment – was so egregious, we demanded he be deported – if only to make a point and draw attention to his subversive activity. “I’ve had some of the pro-gun lobbyists on here, saying to me, ‘Well, the reason we need to be armed is because of tyranny from our own government,’ and I’ve always laughed at them,” Morgan told Jillette. “I said, ‘Don’t be ridiculous! Your government won’t turn itself on you.” “But, actually, this is vaguely tyrannical behavior by the American government.” “I think what the IRS did is bordering on tyrannical behavior. I think what the Department of Justice has done to the AP is bordering on tyrannical behavior,” he said. Unfortunately, it took brazen behavior by the government before Morgan came around. It looks like he still holds out hope that government can be trusted.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368895552949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 12:45:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368895578876-32</Id><Topic><Title>instead of economy economy its scandle scandle and there all Obama's doing</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1368895154427</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 12:39:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing good is going to happen in the USA until this false president is out of office.

Actually, the my point for this post was to show Wayneker how utterly asinine and inane he is to cherry pick stocks and time frames of selcted stocks (after the fact) to bash Boeing and Boeing investor by comparison. Boeing is up around 230% since it's low four years ago and is the third highest performing stock on the DOW ytd being up over 31%. I really don't don't know what his problem is but by any standard or measure that is an excellent return and Boeing is a premier cutting edge company. Go Boeing.

In late July 1974, the White House released the subpoenaed tapes. One of those tapes was the so-called "smoking gun"[16] tape, from June 23, 1972, six days after the Watergate break-in. In that tape, Nixon agrees that administration officials should approach Richard Helms, Director of the CIA, and Vernon A. Walters, Deputy Director, and ask them to request L. Patrick Gray, Acting Director of the FBI, to halt the Bureau's investigation into the Watergate break-in on the grounds that it was a national security matter. In so agreeing, the special prosecutor felt that Nixon had entered into a criminal conspiracy whose goal was the obstruction of justice. Once the "smoking gun" tape was made public on August 5, Nixon's political support evaporated. All the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee who had voted against impeachment in committee announced that they would now vote for impeachment once the matter reached the House floor. He lacked substantial support in the Senate as well. Facing impeachment in the House of Representatives and an almost certain conviction in the Senate, Nixon announced his resignation on the evening of Thursday, August 8, to take effect noon the next day. +++ We should be so lucky !</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368917907589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 18:58:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368918082867-51</Id><Topic><Title>Even Piers Morgan is now saying the Governments actions border on Tyranny</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368878541738</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 08:02:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since you and Genna are the same person and ALWAYS show up together...does that mean you have a multiple personality disorder or jus the most insecure person in the world</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368918082867</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 19:01:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368918574872-52</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Exemplifies Fears of Our Founding Fathers</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368722173628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:36:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look up what he had to say about capitalists (Hamiltonians).

The only blame one can pin the president on is his deliberate escalation of use of drones surveillance and attacks. Obama’s use of drones is only a carryover from the policies of GW Shrub. Its compares better with Clintons NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Balkans conflict. All the other problems in the news, guns, school killings, etc. are screening the real problems of the country from the public’s attention. Are the corporations going to run the country by changing a bunch of laws with the help of Neo-Con leaders in the RepubliCon party, or are the Progressives going to maintain, albeit a lesser amount, of rule for and by the citizenry? The real standoff in this ‘Battle Field America’ is a fight over corporations, taxes against the American people. Will America become the United Corporatocracy of Corporate America? Or Will it become the United States of America with some of the benefits for the citizenry at a substantially reduced level compared prior to the December 8, 1993 signing of the NAFTA (SHAFTA) bill. The annual TRADE DEFICIT in the US went from $165 Billion annually in 1994 to $ 830 Billion annually in 2008.
