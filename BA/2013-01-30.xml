ANA said Wednesday it replaced batteries on its 787 aircraft some 10 times because they failed to charge properly or showed other problems, and informed Boeing about the swaps. Japan Airlines said it had also replaced lithium-ion batteries on its 787 jets but couldn't immediately give details. All 50 of the Boeing 787s in use around the world were grounded after an ANA flight on Jan. 16 made an emergency landing in Japan when its main battery overheated. Earlier in January, a battery in a Japan Airlines 787 caught fire while parked at Boston's Logan International Airport. Lithium-ion batteries are prone to overheating and require additional safeguards to prevent fires. ANA spokeswoman Megumi Tezuka said the airline was not required to report the battery replacements to Japan's Transport Ministry because they did not interfere with flights and did not raise safety concerns. She said that having to replace batteries on aircraft is not uncommon and that it was not considered out of the ordinary. Laura Brown, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman, said in Washington that the agency was checking whether the previous battery incidents had been reported by Boeing.The flying public at risk, the Boeing stockholder at risk, the government possibly kept in the dark tomorrow is earnings you had 20 days to get out since the stock started to be sold out by the large shareholder investment houses.

Boeing had numerous reliability issues with the main batteries on its 787 Dreamliner long before the two battery incidents this month grounded the entire fleet. More than 100 of the lithium-ion batteries have failed and had to be returned to the Japanese manufacturer, according to a person inside the 787 program with direct knowledge. “We have had at least 100, possibly approaching 150, bad batteries so far,” the person said. “It’s common.” The frequency of battery failures reflects issues with the design of the electrical system around the battery, said the person on the 787 program. Most of the batteries were returned because they had run down so far that a low-voltage cutout was activated. At that stage, the batteries, which cost about $16,000 each, are essentially dead and cannot be recharged. The failures likely occurred on planes flown by Boeing and on those delivered to its customers. For airline operators, such failures could be costly in terms of airplane downtime and inconvenience. These problems seem separate from the two more significant incidents, when a battery caught fire on the ground in Boston and another smoldered in midair in Japan, forcing an emergency landing. But the electrical system that monitors and controls the batteries is under scrutiny by the National Transportation Safety Board and other safety investigators as they probe the cause of the recent incidents. It is not just design problem, it is Boeing lacks vision, over self confidence, ignorant to “contract out” their responsibility to a third party in order to cut corner making more profit… in this case, losing their shirt. and still, none of the MD management team behind this debacle will ever be held seriously responsible. What a night mare for Boeing. It appears to be self iinflicted.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359526245325</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 01:10:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359527043743-21</Id><Title>ha ha ha easy short from this level, under $70 this week.....and then under $60s</Title><Msg>lol.......buying back more BA shares so they(top executives) can get big bonuses.... lol</Msg><Username>piyshwi</Username><Timestamp>1359527043743</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 01:24:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359527655663-22</Id><Topic><Title>Should there be a "White Entertainment Television (WET) Network</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1359501281269</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 18:14:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>90% of TV _is_ "White Entertainment Television."

I notice he did not offer to stay on at this critical time! So for Mr. LaHood, Good time to quit and separate himself from the 787 weak safety program standards and all the passed and approved design failures. Since SPEEA was not allowed to engineer the 787 and it was outsourced to contractors and the cost was not cheaper,( 33 billion so far ) who will management find to be a scapegoat, the cheap outsourced contractors? One thing for sure Boeing Management will find a fall guy or another excuse. McNerney is at retirement age so maybe this will be his exit and Boeings next excuse for the failure in outsourcing, Hart-Smith was right! I am sure the CEO cares about being out of job after he received a 18 Million performance bonus last year for finally delivering the plane to the customer, 3.5 years late and 30 billion then overcost. It just tugs my heart strings how much the top level executives have at stake FYI Boeing had to prove to the FAA that these batteries would never ignite as part of the 787 certification and if they did ignite they would not explode.

Just a slight exaggeration. But it is fair to say that the number of problems over the past year should have triggered an aggressive effort on Boeing's part to understand the failure mechanism. I would like to think that that investigation was going in earnest before the grounding. And maybe it was. "With 17 of the jets, ANA was Boeing's launch customer for the technologically advanced airliner." "ANA said it had replaced batteries on its 787 aircraft some 10 times because they failed to charge properly or showed other problems, and informed Boeing about the swaps.... "ANA ... did not inform accident investigators in the United States because the incidents, including five batteries that had unusually low charges, did not compromise the plane's safety, spokesman Ryosei Nomura said on Wednesday." " ... ANA spokeswoman Megumi Tezuka said the airline was not required to report the battery replacements to Japan's Transport Ministry because they did not interfere with flights and did not raise safety concerns. Having to replace batteries on aircraft is not uncommon and was not considered out of the ordinary, she said." Low charge due to failure of individual cells? Failure of the cell balancing electronics (in the battery)? Thermal runaway? The thermal concern is an interesting problem. If you look at the case, it is a non-venting, tightly (but not hermetically) sealed heavy duty case designed to contain spillage of any toxic materials as well as suppress fires and explosions. That works directly against thermal control. Those "rules" (spillage, fires, and explosions), while likely well meaning for safety, were issued by the FAA, but such rules are often counter-intuitive to engineering of a cost-effective and performance effective design. The battery also appears to be designed for quick swap-out by maintenance crews. Without some sort of exotic thermal control, there is no way to provide cooling except whatever convective cooling might occur around the case. Heat-piping is expensive and would make the swap-out process more complex. Also, the balancing electronics are contained within the battery and thus do not appear to be isolated or protected from cell faults (like electrolytic leaks) that could easily degrade the control function (balancing and overcharge), further leading to catastrophic failure. I could see what seems as "frequent" replacing of batteries as not raising a flag if doing so was not out of the ordinary. That is, if previous experience with Ni-Cd and Lead Acid battery types was that those batteries may have been replaced often. However, the Li-ion batteries were supposed to provide longer life - reducing maintenance costs. Even if the customer was not able to see it as unusual, Boeing and its suppliers should have paid attention. Perhaps, without the panic of the customer, the urgency was not there - until it all hit the fan. Or, maybe Boeing was in the middle of aggressively investigating and they simply had not arrived at a timely conclusion.

Then, I considered that, well, God did place the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden. In other words, the massive library of "bad behavior knowledge" was there but God told Adam and Eve to not check out any books from it. They then disobeyed God by "eating of the fruit." Disobedience is basically a sin, so they chose to be sinful without any additional knowledge from the tree. The reason that they were "allowed" to disobey, thus sin, was due to "free will" as has been pointed out. The “free will” was all about serving and loving God in response to His love. So God created man with the inherent ability to become sinful, but it had to be by choice. Once they became sinful, through both disobedience and acquired knowledge of evil, God could not have them in His presence. They would have been destroyed. This is clearly borne out by Isaiah's account of being in the presence of the Lord (Isaiah 6:5) and lamenting of his "doom" due to his sinfulness, which was then "fixed" in verse 6 to allow him to be with God. Moses also was not able to look directly on God and was prevented from doing so by the "burning bush" (Exodus 3:1-5). God did that for Moses' protection. People sometimes think that God is OK with even just a "little bit" of sinfulness, but the fact is He cannot. It is impossible for sin to be in the presence of God. That is what His "Holy" nature is all about. It is the infinite version of oil and water not mixing, with the inclusion of also going "nuclear". Now, as has been pointed out so many times, the sin issue needed a solution if man and God were to be "re-united" (reconciled). That is what Jesus did. No belief in Jesus, no reconciliation (and forgiveness of sin) with God. It is pretty simple.

From the Seattle Times ... The person on the 787 program with knowledge of the problems said that the electrical-system design makes it commonplace for airline mechanics to inadvertently run the lithium-ion batteries down too low. "Because lithium-ion batteries can be dangerously volatile if undercharged, as well as when overcharged, an automatic cutoff is built into the 787 batteries so that if the charge falls below 15 percent of full, the battery locks. “It latches — locked out — and we cannot override that,” the person said. So, while there seems to be a technical issue, there also seems to be a potential O&amp;M ("human fault") issue.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359534580974</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 03:29:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359541624960-34</Id><Topic><Title>At least 100 batteries failed on 787 fleet and earnings tomorrow , timing !</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359526245325</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 01:10:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>but you digress bulky Bob, a well designed system takes human error into consideration and works it, ie 777 the last all Boeing designed plane did not have a human error factor on batteries. pilots have many error sytems like "pull up" commands bulky you need to understand how an airplane is built and that human factors are engineered into a good system before you make an implied statement like you have done !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359541624960</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 05:27:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359545175988-35</Id><Title>Is there a cure for...</Title><Msg>... terminal Republicon stupidity?</Msg><Username>slattary_the_slut</Username><Timestamp>1359545175988</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 06:26:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359545717715-36</Id><Title>Earnings today are meaningless for stock movement until this confounded battery issue is dealt with</Title><Msg>I cannot see the stock going under $70 unless the problems get really out of hand....</Msg><Username>blackmonday1987</Username><Timestamp>1359545717715</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 06:35:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359546427115-37</Id><Topic><Title>Earnings today are meaningless for stock movement until this confounded battery issue is dealt with</Title><Username>blackmonday1987</Username><Timestamp>1359545717715</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 06:35:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I disagree as journalists tend to focus on topics revealing bad decissions or compromising behaviour, as done with Boeing's and ANA's hiding of battery malfunction.</Msg><Username>divesius</Username><Timestamp>1359546427115</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 06:47:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359549103810-38</Id><Title>BA hid battery problem - Lookout for 15% correction</Title><Msg>or more. After earnings's call could BA be down to $65 a share? Yep and maybe more. U.S. regulators said Wednesday they asked Boeing Co. to provide a full operating history of lithium-ion batteries used in its grounded 787 Dreamliners after Japan's All Nippon Airways revealed it had repeatedly replaced the batteries even before overheating problems surfaced. National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Peter Knudson said the agency made the request after recently becoming aware of battery problems at ANA that occurred before a Jan. 7 battery fire in a 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport. Boeing has already collected some of the information, he said. ANA said it had replaced batteries on its 787 aircraft some 10 times because they didn't charge properly or connections with electrical systems failed, and informed Boeing about the swaps. Japan Airlines also said it had replaced 787 batteries. It described the number involved as a few but couldn't immediately give further details.</Msg><Username>truthbtoldhonest</Username><Timestamp>1359549103810</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 07:31:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359549542572-39</Id><Topic><Title>At least 100 batteries failed on 787 fleet and earnings tomorrow , timing !</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359526245325</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 01:10:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The point is of course that this whole thing was preventable.

The U.S. and France are moving to create an intelligence hub in Niger that could include a base, near Mali's border, for American drones that could monitor al Qaeda-linked militants in Mali's vast desert north, U.S. officials said. The moves show the extent to which the U.S. and France are girding for what could be an open-ended campaign against the militants in North and West Africa. U.S. and French officials said they see Niger as a logical hub for intelligence-collection operations nearby in Mali, where France has deployed warplanes and ground troops to drive Islamist militants from cities and towns they have held for months. War planners say small air strips in Niger could be used as launching pads for spy missions and strikes. The signing of the so-called status-of-forces agreement with Niger was a necessary precursor for American military operations there, officials said. U.S. officials said discussions with Niger on a drone base were at an early stage.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359559050877</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:17:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359559217854-78</Id><Topic><Title>Should a White Men Rodeo be allowed?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1359497672178</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:14:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>theres' already one... its called the GOP !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359559217854</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:20:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359559299376-79</Id><Title>I love it when I wake up in the morning and Obama is President !</Title><Msg>its Great !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359559299376</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:21:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359559556079-80</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. to Expand Role in Africa</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359559050877</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:17:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what libs do.

All passengers boarding the plane have to show no signs of "smell". The FAA doesn't want Dreamliner passengers smelling burning electrical cable and battery meltdown. 2. All passengers boarding the plane must sign a waiver, clearly agreeing to not sue BA if the plane they are on should have a major fuel leak, catch fire, have an emergency landing or heaven forbid a crash landing. BA says its only protecting the rights of the company board and senior executives buy forcing passengers to sign off on a personal waiver. After all BA senior executives have lots to stock options and bonus payments that need to be protected should the Dreamliner fall apart. 3. All passengers will be required to bring two Duracell batteries on each flight they fly. Batteries will be used to flight attendants to make sure everyone can see their coffee and peanuts, should the flying Dreamliner lose power. 4. Lastly, should any passenger ask for a full refund due to lack of safety when flying the Dreamliner, that passenger will be referred to the Boeing Public Relations Department, for further delay, stalling and unfortunatly no ticket refund due to BA growing pension program which can now only be paid out if company borrows billions from Uncle Sam.</Msg><Username>justkeepushin</Username><Timestamp>1359562854233</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 11:20:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359563102220-93</Id><Topic><Title>787 will have no signficant impact to 2013 earnings?</Title><Username>madrusky</Username><Timestamp>1359557902644</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:58:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simple, when you don't disclose the purchase price of future deliveries (B737, ect.).

And certainly, if 100+ batteries had been pulled, Boeing was already researching the problem before the fire that led to the grounding. We are not participants in the investigation, so our "speculations" may or may not have any merit. If a significant number of the batteries returned in the lock-out state, and that can be brought about by operational error by the maintenance crew, then that would mask or cloud any design issues. Normally, the engines in flight should keep the batteries fully charged and prevent them from falling below 80% DoD (Depth of Discharge, the standard limit requirement for Li-ion batteries). The 787 battery design set-point for lockout is when DoD falls below 85% (i.e., "15% of full charge"). And that is a safety precaution due to the nature of insipient battery failure when DoD goes "too deep". So what is happening on the ground that the batteries are being "abused"? If that is the case.

Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey thought allegations of sexual intercourse with underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic would be going away now that he's been easily re-elected in the Garden State, but pressure is building as the FBI investigates the issue. Menendez has been dodging Breitbart reporters Matt Boyle and Kerry Picket in order to avoid public questions about the scandal. Senator Bob Menendez (D - NJ) did not want to talk about allegations on Monday regarding an FBI inquiry that apparently show Sen. Menendez was sleeping with underage prostitutes. Sen. Menendez told Breitbart News, "I have no comment and I'm not going to dignify that story." Not surprisingly, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is defending Menendez and distracting from the issue by attacking Boyle. At his weekly press conference, Breitbart News asked Reid if he thinks there should be a full investigation into the allegations surrounding Menendez before the New Jersey Democrat takes over as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman. Menendez is slated to take the Foreign Relations Committee gavel after Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry becomes President Barack Obama’s next Secretary of State. Reid responded to Breitbart News by attacking the “source” for the allegations. A transcript of the questioning: Breitbart News: “Senator, do you think there needs to be–before he takes over as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, do you think there needs to be a full investigation into Senator Menendez’ alleged solicitation of prostitutes in the Dominican Republic and the FBI investigation into that?” Reid: “The answer is: ‘Always consider the source.’ All anyone here has to look at is the source where this comes from. The source has brought up a lot of—“ Breitbart News: “There are FBI emails showing the FBI is—“ Reid: “I told you how I feel about the source of this stuff is. Really very, very typical for the source.” Boyle was the reporter who broke the alleged Menendez prostitute scandal and interviewed alleged Dominican women who claimed Menendez offered them $500 for sex and only paid them $100. Now that's a Democrat for you and you can bet the $100 wasn't his own money.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1359565691696</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 12:08:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359565886426-105</Id><Title>One Sign the GOP are losers !</Title><Msg>President Obama !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359565886426</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 12:11:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359565947053-106</Id><Title>Shares of Boeing just won't go down, no matter what....</Title><Msg>There is an ocean of cash chasing too few stocks...term of the day Share Price Inflation.

Earlier this year, President Barack Obama warned that Social Security checks will be delayed if Congress fails to increase the government's borrowing authority by raising the debt ceiling. However, there's an issue with this warning. According to the 2012 Social Security trustees report, assets in Social Security's trust funds totaled $2.7 trillion, and Social Security expenditures totaled $773 billion. Therefore, regardless of what Congress does about the debt limit, Social Security recipients are guaranteed their checks. Just take the money from the $2.7 trillion assets held in trust. Which is the lie, Social Security checks must be delayed if the debt ceiling is not raised or there's $2.7 trillion in the Social Security trust funds? The fact of the matter is that they are both lies. The Social Security trust funds contain nothing more than IOUs, bonds that have absolutely no market value. In other words, they are worthless bookkeeping entries. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, meaning that the taxes paid by today's workers are immediately sent out as payment to today's retirees. Social Security is just another federal program funded out of general revenues. If the congressional Republicans had one ounce of brains, they could easily thwart the president and his leftist allies' attempt to frighten older Americans about not receiving their Social Security checks and thwart their attempt to frighten other Americans by saying "we are not a deadbeat nation" and suggesting the possibility of default if the debt ceiling is not raised. In 2012, monthly federal tax revenue was about $200 billion. Monthly Social Security expenditures were about $65 billion per month, and the monthly interest payment on our $16 trillion national debt was about $30 billion. The House could simply enact a bill prioritizing how federal tax revenues will be spent. It could mandate that Social Security recipients and interest payments on the national debt be the first priorities and then send the measure to the Senate and the president for concurrence. It might not be a matter of brains as to why the Republican House wouldn't enact such a measure; it likes spending just as the Democrats. I believe our nation is rapidly approaching our last chance to do something about runaway government before we face the type of economic turmoil seen in Greece and other European nations. Tax revenue has remained constant for the past 50 years, averaging about 18 percent of gross domestic product. During that interval, federal spending has risen from less than 20 percent to more than 25 percent of GDP. What accounts for this growth in federal spending? The liberals like to blame national defense, but in 1962, national defense expenditures were 50 percent of the federal budget; today they are 19 percent. What accounts for most federal spending is the set of programs euphemistically called entitlements. In 1962, entitlement spending was 31 percent of the federal budget; today it is 62 percent. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security alone take up 44 percent of the federal budget, and worse than that, it's those expenditures that are the most rapidly growing spending areas. Our federal debt and deficits are unsustainable and are driven by programs under which Congress takes the earnings of one American to give to another, or entitlements. How long can Congress take in $200 billion in revenue per month and spend $360 billion per month? That means roughly 40 cents of every federal dollar spent has to be borrowed. The undeniable fact of business is that a greater number of people are living off government welfare programs than are paying taxes. That's what's driving Europe's economic problems, and it's what's driving ours. The true tragedy is that just to acknowledge that fact is political suicide, as presidential contender Mitt Romney found out. We can't blame politicians. It's the American people who will crucify a politician who even talks about cutting their favorite handout.

Because lithium-ion batteries can be dangerously volatile if undercharged, as well as when overcharged, an automatic cutoff is built into the 787 batteries so that if the charge falls below 15 percent of full, the battery locks. “It latches — locked out — and we cannot override that,” the person said. In that case, it can only be sent back to the manufacturer, GS Yuasa of Japan. The design of the 787’s electrical system includes a battery switch in the cockpit. But even when that main switch is off, the battery comes on when certain ground tasks are performed. Just as a car’s dome light will come on even when the ignition is off, drawing power from the battery, so too on an airplane certain maintenance tasks will bring the battery to life. For example, if an airline mechanic puts jet fuel in the wing gas tank when the airplane is otherwise dark, as soon as the fuel door opens the battery will begin to provide power for the gauges that measure the fuel level. If that door latch is not properly closed or if the mechanic encounters a problem or leaves something else open too long, the 787 battery can drain down below the critical 15 percent level in an hour, the person said. The 787 batteries are unique and the system supplier, Thales of France, insists that the original manufacturer — its subcontractor GS Yuasa — must be the sole supplier. So all the dead 787 batteries have been shipped back to Japan and replacements have had to be sent from there.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1359569882535</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 13:18:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359569944358-124</Id><Topic><Title>Anybody listen to the conference call this morning?</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1359565033679</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 11:57:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Much obliged thanks</Msg><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1359569944358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 13:19:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359570164604-125</Id><Title>Democrats Politicians: Sure the Emperor has Clothes - The Faithful Breath sigh of Relief</Title><Msg>In response to the news today that the economy contracted -.1 percent in the final quarter of last year, Democrats are touting the claim that this is "the best-looking contraction in U.S. GDP you'll ever see."

It is specious to say that the system should be designed to prevent the ground crew from damaging the hardware - electrical and mechanical. They are supposed to know what they are doing. If not, get away from the aircraft! Again, it is pure speculation that the crew is anything other than knowledgeable and competent. But it is a factor that must be investigated. If the Li-ion batteries require "special handling and procedures" over previous technologies, then that is what has to be done - to the extent that it is humanly possible to manage. If you haven't purchased a new car in twenty years, you may be surprised that the maintenance requirements may have changed. And then you just go and do it. Or you pay for the collateral damage for negligence or voiding of the warranty.

It is easy this company passed its phase 3 trials a no brainer. Each night I sell and each morning I buy and get out during the day. I hae made over 60% of that gain in 3 days. While the Boeing Rapid Response team makes nothing all year long . As you know BA is not as good as the Dow average. Last night I noticed it had a .95 gain after market and on a lot of shares so that is to cover the bad news in earnings , but this stock is a dead cat bounce and if you are retired with Boeing stock you should move out and go with better stocks that make more dividends. Until Steve jobs died apple as you know for 15 years was great. But exactly like apple , boeing is also being destroyed by high paid parisites . Steve Jobs took 1 dollar per yar in pay and made all his money on stock price appreciation, if you invest in boeing you know you are getting a stock that the CEO was overpaid before he took the job. It is like paying a professional sport player a guaranteed 10 year contract , thye have no incentive to play. Or like paying a IAM or a SPEEA an entire 30 year career on day one, after that they will not work. For the anti union users there should be a anti parisite CEO group . At least you were able to make a comment tht did not inclue worthless airplane orders, they mean nothing, its profit per plane , on time delivery, cost per delivery and that is why the stock is dead . The Boeing Books have been recalculated to show a on the book profit, when Boeing had to keep up with pensions like bankd they chaged the way the accounting was recorded. Boeing does the books to make it appear better than it is. I did not respond until now because I was making so much money today I did not want to stay away from my gains and was ready to sell on a moments notice. I love to trade and the only thing I did not like about pre deather Steve Jobs was all I had to do for 15 years was leave the money in Apple. With Boeing so far there is no reason to own this stock. It hovera around minus 1% to plus 1% over a year in a dead cat narrow range . The tax on dividends is going up so the increase in BA divident is already neutral.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359572676964</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 14:04:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359573848975-143</Id><Title>Elon musk on battery issue</Title><Msg>He has extensive design experience over yrs and identified problem with ba batteries however they don't appear interested.

Michael Leon, the technician in Tucson, was fired after bringing it to the attention of authorities. "The fire at Securaplane in 2006 was well documented at the time. Boeing said it was the result of a test set up improperly, and it was not a case where a lithium-ion battery simply exploded for no reason. Securaplane said its charging unit has been successfully tested in the Dreamliner. It disputes Leon's allegations." An MIT professor questioned the design of the battery pack used by the 787 as not having adequate cooling, suggesting smaller cell units with ventilation between. Elon Musk of Tesla/ SpaceX offered the same input, as his company uses lithium cobalt as well. According to Musk Boeing seemed to be shrugging off is input. Boeing is a terrific company, I certainly hope they get this fixed soon.

The global health-care industry is booming, which is creating new opportunities for medical travelers to purchase everything from discount dental work to state-of-the-art heart surgery. The international accreditation agency known as Joint Commission International evaluates the quality of hospitals around the world. It has given its stamp of approval to 546 hospitals worldwide and the list is growing faster than ever. Foreign governments and hospitals are staking big dollars on promotion and infrastructure in an effort to burnish their reputations as medical destinations. That enthusiasm was on display last October at a medical tourism industry conference in Miami, which drew participants from 90 countries. Port Charlotte, Florida-based orthopedist Sam Hess is part of a group that's working to open a full-service hospital on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten. Hess says he's grown tired of the legal and bureaucratic headaches of practicing medicine in the U.S. "I still love what I do, but the issues I have to deal with that have nothing to do with patient care take a lot of wind out of my sails," explains Hess. "We have to assign more and more of our staff to address insurance concerns and approvals. We order tests we don't need to cover ourselves legally." Some U.S. patients will follow in the footsteps of the nearly 50,000 Canadians a year who forego their insurance coverage and pay out of pocket for better and immediate treatment abroad. Medical tourism may also flourish within the regulatory confines of Obamacare. Southern Methodist University's Nathan Cortez argues in an soon-to-be published essay that there's nothing in the Affordable Care Act that specifically prohibits insurance companies from encouraging their clients to use foreign providers. It's also possible that insurance plans that utilize medical tourism could be offered on the state-based insurance exchanges, although the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services may choose to interpret the law in ways that makes that difficult. Investor Jerome Mirobe opened a hospital and large Clinic on Grand Cayman Island in March of 2009, primarily to serve Canadians needing care not available under the Canadian Healthcare system. Mr. Mirobe an American from Morgan City, Louisiana and his wife, a general surgeon, have invested heavily to expand their medical facilities on Grand Cayman to prepare for what he calls an inevitable flood of desperate patients from the U.S. who will not be able to obtain quality and timely medical care under Obamacare. Most medical tourists traveling out of the U.S. are seeking procedures that traditional health insurance companies don't cover - such as dental work, plastic surgery, and in vitro fertilization (IVF). But that's likely to change as health care becomes scarcer. Obamacare, which will be fully enacted in 2014, increases the demand for health care without doing much to grow the number of doctors, nurses, and hospital beds necessary to meet that demand. The aging of the baby boom generation (those born between 1946 and 1964) is already putting a strain on resources. By 2025, there will be 64 million Americans over the age of 65. That's almost double the number at the start of the century. Whatever the hurdles, the often-impeccable quality and low prices available abroad will lead more patients to travel for treatment in the coming years. "You're going to see huge competitive forces coming to bear on the U.S. health care system," says Josef Woodman of Patients Beyond Borders. "And god knows, we need it."</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1359580497731</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 16:14:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359581110392-177</Id><Title>I fly any cargo which pays to run batteries burning</Title><Msg>or not I don't pay taxes 'cause I never file bush league (R) pilots, they just can't get the job done People been asking me, "Where'd you learn to fly that way?"

White House press secretary Jay Carney laid the blame for a surprise economic contraction squarely at the feet of congressional Republicans Wednesday, saying economic threats during the "fiscal cliff" negotiations had prevented important defense spending. "Our economy is facing a major headwinds, and that's Republicans in Congress," Carney said. The Commerce Department projected Wednesday that the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012. Carney said that was partially attributable to the threat of sequestration, which would implement across-the-board spending cuts if a long-term deficit deal is not reached. "This is political brinkmanship that results in one primary victim. That's American taxpayers and the American middle class," Carney said, acknowledging the GDP projection was bad news.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1359582317624</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 16:45:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359582517199-184</Id><Topic><Title>What become of the removed batteries</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1359576797430</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:13:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Need some disclosure here Boeing.

If the president wants to, he can circumvent the republicans altogether in order to push his policy. Republicans have to learn, and learn quick, how to play the political games.

The batteries actually catch fire and one suggested plan is to teach flight attendants how to put out fires on flying aircraft. On the call today the CEO says that 2013 plans assume that all this will have zero impact on the company and not one analyst has either the intelligence or the courage (in this cozy corporate/analyst environment) to ask Boeing why this assumption was made. Was it made beacuse Boeing dosen't think there is a problem (oh we can't comment on that) or because they did not know what to factor in. There could be customer and supplier lawsuits and who knows what else and NOT ONE analyst suggests the stock - which could could in the worst case – conceivably lose 60 to 70% of its value - aka BP with the gulf oil spil) be downgraded from a Buy to a HOLD. Am I the only one missing something??? Who in the FAA (despite the also cozy relationship with Boeing) and from the Obama administration is going to have the balls to sign off on releasing this plane without being 100% confident that a plane will not go down in a burst of flames 2, 3 or 6 months later. Will anyone in the FAA take this risk? And what then will be the inpact to Boeing?

In the US medical care overall plus the financial sector is draining 1/4 US GDP. That was not from any markets but was bought in Pay-To-Play Washington. Medical care is 17 1/2 % US GDP, a phenomenal number considering that the US has the lowest life expectancy of any Western developed country (ref - CIA World Factbook online). We pay 2X world prices for drugs and the US infant mortality rate is high for a developed country. France, like many countries, is under financial pressure but is spending 12% GDP on medical care overall. They have a Single Payer system like Medicare for all, not a socialized care system like the VA here or the British National Health. For that they get Universal Care, no necessary employer involvement, more choice (one "network"), and several years linger life expectancy. If the US had the French system we would spend $800 billion a year less overall. A bit less than a quarter of US medical care expense is insurance companies. Sweden and many other developed countries have numbers and systems comparable to France. So of course, US Medicare costs money - everything in US medical care costs money. And it will get worse. We read that diabetes 2 is almost completely preventable, and about 1/3 of cancer and heart attacks. Effectively we have lobbyists in Washington for diabetes 2, cancer, and heart attacks, with yet more lobbyists to treat them all. One day we will find that we have lobbyists for Alzheimer's as well since the US rate is so high. No wonder the Republicans want to pull the plug. It's the only course available to them given their patrons. The Boomer Bulge in demographics has been known for decades and the actuaries do their jobs well. Now we see that indexing for SS has been largely eliminated, though the CPI indexing has been bogus for many years. The dollar is likely to drop as much as 1/2 in the next ten or a dozen years, so SS checks will be dropped by that much. US finances demand that growth plus inflation deal with the debt level. It's better to speak plainly about this. Rep Paul Ryan's Medicare replacement plan would send billions in present Medicare money to his insurance companies in vouchers. For his plan to work US life expectancy has to drop at least 5 years. For him, ideally people would die in net worth order. The Republican program in general is that people not working for whatever reason, including retirement, should be encouraged to die in a few years. Partly because of our medical care system people out of work in their fifties or older find it very difficult to find any work and retraining is futile. So far as Republicans are concerned, they all need the plug pulled ASAP. Will the Republicans mention the billions spent to maintain their core Confederate base area, a social and economic fossil enabled by our money? Only Texas and metro Atlanta make a living - between them the states are on net welfare. Will they mention the billions spent on corporate subsidies and tax breaks, some of who's rationale has been forgotten? Will they mention the 7% or so GDP devoted to the financial sector? Are they still playing Starve The Beast, intending to crush Washington and the USA between military expenses and interest payments? Apparently not - they intend to solve the budget problems by pulling the plug on Granny.</Msg><Username>maguro_01</Username><Timestamp>1359597290844</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 20:54:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359597932491-233</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary Clinton Now Being Compared to Thomas Jefferson...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1359595180403</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 20:19:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ROFLMAO LOL....stop in man ....you're killing me ROFLMAO ...</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359597932491</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 21:05:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359598214785-234</Id><Topic><Title>22 signs that Barack Obama is transforming America into a larger version of North Korea…</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359547792540</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 07:09:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know small business men with under 10 workers paying $10000 a month for health insurance No wonder America is bankrupt.

The care systems are usually mixed like we have here now. If the US spent 12% GDP on medical care overall we would save $800 billion a year and live longer "healthspans".

Between medical care overall and the financial sector the US spends about 1/4 GDP - a heavy unsustainable burden. That phenomenal number was not from any market but bought in Washington through the institutionalized corruption of the Pay-To-Play politics financing system - a Founding Flaw. Rep Paul Ryan's Medicare replacement program sends billions from what is now Medicare funds to his insurance companies through vouchers. The only way his program works financially is to cut US life expectancy by as much #$%$ years, perhaps more. Ideally people would die in net worth order. That's really how they propose the save the USA - to snuff Granny. They would earn themselves a place in the history of atrocity.

So Boeing will not sign a short form, because Boeing can short the customers on a strike, the union will not agree to a short form contract , because they are actually already de facto on one now. So if a strike vote ratified an ok to strike,SPEEA can threaten a strike, and Boeing Chicago likes the strike idea per above no financial loss during a strike for late delivery.. In the man time ,Yes, tens of thousands of workers (present and future), who bear NO responsiblity for the catastrophic decisions that have become the hallmark of the 787, will pay with loss of present and/or future employment. The region, and the nation will pay with ballooning balance of trade deficits (Boeing accounts for about 10% of the foriegn trade revenue of the U.S.) and loss of tax revenues to support our failing federal budgets. The people actually responsible for the hubris, ignorance and greed that have destroyed the 787 program, and that threaten the corporation itself - no. They will retire with six to seven digit Executive Retirement Packages and blame the unions for the demise of the Boeing Co.
