In the NRA's future USA, an NRA-trained militia will patrol our neighborhoods, schools, stadiums, churches and public spaces. We will be armed, we will be secure, and we will live in fear. The NRA's "School Shield" program has been concocted to reframe the debate on the NRA's terms, turning the NRA into a white knight riding in to save the day. I utterly reject and despise this effort. The day NRA-trained civilian security teams police the high school where I teach is the day I quit. The role schools play in this question is not to fight violence with the threat of counter-violence. Our role is to educate youth toward understanding of the roots of violence, and to interest them in real questioning and analysis of issues of history and themes of literature and culture that demonstrate vividly and forcefully the folly of responding to violence with more violence. You cannot educate for a peaceful world from an armed camp; you cannot provide freedom of thought, of inquiry, and expression from behind a barricade erected against society itself. As educators, we must teach children and young adults to make responsible choices, to be good citizens, to read and listen critically and thoughtfully, and to recognize that security and peace can never be achieved at the point of a gun.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1356180674283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 07:51:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356182228375-9</Id><Topic><Title>WHY is President Barry giving Assault Weapons to Al-Qaeda (Confirmed)?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356049251554</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 19:20:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If we have a President giving Aide and comfort to the enemy therby meeting the definition of treason, “Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.” U.S. Constitution, Article 3, Section 3. constitution" ......and ALSO meeting that definition under the Patriot Act, then it begs the question...why are REAL AMERICANS and REAL VETERANS who FOUGHT FOR AMERICA being asked to disarm ?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356182228375</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 08:17:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356184290140-10</Id><Topic><Title>Why the Global Elite need to Disarm us before the inevitable collapse</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1355749618478</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 08:06:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A glimmer of intelligence...now take one more step and ask WHY the Globalist Elite Central Bankers are the root cause ?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356184290140</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 08:51:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356188292506-11</Id><Topic><Title>Why Are Blue Stes Lossing Population?</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1356119297860</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 14:48:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He genius, the word is "there" not "their".

He has confiscated guns and other weapons from kids based on these tips from other kids who feel protected and safe from retaliatiion. Did you ever think about that Chris? So I know from first hand evidence that the program works.

Focusing on parts installed on nearly 700 Airbus jets world-wide in recent months, the safety directives stress that they actually may increase ice buildup on sensors that tell automated flight-control systems about the angle of the wings relative to airflow. If multiple sensors fail at the same time, even temporarily, on-board computers may automatically push the nose of a plane sharply downward without any commands from pilots. The directives issued on both sides of the Atlantic are highly unusual because the manufacturer initially urged airlines to put the parts on as a voluntary safety initiative. Now, Airbus has stopped installing them in the factory and is scrambling to help airlines remove the suspect parts—metal plates that support sensors called angle-of-attack indicators—as quickly as possible. There haven't been any accidents, but the flurry of directives in the past two weeks was sparked by a recent incident in which ice temporarily disabled angle-of-attack indicators on an Airbus A330. With all three sensors out, the autopilot shut off and other automated safety systems pushed the plane's nose down. The pilots reacted appropriately and regained command of the plane. The airline hasn't been identified by regulators. According to the European Aviation Safety Agency, pilots who fail to follow recently mandated recovery techniques "may not be able to counteract" such a dive, even if they put in maximum manual commands to pull up the plane's nose. +++ When adding a safety feature reduces safety !!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1356204472281</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 14:27:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356204689631-34</Id><Topic><Title>Secession is far Preferable to Overthrow of an Abusive Government</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1356107618012</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 11:33:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I don't think that ANYONE would stop the red states from seceding this time."

Read the BIG PRINT in my comment and try again. From the Sheriff's Office of Jefferson County Colorado Deputies on Scene "Community Resource Officer Called to “Back Lot” Jefferson County Sheriff’s Deputy Neil Gardner soon would complete his second year as the uniformed community resource officer assigned to Columbine High School. Gardner, a 15-year veteran of the Sheriff’s Office, normally ate his lunch with the students in the cafeteria during first lunch period. His car would have been parked in his “normal spot” in front of the cafeteria doors - between the junior and senior parking lots. On April 20, however, Deputy Gardner and campus supervisor Andy Marton, an unarmed school security officer employed by the school district, were eating lunch in Gardner’s patrol car. They were monitoring students in the “Smokers’ Pit,” a spot just to the northwest of campus in Clement Park where the students congregated to smoke cigarettes. Gardner had just finished his lunch when he received a call over the school’s radio from a custodian. “Neil,” called the custodian in a panicked voice, “I need you in the back lot!” Gardner pulled out of the parking lot near the school’s tennis courts and drove onto Pierce Street in front of the school. The “back lot” being referred to by the custodian, he assumed, was the south student parking lot by the cafeteria. As soon as he pulled onto Pierce Street, he heard another call being dispatched over the Sheriff’s radio, “Female down in the south lot of Columbine High School.” He activated his lights and siren. It was 11:23. In his own mind, he recalled later, he thought someone probably had been hit by a car."</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1356205274735</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 14:41:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356206374529-36</Id><Topic><Title>Hi.

There is no way having more guns in the school would make anyone safer. Even a 7-year old knows that.

Now tell me that the 2nd amendment guarantees your right to have nuclear weapons, man-carried missiles, bazookas, hand grenades, C-4 etc. etc. etc. I believe you have the right to a weapon to shoot food to eat and to protect yourself from an assailant -- not the Red Chinese Army, an assailant.

It is currently illegal for private citizens to own a fully-automatic weapon without a special license from the ATF. A semi-automatic rifle is one that fires only one bullet for each pull of the trigger. The officer implies that all semi-automatic rifles (even though they may have the menacing, cosmetic appearance of a fully-automatic “assault rifle”) are not “assault rifles” because they cannot function as “fully automatic” weapons. When you stop to think about it, the distinction between “fully automatic” and “semi-automatic” rifle mechanisms must be the essential distinction between “assault rifles” (which are largely illegal for Americans to own) and conventional, semi-automatic rifles (regardless of their cosmetic similarity to assault rifles) which are legal. In the end the difference between functions is critical and essential while the differences or similarities in appearance are trivial or irrelevant. A true assault rifle is defined by its function rather than its appearance. I doubt that anyone can point to a single rifle manufactured in the past 50 years that was sold to to the US military as an “assault rifle” that was not fully-automatic. When you say “assault rifle” you must mean “fully automatic”. Given the simplicity of the full-auto/semi-auto distinction, it might seem strange that so many politicians and governmental officials are inclined to pass or enforce laws that treat semi-automatic rifles (that may look menacing) as if they were fully-automatic assault rifles. The explanation is apparent: government wants to remove all weapons from the hands of the people. The objective of gun control and gun confiscation is hugely advanced whenever government can seize and remove semi-automatic rifles because they merely look like fully automatic assault rifles. Legally, they can’t do that. But so long as confusion remains as to what really is, and what is not, an “assault rifle,” the governmental powers to seize legal weapons are enhanced. Therefore government wants the confusion between what an assault rifle (which they can legally seize) and a legal, semi-automatic rifle that may look like an assault rifle, but is not.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356229913284</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 21:31:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356230933325-89</Id><Topic><Title>Another Thought...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1356210753529</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 16:12:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Orly/sammysh*tdown/Genna/half_a_dozen_other_ID's ..lamely trying to pose as a Quarom... ......

When M1 Abrams tanks are outlawed, only outlaws will have M1 Abrams tanks!</Msg><Username>jumbojetskl</Username><Timestamp>1356234009387</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 22:40:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356236907095-96</Id><Topic><Title>Another Thought...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1356210753529</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 16:12:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Those people don't know the difference, so why do they think they're the experts on the subject?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1356236907095</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 23:28:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356237586654-97</Id><Topic><Title>V-22 dumps crew member</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1356207937882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 15:25:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, wrong by comparison, well there is no comparison. The c-47 had plenty of standup and walk between room. The same with the ch-46. Not so on the V-22, no standup room, troops remain hunched, and no room side to side, no foot room traverse front to rear would mean crawling through a tunnel of laps and heads. How about an hour or two of that then transition to the battlefield or the jump?</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1356237586654</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 23:39:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356237677443-98</Id><Topic><Title>V-22 dumps crew member</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1356207937882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 15:25:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK...I guess you're right...I guess every soldier should have his own state room with a hot tub and a cammode on his way to and from the mission. What were the marines thinking...I mean why didn't they convert a 747 to a hover craft so the soldiers could have some personal space. I mean...soldiers are people too !!</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1356237677443</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 23:41:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
