The path to knowing the Lord and being saved is one of great simplicity. Some religions introduce complication and, in some cases, deception, leading people down the wrong path. In the account of one of the Pharisees, in John chapter 3, Nicodemus, he approached Jesus for just the same purpose as you and many - to know and understand God. He came by night because, well, likely, he did not want to be seen by his colleagues. Nevertheless, when Nicodemus began to tell Jesus that he had heard of the things which He had done and exclaimed that "no one could do such things unless he be with God", Jesus said, "Except a man be 'born again', he shall in no way enter into the kingdom of God." Jesus sometimes spoke in parables and sometimes He was straight to the point. This might be considered an "in between" as He was revealing a "new truth" of being "born again" but the meaning of the concept did not jump out at Nicodemus right away. Obviously, Nicodemus was confused, and went on saying something about being born of one's mother's womb a second time. Jesus said that a person had to be born both of the flesh and the spirit. Further, Jesus explained that a person needs to believe in the Son to have everlasting life - as the alternative, i.e., not believing, results in eternal punishment. Plain and simple. This is amplified in Romans 10:9,10. Jesus put it this way, "He that believes on the Son has everlasting life; but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God." - John 3:18 BB</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1352788415180</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 01:33:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352789162884-3</Id><Topic><Title>My Condolences to Baggers</Title><Username>agent0977</Username><Timestamp>1352559355282</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 09:55:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Compared to Obama, definitely.</Msg><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1352789162884</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 01:46:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352810405650-4</Id><Topic><Title>Why Mitt Romney Lost !!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1352483187601</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 12:46:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reason 10: More than 15% of voters are blacks 99% of them voted for Obama. that's over 2 million enough to put Obama in the White House.

The EU said in a statement that the amount was "based on estimates of the damages suffered by the EU due to unfair and biased competition from the U.S. industry," which received U.S. government subsidies. The action marks the latest salvo in a seven-year dispute between the EU and the U.S. over subsidies to the two plane-makers. Officials from France, where Airbus is based, welcomed the EU's decision. "The aerospace companies need to have a level playing field in international competition," Foreign Trade Minister Nicole Bricq and Transport Minister Frederic Cuvillier said in a statement. "This conflict has gone on too long now. We must put an end to it and restore fair competition. It is important for European companies and jobs. " An Airbus spokeswoman also praised the EU decision. "But this is nothing other than the next step in a trade dispute initiated in 2004 by Boeing. ..." Maggie Bergsma said.

Yes, apple has lost over 20%, since hitting 700 dollars, as you know ron I made a ton of money on apple for the year, so now Ron since I am a trader and not tied to any stock the question for you is -----( Ron have you heard of shorting? eh ) Ron, had you listened to me about JRCC first going long when Romey was running for president up 80% in just 14 days, and then going short inthe next 14 days and that is 160% in justone month, you would have made over 160%% in the last 30 days. . So Ron, the problem with you and the 6 other Boeing shill folks, is you seem to think that by being felons of the rude behavior that you win something. In fact, other than getting the company matching of Boeing stock, like I sued to do and then sell it immediately, you get that makes you 50% on day one, you make nothing over the year. Read my user comments, clearly you could have and should have been firs going long and after the election you should have been shorting jrcc I told you so !. It was easy Romney was a guy who would have allowed coal industry to be expanded, very easy if you can actually use a brain to figure theses things out. When Obama won it was clear that after the run up of 80% the run down would be just as good for me. Clearly the only thing you miss is the obvious, Boeing makes no money on the 747, the 787, and is late and going to pull another " the custmer can wait ont he 777x like Boeing did on the delay of the 737. If you actually could think on your own you would know this. See I did not insult you, I just told you the facts and you still don't get it do you, that is a fact and it is your problem not mine. I retired from Boeing just after my 50th birthday as I make way too much money in the stock market to worry about a small Boeing pay check. I get two pensions too. You go Ron if you think you made a point I am sorry for you</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1352864660611</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 22:44:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352865485479-80</Id><Title>The six contradictions</Title><Msg>From the peoples cube The six contradictions of socialism in the USSR There is no unemployment - yet no one is working.

You didn't say you shorted it near the top and then you jumped to your prowess in trading JRCC. I think everyone on this board likes to hear people brag about their trading skills.
