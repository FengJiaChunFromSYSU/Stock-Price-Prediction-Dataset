I have no doubt approval is coming but since the company has angered the NTSB by trying to take the lead on the issue by issuing statements they are going to make it as painful for Boeing as they can. I doubt the FAA will move before the NTSB report is out as the lack of battery testing was the FAA's mistake in the first place. I think 26 April will be the FAA date and I think there will be a short overwater restriction for a pre-determined number of operational flight hours just to cover the governments butt.

The number of new jobs is less than half what economists had forecast. The unemployment rate fell to 7.6% from 7.7%, largely because 496,000 Americans stopped working or looking for work, the Labor Department said Friday in its monthly employment report. Futures trading on Wall Street in major indexes began sinking as soon as the report was released. And investors fled to the safety of U.S. Treasury bonds, where prices soared and yields plummeted. Former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin describes the totality of the new report as "awful." Few liberal economists can muster the strength to disagree. The civilian workforce participation rate is the real story today, with nearly half-a-million Americans giving up looking for work. Perversely, this allowed the official U-3 unemployment rate to tick down by a notch, but analysts from across the spectrum recognize that result as fool's gold. The participation rate is now a paltry 63.3 percent, the lowest it's been since 1978. This is a very disappointing report, which Obama cheerleaders will try to blame on his sequester cuts -- which, in turn, they'll try to blame on Republicans. But these are pre-sequester numbers. Before the furloughs. Before any possible layoffs. Don't ask me, ask Obama's favorite economist:</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1365175589635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 11:26:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365175710533-34</Id><Title>The Sooner Democrats Admit Obamacare is a Disaster....</Title><Msg>....the sooner the economy can start to improve.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1365175710533</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 11:28:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365175763905-35</Id><Topic><Title>White House Schedule</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363270937569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 10:22:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looks like another day off for our POS n Chief after two day escape to san fran... 9:15 am The President hosts an Easter Prayer Breakfast; the Vice President also delivers remarks The East Room Pooled Press 10:30 am The President and the Vice President receive the Presidential Daily Briefing Oval Office Closed Press 12:45 pm The Vice President delivers remarks at the 2013 Annual Conference of the Export-Import Bank Omni Shoreham Hotel Open Press Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney Got Budget?????????</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1365175763905</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 11:29:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365175897562-36</Id><Title>Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March</Title><Msg>The American economy added 88,000 jobs in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which was a major miss from predictions. Forecasters were expecting between 150,000-200,000 jobs added. The unemployment rate dropped despite the lackluster number added due to a sharp drop in the labor force participation rate - from 7.7 to 7.6%. Nearly half a million people stopped looking for work in March. In short, then, the economy stalled after a surprisingly strong February. Employers weren't hiring much and a lot of people gave up looking for jobs. Even the federal government lost jobs - though that was mostly driven by the U.S. Postal Service laying off workers. The U-6 "broader" measurement of unemployment also fell, to 13.8%. On a mildly positive note, this BLS report also revised both January and February's jobs reports up by 62,000 jobs, though that's far from enough to make up for today's disappointment. March will also be subject to future revisions, and these revisions might possibly be fairly high. There are quite a few explanations for why the economy sputtered in March. The payroll tax hike from January's fiscal cliff deal might have started taking effect. It may be possible that anticipating effects from sequestration would have frozen some employers' payrolls. But what the media likely won't focus on is that Obamacare implementation has weighed heavy on the minds of employers. Paul Howard, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, testified before Congress that: The consulting firm Mercer predicts that "more than a third of the nation‘s employers – 38% - have at least some employees for whom coverage would be considered 'unaffordable' under [PPACA]." The penalty is equal to $3,000 per full-time employee receiving subsidized coverage, or $2,000 per FTE excluding the first 30, whichever is less. (Although Mercer found that more small companies would be affected by the penalty, 31% of employers with 500 or more employees would be at risk, along with 20% of employers with 20,000 or more employees.) The play or pay mandate is apt to have a variety of effects on coverage and employment decisions. For employers with 50 or fewer employees who do not offer coverage, it will be a disincentive to grow beyond the "cap" and incur the penalty – reducing employment. One labor economist notes that the $2,000 penalty will amount to 15% of average wages in the restaurant industry and nearly 10 % of wages in the retail sector – providing an incentive for firms to hire fewer lower-wage workers or become more automated. (In general, firms will also prefer to hire full - time workers as the cost of benefits per - hour of labor is lower.) Bottom line: this was a mediocre jobs report. What seemed like an economy poised to finally rebound in February stalled in March. Federal policy likely played a role in this - be it the tax hikes from January's fiscal cliff deal, the implementation of Obamacare provisions, or the anticipation of sequestration. People have given up looking for work en masse, and there aren't really any signs of a sharp turnaround coming.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1365175897562</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 11:31:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365176068349-37</Id><Title>Obama Caves - Official: Obama proposes cuts to Social Security</Title><Msg>Townhall News Politics &amp; Government Official: Obama proposes cuts to Social Security APNews | 2 hours ago A 10 Official: Obama proposes cuts to Social Security WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama's proposed budget will call for reductions in the growth of Social Security and other benefit programs while still insisting on more taxes from the wealthy in a renewed attempt to strike a broad deficit-cutting deal with Republicans, a senior administration official says. The proposal aims for a compromise on the Fiscal 2014 budget by combining the president's demand for higher taxes with GOP insistence on reductions in entitlement programs. The official, who spoke on a condition of anonymity to describe a budget that has yet to be released, said Obama would reduce the federal government deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years. The president's budget, the first of his second term, incorporates elements from his last offer to House Speaker John Boehner in December. Congressional Republicans rejected that proposal because of its demand for more than a $1 trillion in tax revenue.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1365176068349</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 11:34:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365176415508-38</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Caves - Official: Obama proposes cuts to Social Security</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1365176068349</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 11:34:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama put Social Security on the table months ago.

We know that, if we step back for a moment, that we, both liberals and conservatives, could enumerate many positive things about the current President as well as former Presidents. The Obamas: energetic, modern, and friendly. The Bushes: "down home", reserved, and warm. Even Oprah liked Bush W, so she said. Besides the notion of decency, the First Ladies should be off limits to public scorn as they were not elected. Michelle is doing a decent job of representing her "office" with her campaign to get young people to eat better. Studies have shown that hypertension (high blood pressure, the "silent killer") has had a significant increase in the past two decades, and it is more pronounced in minority young people. Diet and exercise are key. I am glad that she is doing this. I would can Secretary Sebelius and put Michelle in charge of HHS. However, her husband could take a hike as far as I am concerned.

Initial comparisons confirm that chimpanzees are our closest relatives, sharing 99% of our DNA. Gorillas come a close second with 98%, and orangutans third with a 97% share. That reflects the evolutionary history of apes. Genome comparison indicates that the human lineage separated from orangutans 14 million years ago, gorillas 10 million years ago, and chimps 6 million years ago. That order of events is not a surprise, but the dates are earlier than many scientists had thought. __________________________________________ So 100% of those surveted would know that Michelle shares much of the same genome of gorilla's but she is not unique as we all share that trait.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1365186323239</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 14:25:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365186472162-88</Id><Title>BA longs-this article is quite encouraging</Title><Msg>I'm very sorry for you shorts as this is very encouraging. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-good-plan-dreamliner-battery-154042078.html There is more news to come in a week to two hopefully giving the full green light.

And he had at least 6 months warning as well (see article below). Seems to me you are really quite selective in criticizing a President. Could it have anything to do with whether they are a Republican or a Democrat. No, that would be unfair, illogical and mindlessly stupid………. New York Time September 10, 2012 The Deafness Before the StormBy KURT EICHENWALD IT was perhaps the most famous presidential briefing in history. On Aug. 6, 2001, President George W. Bush received a classified review of the threats posed by Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda. That morning’s “presidential daily brief” — the top-secret document prepared by America’s intelligence agencies — featured the now-infamous heading: “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.” A few weeks later, on 9/11, Al Qaeda accomplished that goal. On April 10, 2004, the Bush White House declassified that daily brief — and only that daily brief — in response to pressure from the 9/11 Commission, which was investigating the events leading to the attack. Administration officials dismissed the document’s significance, saying that, despite the jaw-dropping headline, it was only an assessment of Al Qaeda’s history, not a warning of the impending attack. While some critics considered that claim absurd, a close reading of the brief showed that the argument had some validity. That is, unless it was read in conjunction with the daily briefs preceding Aug. 6, the ones the Bush administration would not release. While those documents are still not public, I have read excerpts from many of them, along with other recently declassified records, and come to an inescapable conclusion: the administration’s reaction to what Mr. Bush was told in the weeks before that infamous briefing reflected significantly more negligence than has been disclosed. In other words, the Aug. 6 document, for all of the controversy it provoked, is not nearly as shocking as the briefs that came before it. The direct warnings to Mr. Bush about the possibility of a Qaeda attack began in the spring of 2001. By May 1, the Central Intelligence Agency told the White House of a report that “a group presently in the United States” was planning a terrorist operation. Weeks later, on June 22, the daily brief reported that Qaeda strikes could be “imminent,” although intelligence suggested the time frame was flexible. But some in the administration considered the warning to be just bluster. An intelligence official and a member of the Bush administration both told me in interviews that the neoconservative leaders who had recently assumed power at the Pentagon were warning the White House that the C.I.A. had been fooled; according to this theory, Bin Laden was merely pretending to be planning an attack to distract the administration from Saddam Hussein, whom the neoconservatives saw as a greater threat. Intelligence officials, these sources said, protested that the idea of Bin Laden, an Islamic fundamentalist, conspiring with Mr. Hussein, an Iraqi secularist, was ridiculous, but the neoconservatives’ suspicions were nevertheless carrying the day. In response, the C.I.A. prepared an analysis that all but pleaded with the White House to accept that the danger from Bin Laden was real. “The U.S. is not the target of a disinformation campaign by Usama Bin Laden,” the daily brief of June 29 read, using the government’s transliteration of Bin Laden’s first name. Going on for more than a page, the document recited much of the evidence, including an interview that month with a Middle Eastern journalist in which Bin Laden aides warned of a coming attack, as well as competitive pressures that the terrorist leader was feeling, given the number of Islamists being recruited for the separatist Russian region of Chechnya. And the C.I.A. repeated the warnings in the briefs that followed. Operatives connected to Bin Laden, one reported on June 29, expected the planned near-term attacks to have “dramatic consequences,” including major casualties. On July 1, the brief stated that the operation had been delayed, but “will occur soon.” Some of the briefs again reminded Mr. Bush that the attack timing was flexible, and that, despite any perceived delay, the planned assault was on track. Yet, the White House failed to take significant action. Officials at the Counterterrorism Center of the C.I.A. grew apoplectic. On July 9, at a meeting of the counterterrorism group, one official suggested that the staff put in for a transfer so that somebody else would be responsible when the attack took place, two people who were there told me in interviews. The suggestion was batted down, they said, because there would be no time to train anyone else. That same day in Chechnya, according to intelligence I reviewed, Ibn Al-Khattab, an extremist who was known for his brutality and his links to Al Qaeda, told his followers that there would soon be very big news. Within 48 hours, an intelligence official told me, that information was conveyed to the White House, providing more data supporting the C.I.A.’s warnings. Still, the alarm bells didn’t sound. On July 24, Mr. Bush was notified that the attack was still being readied, but that it had been postponed, perhaps by a few months. But the president did not feel the briefings on potential attacks were sufficient, one intelligence official told me, and instead asked for a broader analysis on Al Qaeda, its aspirations and its history. In response, the C.I.A. set to work on the Aug. 6 brief. In the aftermath of 9/11, Bush officials attempted to deflect criticism that they had ignored C.I.A. warnings by saying they had not been told when and where the attack would occur. That is true, as far as it goes, but it misses the point. Throughout that summer, there were events that might have exposed the plans, had the government been on high alert. Indeed, even as the Aug. 6 brief was being prepared, Mohamed al-Kahtani, a Saudi believed to have been assigned a role in the 9/11 attacks, was stopped at an airport in Orlando, Fla., by a suspicious customs agent and sent back overseas on Aug. 4. Two weeks later, another co-conspirator, Zacarias Moussaoui, was arrested on immigration charges in Minnesota after arousing suspicions at a flight school. But the dots were not connected, and Washington did not react. Could the 9/11 attack have been stopped, had the Bush team reacted with urgency to the warnings contained in all of those daily briefs? We can’t ever know. And that may be the most agonizing reality of all.

The Economist which for years has been very alarmist in its climate coverage, has just posted a new article questioning the veracity of global warming which included an illustration of how IPCC climate models are sitting at the threshold of exceeding two standard deviations of CO2 induced temperature estimates, which if crossed would render the models null and void as a predictive methodology. Just out are thoughts on climate by Princeton's Freeman Dyson who actually worked on climate change in the 1970s in a new article titled 'Climatologists are no Einsteins, says his successor' by Paul Mulshine of The Star Ledger. Dyson rejected climate models as unreliable long long ago and today with those models in trouble he states, "Their (climatologists) computer models are full of fudge factors." TSI peaked and is now falling with Solar physicists warning of an extended period of reduced Solar activity similar to the Dalton Minimum. NASA completely botched the Solar cycle 25 prediction which has only reached half the increased predicted by NASA and this lends more credence to the Dalton Minimum scenario which is predicted to start in 2014. If this minimum occurs and temperatures drop, that will be the proof that I need that CO2 is the main driver of global temperatures. If it doesn't cool down or the temperature increases with decreasing TSI then I take CO2 more seriously.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1365189253195</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 15:14:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365189606492-103</Id><Title>Barry's Budget Leak Shows Medicare and SS Cuts</Title><Msg>Is he tossing seniors overboard or is there some brilliant strategy that I'm missing?</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1365189606492</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 15:20:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365190161753-104</Id><Topic><Title>63 % of Americans Doubt Michele Obama is part Gorilla</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1365178143567</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:09:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post pay4.......

Petroleum geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent, respectively, believing in human involvement. "The petroleum geologist response is not too surprising, but the meteorologists' is very interesting," said Peter Doran associate professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and one of the survey's authors. "Most members of the public think meteorologists know climate, but most of them actually study very short-term phenomenon." However, Doran was not surprised by the near-unanimous agreement by climatologists. "They're the ones who study and publish on climate science. So I guess the take-home message is, the more you know about the field of climate science, the more you're likely to believe in global warming and humankind's contribution to it.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1365204354234</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 19:25:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365204681028-136</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle Obama claims to be a single parent then corrects herself.
