Related Content Belton, 88, succumbed to his injuries Thursday morning at Sacred Heart Medical Center. Witnesses say Belton was in the parking lot of the Eagles Lodge at 6410 N. Lidgerwood, adjacent to the Eagles Ice-A-Rena, around 8 p.m. Wednesday when the two male suspects attacked him as he was about to head inside to play pool. Police responded with K-9s to track the suspects' scent but were not able to locate them. "It does appear random. He was in the parking lot, it appears he was assaulted in the parking lot and there was no indication that he would have known these people prior to the assault," Spokane Police Major Crimes Detective Lieutenant Mark Griffiths said. Belton died from his injuries Thursday morning at Sacred Heart Medical Center. "Shorty," as he was known by his friends at the Eagles Lodge, served in the U.S. Army in the Pacific during WWII and was shot in the leg during the Battle of Okinawa. He went on to work at Kaiser Aluminum at the company's Trentwood plant for more than 30 years.

The on-time milestone brings the program another step closer to delivering the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation aerial refueling tanker. The event comes less than two months after the KC-46 program began to assemble the first of four Engineering, Manufacturing and Development test aircraft. The wing spar, the main structural component of the wing, is 82 feet 5 inches long and provides critical support for flight loads and the weight of the wings. “Completing production of the four test aircraft on schedule is our priority as we prepare to enter the flight test phase of the program,” said Maj. Gen. John Thompson, U.S. Air Force Program Executive Officer for Tankers. “The program continues to meet or exceed all contract milestones.” The first test aircraft is expected to roll out of the factory in January 2014, while the second is scheduled to leave the factory in March. Boeing plans to fly the fully provisioned tanker for the first time in early 2015 and make the first delivery in 2016. The company expects to build and deliver the first 18 KC-46As by 2017 and a total of 179 by 2027 if all options under the contract are exercised.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1377267021812</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 10:10:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377267456056-30</Id><Topic><Title>R.I.P.

However, just a few days prior, a draft report from the world's top climate scientists showed that the actual number would be around three feet, exacting a great toll on coastal cities. On Fox News' America's Newsroom Thursday, anchor Gregg Jarrett suggested that former Vice President Al Gore "tends to exaggerate" the consequences of global warming, alleging that Gore said "the sea level would rise 20 feet" (more on that later). Jarrett continued, "Scientists are laughing at that, saying 'wait a minute, okay, maybe, worst-case scenario, a few inches over a century.'" But if anyone is "laughing," it should probably be at Gregg Jarrett, who has evidently modeled his own disregard for science on that of the North Carolina general assembly. Earlier this week, a leaked draft of a major report from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that sea levels could rise by more than three feet by the year 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise rapidly -- in other words, a "worst-case scenario." Only in a scenario in which "the world's governments would prove far more successful at getting emissions under control than they have been in the recent past" would sea level rise be limited to "as little as 10 inches" in addition to the eight-inch rise we've already experienced, according to The New York Times. Some scientists have said this assessment is "overly conservative," and there are studies suggesting "the possibility of as much as two meters (six feet) sea level rise by 2100." Even if we suddenly and drastically reduced our emissions, greenhouse gases already emitted have left us "locked in" for catastrophic sea level rise for centuries to come.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1377275447334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 12:30:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377275624542-57</Id><Topic><Title>Every Board has an Idiot</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1377275130184</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 12:25:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you think the Koch family is worse than George Soros?

The "leaked" IPCC AR5 first of three draft reports is not the final version and subject to revision so we should really wait for the final version. But since you brought it up what did you do to confirm the accuracy or lack thereof regarding sea level rise? Did you seek info from the scientists involved or read the leaked document? The answer is no you didn't. How do I know that you didn't? Because of this inaccurate sentence in your post. "However, just a few days prior, a draft report from the world's top climate scientists showed that the actual number would be around three feet, exacting a great toll on coastal cities." You must have never read and IPCC assessment report in your life or you would know that the IPCC scientists never give a single number for sea level rise and instead they always give a range that bounded by probability. Now while Fox may be guilty of misleading the public by not stating the exact range from the report, and while I support you in calling out inaccurate reporting, you are also putting out inaccurate information. So in an effort to provide this board with accurate information I will share with you that the range of sea level rise given in the draft report is between10 inches and 3 feet. The way that probability is assigned to this range means that the chance of a 3 foot rise is the same as the chance of a 10 inch rise. For those that took statistics courses you can recall the bell curve and the process of determining levels of significance. As for the part of you post addressing models I suggest that anyone interested in learning about climate or sea level modeling start reading climate scientist and climate modeler Tamsin Edwards at "All Models Are Wrong". You can also read the latest on why models used to price the social cost of CO2 are completely useless in a new paper coming out in September titled 'Climate Change Policy: What Do the Models Tell Us?' by Robert S. Pindyck, a physicist from MIT.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1377277313608</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 13:01:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377277406394-68</Id><Topic><Title>Fox vs Science</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1377275447334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 12:30:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>reptoads think Fox is news</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1377277406394</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 13:03:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377277414140-69</Id><Title>How Oberlin Manufactured the Hate-Crime Hoax of the Year</Title><Msg>Busted. Stone-cold busted. Just as I suspected, "progressive" pranksters at Oberlin College have been definitively unmasked as the perpetrators of phony campus "hate crimes" that scored international headlines in March. The blabbermouth academic administrators who helped fuel the hysteria are now running for cover. The Associated Press, The New York Times, MSNBC, Yahoo News and the Huffington Post were among the media outlets that trumpeted the story of supposed racism, homophobia and anti-Semitism run amok at my alma mater. Throughout the winter, anti-black and anti-gay graffiti, swastikas, and a shadowy figure in a "KKK hood" surfaced on the tiny campus outside Cleveland, Ohio. Black Entertainment Television News decried the hate outbreaks and "KKK sighting." Because of my firsthand knowledge of Oberlin's long history of self-manufactured hate-crime incidents, the fake-hate-crime alarm bells went off immediately for me when I read the reports. Back in the 1990s, race-obsessed nutballs at Oberlin College cooked up a horrid hate-crime hoax. Asian-American students claimed that a phantom racist had spray-painted anti-Asian racial epithets on a campus landmark rock. It turned out that it was a warped Asian-American student who perpetrated the dirty deed. Student newspapers were filled with complaints about imaginary racism. One Asian-American student accused a library worker of racism after the poor staffer asked the grievance-mongering student to lower the blinds where she was studying. A black student accused an ice-cream shop owner of racism after he told the student she was not allowed to sit at an outside table because she hadn't purchased any items from his store. My suspicions about the latest "hate" crime were bolstered by police statements that the "KKK hood"-wearing menace was actually a female student wrapped in a blanket. Hollywood darling and Oberlin alumnus Lena Dunham was undaunted, however, in ginning up emotional calls for Obie solidarity on Twitter, which the AP dutifully reported as "news." My warnings and reports on previous Obie hoaxes, alas, were not deemed AP-newsworthy. The orgy of self-flagellation swelled. Liberal grievance-mongers applauded the administration's decision to shut down classes. Faculty, students and opportunists took to the airwaves and the Internet to bemoan "white privilege," institutional bigotry, lack of diversity, yada, yada, yada. And now, the rest of the story. According to police reports published by Chuck Ross of The Daily Caller News Foundation this week, two students had 'fessed up to most of the incidents (and fellow students suspect they are responsible for all of them). The Oberlin Police Department identified the hoaxers as Dylan Bleier (a student worker bee for President Obama's Organizing for Action and a member of the Oberlin College Democrats) and Matthew Alden. Bleier told police the pair posted inflammatory signs and a #$%$ flag around campus to "joke" and "troll" their peers. Investigators "caught them red-handed" trying to circulate anti-Muslim fliers, and a search of Bleier's email confirmed he had used a fake account to harass a female student. Cops told Oberlin President Marvin Krislov, but he failed to pursue any criminal action. The two students were removed from campus before the bogus "KKK" brouhaha and news-making shutdown. Krislov not only remained silent about the two pranksters, but he also stoked the fires of political correctness and helped fuel the false notion that real bigotry had pervaded the campus. The spring edition of the Oberlin College alumni magazine opened with a self-congratulatory essay from Krislov titled "A Fitting Response." After perversely bragging about the "national and international news" headlines on the "bias incidents (that) disrupted our campus community," Krislov clucked that "similar things have occurred at other colleges." Which, of course, is inadvertently true. As I've reported for 20 years, American college campuses are the most fertile grounds for fake hate. Krislov then praised "students, faculty, staff, alumni and fellow Oberlin residents" who "turned hate into an opportunity to educate." Of course, "hate" had nothing to do with it. And the police reports suggest that Krislov knew it. The rash of "intolerance" that littered the Oberlin campus was a symptom of juvenile delinquency and perverse self-delusion. Instead of examining their guilt in coddling hate-crime hoaxers, Krislov giddily promoted new efforts "strengthening the emphasis on diversity." There are other adults who deserve to be called out. As Cornell law professor and blogger William Jacobson, who has pressed the administration for months about the cover-up, notes: "Oberlin continues the wall of silence which delayed for months disclosure of the hoax. It's time for Oberlin to reveal who knew what, and when, particularly as to the oversight exercised by the Board of Trustees." Sad to say, this is the sorry state of liberal arts colleges in America today: Extreme identity politics, multiculturalism and pedagogical self-indulgence are creating a generation of race trolls enabled by tenured cultural Marxist punks raking in beaucoup bucks. The bursting of the higher-ed bubble can't come fast enough.

The latest climate sensitivity studies (which may not have been used in AR5 draft report) indicate that the atmosphere is not as sensitive to CO2 rise as the figure used in the AR4 report. In fact the scientists are now ruling out any warming over 4 degreesC for a doubling of CO2 and the newer studies have lowered the average warming from 3 degreesC to around 2 degreesC. This equates to the AT1 and B2 projections used in 2007AR4 which would put the midpoint or average for sea level rise by 2100 at roughly .45 meters or slightly under 18 inches. I think Al Gore has exaggerated sea level rise and I recall arguing with those that were making claims of a 20 foot rise in oceans after watching "An Inconvenient Truth". Gore based his 20foot rise on Greenland completely melting which we now know is not possible based on new evidence that as Greenland's ice melts, the land rises thus protecting it from rising oceans combined with new evidence that basal water streams at the bottom of Greenlands glaciers will cause a slow down of glacier movement to the oceans. Gore is suffering the same effect that Paul Ehrlich suffered when he claimed in 1970 that 65 million US citizens would starve to death by 1990. Most other media outlets have exaggerated sea level rise too. If you look at the cover of National Geographic this month they show the Statue of Liberty half way under water.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1377281664170</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 14:14:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377281768171-79</Id><Topic><Title>How Oberlin Manufactured the Hate-Crime Hoax of the Year</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1377277414140</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 13:03:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>re Oberlin President Marvin Krislov,.. what else would you expect from a Alumnus of Yale- attending a few years after Hillary and Friends..

As PBS reports, “At around 3 a.m. (on August 21st) , patients started streaming in from neighborhoods in suburban Damascus like Zamalka and Ain Terma,” following the alleged chemical weapons attack. However, a playlist of videos entitled ‘Alleged Chemical Attack in Eastern Ghouta August 21st 2013‘ contains 159 videos – every one of which was uploaded to YouTube on August 20th. While no one is denying that some kind of attack did indeed take place, the fact that hundreds of videos showing victims of the attack were uploaded to YouTube a day before the incident is supposed to have actually happened remains unexplained. The time stamp attributed to uploaded videos applies to the country in which they were uploaded, meaning that the videos were uploaded in Syria on August 20th, which is seemingly impossible given that the attack took place in the early hours of the 21st. The only way the videos could display as being uploaded on the 20th was if they were uploaded in America, which is on an earlier time zone. According to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich, this represents evidence of a “pre-planned” provocation. Lukashevich labeled the accusations “another anti-Syrian propaganda wave.” “We’re getting more new evidence that this criminal act was of a provocative nature,” he told RT. “In particular, there are reports circulating on the Internet, in particular that the materials of the incident and accusations against government troops had been posted for several hours before the so-called attack. Thus, it was a pre-planned action.” The unanswered question as to how footage showing victims of an attack that occurred on August 21 was uploaded to YouTube on</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377295105160</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 17:58:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377296370066-119</Id><Title>Let's welcome the 3 new bashers to the message board</Title><Msg>sparticuskawkwoski Joined 8/23 gsylvia Joined 8/20 And the most famous Elon Joined 8/21 All of Waynes information on this messagae board must be working for his recruiting efforts.</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1377296370066</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 18:19:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377296545884-120</Id><Topic><Title>R.I.P.

According to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich, this represents evidence of a “pre-planned” provocation. Lukashevich labeled the accusations “another anti-Syrian propaganda wave.” “We’re getting more new evidence that this criminal act was of a provocative nature,” he told RT. “In particular, there are reports circulating on the Internet, in particular that the materials of the incident and accusations against government troops had been posted for several hours before the so-called attack.
