Ed Asner, 83, and Mike Farrell, 74, both expressed extreme disappointment in Obama for advocating military action. Even if Obama presents irrefutable evidence that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used poison gas against civilians, military action is still unwarranted, the two activists say."This administration ought to insist that the international community charge [Assad] with a war crime and prosecute him, and in so doing Obama would be following the law instead of flaunting the law," Farrell said. "It's incredibly improper for the president to call for a strike. I have said it everywhere I can and I suspect a lot of others will do the same, but whether there will be an organized effort, I don't know," Farrell continued. "We're talking about the difference between an invasion in Iraq and a limited action in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria." It will be a done deal before Hollywood is mobilized," Asner said. "This country will either bomb the hell out of Syria or not before Hollywood gets off its #$%$." "We've been so God-d***ed stung in this country by false wars, repeatedly, that, how can you believe in any just war with the history we have had?" Another reason some Hollywood progressives have been reticent to speak out against war in Syria, according to Asner, is fear of being called racist. "A lot of people don't want to feel anti-black by being opposed to Obama," he said. Asner said Hollywood activists should read a Huffington Post blog item by Dennis Kucinich, where the former congressman lists the "Top 10 unproven claims for war against Syria.""Whether it's a Republican or Democrat president, or Republican or Democrat Congress -- and it doesn't make a God-d***ed difference -- it behooves us to get off our #$%$ and ask these questions," Asner said.

"A lot of people have lost hope -- with the betrayals, the NSA spying ... People aren't getting active because 'Who gives a s**t?' is essentially the bottom line." Adds Farrell: "I'm frankly deeply disappointed in the president's foreign policy, war-making, his reliance on military rather then diplomatic responses, his use of drones, continued allowance of the Guantanamo prison. He's a disappointment to me and other people I know."</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1378590175773</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 17:42:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378590296413-31</Id><Topic><Title>Schizophrenia</Title><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1378584601214</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 16:10:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All of the Kent Raven's aliases would either agree or disagree with that statement.................</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1378590296413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 17:44:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378594588168-32</Id><Topic><Title>God I Love President Obama...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1378582236706</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 15:30:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, most gay people do, why should people think you would be any different?</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378594588168</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 18:56:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378595086512-33</Id><Title>People the Wold Over Are Finally Realizing What a Liar Obama is.</Title><Msg>It was obvious he lied about Benghazi and they certainly don't buy his BS on Syria.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378595086512</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 19:04:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378601131439-34</Id><Title>I Really Don't Trust The Obama Regime</Title><Msg>Their have their heart in the right place but, little knowledge of history.

The point of the act was to allow the public to see for themselves if members of Congress and their employees were trading on material, non-public information. "The STOCK Act: Bans Members of Congress from Insider Trading" was the bolded headline at the top of a lengthy and self-congratulatory press release. Last Monday the White House website took the guts out of the STOCK Act in one run-on sentence under the headline "Statement by the Press Secretary on S. 76." Those so inclined are invited to read the memo themselves. The gist is that disclosures will no longer be practically available for all employees but only for the elected officials, which means staffers, lobbyists, employees, aides and anyone who works for or is close to a serving politician can do whatever they want. Corrupt officials could theoretically still dish insider info with little fear of discovery — it's just hard for them to trade off of the information themselves. The idea of transparency is to remove doubt about conflicts of interest and malfeasance, real or imagined. When the rules are quietly changed to such a degree, it defeats the purpose entirely. Hank Smith of Haverford joined Breakout to discuss this backtracking. "We only have ourselves to blame because we're the ones voting these clowns in," notes Smith in the attached video. It's a fair point, but the government doesn't make it easy for the public to see these flip-flops. The STOCK Act passage was on the front page. When it got de-fanged, the announcement was so buried that only the most hardcore of wonks could find the news.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1378604107473</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 21:35:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378606215614-38</Id><Topic><Title>Affordable Care Act Question</Title><Username>obamastamps</Username><Timestamp>1378601828813</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 20:57:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama wants you to be dependent on government freeloader goodies that's why.

A good read is "Throw all the bum Out". A Mississippi in earmarks wants a Freeway in California. Now why would a Mississippi Congressmen want a freeway in California. It took the author years to find out. Pelosi had investment property in the vicinity. Rental and property zoned for a shopping mall out in the middle of no where. Just like Representative Murtha and the $8B airport in Pennsylvania that nobody uses.</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1378607045239</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 22:24:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378607746368-40</Id><Topic><Title>God I Love President Obama...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1378582236706</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 15:30:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>according to the Bible #$%$sexuality is an abomination, but why did Obama run to Billy Graham on same sex marriage? He thought Billy would flip flop, but he did not. Obama brought suite against Larry Sinclair in an attempt to stop Sinclairs book from publication. Obama lost that suite and Larrys book went to press. Obama is a non reciprocating oral sex #$%$sexual. He also is a card carrying member of two #$%$ bath houses in Chicago along with Rahm Emanuel, Chicago's present mayor. There is also evidence that Obama has knowledge of a killing, the killing of a #$%$ at Rev. Wrights church who introduced Obama to #$%$ oral sex partners. Newsweek also went to press with evidence that Obama is the first Homosexual president.</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1378607746368</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 22:35:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378608557772-41</Id><Title>We haven't been in this much danger since the Cuban missle crises....</Title><Msg>The difference is that in 62 we had Jack F Kennedy........NOW we have Jack T Ripper</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378608557772</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 22:49:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378609037029-42</Id><Topic><Title>Affordable Care Act Question</Title><Username>obamastamps</Username><Timestamp>1378601828813</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 20:57:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So it's "affordable" because the federal government will be paying for part of my healthcare bill?</Msg><Username>obamastamps</Username><Timestamp>1378609037029</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-07 22:57:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
