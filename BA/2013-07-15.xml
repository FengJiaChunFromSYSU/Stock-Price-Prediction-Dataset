So on the ground there is a good chance you'll die but while your up in the air flying just can sit back and enjoy the ride. Today's news - Unless the cause of the Heathrow fire is pinpointed quickly, Boeing, the airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration could once again find themselves in a delicate spot in balancing passenger safety with high financial stakes, including millions in lost revenue that would come from any delays or suspensions in service. So does money win out over passenger safety? We find out Monday and remember - it very hard to sue the federal government and win, especially if the FAA looks the other way (again) and says "Hey we didn't build it and we didn't fly it. We just monitor it and if something goes bad we just take the 5th and call our lawyers".</Msg><Username>wise4us</Username><Timestamp>1373860871889</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 00:01:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373861059332-2</Id><Topic><Title>China GDP in line with expectations - DOW FUTURES UP +33</Title><Username>mcivor</Username><Timestamp>1373856308880</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 22:45:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Chinese always play with their number - you fool.

The protesters of all categories are using the term "A child was killed". When is a 17 year old considered a child. To stir up emotions and possibly incite riots so the liberal media and the African American leaders can make money of the tragedy. Remember, Rev Jackson for example has made millions being an advocate for the African Americans. Are they any better off because of that. I seriously doubt. Those African Americans who work hard, save and may be start a business like the other Americans, are successful.

Airbus stock is up 218% while Boeing is up 60% . morisretired , lets look at deliveries , this month Boeing delivered 15 planes and Airbus delivered 48 planes. morisretired lets look at backlog , Boosted by a wave of orders announced and signed at the Paris Air Show, Airbus surpassed the 5,000-aircraft backlog milestone – the first time an aircraft manufacturer has ever attained a backlog of this magnitude. Airbus’ 241 jetliners booked during the month increased its overall backlog to 5,109 aircraft, representing more than seven years of sustained production. This performance also brought total Airbus orders over the 13,000 aircraft mark, of which more than 9,600 are for the single-aisle A320 Family. Highlights of the month included the 65 additional orders for Airbus’ latest product – the A350 XWB – bringing combined total bookings for this next-generation extra widebody jetliner to 678 in the month when the aircraft performed its maiden flight. Acquisitions announced in June were Singapore Airlines’ agreement for 30 A350-900s; the Air France-KLM Group’s booking for 25 A350-900s; and 10 A350-1000s for United Airlines. morisretired there is only one thing we agree upon one of us is the biggest idiot here and its not me. the customers , suppliers and Boeing all need to stand by their investment that is not support than is panic</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373863864218</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 00:51:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373863869761-12</Id><Title>Scottish Yard found the maintenance crew left burning cigarette butt in container set off fire in 787 airplane!</Title><Msg>Not battery related.

The key question for both: can the burned plane be fixed easily and at a reasonable cost? While composites have been used in aerospace for decades, the 787 is the first commercial jetliner built mainly from carbon-plastic materials, whose weight savings, combined with new engines, are supposed to slash fuel costs 20 percent and operating costs by 10 percent compared with traditional aluminum alloy. In designing the Dreamliner, Boeing engineers also added a weight-saving electrical system that was sorely tested when its lithium-ion batteries overheated on two 787s in January. The system also suffered a fire in 2010 during the plane's test phase, and could come under scrutiny again if the Ethiopian Airlines blaze is traced to an electrical fault.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373871260344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 02:54:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373873651380-45</Id><Topic><Title>Black Monday coming for Boeing</Title><Username>truthbtoldhonest</Username><Timestamp>1373722343749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 09:32:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Truthtoldhonest and fox gang are a couple of low level bashers who are a embarrassment to the human race, these two idiots are a couple of unemployed booze hounds who get paid in cheap liquor to post there gibberish on the boards.they are to be mocked at and laughed at like these two turds were in high school,rumor has it the F.T.C is working with yahoo to rid the board of these scum.</Msg><Username>olemuttonchops</Username><Timestamp>1373873651380</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 03:34:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373875770234-46</Id><Title>Main concern were the batteries NOW we know they are just fine!

Its time the FAA does there job (to protect the FLYING PUBLIC) and shuts down the Dreamliner for a complete plane examination and overhaul.

Each day that goes by increases the chances that the investigation team is finding serious problems with the Dreamliner. If the problem or problems were simple they would be announced today, ending all this insane uncertainly on passengers who might have to fly the 787 due to no recourse. People do not like to fly on planes that are being investigated for faulty workmanship or electrical hazards. The longer it takes for a report to go public, the odds increase the Dreamliner has serious problems and could be mothballed for sometime.</Msg><Username>luvclwr</Username><Timestamp>1373894348123</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 09:19:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373894523983-84</Id><Title>$103.95 in Pre-Market :)</Title><Msg>cleared for TAKE-OFF!!!</Msg><Username>ibcnu2nite</Username><Timestamp>1373894523983</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 09:22:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373894937361-85</Id><Title>How Boeing Trades This Week</Title><Msg>Today Close - $99 if no completion on 787 Dreamliner investigation Tuesday Close - $94 if no completion on 787 Dreamliner investigation Wed.

Ten test pilots flew the first A350 — known as MSN1 — for 92 hours, completing initial tests of key systems, including engines, electrics, landing gear and braking, fuel and cabin pressurization, and the autopilot and auto-land functions. The jet's direct competitor, Boeing's Dreamliner, is under scrutiny again, after a fire onboard an empty 787 in London last week The testing is complete and now for all maintenance checks, unlike the BOEING tests on the 787 no emergency or problems were found on the A350, just like I predicted. Airbus watched Boeing, cherry picked the best suppliers and learned off the MD managed BA company failure . BA is now 8 years into a BOEING 787 plane that still does not work right so that 10 year lead is now just a 2 year lead and once the A350 starts delivery, the Airbus stock will jump fast for a airplane making company with another over 100% better stock price gain than Boeing . Now Airbus stock is up 218% in the past 5 years and has bettered Boeing up only 60%</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373901171238</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 11:12:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373901298816-115</Id><Title>Just look at that Volume</Title><Msg>And up 2.55.

Tesla has become the hottest stock of the year and has found a home in the Nasdaq 100. Northland Capital raises price target to $230; rating outperform : July 15 (Reuters) - CNBC's Phil LeBeau, reports on the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing Dreamliner's fire and says that while the cause has yet to be determined, investors worry it might be due to a flaw in the electrical system. Now my opinion, that would mean after 8 years to get it right MD mismanagement still has not fixed the 787 remember . Investors , this is not a real Boeing plane it is a MD mismanaged bankruptcy business model plane covered with a Boeing logo. Read Hart-Smith, his paper covers all new additions to heritage planes too. So like the 747 a heritage Boeing plane , once MD got a hold of it, after the two extra years over plan to update the 747 with a new wing, and the extra 2 billion dollar it cost over plan, the plane is not selling as MD expected and the production has been cut due to lack of demand. Per hart-Smith this will happen on the Boeing MD mismanaged 737MAX and the 777X too. You should sell your Boeing stock and move to TSLA or if you have to have a airplane maker in your portfolio go with Airbus, EAD.PA once the A350 is ready to sell it will destroy the MD 787, so far there are a huge number of orders for the A350.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373901842557</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 11:24:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373902053362-121</Id><Title>Racist Blacks and white Liberals</Title><Msg>Are going crazy......they ignore black men killing black men......it's only a shame if a white man shoots a black thug in self defense.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1373902053362</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 11:27:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373902215391-122</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Whistling Past The Graveyard</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373897748040</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:15:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sux to be you...</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373902215391</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 11:30:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373902244454-123</Id><Title>MY take on the cause...

problem is white rage For all the warnings about supposed black riots, don't forget who exploded throughout the George Zimmerman affair By Edward Wyckoff Williams If there is no justice, there can be no peace. But in the American South it seems white folks suddenly believe that decorum and charm are a proper response to unspeakable acts of violence and unconscionable injustice. The day before a jury delivered an acquittal in the murder trial of George Zimmerman, Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger and Sanford Police Chief Cecil Smith gave a national press conference to appeal for a peaceful reaction to the verdict — regardless of its outcome. Eslinger, who is white, said “We will not tolerate anyone who uses this verdict as an excuse to violate the law.” The veiled threat of an aggressive police response to imaginary civil unrest belies the very logic that led to Trayvon Martin’s death to begin with. For, you see, African-Americans are never protected or served by the law enforcement apparatus — yet they are always subject to its military might. Sanford police coyly “tolerated” the actual killing of an unarmed black child, but yet refuse to “tolerate” any anger expressed for the acquittal of his murderer. This is the new Jim Crow realized. It bears reminding that it was Sanford’s police who first allowed Zimmerman to walk away uncharged — his gun in tote. The story of self-defense seemed logical to them given the brown body laying on the ground. It was their decision not to investigate the case as a crime that led to public outcry, rallies and marches. It is only because of their total failure to do their jobs that the world now knows the name and face of Trayvon Martin. The complete incompetence (or indifference) of Sanford police is why certain evidence which could have more easily convicted Zimmerman was inadmissible at trial — the most glaring example being their failure to perform a toxicology test on Zimmerman the night he shot Martin. Had they done so, it would have revealed whether he was under the influence of either illegal substances, alcohol or the two prescriptions drugs he had admittedly been taking — Temazepan and Adderall — the side-effects of which include hallucinations, insomnia and aggressive behavior. Instead, Sanford police let Zimmerman walk away, quietly into the night, as he did again yesterday. But the same police now threaten a quick and forcible response to any violence perpetrated in reaction to injustice their own department has engendered. This arrogant call to remain calm in the face of such fatal injustice reveals a basic disregard for the humanity of black people. It is this fundamental disconnect — an unwillingness or inability to see African-Americans as fully realized human beings — that allows whites to blindly ignore the need for equal treatment and equal justice. It is this warped mentality that led George Zimmerman to murder an unarmed child, feel no remorse and say it was “God’s plan”. Human beings are allowed to be angry. They are allowed to emote fear, love, joy, relief, pride and pain. Perhaps if the white women on this jury could see a murdered child — as opposed to a “black” child — they would instinctively know that Trayvon was afraid of Zimmerman, confused by this man following him in the dark, and perhaps they could intuit Trayvon screaming for his life. There is, after all, no other way to see the facts of this case — beyond a reasonable doubt or otherwise. But neither justice nor humanity are colorblind in the eyes of American law. The nation’s socio-political consciousness remains plagued by a three-fifths compromise that devalues the lives of black people in general, and black boys and men in particular. And when the criminal justice system — in the hands, as it was, of two white defense attorneys, two white prosecutors and a mostly-white jury presided over by a white judge — choose to disregard the life of an innocent black teenager, it can hardly be a surprising result. Trayvon Martin was profiled not just by Zimmerman on the night he was killed, but by the very people charged with ajudicating justice on behalf of his senseless death. For African-Americans this is not new. The paradox of being implicitly excluded from the guarantee of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness has been reiterated and reinforced by public policy and social malaise for centuries. President Barack Obama is not immune — as he’s become the target of incessant “white rage”: race-baiting attacks, prejudice and bias even prior to his election. The Republican Party and its neo-Confederate Tea Party wing has been committed to invalidating his political and legislative legacy as much as the Zimmerman jury invalidated the civil rights of Trayvon. The disparate precedent set, therefore, becomes all the more insulting when we’re told to simply shut-up and bear it. Melissa Harris-Perry, on her eponymous MSNBC show, explained this weekend that “race riots” is a biased term that dismisses the underlying calls for justice which is often the primary purpose for protests by black and brown people. She highlighted the key fact that in America’s history the worst “race riots” featured violent attacks perpetrated by whites against blacks: The Tulsa race riot of 1921 and the Rosewood, Florida riots of 1923. In Tulsa, a mob of armed white men charged into a black neighborhood, burning homes, killing over 300 victims and leaving an estimated 8,000 people homeless. In Rosewood, a series of lynchings escalated into hundreds of angry white rioters killing an unknown number of black citizens and leaving the entire town in waste. Yet white rage is never articulated by America’s law enforcement as a reason to fear or strategically organize against. White males aren’t stopped by police in disproportionate numbers nor frisked before entering movie theaters and first-grade classrooms. But there are many angry white people out there. The image of a threatening black male prevails in the minds of white prosecutors, juries and average citizens alike — and the Zimmerman verdict will only serve to solidify that concept and embolden like-minded vigilantes to behave recklessly and act with impunity against the lives, bodies and souls of black folks. African-American civil rights leaders, politicians and religious authorities have all echoed the call for calm in the wake of the verdict. But what is most confounding is the fact that a black male who chooses to riot is as likely to be met with violent and deadly force as if he were walking quietly home with Skittles and iced tea in-hand. This is the ultimate tragedy that Zimmerman’s trial has unleashed in the so-called “post-racial” age. Black males, regardless of age, environment, lack of criminal record, activity and intent are treated as suspects, never presumed innocent. Their lives are reduced to a cautionary tale — denied of due process and equal protection. What words written here can suffice to argue on behalf of an innocent dead child, as his murderer walks free — absolved by the system which failed to hold him responsible from the very beginning? The very logic that precipitated Trayvon’s death and rendered jurisprudence to justify his killing reflects the misguided principles at the heart of Zimmerman’s defense: that this black boy had no right to live. How is this possible sixty years after Emmett Till’s fatal demise? What progress can be gleaned from Obama’s ascendence if black children can’t be judged by the content of their character, instead of the color of their skin? Trayvon Martin, and all of us by proxy, has been weighed in the balances and found guilty of his own murder.

So where does that verdict take us? The prosecution tried to argue that Zimmerman was looking for trouble. "Why does this defendant get out of the car if he thinks that Trayvon Martin is a threat to him? It's because he's got a gun, he's got the equalizer." But lots of people carry a gun for that very reason! They want to feel secure in sketchy situations. Ultimately, you carry it in case you get into a fight, and find yourself losing. Which would mean, that if Trayvon Martin had been losing the fight, he could have shot George Zimmerman in self-defense. Of course, being only 17, it wouldn't have been legal for him to have a handgun. But given this verdict, if he truly feared for his life, he would have been justified - in grabbing George Zimmerman's gun. Which brings us full circle because Zimmerman claimed it was Trayvon's attempt to grab the gun that forced him to shoot. So the Florida Rule boils down to this: If you notice someone following you, do not confront him. If you confront him, and make him feel threatened, he is allowed to reach for his gun and shoot you in self-defense. However, it would also appear that if you feel threatened because you think he's reaching for his gun, you might also be justified in reaching for your gun, or, if you don't have one, trying grab his gun so you can shoot him in self-defense. And as long as the two of you are alone and in Florida, whoever survives will leave the courtroom a free man.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373911367736</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:02:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373911500852-226</Id><Topic><Title>The Florida Rule</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373911367736</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:02:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Common future events in Florida - for now, at least.....

The people briefed on the matter, who would speak only under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the inquiry publicly, said investigators were focused on the transmitter and OTHER nearby equipment. Honeywell Aerospace, which supplies the transmitter and the jet’s navigation system, said in a statement Monday that it had sent technical experts to Heathrow to help the investigators. It said, however, that it is still “premature to speculate on the cause of the fire.” Details were not immediately available about how the transmitter might have malfunctioned. The battery in the transmitter is much smaller and less volatile than the lithium-ion batteries that can supply power when the plane is on the ground and provide backup power for the flight systems when it is in the air. Fire or smoke emitted by the lithium-ion batteries in January led to a four-month grounding of the planes around the world. Those batteries have a cobalt chemistry, which is more volatile than manganese.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1373914596246</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:56:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373914743603-253</Id><Topic><Title>The Florida Rule</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373911367736</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:02:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There was not enuf evidence to charge Zimmerman in the 1st place.

This by the way could turn into a way bigger issue than just BA and their 787, this could impact a lot of planes as Honeywell is a big suppler in the air craft industry of electronic parts. One good thing is they could pull them out and still fly the planes until a fix is in place.

The African-American community is up in arms over a jury of six women finding George Zimmerman not guilty of the second degree murder of Trayvon Martin. That same community is SILENT on the routine killing of young black babies by GMOs, vaccines and even the cancer-causing chemicals found in processed meat. Where is the march against cancer-causing sodium nitrite in hot dogs and beef jerky? There’s no telling how many young black men, boys and children are given brain cancer each year by the processed meat industry. How many young black kids are made autistic by the methyl mercury that’s still admittedly used in vaccines? How many young black girls are put into comas or paralyzed by HPV vaccines? Why is Jesse Jackson utterly silent on the mass killing of black people by toxic chemicals in foods and prescription drugs? Why does Beyonce remain completely silent when her own brothers and sisters — and their children — are routinely poisoned and killed by vaccines? See, in this regard the black community is just like the white community: there is no universal call for justice; there’s only selective justice in rare, isolated cases while ignoring the mass killings that takes place every day through GMOs, vaccines, fluoride, chemical food additives, pesticides and more. They will probably even serve up cancer-causing hot dogs at upcoming “Justice 4 Trayvon” rallies, thereby killing yet more of their black brothers and sisters at the same time they are calling for justice over Trayvon’s killing. “Trayvon Benjamin Martin is dead because he and other black boys and men like him are not seen as a person, but a problem,” said Rev. Dr. Raphael Warnock, pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. He said nothing about how GMOs, pesticides, vaccines, cancer centers and psychiatric drugs are part of the “problem.” All those problems, it seems, are</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373916856302</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:34:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373916886948-265</Id><Title>Guantanamo Detainees Genital Searches</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON -- A federal judge has ordered the government to stop genital searches of Guantanamo Bay detainees who want to meet with their lawyers.

The detainees had complained that guards had recently begun touching and holding detainees' genital and anal areas during searches. Detainee lawyers say the searches began after prisoners were told they would have to travel offsite to meet with their lawyers at another location at the U.S. Navy base in Cuba, rather than at the prison there.

The cancer industry preys upon black America Over 100,000 Americans are killed each year by prescription drugs. Hundreds of thousands more are killed by the cancer industry and its toxic treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Black people are far more likely to die from cancer treatments than white people due to chronic vitamin D deficiencies. There is no call for justice for the African-America victims of the cancer industry. None whatsoever. Why aren’t black Americans rioting outside the front doors of the American Cancer Society which continues to cover up the truth about why black people get more cancer than white people? Apparently black leadership is far too busy distracting people into the Trayvon Martin fiasco to focus on what’s really killing everyone. This is further proof that black leadership doesn’t really care about white people killing black people – they will happily let them continue to die by the millions as long as it’s white-run corporations doing the killing. Sure, Aunt Kayla has breast cancer, and uncle Tyler is dying of prostate cancer — and the entire African American community is being decimated by the cancer industry, vaccines and abortions — but apparently none of those lives count as much as Trayvon Martin’s. If killing an unarmed black 17-year-old is wrong, then why isn’t it wrong for America’s “industries of poison” to kill millions of unarmed black children, teens and senior citizens? And the same criticism goes for the so-called leaders of other races and religions. Why aren’t white preachers calling for their followers to hold prayer vigils outside the headquarters of Monsanto?

Here is what I know so far. They called in Honeywell to look at the planes ELT as a possible cause of the fire. The ELT (Emergency Location Transmitter) is a battery operated radio. Other than a remote panel (located in the cockpit) for monitoring and the ability to reset it if it is accidentally triggered, it is NOT wired into the planes electronics bus or powered by the plane itself. It is designed to operate independently of the aircraft in the event of an accident and help search and rescue quickly locate the aircraft. The 787 uses Honeywell's RESCU 406® AFN model. It's same model that is used in the Airbus A380 and A340 among others and is used many other commercial transport aircraft including other Boeing models. It also is not a new design, so it has been in use without problems for a number of years now in planes operated all over the world. Also, it is held in place by a single strap and has one small wiring harness. In other words a mechanic can remove and replace it in a matter of seconds. It's easier to replace than your average car battery. If it proves to be the cause, then it's an easy and low cost fix to replace it.</Msg><Username>logictheorist</Username><Timestamp>1373921613373</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 16:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373921677625-286</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing cuts Dreamliner production in half.....ZACKS</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1373919350586</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 16:15:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your a short--read all your posts.

And because it happened in America, the people who benefit politically from the same invidious forces that led both to Trayvon Martin’s killing, and the acquittal of his killer, will deny that race had anything to do with either the killing or the verdict. Suppose Trayvon Martin had been a 230-pound 30-year-old black man, with a loaded gun in his jacket. Suppose Zimmerman had been a 150-pound 17-year-old white kid, who was doing nothing more threatening than walking back from a convenience store to his father’s condo. Suppose Martin had stalked Zimmerman in his car, until Zimmerman became afraid and tried to elude him. Suppose Martin had gotten out of his car and pursued Zimmerman. Suppose this led to some sort of altercation in which the big scary black man ended up with a bloody nose and some scratches on the back of his head, and the scared skinny (and unarmed) white kid had ended up with a bullet in his heart. How do you suppose the big scary black man’s claim of “self-defense” would have gone over with a jury made up almost entirely of white women? But of course this is America, which means that the scary figure in this story is the skinny unarmed teenager, because in America pretty much any black male over the age of 12 in this sort of situation is going to be presumed to be the ”aggressor,” the “thug” – in short,” the real criminal,” until he’s proved innocent, which he won’t be, even if he’s now a dead, still unarmed teenager. And his killer is a grown man who provokes a fight with an otherwise harmless kid, starts losing it, and then shoots the kid dead. Because this is America, pointing out that a black boy can be shot with impunity by a more or less white man because many white Americans are terrified by black boys and men is called “playing the race card.” The race card is what the people who benefit politically from the fact that many white Americans are terrified by black boys and men call any reference to the fact that race continues to play an overwhelmingly important, and overwhelmingly invidious, role in American culture in general. And in the criminal justice system in particular. Trayvon Martin was stalked by George Zimmerman because he was black. Trayvon Martin is dead because he was black. George Zimmerman was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin because the boy Zimmerman killed was black. If you deny these things, you are either a liar or an idiot, or possibly both. Nothing above requires the conclusion that the jury’s verdict was wrong as a matter of law. Florida’s laws, in their majestic equality, extend to people of all races the right to engage in vigilante killing that eliminates the sole witness to that killing. To point this out is neither a defense of those laws, nor a claim that they will in fact be applied equally. In other words, to blame this jury in this situation is to miss the point.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373926076254</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:07:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373926125642-304</Id><Topic><Title>Emergancy location transmiter fits with claim plane powered off.</Title><Username>send_this_pig_to_hell</Username><Timestamp>1373915726637</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:15:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a very good post</Msg><Username>duffymagoo</Username><Timestamp>1373926125642</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:08:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373926134732-305</Id><Topic><Title>New issues regarding the 787</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1373912910642</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:28:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its composite like the B-2 and some of the more recent fighter jets.

Boeing losers attention, the reason I posted that TSLA would join the nasdaq 100 on July 15, just as soon as it became public knowledge only a few weeks ago, was to see if any of you popeyes could understand what that means. Nope, not a one of you. I loaded up Friday, if you read my posts, and I know you all do, I am day trading tesla since it made me 100% in MAY in just 15 trade days. THIS MORNING AT THE OPEN I sold my FRIDAY LOAD UP a open making over 3.8% . Since tesla joined the NASDAQ today, over time, funds and institutions that mirror the nasdaq 100 will have to buy into tesla. I also noted that a analyst set his target now for tesla is 230 dollars so that is part of his reason for the huge upgrade. As the biggest fool of all knows, spartacus99991 attempted to tell me when apple was hot and the stock price was going down many years ago.. So I told her that she was wrong and the only reason apple was going down was the stock was becoming too much of a percentage of the overall average it made up. Well then as now you fools missed another opportunity to make a great day trade. Now just like apple then tesla is moving up into a better average trader market . I also made a great day trade on SCTY today doing the same thing I loaded up Friday and sold off both . So how is that hopey changy thing working for you popeyes now eh! Sorry you missed me today no doubt I had to buy a large mobile home for the tax write off as part of my tax basis reduction. so I had to sell off this morning anyway , but I know what I am doing . Keep up that hopey changy thing for Boeing and we will visit the next fire and I will listen to you spin it as a good thing it was not the battery wow hopey change Airbus up 218$ in 5 years BA up 63% in 5 years your so smart not !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373929573444</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 19:06:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373929633084-320</Id><Topic><Title>Let's Get Real, Zimmerman saga was all about race</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373926076254</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:07:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"If you deny these things, you are either a liar or an idiot, or possibly both."

The press's portrayal of Zimmerman was a fabrication to paint him as a villain but Reuters said, "After Zimmerman was finally arrested on a charge of second-degree murder more than six weeks after the shooting, prosecutors portrayed him as a violent and angry man who disregarded authority by pursuing the 17-year-old. But a more nuanced portrait of Zimmerman has emerged from a Reuters investigation into Zimmerman's past and a series of incidents in the community in the months preceding the Martin shooting." It turns out he is a good man who started a business with an African American partner, and tried to help protect neighbors from being victims.

By bus it’s an excruciating nine hours. Although a flight takes one hour and 15 minutes, when the drive to the airport and tarmac time are factored in, it’s a four-hour trip. Bloomberg Businessweek quoted Mr. Musk in September as saying that the Hyperloop would be able to take people to San Francisco from Los Angeles in 30 minutes. That’s a speed of almost 800 miles an hour. Mr. Musk has described the Hyperloop as the “fifth mode of transportation” and says it is a hybrid between a train and a plane. The proposed cost of the Hyperloop between Los Angeles and San Francisco is $6 billion. California is now working on plans to build a far slower train system between the two cities that is expected to cost $60 billion.

What a damn joke! The Justice Department has been caught over and over again running drugs and guns to Mexican Drug cartels. Then those same guns they put in their hands was used to kill police officers from America. Nobody goes to jail….. I know Obama is not saying anything about violating civil liberties when he has signed the NDAA that allows the military to arrest citizens with no warrants. In most cases you will never see a judge and only an act of congress could release you from that camp. That’s actually in the bill my friends. Obama bypassed congress and bombed Libya and told our congress that the military is now under United Nation control. Then he marches the General into congress and he says the same thing and everybody just sits quietly. It’s time for us to wake up as a nation and understand that our government has been hijacked by foreign banks that have an agenda to drive this country into the ground.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373936538572</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 21:02:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373937016987-343</Id><Topic><Title>Let's Get Real, Zimmerman saga was all about race</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373926076254</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:07:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was about a guy who projected himself into a situation where his firearm was likely to come into play.

But he presented nothing, so its innocent because of no proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Trying to convict by grandstanding and hollering just don't cut it. And we can all be thankful for that. That prosecutor must have been angling for a job with the BO admin, the way he was operating. Then there is Holder acting like he will have the final say?

Also, it would be much faster and cheaper to put a fireproof box around the ELT than go through a redesign and then have to prove they are absolutely not going to spontaneously combust (take out the batteries?). Given past history with battery problems I suspect that is the way Boeing will approach this, IF this is the problem.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1373946575227</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 23:49:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
