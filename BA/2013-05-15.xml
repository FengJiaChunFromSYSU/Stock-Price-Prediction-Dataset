EO function officials stated that, in May 2010, the Determinations Unit began developing a spreadsheet that would become known as the “Be On the Look Out” listing (hereafter referred to as the BOLO listing),15 which included the emerging issue of Tea Party applications. In June 2010, the Determinations Unit began training its specialists on issues to be aware of, including Tea Party cases. By July 2010, Determinations Unit management stated that it had requested its specialists to be on the lookout for Tea Party applications. In August 2010, the Determinations Unit distributed the first formal BOLO listing. The criteria in the BOLO listing were Tea Party organizations applying for I.R.C. § 501(c)(3) or I.R.C. § 501(c)(4) status. Based on our review of other BOLO listing criteria, the use of organization names on the BOLO listing is not unique to potential political cases.16 EO function officials stated that Determinations Unit specialists interpreted the general criteria in the BOLO listing and developed expanded criteria for identifying potential political cases.17 Figure 3 shows that, by June 2011, the expanded criteria included additional names (Patriots and 9/12 Project) as well as policy positions espoused by organizations in their applications.

McKenney Acting Deputy Inspector General for Audit SUBJECT: Final Audit Report – Inappropriate Criteria Were Used to Identify Tax-Exempt Applications for Review (Audit # 201210022) This report presents the results of our review to determine whether allegations were founded that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS): 1) targeted specific groups applying for tax-exempt status, 2) delayed processing of targeted groups’ applications for tax-exempt status, and 3) requested unnecessary information from targeted groups. This audit was initiated based on concerns expressed by members of Congress and reported in the media regarding the IRS’s treatment of organizations applying for tax-exempt status. This review is included in our Fiscal Year 2013 Annual Audit Plan and addresses the major management challenge of Tax Compliance Initiatives. We would like to clarify a few issues based on the IRS response to our report. The response states that our report views approvals as evidence that the Exempt Organizations function should not have looked closely at those applications. We disagree with this statement. Our objection was to the criteria used to identify these applications for review. We believe all applications should be reviewed prior to approval to determine whether tax-exempt status should be granted. The IRS’s response also states that issues discussed in the report have been resolved. We disagree with this statement as well. Nine recommendations were made to correct concerns we raised in the report, and corrective actions have not been fully implemented.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368594246413</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 01:04:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368594273034-8</Id><Topic><Title>IRS BOLO partial List</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368593980805</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 00:59:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The IRS’s response also states that issues discussed in the report have been resolved.

No, it’s to brand those asking questions as conspiracy theorists. That, or just censor them altogether. Even Google employees have issued warnings on the official company blog regarding the continued requests initiated by governments around the globe to ‘pull’ content from Google’s massive search and blog service. From Google Plus (their Facebook equivalent) posts to legitimate search rankings, Google says that governments are demanding all forms of government criticism be taken down immediately. Right now, over 24,000 pieces of content may disappear if Google caves. That’s 24,000 pieces of content that likely includes my articles and other alternative news pieces that criticize our ‘brave’ new government. And expect thousands to be added to that list very quickly. A d v e r t i s e m e n t But of course we must ask: What do they have to fear? I mean after all, if the questions I ask regarding the mega banks admittedly funding the Mexican drug cartels and terror cells are fake (even though NBC reports it’s confirmed along with other news sources), then why be worried? If it’s all just ‘conspiracy’ bunk, then it sure would be easy to go ahead and dispel the rumors once and for all. Obama himself could go on air and break down how ‘conspiracy theories’, like the well-respected eyewitness coach asking questions about the Boston bombing drill that occurred the morning of the race (and not even slightly insinuating anything) are not real. But, of course, it is because the media cannot refute legitimate questions regarding mega banks and government corruption. Instead, they lump them in with things that no one in the alternative news actually believes like conspiracy theories about Elvis and other silly things. It all ties in to the well-scripted media theater that must run without interruption — no questions allowed!</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368619171732</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 07:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368620050450-27</Id><Title>Whopping Upgrade for The Boeing Company. **MUST SEE**</Title><Msg>We simply wanted to share this website with everybody under the sun.

Priorities USA, President Obama’s super PAC during the 2012 election, was also a 501(c)(4) organization. IRS enforcement officers, prodded by exposes in the press, knew something was fishy, and for reasons that still aren’t clear, began checking out conservative groups without applying the same type of scrutiny to liberal groups. The IRS gradually improved its search criteria so as not to target one type of political group over another, and it has since admitted that it bungled the initial effort to better police 501(c)(4) outfits. But the basic problem is that the IRS is trying to enforce outdated tax laws never meant to govern political groups. “The law was created years ago for PTAs and citizens’ associations,” says Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center. “It’s been turned into something it was never meant to be, and the IRS is being forced to do something for which it is very ill-equipped.” There are other IRS designations intended for political groups, but 501(c)(4)s have one key advantage: They’re not required to publicly disclose their donors. That allows wealthy contributors, including corporate executives, to funnel large amounts of money to favored candidates without generating unwanted controversy. The flow of such money became a gusher after the 2010 Citizens United case. The Supreme Court ruling seems to have spurred many groups to organize themselves as 501(c)(4)s rather than more traditional political groups that would have to disclose their donors. And Republican organizers got a head start on Democrats, which might explain why IRS agents zeroed in GOP groups when they started snooping in 2010. A New York Times expose published on September 20, 2010, for example, found that campaign spending by such groups in the 2010 midterm elections “heavily favored Republicans.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368620248552</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 08:17:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368620867363-30</Id><Topic><Title>The scandal?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368620248552</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 08:17:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yahoo wouldn't allow me to post the rest of it, but it is a yahoo finance article.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368620867363</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 08:27:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368621032837-31</Id><Title>Oh! So Now, Obama Finally Acknowledges IRS Did In Fact Targeted Conservative Groups</Title><Msg>After days of using the term "if," President Obama finally acknowledged the IRS did in fact inappropriately target conservative groups in a statement released last night. IRS official Lois Lerner admitted last Friday that the IRS had specifically singled out conservative groups for extra scrutiny. I have now had the opportunity to review the Treasury Department watchdog’s report on its investigation of IRS personnel who improperly targeted conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. And the report’s findings are intolerable and inexcusable. The federal government must conduct itself in a way that’s worthy of the public’s trust, and that’s especially true for the IRS. The IRS must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must act with utmost integrity. This report shows that some of its employees failed that test. I’ve directed Secretary Lew to hold those responsible for these failures accountable, and to make sure that each of the Inspector General’s recommendations are implemented quickly, so that such conduct never happens again. But regardless of how this conduct was allowed to take place, the bottom line is, it was wrong. Public service is a solemn privilege. I expect everyone who serves in the federal government to hold themselves to the highest ethical and moral standards. So do the American people. And as President, I intend to make sure our public servants live up to those standards every day. If you notice the first sentance in the second paragraph of Obama's statement, he has passed the responsibility of holding these people accountable off to someone else. Obama never takes responsibility for anything unless it's something good.....like killing Ben Laden.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1368621032837</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 08:30:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368621163005-32</Id><Title>Okay, boys and girls, your spartacus math moment for the day...</Title><Msg>Cleta Mitchell thinks the president knew + if proven + could be an impeachable offense.

In his remarks, he urged graduates to reject voices warning about government tyranny. "Unfortunately you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that's at the root of all of our problems. Some of these same voices do their best to gum up the works. They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner. You should reject these voices. Because what they suggest is that our brave and creative and unique experiment in self rule is somehow just a sham with which we can't be trusted." As a reminder of current Obama administration scandals: -IRS inappropriately targeting conservative groups -DOJ secretly monitoring multiple personal and work phone line of Associated Press reporters -Kathleen Sebelius extorting money from companies she regulates to fund ObamaCare -Benghazi That's right kids, you can totally trust Big Brother.

Every time a new scandal breaks, the White House comment is "we found out about this through news reports," "we need to wait for all the facts," and of course, "this was just a few low-level employees in X-state or X-city, nobody in Washington was involved." Operation Fast and Furious After it was discovered in early 2011 the Department of Justice [DOJ] had knowingly and willingly trafficked 2500 semi-automatic Ak-47 style rifles, or what President Obama would call "military grade assault rifles," to Mexican drug cartels, DOJ officials in Washington D.C. immediately blamed a "few low-level, rogue ATF agents working in Phoenix." It turned out, not only did senior DOJ officials know about Fast and Furious from the beginning, which started in September 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder received regular memos about the operation. Benghazi In the aftermath of the 9/11 Benghazi terror attack, the entire Obama administration, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, President Obama, Press Secretary Jay Carney and UN Ambassador Susan Rice, all blamed a rogue and irrelevant YouTube video for the violence. After investigation by the House Oversight Committee, a handful of investigative press reports and whistleblower testimony from acting Libyan Ambassador Greg Hicks last week, we now know Clinton knew the 9/11 attack was in fact a terrorist attack on the day it happened. "At 2 a.m. Secretary of State Clinton called me along with her senior staff were all on the phone and she asked me what was going on and I briefed her on developments. Most of the conversation was about the search for Ambassador Stevens. It was also about what we were going to do with our personnel in Benghazi and I told her that we would need to evacuate," Hicks said. "The only report that our mission made through every channel was that there had been an attack." Now that the White House and Clinton have been caught in their lie about a YouTube video, they're blaming the "intelligence community" for bad information. In addition, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed not to know anything about requests for more security at the consulate in Benghazi. Those requests, of course, were handled by the people below her.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1368621523895</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 08:38:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368621544466-36</Id><Topic><Title>Whopping Upgrade for The Boeing Company. **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>banas_gerard</Username><Timestamp>1368620050450</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 08:14:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good</Msg><Username>d.clifton41</Username><Timestamp>1368621544466</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 08:39:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368621719564-37</Id><Topic><Title>Oh!

It was also, late in the game, the rallying cry of John McCain and his supporters last fall, especially after the Joe the Plumber incident. They are undoubtedly correct that this law, and Obama's plans in general, are leading us ever further down the road to serfdom, although from an economic standpoint it's at least as much fascist as socialist — not that the distinction matters greatly for the two are the same in principle. While it's good to see some actual GOP opposition to government growth again, it's very difficult to take it seriously. Here, for example, is just a sampling of the socialist programs and policies instituted and/or supported by a significant number of Republicans, with Ron Paul frequently being the lone exception: Social Security. Republicans may not have started this program, and occasionally they will speak of its insolvency, but they seem to have no real problem with its continuation. The best we get out of them is Bush's stillborn plan to give those of us forced into Social Security the option of diverting a small portion of the loot stolen from us into various government-approved investments. Given the current state of the stock market, we should be grateful that this plan never got off the ground. Imagine the bailouts to all the individual Social Security "investors" who expected to get ever-increasing returns on their investments! Name the last Republican who spoke of abolishing, rather than "shoring up" or "reforming" Social Security. Medicare. Not only does the GOP not suggest ridding us of this blatantly socialist takeover of the health care system; but George W. Bush, with the support of many members of his own party, pushed through Medicare prescription drug coverage, the largest new entitlement program in four decades. Again there is talk of "fixing" or "saving" Medicare but none of ending it — all while Republicans try to convince us that they, and they alone, are standing between us and the Democrats' plans to nationalize health care. Welfare. Yes, we have welfare "reform," but where is welfare repeal? Add a few mild work requirements to the program, and the GOP is on board. Faith-Based Initiatives. Getting religious charities on the government dole was another Bush policy that seemed to please much of his base as long as their preferred charities were the ones robbing the rest of us. Sure, it meant that those charities had to water down their messages, but it was worth it to see that "liberal" charities didn't get their hands in the till. Proof of the socialist nature of these programs is that Obama intends to retain and expand them, in the process forcing charities to distance themselves even further from their religious underpinnings. Public Education. In 1994 the GOP promised to rid us of the Department of Education. Instead we got Bush's No Child Left Behind Act, greatly increasing control of the education system from Washington. Every once in a while some Republican will timidly suggest school vouchers or tuition tax credits to allow parents to send their children to the schools of their choice, but in these programs (especially vouchers) lie the same dangers for private elementary and secondary schools that private colleges and universities whose students accept federal money already have experienced. (See my alma mater, Grove City College, for a prime example.) In any event, Republicans seem uninterested in reducing federal control over the education system. For that matter, when was the last time you heard a Republican suggest curtailing or eliminating state control of any level of schooling? Infrastructure. Where are the Republicans demanding that Uncle Sam get out of the road- and bridge-building business? Where are those demanding even a cutback in such spending? Republican President Dwight Eisenhower gave us the Interstate Highway System, a fact to which most GOP stalwarts point with pride. Even scarcer is the Republican at the state or local level voicing the opinion that perhaps the government of which he is a part is doing us all a disservice by continuing to maintain socialist infrastructure to the exclusion of all competitors. Law Enforcement. Republicans are always the first to defend the police, the FBI, and other government agencies whenever any allegations of abuse or wrongdoing are lodged against them. They have shown great eagerness to increase local, state, and federal cops' powers and immunities, especially if they can use the excuse of fighting wars on drugs or terrorism. They passed the PATRIOT Act with alacrity when the opportunity presented itself; and Bush aggrandized, with his fellow Republicans' approval, much unconstitutional power to the executive branch, including the ability to imprison people indefinitely on the president's say-so. They even granted retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that had assisted the Bush administration in violating the Constitution by eavesdropping on Americans' telephone calls — with the assistance of noted socialist Obama. Give even the slightest hint that you think law enforcement agencies should be curtailed or certain criminal statutes repealed, and Republicans will be the first to denounce you as "soft on crime" or "with the terrorists." And don't even suggest that private security could do a better job than government "security." Financial Bailouts. Republicans maintained that the abuses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could have been prevented by better oversight, which the Democrats opposed. They did not say that these abuses could have been prevented by abolishing Fannie and Freddie and various other government loan programs. Bush had, in fact, exacerbated the problem with his now laughably named American Dream Downpayment Act of 2003, which allowed people to obtain mortgages with no down payment and even without mortgage payments for the first two years. Bush, of course, also stumped for and signed into law the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which gave the Secretary of the Treasury $700 billion to hand out at will. Even Obama's latest outrage on this front, yet another mortgage bailout, "originated with a Republican," writes Ilana Mercer. "Only a week or two back," she explains, "minority whip Sen. Mitch McConnell proposed a similar scheme whereby the government would lower home-loan interest rates and guarantee the loans." One doubts that Republicans would be crying "Socialism!" had McConnell's plan come up for a vote. The Military. This undoubtedly is the socialist program most beloved of Republicans. They may be willing to admit that in all other instances government is wasteful, inefficient, and bungling and that it usually fails to solve the problems it sets out to solve while simultaneously creating new ones; but when it comes to the armed forces, suddenly all that skepticism melts away into an infatuation worthy of Romeo and Juliet. Maybe the Pentagon does spend a wee bit too much on screwdrivers and toilet seats, and perhaps even certain actions taken by the boys in uniform (such as Abu Ghraib) have negative effects, but those are aberrations in an otherwise stellar record. Every good Republican knows that the U.S. military always acts in the best interest not just of America but of the entire world. As far as the GOP is concerned, "defense" spending must never be cut, no matter how out of proportion it is to the actual threats our country faces or to the spending of the rest of the world; and one must never, ever criticize the military. To cut the military's budget or suggest that it might be just as wasteful, inefficient, and bungling as the rest of the government is to "hate the troops" and to "blame America first." One wouldn't expect private defense to enter these people's minds, but few Republicans are even willing to consider constraining either the Pentagon's spending or its adventurism. All other government programs are fair game for cutting and criticism, but the military is sacrosanct. One could probably make a list ten times as long of all the socialist institutions supported by the very same Republicans who now pose as defenders of capitalism. They are correct that Obama's plans are socialist in nature, but they fail to see — or conveniently forget — that they, too, are guilty of giving America a huge push down the slope of socialism. While their opposition to the "stimulus" is welcome, it's a bit like Bugs Moran's criticizing Al Capone for bumping off his enemies. Unfortunately, we the taxpayers are the ones who were massacred on this St. Valentine's Day.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368627410421</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 10:16:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368627941672-61</Id><Topic><Title>Are Democrats and Other Liberals Clueless about the Radical Left's goal?</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1368623980103</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 09:19:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>roksta, i mean sparty, raises his hand...clueless, our enemies ever useful idiot</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1368627941672</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 10:25:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368628155928-62</Id><Topic><Title>Okay, boys and girls, your spartacus math moment for the day...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368621163005</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 08:32:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>chrissie, err spart, i mean hooz, remember when spazticus thought the per unit cost of osprey's ordered in billions of dollars dem liberal arts majors don't make very good mathematicians (or economists), ripe territory for useful idiots though</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1368628155928</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 10:29:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368628399656-63</Id><Topic><Title>Are Democrats and Other Liberals Clueless about the Radical Left's goal?</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1368623980103</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 09:19:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how come you`re always a vowel or two short of stupid?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368628399656</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 10:33:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368628429720-64</Id><Topic><Title>Obama made right decisions night of Benghazi attack</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368535700633</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 08:48:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As compared to the expertise of a person hooz delusional alter ego is Sir Paul.</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1368628429720</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 10:33:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368628646688-65</Id><Title>Does America need a Peaceful Revolution?</Title><Msg>In spite of the exposing of several scandals, lies and the tyrannical abuse of government power and agencies Obama still has strong support from the left.....if not a majority of voters, close to it.

The two most populous states subscribe to the latter ideology. Should States begin to realize this difference will only become more polarized and contentious under our present system? Perhaps it’s time for states to consider a peaceful revolution and succession into two separate countries......not necessarily along geographical lines but ideological ones. In fact why not have 50 separate countries. Abolish our federal government that is obviously out of control. The fear of our founders of an over reaching government has been realized.

According to a new PPP Poll, a majority trust former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s handling of the Benghazi attacks — only Republican voters have rallied behind the idea that the Obama administration is involved in covering up the “truth” behind the Benghazi attacks. A question posed to respondents asked, “Who do you trust more on the issue of Benghazi: Hillary Clinton or congressional Republicans?” — 49 percent said they trust Mrs. Clinton and 39 percent cited the Republicans. The poll also reports 57 percent of voters have an unfavorable view of congressional Republicans, while 52 percent have a favorable opinion of the former secretary. Some Republican leaders, like Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), are convinced that “Benghazi-gate” will lead to President Obama’s impeachment. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee told listeners on his radio show, “I believe that before it’s all over, this president will not fill out his full term. As bad as Watergate was because it broke the trust between the president and the people, no one died. This is more serious because four Americans did in fact die. And President Obama has yet to explain why did they die.” According to the poll (PDF), 41 percent of Republican respondents believe Benghazi is the biggest scandal in American history, yet 40 percent of them could not identify where Benghazi is located. GOP leaders have somehow convinced their base that this is the scandal of the century and have turned “Benghazi” into a talking point, certain that if they continue shouting the word, voters will eventually pay attention, see the injustice, and mobilize behind the party to impeach Obama. What is even more astounding is the 72 and 58 percent of Republicans who said investigating Benghazi is more important than passing a bill requiring background checks for all gun sales or passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill, respectively. Republicans have become obsessed with uncovering the “truth” behind Benghazi, insisting that the Obama administration is hiding emails that would directly tie them to the four American deaths, and after endless testimony and congressional hearings are still relentlessly in search of a smoking gun. President Obama addressed what he referred to as a “sideshow” on Monday during a press conference with United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron. “If this was some effort on our part to try to downplay what had happened or tamp it down, that would be a pretty odd thing that three days later we end up putting out all the information that, in fact, has now served as the basis for everybody recognizing that this was a terrorist attack and that it may have included elements that were planned by extremists inside of Libya,” Obama said. “Who executes some sort of cover-up or effort to tamp things down for three days? The whole thing defies logic.” While a majority of Americans do care about the four lives lost during the Benghazi terrorist attacks, this PPP poll raises two major points that will surely not sit well with Republicans. Overall, voters believe further investigation into Benghazi should not have priority over passing other important legislation — ensuring attacks don’t happen again is crucial, but chasing a conspiracy is a waste of time and resources. Despite attempts to denounce the former Secretary, the majority of voters still trust Hillary Clinton and believe her testimony.

Gates is claiming THIS WAS A KNOWN HIGH RISK AREA which means state department personnel were put in harms way with no protection and no rapid evacuation contingency plan. Exposing state department personnel in this manner rises to the level of willful negligence on the part of State Department leaders including Hillary Clinton. You and Hooz keep rising to the level of willful ignorance on how Gates unintentionally confirms that a government department led by Hillary Clinton committed acts of willful negligence which led to the deaths of Americans. Hillary also lied to parents and families of the dead to their face, by telling them that a YouTube video was the cause of the deaths. There is no longer any doubt with multiple lines of evidence that Hillary knew during the attack that it was terrorist attack.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368632205375</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:36:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368632383515-90</Id><Topic><Title>787 is the next big thing..</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1368631329803</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:22:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very soon shorts are getting fried$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1368632383515</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:39:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368632410670-91</Id><Title>Monoply with huge back log.. why this is not 120$ already..</Title><Msg>is beyond my.</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1368632410670</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:40:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368632428252-92</Id><Topic><Title>Another day</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368550718001</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:58:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>censored err spaz err fascist err bumper err brain damaged err delusions err hallucinations err spaz</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1368632428252</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:40:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368632588087-93</Id><Topic><Title>Pentagon Grants Itself Authority Over ‘Civil Disturbances’</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368631199153</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I posted this 6 minutes before you did noting that Obama believes he can kill citizens he doesn't like with drones and that he is overseeing the transformation of "our brave and creative and unique experiment in self rule" into a 1960s Kremlin style government.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368632588087</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:43:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368632649333-94</Id><Topic><Title>Another day</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368550718001</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:58:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>censored you`re far below slinging poo you`re more of the #$%$ eating type so keep licking it up there is plenty out there for you.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368632649333</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:44:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368632985425-95</Id><Topic><Title>Another day</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368550718001</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:58:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if not REAL work, just how is your msg board jihad sustained ahkmed, i mean roksta?</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1368632985425</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:49:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368633881723-96</Id><Topic><Title>787 is the next big thing..</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1368631329803</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 11:22:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly!</Msg><Username>binder_jim</Username><Timestamp>1368633881723</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 12:04:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368634053456-97</Id><Title>Now Barry is going to claim he didn't know his staff used illegally obtained personal tax records</Title><Msg>“The American people are entitled to know how a confidential tax return containing private donor information filed exclusively with the Internal Revenue Service has been given to our political opponents whose leader also happens to be co-chairing President Obama's reelection committee,”</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368634053456</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 12:07:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368634391173-98</Id><Title>GOP waste tax dollars on bozo hearings !</Title><Msg>come up empty handed every time Fast and Furious -

If the AP leak case was one of the worst in history according to you, why did you as the AG step down from the case? Was the Associated Press the only media outlet secretly monitored?How many reporters from what media outlets had their communications secretly monitored?

Eric Holder says he is not sure how many times such information has been seized by government investigators in the four years he's led Justice. During an interview with NPR's Carrie Johnson on Tuesday, Holder was asked how often his department has obtained such records of journalists' work. "I'm not sure how many of those cases ... I have actually signed off on," Holder said. "I take them very seriously. I know that I have refused to sign a few [and] pushed a few back for modifications." On Morning Edition, Carrie added that Holder declined to say whether there will be a review of the Justice Department's policy on searches of reporters' records. How is it that the Attorney General of the United States never knows anything important about anything controversial? Just yesterday Holder made it a point to stress that the AP leak was one of the most serious leaks he's ever seen in his career yet, recused himself from the case. You'd think if the leak was one of the most serious in history, the chief law enforcement officer and head of the Justice Department would lead the investigation into the case. As Ed Morrissey points out, Holder's response indicates that the seizure and monitoring of reporters' communications is a normal thing over at DOJ. Er … he’s refused to sign “a few” but isn’t sure how many he’s approved? Presumably, the few modifications for which he “pushed” resulted in approval eventually. That seems to strongly imply that this is a rather normal course of action at the Department of Justice — and for Holder. And note that Holder isn’t saying that he’s unclear about the operations within his executive purview, as Carney tried yesterday on Obama’s behalf — he’s unclear on how many times he himself has approved those seizures. Holder is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday at 1 p.m.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1368639407298</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 13:36:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368639608586-125</Id><Title>Majority Believe IRS Agents Who Targeted Tea Party Should Be Thrown in Jail</Title><Msg>If you don't pay your taxes, you go to jail and now, the majority of likely voters want to see the IRS agents who inappropriately targeted the Tea Party thrown in jail. More from Rasmussen Reports: Only seven percent (7%) of voters believe no disciplinary action should be taken against the IRS employees involved in the investigations. Twenty-nine percent (29%) feel they should be formally reprimanded. But most (57%) think those involved should be jailed or fired, with 16% who say they should be put in jail and 41% who believe they should be fired. On the issue of political motivation behind the targeting, a majority believes this was in fact political with 55 percent thinking President Obama had some kind of knowledge about the situation before news reports surfaced. President Obama has claimed he only found out about the targeted through news reports last Friday. Just 16% of Likely U.S. Voters believe the IRS investigations of these groups were a coincidence, according to the latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey. Fifty-seven percent (57%) think the investigations were politically motivated. Twenty-seven percent (27%) are not sure. Fifty-five percent (55%) think it is at least somewhat likely that President Obama or his top aides were aware that Tea Party and other conservative groups were targeted by the IRS. Thirty-four percent (34%) consider that unlikely. This includes 36% who believe it is Very Likely the president or his top aides knew of the investigations and 13% who feel it is Not At All Likely. Eleven percent (11%) are undecided.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1368639608586</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 13:40:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368639735370-126</Id><Title>in a week or two</Title><Msg>After all these fake scandals have been forgotten the Republicans will be forced to bring back the birther issue it`s their only hope !</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368639735370</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 13:42:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368639787256-127</Id><Topic><Title>Another day</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368550718001</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:58:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368639787256</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 13:43:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368639796751-128</Id><Title>Stewart: C'mon Obama, You Don't Actually Find Out Everything Through the News</Title><Msg>For the second night in a row last night, Jon Stewart hammered the Obama administration about mounting scandals.

Aircraft JA826J was the seventh and last aircraft to receive modifications to its lithium-ion batteries, including the installation of a new containment system. The works were finished on 13 May. Four of JAL's seven 787s have also completed confirmation flights, where no battery problems were found, says the carrier. Fellow Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways (ANA) still has six 787s undergoing modifications. Works on 11 others have been completed, where like JAL, the carrier did not discover any further problems. JAL and ANA have also been conducting familiarisation flights with its pilots on the aircraft type since 4 May and 28 April respectively. Both carriers, which together own about half of the worldwide fleet of 787s, have said that they plan to resume 787 operations on 1 June. ANA will deploy the aircraft type on routes from Tokyo Narita to San Jose, and from Tokyo Haneda to Frankfurt and Beijing. JAL meanwhile will use the 787s on services from Tokyo Narita to Boston, San Diego and Singapore, and also on routes from Tokyo Haneda to Singapore and Beijing. Flightglobal Pro data shows that ANA has received 17 787-8s, with an additional 19 -8s and 30 787-9s on order. JAL, meanwhile, has seven -8s in its fleet, with an additional 18 -8s and 20 787-9s on order.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1368645196441</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:13:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368646441567-147</Id><Topic><Title>Oh!

"In the four years since the inspectors, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capability to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." Congressional Record, October 10, 2002. Did she lie about WMD? If President Bush is a liar, then Senator Clinton is as well. Let us hear what Charles Schummer said about the threat of Iraq. "[It] is Hussein's vigorous pursuit of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations, that make him a terrible danger to the people to the United States." Congressional Record, October 10, 2002 Was he misleading himself into voting for the war? Did he lie for oil as President Bush has been accused of? What of Senator Jay Rockefeller? What did he say about Iraq before Selective Memory Syndrome, a common Leftist malady struck? "We must eliminate that [potential nuclear] threat now before it is too late. But that isn't just a future threat. Saddam's existing biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose real threats to America today, tomorrow. ... [He] is working to develop delivery systems like missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that could bring these deadly weapons against U.S. forces and U.S. facilities in the Middle East. He could make these weapons available to many terrorist groups, third parties, which have contact with his government. Those groups, in turn, could bring those weapons into the United States and unleash a devastating attack against our citizens. I fear that greatly." Congressional Record, October 10, 2002 How about failed lifeguard Ted Kennedy? What did he think about Saddam? "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction." Remarks at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, October 27, 2002 Democratic Senator Chris Dodd had this to say. "There is no question that Iraq possesses biological and chemical weapons and that he seeks to acquire additional weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. That is not in debate. I also agree with President Bush that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace and must be disarmed, to quote President Bush directly." Congressional Record, October 8, 2002 Finally let me close with the words of President Bill Clinton! "In the next century, the community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat Iraq poses now — a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them or provide them to terrorists, drug traffickers, or organized criminals who travel the world among us unnoticed. If we fail to respond today, Saddam, and all those who would follow in his footsteps, will be emboldened tomorrow by the knowledge that they can act with impunity, even in the face of a clear message from the United Nations Security Council, and clear evidence of a weapons of mass destruction program." "[Let's imagine the future. What if he fails to comply and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third route, which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this program of weapons of mass destruction and continue to press for the release of the sanctions and continue to ignore the solemn commitments that he made? Well, he will conclude that the international community has lost its will. He will then conclude that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction. And some day, some way, I guarantee you he'll use the arsenal. And I think every one of you who has really worked on this for any length of time, believes that, too." Remarks at the Pentagon, February 17, 1998 "Other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. With Saddam, there is one big difference: He has used them, not once, but repeatedly. Unleashing chemical weapons against Iranian troops during a decade-long war. Not only against soldiers, but against civilians, firing Scud missiles at the citizens of Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Iran. And not only against a foreign enemy, but even against his own people, gassing Kurdish civilians in Northern Iraq. The international community had little doubt then, and I have no doubt today, that left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will use these terrible weapons again." Remarks at the White House, December 16, 1998 Was Bill Clinton helping Bush mislead Democrats with these words? Was he plotting to assist George W. Bush in misleading us into a war on false pretenses over two years BEFORE Bush was elected? If you are a Leftist then you have to believe this if you believe Bush lied.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1368648153741</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:02:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368648364676-157</Id><Topic><Title>4500 died</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368647971323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:59:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What about the leftist Democrat morons that gave speech after speech chastizing Bush for not going to war right away?

The ACLU argues that current government surveillance practices on electronic communications violate citizens’ Fourth Amendment rights, designed to protect Americans from unlawful searches and seizures. “If nothing else, these records show that federal policy around access to the contents of our electronic communications is in a state of chaos. The FBI, the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, and DOJ Criminal Division should clarify whether they believe warrants are required across the board when accessing people’s email,” Wessler wrote. “It has been clear since 1877 that the government needs a warrant to read letters sent via postal mail. The government should formally amend its policies to require law enforcement agents to obtain warrants when seeking the contents of all emails too, ” he wrote. Reform legislation to update the main statute protecting electronic and online privacy is making its way through the Senate now. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted overwhelmingly in April to update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and thus bring our privacy rights in line with the 21st century.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1368648813516</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:13:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368648962786-159</Id><Title>Why Are Democrats Circling the Wagons and defending Wrong Doing?</Title><Msg>Has the whole Party become corrupt?</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1368648962786</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:16:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368649016917-160</Id><Topic><Title>4500 died</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368647971323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:59:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Those 4500 died fighting the type of tyranny Barry is now guilty of.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368649016917</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:16:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368649086695-161</Id><Topic><Title>4500 died</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368647971323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:59:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>name one dopey- the Dems were the sole opposition to the criminal Bush wars- I would say that in addition to your being slightly smarter than the village idiot you probably are guilty of aiding and abetting as far as the Iraq war goes</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368649086695</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:18:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368649139253-162</Id><Title>Eric Holder on Secretly Monitoring the Press: "I Know Nothing"</Title><Msg>Under pressure from lawmakers Wednesday to explain why the Department of Justice secretly monitored the personal and work phones of Associated Press reporters, Attorney General Eric Holder shielded himself from responsibility by claiming, "I don't know." According to Holder, Deputy Attorney General James Cole signed off on a subpoena allowing for the monitoring of AP reporters and editors after Holder recused himself from the case. The law requires the Attorney General of the United States to sign off on subpoenas related to press monitoring. Holder claimed throughout the hearing that because he recused himself "early on," he knew nothing about the details of DOJ snooping. Here is a list of a few of Holder's quotes in response to the phone monitoring case: I recused myself because I thought it would be inappropriate for a fact witness to lead the investigation I don't know, I was recused from the case. I do not have a factual basis for that answer because I was recused from the case. Again Mr. Chairman, I don't know what happened there with the interaction between DOJ and the AP, I was recused from the case. I simply don't have a factual basis to answer that question. I am not familiar with the reasons why the subpoena was constructed in the way it was because I was not part of the case. The head of the RNC called for my resignation even though I was not the one who made that decision. I know nothing. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgran was less than satisfied with Holder's no-knowledge answers. "I want to know how and why you recused yourself," Lofgren said. "It seems clear to me the actions of the department have in fact impaired the First Amendment....The regulations say that these records should not be contained in a compulsory manner."</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1368649139253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:18:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368649305077-163</Id><Topic><Title>4500 died</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368647971323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:59:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you don't have a case psycho- the US Airforce wasconducting patrols and enforcing no fly zones which could have been easily extended to the entire nation of Iraq- to put intolerable pressure on Saddam Hussein - until the slightest evidence that WMD's were existant we could have held that 4500 KIA down to a few dozen- and invaded when it became necessary</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368649305077</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:21:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368649982997-164</Id><Topic><Title>Eric Holder on Secretly Monitoring the Press: "I Know Nothing"</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1368649139253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:18:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody in the Obamer Administration has a clue as to what's going on in this administration and Obamer is always telling the press he didn't know anything until he heard it from the press.

"One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line." President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998-Truth! This was a quote from President Clinton during a presentation at the Pentagon defending a decision to conduct military strikes against Iraq. "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program." President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998-Truth! Bill Clinton went to the Pentagon on this occasion to be briefed by top military officials about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. His remarks followed that briefing. "Iraq is a long way from USA but, what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998-Truth! This is a quote from Albright during an appearance at Ohio State University by Albright, who was Secretary of State for Bill Clinton. "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998-Truth! This was at the same Ohio State University appearance as Madeline Albright. "We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S.Constitution and Laws, to take necessary actions, (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998-Truth! According to the U.S. Senate website, the text of this letter was signed by several Senators, both Democrat and Republican, including Senator John McCain and Joseph Lieberman. "Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998-Truth! The text of this statement by Nancy Pelosi is posted on her congressional website. "Hussein has .. chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies." Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999-Truth! This was from an appearance Albright made in Chicago. She was addressing the embargo of Iraq that was in effect at the time and criticism that it may have prevented needed medical supplies from getting into the country. Albright said, "There has never been an embargo against food and medicine. It's just that Hussein has just not chosen to spend his money on that. Instead, he has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction, and palaces for his cronies." "There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue a pace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001Truth! The only letter with this quote from December 5, 2001 that we could find did not include the participation of Senator Bob Graham, but it was signed nine other senators including Democrat Joe Lieberman. It urged President Bush to take quicker action against Iraq. "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them." Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002-Truth! These were remarks from Senator Levin to a Senate committee on that date. "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country." Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002-Truth! This and the quote below was part of prepared remarks for a speech in San Francisco to The Commonwealth Club. "Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power." Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002-Truth! "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction." Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002-Truth! Part of a speech he gave at Johns Hopkins. "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons..." Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002-Truth! On the floor of the Senate during debate over the resolution that would authorize using force against Iraq. He was urging caution about going to war and commented that even though there was confidence about the weapons in Iraq, there had not been the need to take military action for a number of years and he asked why there would be the need at that point. "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002-Truth! Senator Kerry's comments were made to the Senate as part of the same debate over the resolution to use force against Saddam Hussein. "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years ... We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction." Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002-Truth! Senator Rockefeller's statements were a part of the debate over using force against Saddam Hussein. "He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do" Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002-Truth! Senator Waxman's contribution to the Senate debate over going to war. "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002-Truth! Senator Clinton acknowledged the threat of Saddam Hussein but said she did not feel that using force at that time was a good option. "Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real ..." Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan.23.2003-Truth!

This should lead to the rollout of the aircraft approximately 2 months later in late August. First flight is anticipated later this fall though timing is still uncertain. Boeing has taken delivery of ZB001's horizontal and vertical tail plane as well as the wings. In the coming two weeks we should see the delivery of the fuselage sections into Everett. Boeing is shifting production of 787-8s to the main 40-26 and 88-03 assembly lines in Everett in case issues with the assembly of the first 787-9 encounters problems in 40-24. Already Charleston is taking on more 787-8 but the bulk of the 787-8 production will go to the main final assembly in Everett. The other two 787-9 test airplanes will follow ZB001 in the 40-24 surge line. Meanwhile Boeing has resumed deliveries of the 787-8. ZA513 (LN83, JA818A) was delivered to ANA marking the airlines 18th 787 and Boeing's 51st 787 delivered.

Unlike yesterday’s hammering, today’s briefing focused on President Obama’s statement regarding the IRS scandal, issued last night. Reporters wanted to know what, exactly, the president meant when he said he wants those responsible to be held accountable. Does he support firings? Jail time? Calling the behavior “inappropriate” and “wrong,” Carney could not say anything specific about “accountability.” However, he pointed out that the president would be meeting with Treasury officials this afternoon, including Secretary Jack Lew, to discuss the matter. President Obama feels “very strongly” about the need for accountability and ensuring this never happens again, said Carney, although he couldn’t say what that meant, specifically, as “the president cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.” “I have no personnel announcements to make,” he said. Yesterday, Carney refused to comment on what the president thought of the IRS scandal, continually saying “if it happened” (despite IRS officials’ own admissions that the IRS targeted conservative groups), and refusing to comment on the matter until the president reviewed the Inspector General’s report. Today, although he noted that the president felt “strongly” about the need for the tax code to be applied in a neutral manner, Carney made a point of saying that the president had no reason to doubt the IRS officials who claimed that the targeting was for purposes of efficiency. In other words, Carney seemed to suggest that the president didn’t believe the targeting was politically motivated—and yet, in the same breath, he noted a lack of “neutrality,” indicating that there was political bias present. "The president has no reason to doubt the Inspector General's report," Carney said, in which political bias was not named a factor in the targeting. Turning to another unfolding indiscretion, reporters in the room seemed awfully curious about the president’s sudden renewed interest in passing media shield legislation, to help protect the press from unwarranted scrutiny over sources. Given the AP hacking discovery, isn’t the timing rather suspect, and perhaps a transparent attempt to save some face?</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1368653638356</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 17:33:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368653930503-181</Id><Title>RANGEL TO OBAMA: Come clean......LMAO</Title><Msg>Rep.

In response to questions, the engine-maker said it issued a pair of service bulletins on Tuesday urging airlines to replace at least one of two suspect gearboxes on 26 of the planes currently in service. Another 34 planes have the suspect part attached to one engine. The bulletins, which aren't mandatory but usually are followed by airlines, call for the work to be done within five days.

Of that money, a grand total of $1.4 million, or 2 percent, was spent on what Crossroads identified as “research.” Yet in 2010 Crossroads applied for tax-exempt status as a 501(c)4 “social welfare organization” and specified on its application – which ProPublica obtained from the IRS – that 20 percent of its money would be spent on research, 50 percent on public education and 30 percent on “activities to influence legislation and policy making.” The group said it “may in the future develop and/or distribute independent political communications,” but that “any such activity would be limited in amount and will not constitute the organization’s primary purpose.” In 2012, according to ProPublica, Crossroads GPS spent more than $70 million on ads and phone calls created to promote Republican candidates (like Mitt Romney). Then it spent another $50 million on ads attacking President Obama outside the FEC’s reporting window. Its twisted sister organization, American Crossroads, spent almost $105 million on ads during the 2012 campaign cycle. It’s long been obvious that groups like Crossroads were going beyond any reasonable interpretation of the law in claiming to be “social welfare” groups that operate independently of political parties and individual campaigns. These groups are required by law to limit those activities to a very small part of their work in order to qualify for tax-exempt status, and to shield their donors from disclosure requirements. Apparently the IRS has not yet officially approved Crossroads’ request for tax-exempt status. The discrepancy between the document ProPublica obtained and Crossroads’ activities during the campaign season demonstrates, beyond a non-hack’s doubt, that it shouldn’t. If Mr. Rove makes off with the “social welfare” label, it will be a scandal.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368658705709</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 18:58:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368659388502-196</Id><Title>Steven Miller the IRS Scapgoat, managers had nothing to gain, Steven had nothing to gain, this goes to the top</Title><Msg>now Obama plays the angry game.

Although Tea Party applicants got unfair IRS scrutiny, only one known group had status revoked. They’re Democrats By Joan Walsh Everyone agrees that the IRS shouldn’t have targeted groups with “Tea Party” or “Patriot” in their names for special scrutiny in awarding tax-exempt status. NBC News reports two agents have been disciplined for doing so, and the Justice Department announced a criminal probe. But so far no one has identified a single conservative group that was denied status in the controversial review, though some faced bureaucratic hurdles and had their tax-exempt status delayed. In fact, the only known 501(c)(4) applicant to have its status denied happens to be a progressive group: the Maine chapter of Emerge America, which trains Democratic women to run for office. Although the group did no electoral work, and didn’t participate in independent expenditure campaign activity either, its partisan status apparently disqualified it from being categorized as working for the “common good.” Ironically, the national organization and its earlier chapters had gotten tax-exempt status by the IRS during the Bush administration in 2006. But it appears as though the Maine group’s rejection triggered a review of the entire organization, and Emerge America and all of its chapters had their tax-exempt status revoked. Emerge reincorporated with 527 status, which requires it to report its donors. You can read the IRS letters explaining its decisions at the bottom of this post. Here’s what director Karen Middleton has to say: Emerge America and its initial state programs were granted 501(c)(4) status by the IRS several years ago. Later, when a new state program applied for the same status, it was denied because Emerge works only with women who are in the Democratic Party, so the IRS determined this did not meet the definition of “social welfare” for the common good. We believed this denial triggered a review of the Emerge programs that had already been granted c4 status, and consequently those statuses were revoked. Becoming 527 organizations has not hurt our fundraising or organizational expansion – we report our donors and continue our work fully transparently. Again, the focus on Tea Party groups is wrong, but two-thirds of the groups reviewed had no Tea Party ties — and only a Democratic group had its status denied. This story is more politically complicated than the right lets on.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368661691812</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 19:48:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368661946703-204</Id><Title>Blame Citizens United for the IRS scandal</Title><Msg>Blame Citizens United for the IRS scandal The real outrage is why these political groups have tax-exempt status in the first place Jared Bernstein Nope, I’m not going to defend the IRS, which appears to have acted in ways wholly inconsistent with their mandate for unbiased investigations into, in this case, whether certain political groups should receive tax-exempt status. It is unclear how high up the chain of command these untoward actions went, but this morning’s news suggests it wasn’t just a few rogue auditors in Cincinnati. The problem wasn’t that the agency scrutinized these so-called “social welfare” organizations—as I’ll emphasize in a moment, tax law in this area is an accident going out to happen. It’s that they violated neutrality, investigating conservative groups by searching on “tea party” and “patriot.” Republicans will of course try to pin this on the President, despite the fact that since Nixon used the IRS to target his enemies, the president’s been barred from even discussing this kind of thing with the agency. No, the problem here isn’t the president. It’s the Supreme Court’s Citizen United decision and subsequent tax law written by Congress that gives these groups tax exempt status (under rule 501(c)(4)) as long as most of their activities are primarily on educating the public about policy issues, not direct campaigning. Of course, the ambiguities therein are insurmountable. Many of these groups, especially the big ones, spend millions on campaign ads mildly disguised as “issue ads,” and under current law they can do so limitlessly and with impunity. According to today’s NYT: The tax code states that 501(c)(4)’s must operate “exclusively” to promote social welfare, a category that excludes political spending. Some court decisions have interpreted that language to mean that a minimal amount of political spending would be permissible. But the I.R.S. has for years maintained that groups meet that rule as long as they are not “primarily engaged” in election work, a substantially different threshold. Nowhere do the rules specify what “primarily engaged” means… Again, I see no way that a government agency could fairly interpret and enforce these instructions. What is “primarily engaged”–at which point does an issue ad cross the threshold into campaign ad—what kind of “education” is GPS Crossroads providing and how is it promoting “social welfare?” Weirdly, the IRS hasn’t seemed particularly interested in going after the big fish here, like Rove’s Crossroads GPS on the right or Priorities USA on the left. Instead, they appear to have systematically targeted small fry on the far right. If so, not only is that clearly biased and unacceptable—it’s also ridiculous given the magnitude of the violations of tax exempt status by these small groups relative to the big ones. At the end of the day, we should really ask ourselves what societal purpose is being served here by carving out special tax status for any of these groups. If anyone can show me any evidence that the revenue forgone is well spent, that these groups are making our political system and our country better off, please do so. If not, then no one’s saying shut them down—they’ve got a right to speak their minds. But not tax free.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368661946703</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 19:52:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368662261579-205</Id><Topic><Title>IRS head resigns</Title><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1368660818997</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 19:33:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't have the slightest idea "what took place."

Pro Publica is Dem front group and they are breaking the law by publishing documents on organizations that are not yet approved by the IRS. The proPublica people were also a key contributor to the housing collapse that has caused the recession. ___________________________________ Two years after ProPublica’s launch, the Sandlers seem happy with the freestanding newsroom. Under Paul Steiger, a former editor of The Wall Street Journal, it has collaborated with some top news outlets and brought researched exposés to an array of smaller ones. Its work has spurred an overhaul of California’s nurse-disciplinary system, heightened the sense of the risk that natural gas hydrofracking poses to America’s water supply (which won a Polk Award), and raised red flags over the dire straits of unemployment insurance funds nationwide. The Sandlers’ relationship with the rest of journalism has not fared as well. After decades of depictions of the couple as meticulous lenders, consumer advocates, and a lovable husband-and-wife team, the Sandlers’ reputation was recast during the financial crisis. In the 1980s, their bank popularized the “Pick-a-Pay” loan, a subtype of the option adjustable-rate mortgage (option ARM) that would later be blamed for some of the housing boom’s excesses—largely because they allowed borrowers to temporarily make payments that do not cover even the interest on the loan, meaning later payments must rise sharply. Worse, the Sandlers were accused of lowering their underwriting standards to juice loan volume, then pocketing billions by foisting the toxic mess on Wachovia—an acquisition that poisoned America’s fourth-largest bank.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368663082099</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 20:11:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368663134869-214</Id><Topic><Title>Karl Rove’s ‘Social Welfare’ Organization</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368658705709</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 18:58:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In The New York Times, the Sandlers’ option ARM loans were the “Typhoid Mary” of the housing crisis. 60 Minutes featured a whistleblower who accused them of “sitting on an Enron.” To cap it all off, Time included the Sandlers on its list of “People to Blame for the Financial Crisis” at number twelve, right after Lehman Brothers’ #$%$ Fuld.

Monsanto will engineer seeds and control food supplies. Obama, the U.N. and his new world order handlers will manage and control it all. Long before Obama’s tyrannical and controlling rule on America we were viewed as cattle to be forced into shuts to either brand or slaughter. Underneath our noses and beyond most people’s understanding, food, medicine, property rights and even the length of our life span has been assaulted, designed and planned. You thought all this time you had the right to live, breath, grow food and function as you felt lead??? Aren’t you a precious little cow? Obama, Monsanto and the New World order crowd believe they have that right to control you, not you. You are simply in the way other than being trained and pushed around as a good little ‘surf’ that creates income for the elite international power brokers. Who is Monsanto and what are they doing? Monsanto is a huge international GMO who plans to control and IS controlling more and more of the international food supply. They aren’t just a little start up research group studying food supply. They are in 60 countries, have over 14,000 employees and have revenues of $6 billion. They have invested over 500 million in one of their destructive schemes – genomics and biotechnology. I call it what it is – ‘depopulation’ hiding behind ‘Mother Theresa’ goals. Monsanto is quite famous for the release of the ‘Terminator Seed’ which renders a seed as a controlled and neutered item that can only produce a crop one time. Farmers and growers cannot use and re-use seeds as they have historically done for thousands of years. Monsanto has made sure that their Terminator Seed is good for one crop only. Thus, the farmer is forced to come back to them and get more seeds that ‘hark’ Monsanto controls. Now growers are dependent on Frankenstein’s laboratory. Where do they hide and do they have real influence? One whistle blower using an assumed name ‘Miguel’ talked of Monsanto’s domination in our colleges and universities. He also said that after watching them and working with them for 25 years it was most clear that their care for the safety and welfare of people and health is seriously in question. Monsanto has been accused numerous times of fraud, threats to health, accused of ecological disasters and false evidence. Some say that ‘genetically modified food’ is the harbinger of saving a hungry humanity. Monsanto talks a good game on the surface, food protection, stopping world hunger and viruses but it appears more and more that their goal is just the opposite. Control the world food supply, and depopulate parts of the world by creating massive illness and death, dependency on them for modified seeds. They will have the increasing power to turn the ‘modified’ spicket on and off — create diseases at will and get rid of unwanted populations. Obama and the U.N. must be thrilled…and you thought abortion was the big de population weapon. With most of the world standing against Monsanto’s terminator technology, they are verbally distancing themselves from it but in truth pushing and funding it worldwide. It is a known fact that poor farmers feed up to 1.4 billion people a year. If they cannot afford to buy seed after the first year, millions if not billions will die from starvation.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368671300865</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 22:28:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368671576881-238</Id><Topic><Title>did hell just freeze over ??</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368664450456</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 20:34:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One thing I learned on the Birth Certificate issue....it does not matter HOW much evidence is compilied against Barry....when you have Media, Intell and financial interests behind you...you are unbeatable,...Soetoro is being protected by the people who run this planet.
