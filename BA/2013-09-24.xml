Typically for most aircraft ( commercial) new models the first flyable plane labor costs are about 12 to 14 times the labor costs of the 100th plane. Similar curves for parts cost, sub assembliy costs, etc also apply. 2) When adding in the costs of capital, new tooling,machinery, facilities, etc, a so called breakeven number has always been figured to be around 400 to 600 planes- assuming no major issues in design, testing, and service. However, in the case of 787- mainly due to outsourcing and other issues, the breakeven numbers are estimated to be over 1000 planes- much worse than any new design at boeing in the last 50 years ( and even worse than the 737 which was almost cancelled/dropped in the late 80's ). 3) the 1997 - 2001 foulup was mostly due to two issues- pushing out over 9000 senior employees, and a fubar changeover to a computer system for tracking production issues pushed by a bunch of incompetent IT types learning how to use computers, power point, and the influx of proven loser management known as MDC</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1379996704891</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 00:25:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379997206516-3</Id><Topic><Title>Can this be explained?</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1379990020005</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 22:33:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did you check the details of the medical policy.

According to a shocking new report that was just released by the U.S. Census Bureau, median household income (adjusted for inflation) has declined for five years in a row. This has happened even though the federal government has been borrowing and spending money at an unprecedented rate and the Federal Reserve has been on the most reckless money printing spree in U.S. history. Despite all of the "emergency measures" that have been taken to "stimulate the economy", things just continue to get worse for average American families. Americans are working harder than ever, but their paychecks are not reflecting that. Meanwhile, the cost of everything just keeps going up. The Federal Reserve insists that inflation is "low", but anyone that goes grocery shopping or that stops at a gas station knows that is a lie. In fact, if inflation was calculated the exact same way that it was calculated back in 1980, the inflation rate would be somewhere between 8 and 10 percent right now. Paychecks are being stretched more than ever before, and that is probably the reason why about three-fourths of the entire country is living paycheck to paycheck at this point</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380020655636</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 07:04:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380022008442-15</Id><Title>Off Duty Soldier Armed With Handgun Saves 100 Lives During Mall Siege</Title><Msg>Another pro-gun story you won’t see covered by the US corporate media Paul Joseph Watson September 24, 2013 Here’s a positive story about guns that you’re not likely to see the US corporate media pay much attention to – an off-duty SAS soldier armed with just a handgun saved 100 lives during the terrorist siege on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya. The soldier was having a coffee with friends inside the mall when the attack began. His gun tucked inside his waistband, the soldier returned to the building at least a dozen times to rescue hostages. “He went back in 12 times and saved 100 people. Imagine going back in when you knew what was going on inside,” a friend told the Daily Mail, labeling the soldier a “hero”. British SAS forces regularly train and work in Kenya. The man’s identity cannot be revealed for security reasons, although he was pictured escorting panicked hostages out of the building.

They realized the full profitability of any sale late in the program and bury cost in backward looking charges that don't impact earnings. Where does this intersect with reality?

Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35A, previously considered too expensive, has shot to the front of the line in the race for the contract after the defense ministry singled out a fifth-generation fighter as the preferred option. The fifth generation F-35A, complete with its hi-tech stealth capability, has already been ordered by seven countries, including Japan and Israel. Boeing's F-15 Silent Eagle had been in the box seat to win the 8.3 trillion won ($7.7 billion) tender - as the only bid to fall within budget - but former military top brass and even the ruling party's lawmakers had criticized the plane as it lacked crucial stealth capabilities.

Let's delve a little further and look at Obonzo's motivations. He and his publicist lied to the public and said that Obonzo was born in Kenya as a PR stunt to promote his appearances and books. Without his father and the Kenyan angle, there is nothing interesting about his life and he's just another Black kid abandoned by his daddy. Obonzo knew that in order to separate himself and make his life interesting to others from a PR standpoint, he had to fabricate a story about a foreign born minority that was an American success story. That would get him the attention he needed especially in the political minority circles. I think that Obonzo's projected naivety, vulnerability and story of emotional abandonment makes him attractive to people who are weak minded individuals or who have emotional issues and empathize with Obonzo's fabricated story of parental abandonment. It appeals too pity party types who all feel sorry for themselves and project their emotional baggage onto Obonzo. That is the true emotional connection that Obonzo has tapped into in order to secure emotional loyalty with weak minded people that are unable to evaluate him beyond an emotional level even in light of his failures as a leader. Those who are ignorant and unread in philosophy fall for fabricated stories and emotional rhetoric. Humans are wired to want to believe a good story, that's why children are so easy to fool. When children grow up without training in science and philosophy that teaches them about their emotional weaknesses and vulnerability to lies put into a good story, they remain as children from an emotional standpoint into adulthood and can easily be manipulated by very good rhetoricians who fabricate good stories. This is why turd belching, copy and paste fanatical Obonzobots never present nay original thoughts of their own on the BA board and only present emotionally based fabrications from the Obonzo approved PR stasi.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380037063131</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 11:37:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380037673007-42</Id><Topic><Title>No Matter How Much You Shake, Kick, and Dance!!</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380035087410</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 11:04:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380037673007</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 11:47:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380037780957-43</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus CEO to announce product and commercial business wednesday at Beiging uh oh boeing</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380037712285</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 11:48:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no new customers on the A380 only</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380037780957</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 11:49:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380038250684-44</Id><Title>Billy Graham the people chose a murder Barrabas rather than Jesus....much like</Title><Msg>Americans chose Obama over Biblical principle.

Even the best con can only go on for so long before people start getting suspicious. Americans are finally getting suspicious of Obama.

Six years in the making, they will update the climate science community's best estimates for the level of warming that may occur, as well as estimates for impacts like sea level rise and melting ice sheets. Its conclusions are already under attack. The final summary of the first of four parts of the report will be released Friday (Sept. 27), after scientists and government officials hash out the details line by line. "I hope this report will stress the virtual certainty among the scientific community that humans are affecting the climate system in profound ways, mainly through burning ever-increasing amounts of fossil fuels," said Jennifer Francis, an atmospheric scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey. "I hope it will emphasize the high confidence in attribution of many aspects of climate change to increasing , and de-emphasize the discussion of uncertainty. The public hears "uncertainty" and thinks there is no consensus." A message for skeptics Climate researcher Julienne Stroeve said the final IPCC report needs to communicate the differences between natural variability and long-term . "I believe society is often confused about the differences between natural variability and long-term changes," said Stroeve, a research scientist at the National Snow &amp; Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. "While the models used in the IPCC reports are useful tools for generally expected climate changes, natural variability can be powerful in reversing these trends for several years at a time, which doesn't negate anthropogenic influences on climate. Better communication of that fact is needed." Critics of the leaked drafts have focused on what climate scientist Kevin Trenberth said is the "mistaken idea that warming has slowed." Because the reports draw worldwide attention, they also attract naysayers. An error on Himalayan glacier melting in the 2007 report was used by climate-change skeptics to question all of the report's conclusions on global warming. "It is not just a scientific document — it should have policy implications," Trenberth said. "And, of course, this is why there are well-financed and organized denier campaigns out in force."</Msg><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1380042861094</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 13:14:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380042987569-66</Id><Topic><Title>RWNJS howl at the public school system</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1380042647712</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 13:10:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ignorance is truth in the RWNJ mindest.</Msg><Username>reloadx10</Username><Timestamp>1380042987569</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 13:16:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380043319874-67</Id><Topic><Title>Big day tommorow with S.

That's why we need the "Fair Tax" or a flat tax with absolutely no exemptions. That would take care of halve the problem by preventing politicians the ability to grant favors via the tax code. It would also eliminate most of the IRS.....in the case of the "Fair Tax" all of the IRS would be eliminated. The second half is the spending half and also the more difficult half. Reduce the Federal Government to only those functions permitted and enumerated in article 1, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution and cede all other legislative action to the states as required by the 10th amendment. The only way to prevent or at least reduce the federal government from abusing, misusing and wasting the people's money is to not give it to them in the first place. Reduce the pay of congress to the median income of tax payers and take away their perks. Quit making serving in congress a life-time career and one big party. I suppose Democrats and other socialists minded people would fight this tooth and toenail because the very last thing they want from our government is fairness and sensibility.</Msg><Username>ireadhistory2</Username><Timestamp>1380043624801</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 13:27:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380043776067-69</Id><Topic><Title>Can this be explained?</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1379990020005</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 22:33:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A new alias, just for us?

As you will learn from the passage below any presentation of consensus that ignores the scientific fact that warming has paused, will be attacked by other scientists. For those of you who do not follow climate science the IPCCC AR5 report was leaked weeks ago to IPCC friendly/motivated journalists who could be counted on to write stories that would provide a defense for the numerous criticisms that will be leveled at the report. At the conference in Stockholm, scientists were pressured by non-scientists writing the Summary For Policy Makers, to present a defense for the 15+ year global warming pause. The scientists were uneasy and reluctant to do so and in a report from Spiegel On Line (a top liberal German paper) the following was reported. _______________________________ Germany’s highest-ranking climate researcher, physicist Jochem Marotzke, director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, in Hamburg, is fighting back against this refusal to face facts. Marotzke, who is also president of the German Climate Consortium and Germany’s top scientific representative in Stockholm, promises, “We will address this subject head-on.” The IPCC, he says, must engage in discussion about the standstill in temperature rise. Marotzke calls the claim that a temperature plateau isn’t significant until it has lasted for over 30 years unscientific. “Thirty years is an arbitrarily selected number,” he says. “Some climate phenomena occur on a shorter timescale, some on a longer one.” Climate researchers, Marotzke adds, have an obligation not to environmental policy but to the truth. “That obligates us to clearly state the uncertainties in our predictions as well,” he says.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380046733516</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 14:18:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380046901774-95</Id><Topic><Title>Why have Democrats come to believe they're Too Dumb to Spend their Own Money?</Title><Username>ireadhistory2</Username><Timestamp>1380044809082</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 13:46:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All for one and one for all</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1380046901774</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 14:21:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380047300752-96</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Scientists: IPCC Report Must Communicate Consensus</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1380042861094</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 13:14:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Certainly there is uncertainty in your 'denier' certainty, n'est ce pas... or bigger holes in DENIER theory than there are in CREATIONISM for a nickel I will...take the other side a 1913 Liberty Head V Nickel - Worth $4,500,000.00 Those who want to put aside over 200 years of tax legislation (change the rules in the middle of the game) in lieu of a flat-tax system are either... a. have not a clue of which they speak or b. have so much money that they think their flat-tax rate will be less than what they pay now so, which are you eh/a.</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380047300752</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 14:28:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380047428413-97</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Scientists: IPCC Report Must Communicate Consensus</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1380042861094</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 13:14:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can you take 200 years of recorded history from a planet that's supposedly 250 billion years old and establish a trend?

The UN has seen a reversal of support for the IPCC version ever since Climategate and now it is affecting elections. For instance Australia's Julia Gillard who put a carbon tax in place, lost her re-election bid to a conservative who has already fired Gillard's government climate science committee and will be repealing the carbon tax. In Germany, the Green Party once controlled 20%+ of the electorate and polls indicated that 63% of the people feared future climate change impact. Last week the Green Party candidates were pummeled in elections and now only represent 8% of the electorate while new polls show that only 39% of Germans fear climate change now. Desperate times required desperate measures for the IPCC but it is too late. I have kept current on the work of the IPCC climate scientists and reviewers and there is no consensus from a scientific standpoint with regard to the DEGREE of future trends. They are uncertain about hurricanes tornadoes, drought, sea level rise and others and the only areas of stronger certainty are heat waves and precipitation. The financial argument for increased future damage took a huge hit when earlier this year the IPCC SREX update report on extreme weather actually increased uncertainty in future loss damage. The problem here is that ultimately an economic cost/benefit analysis using lower future loss damage would indicate that mitigation costs associated with the reduction of CO2, would also be lowered.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380048520046</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 14:48:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380048638144-107</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Scientists: IPCC Report Must Communicate Consensus</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1380042861094</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 13:14:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a perfect game and a no-hitter are two different scenarios both of which, we the human species are trying to avoid concerning global climate change perhaps you did not see the signs in the Denver stands during last night foosball game concerning fires, floods, droughts, tornados or toandoes ( either is correct), etc. but one Danforth Quayle (draft-dodging/silver-spooner) on the campaign trail got angry at a second-grader for correcting him about the the spelling of the plural of potato's a. you know not of which you sepak or b. you have so much money that you think a flat-rate tax system will make you less in taxes than you do now so which is it ?</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380048638144</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 14:50:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380048666404-108</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle Obama has nearly 2 million fake Twitter followers</Title><Username>ireadhistory2</Username><Timestamp>1380046621262</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 14:17:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's just more proof these two are fakes and can't do anything upfront and honest.

I agree with that. And like being short tech in 1999 you could really get your throat ripped out. This stock is pricing in zero risk right now. Even if everything goes perfectly it's a real stretch to get to the street's 2015 numbers. And things are unlikely to go perfectly. This company faces major risks not confronted by other large industrial companies. They are trying to refresh their entire commercial plane lineup in the next 10 years. People talk about the 737Max as a "positive catalyst". No, it's not. They did not want to do this upgrade and as recently as two years ago said they wouldn't, but the success of the A320NEO forced their hand. If that program goes well the best case is they keep losing market share to Airbus. More likely, there will be development problems and their narrowbody franchise will become a spare parts business. The 777x is a similar situation. The 777 is less than 20 years old and they're already doing a ground-up redesign. The 777 is very successful, but once again their hand is being forced by Airbus. Airbus is going for the 777's throat with the A350, and Boeing is reluctantly responding. And never mind the 787. This is like watching a garbage truck crash into a brick wall in slow motion. No one who understands the accounting for this program believes this has any chance of ever breaking even.</Msg><Username>ba_hard_landing</Username><Timestamp>1380049496907</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 15:04:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380049551796-118</Id><Topic><Title>7 days to go till end of quarter</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1380027530215</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 08:58:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>more planes were flying this morning, 787, 2 747's, 3 737's</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1380049551796</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 15:05:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380049609587-119</Id><Topic><Title>Off Duty Soldier Armed With Handgun Saves 100 Lives During Mall Siege</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380022008442</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 07:26:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An off duty Navy Seal tried to save the Embass. in Benghazi, and several others that were left to be murdered by Obama, and Hillary.

As the evidence for this "masking" grows it has created another possibility which is that natural variation may trump any human contribution and that man's impact on warming may be insignificant in the long run (this has no scientific support thus far and is only a hypothesis that will be require further examination). This is where it gets interesting because the point that climate physicist Jochem Marotzke makes is that from an empirical basis you can test aspects of climate models on a 15 year basis accounting for these masking effects. If the models are tuned to be too sensitive to a doubling of CO2, they would overstate future climate change. This is a nightmare for the IPCC because the IPCC relies heavily on models that are not looking so good to the climate scientists and physicists who insist that physical measurements need to correlate well with models before they can be considered reliable for future projections, and to the contrary the physical evidence has been diverging from the models. The thinking is that the models are tuned to be too sensitive to CO2 and are missing other perturbations and possibly negative feedbacks or possibly are using the wrong physics. The IPCC is also missing newer scientific findings that missed the cut off date to be included in AR5, and that is also a point of scientific contention that the IPCC will face that involves the latest research on Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity and Transient Climate Response calculations.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380051037623</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 15:30:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380051168855-126</Id><Topic><Title>ANYONE ELSE DOES N'T LIKE BOEING?</Title><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1380038763514</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 12:06:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another brand new poster joined today discussing BA with himself..

During a discussion on The Tom Joyner Radio Show, Lemon entered into a discussion about gun violence. While we might expect to see a diatribe concerning emotional rhetoric, to his credit, Lemon focused on the logic of gun control policies and cited a study that has altered his thinking on the subject. Obama commissioned a study by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to investigate gun violence. While the move was largely thought to be an effort to drum up some support for his anti-gun push, the report actually discovered what gun rights advocates have known all along. Gun control doesn’t work. Lemon candidly admitted, “It just might make you rethink your stance, your view, on the issue. It did for me. It’s making me rethink it.” The lengthy report, in summary, states, 1) That most gun deaths are actually suicides, not gun violence. 2) Armed citizens are less likely to be injured by an attacker 3) There are anywhere between 500,000 to 3 million defensive uses of guns per year. 4) Most criminals procure their weapons from illegal means- such as friends or blackmarkt, making it impossible to remedy throw legislation. 5) mass shootings and accidental firearm casualties account for a small fraction of gun-related deaths and both are declining. The report emerged in June, but has largely been ignored by the mainstream media and has not been mentioned by the Obama Administration. Of course, the findings directly contradict the narratives pushed by anti-gun zealots. Still, with these surprises coming from the left, it is refreshing to see that some liberals are slowly awakening to several key narratives that simply don’t make sense.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople3</Username><Timestamp>1380053086999</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 16:04:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380053226904-136</Id><Topic><Title>ANYONE ELSE DOES N'T LIKE BOEING?</Title><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1380038763514</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 12:06:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not doubting you, but what site are you using today, you say you only use CNN which you claim only goes back 3 years in most of your other posts</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1380053226904</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 16:07:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380053232588-137</Id><Title>Airbus Crash</Title><Msg>Does anyone know about a new ETHIAD Airbus being fully destroyed???</Msg><Username>brhoy2002</Username><Timestamp>1380053232588</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 16:07:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380053437854-138</Id><Topic><Title>I9f the RWNJ's shut-down the government we win</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380051689615</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 15:41:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What will you win?

The analogy isn’t even applicable. Why? Because I’m pretty sure that the programs Rangel is lionizing here didn’t even exist in Jesus’ day. In any case, Rangel is essentially saying that if a so-called "Christian" disagrees with the premise of expanding government benefits to poor people (never mind that government dependency is oftentimes destructive and counter-productive) he/she is therefore indifferent to those living in poverty. This, my friends, is a non sequitur. At the same time, Rangel further implies that welfare state programs are the only programs that exist in the United States that could possibly lift poor people out of poverty. Not true. In fact, fifty years of empirical evidence suggests that the “Great Society” programs championed by LBJ and the intelligentsia (the very ones Rangel’s seems to be advocating for here) have actually hindered progress.

"Beneficial mutation" - the basis for evolution - involving multiple concurrent changes in genetic material in both the male and the female has never been demonstrated. The sequence of millions of beneficial mutations to arrive at anything that we might recognize is a statistical improbability – without some sort of intelligent controlling designer. And mutations are not generally tolerated by the birthing parents (of any species). 2. The premise of evolution is the antithesis of believing in the Bible account. If man evolved then sin did not start with “one man” (Adam). Without the introduction of sin and falling from grace, Jesus did not, it could be argued, die for everyone – or anyone. It is a matter of faith. If the Son of God did not die for everyone, then what did He did for? So, embracing evolution of man is equivalent to denying the work and purpose of Jesus. 3. The term “fossil fuel” is attributed to the notion that somehow biomass material was trapped instantaneously under 1 to 3 miles of earth and then became oil under heat and pressure over time. There is no likely scenario and there is no evidence to support such a premise. Yet, every celestial body in the solar system contains methane – which is the building block of products like oil – without the benefit of Fred Flinstone and Dino. It is not that there were no dinosaurs, it is that oil occurring naturally, “abiotic”, is more likely than being a product of “fossils”. 4. God is in control. And if man, in obeying His command to be “fruitful and multiply”, is causing global warming, then God will make whatever adjustments are necessary. He is laughing at all of the global warmers right now who cannot understand the flat temperatures over the past fifteen years. And the sun is at such a low ebb of solar activity that there is instead worry of an ice age (like from 1645 to 1715). The most important point is that God is in control. Period. Those that do not believe that live in fear.

(John 14:6). We can look at Islam, as an example, and see what it says: Jesus was NOT the Son of God, Jesus was NOT crucified and rose from the dead, etc. So, Muslims may believe in "a God", but not the God of the Bible. And the Bible says that there is only one God. The Bible says that God is "not the author of confusion" and He cannot lie. So, take your pick: the Koran or the Bible. The Koran is the singular work over the course of about a decade of one man who says he received a revelation from an angel (sound familiar?) - there were no witnesses. The Bible is the work of 40+ authors, consisting of 66 books, written over 1400 years, and has multiple testimonies of the same events. And it is self-consistent. The Koran contradicts itself and Mohammad simply wrote that the later verse, when two or more disagree, shall take precedence - like God cannot make up His mind. I would say that anything other than the Bible is wrong. Where would you place your faith and trust?

Is it possible for God to tell two completely different "truths"? If He tells two completely different things - each being the opposite of the other - is not one of them a lie? And, as the Bible says, God cannot lie. Therefore, the Bible and the Koran cannot both be true. In that vein, I can only conclude that one witness is false. Therefore, whatever the Muslims are worshiping is NOT the God of the Bible. If there is ONLY one God, therefore, the Muslims worship nothing.

From that, I am to understand that Jefferson was enamored with Jesus as a "good" person and teacher, but he rejected anything beyond that. In a way, you are doing the same. You embrace that Jesus is the path for you to God, yet you apparently have rejected some of those truths that point to His unique and exclusive message - like John 14:6 that He is the "only way to the Father". He also said, "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it." (Matthew 7:13,14) I am not trying to "vex" you but challenge you to consider the larger meaning of what He said relative to belief. If you believe what Jesus is saying, all 1.2 billion Muslims (as well as all other nonbelievers) are on the road to destruction - since they reject Jesus as the Son of God (John 3:18).

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) hopes that by shutting down the government he can convince Democrats to defund it. Speaker John Boehner hopes that by threatening to breach the debt ceiling he can convince Democrats to delay it. If that fails, top Republicans quietly think they may be able to get Democrats to compromise on delaying the individual mandate. Republicans do have a theory as to why Democrats will ultimately agree to some of this. Obamacare is unpopular. A lot of Democrats are up for reelection in 2014. In the end, they'll see a delay of the whole thing, or at least of the individual mandate, as a gift. The Obama administration may complain, but when vulnerable Senate Democrats begin voting with the Republicans, they'll quickly cave. Senate Democrats find this logic baffling. "We're dumb," says an aide to a moderate Senate Democrat. "But we're not that dumb." Congressional Democrats are realists on Obamacare. It's not popular now. They don't expect it to be popular by the 2014 election. But they know they own it. "Our members are not going to become clean on Obamacare if they take one different vote now and they won’t become culpable on Obamacare if they take one different now.," says a senior aide to the Senate Democratic leadership. "I don’t see us having a Saul on the road to Damascus change of mind on health-care reform." But it's the specifics of the GOP's pitch that really amuse Democrats. The argument they're making might make sense for repeal, but a one-year delay in Obamacare would just mean that implementation begins in October 2014 -- which is to say, one month before the 2014 election. That's supposed to help Democrats in the election? Democrats point out that Obamacare's implementation schedule wasn't an accident. It was purposefully designed to begin in an off-year. That way there would be a year to work out the worst kinks, and by the time of the actual election, Democrats could point to millions of people getting insurance, running ad after ad highlighting constituents who now have coverage. If implementation didn't begin until October 2014, all voters would know about Obamacare would be the early glitches, as insurance coverage wouldn't begin until January 1, 2015. In other words, the GOP is trying to sell Democrats on a political nightmare they specifically wrote the law to avoid -- and they're doing so on the grounds that it would actually be a political boon! The individual mandate "compromise" is also looked on with some derision. Republicans assume that it will be attractive to Democrats because the policy is unpopular. But they haven't thought through the way the law works. "If you were to delay just the individual mandate, the premiums would jump much higher," says Rep. Chris Van Hollen. "That would sabotage the entire purpose of the exchange." Democrats would be left trying to protect a law where premiums are skyrocketing and insurers are pulling out. They would've traded an unpopular policy that won't actually impose any penalties until 2015 for a complete disaster in 2014. "They think Obamacare is in play," says the Democratic leadership aide. "We don’t. We just take it for granted we’re not going to fundamentally change Obamacare." Moreover, Democrats see a real silver lining in the GOP's obstruction. The American people don't like Obamacare. But they dislike the Republican Party's kill-it-at-all-costs strategy even more. AAES-defund-health-care-law According to a CNBC poll, the public opposes defunding Obamacare 44-38 percent. They oppose shutting down the government to defund Obamacare 59-19 percent. Republican brinksmanship takes defunding Obamacare from a slight political loser to an overwhelming political disaster. Democrats know they own Obamacare. They can't get away from that. But they figure their chances in 2014 are substantially improved if Republicans own a shutdown -- or, worse, a default. Democrats used to hope that Obamacare would help them in the 2014 election by being popular, but now they think it might help them by driving the GOP so crazy that the American people simply don't trust them to govern.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380063607436</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 19:00:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380063702850-180</Id><Topic><Title>Same lattitude of Seoul S.

The 27-year-old thief, who family identified as Blake Moore, and his girlfriend were already driving a stolen Honda with stolen plates when they pulled up to a home in the 21800 block of SE 236th Place just after midnight, deputies said. As the man then began breaking into a pickup truck, the truck's owner came out to walk his dog and confronted the thief, according to investigators. Guns were drawn, and several shots were fired. The thief ducked behind the truck he was trying to steal, but was still struck several times and died at the scene, deputies said. The truck owner's aunt hailed her nephew, who is a former Marine, as a hero for saving her life as the bullets began flying. "He shoved me out of the way when the guy was going to shoot at us," said Kristen Hague. "Looked like (the thief) had a gun and pushed me out of the way and yelled 'gun!' and I don't think if he would have done that, I would be alive... I think he was defending me -- I totally see it." She said her nephew was definitely justified in fatally wounding the thief. "My life was in danger; my nephew's life was in danger, and he did the right thing even though it ended really bad and really sad," Hague said. She said despite the thief's attempt to shoot them, she went to his side and did CPR until medics could arrive. "There was a guy on the ground dying and it was instinct and...I just went in and started doing compression on his chests...until help got there," Hague said. "It was all I could do." Detectives say they recovered at least two weapons from the scene -- a .45 caliber apparently used by the thief and a 9 millimeter from the man who shot the suspect. His alleged accomplice was arrested and police say she had a felony warrant for burglary.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1380073948199</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 21:52:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380074035208-224</Id><Topic><Title>Why are certain posters allowed to copy articles and paste and others can't give an opinion</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1380070869616</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 21:01:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank-you I will try that avenue.
