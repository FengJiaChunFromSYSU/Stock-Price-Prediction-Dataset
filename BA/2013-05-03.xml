The Obama administration has asked its allies in Congress to introduce legislation that would permit the feds to continue their march through the Fourth Amendment when it comes to obtaining private information about all of us. The Fourth Amendment, which guarantees the right to be left alone, was written largely in response to legislation Parliament enacted in the colonial era that permitted British soldiers to write their own search warrants and then use those warrants as a legal basis to enter private homes. The ostensible purpose of doing that was to search through the colonists' papers looking for stamps, which the Stamp Act required the colonists to affix to all documents in their possession. The laws that permitted the soldier-written search warrants and the Stamp Act were the British government's fatal political mistakes, which arguably caused a major shift in colonial opinion toward secession from Britain 10 years before the bloody part of the Revolution began. After the Founders won the Revolution, the Framers wrote the Constitution in large measure to assure that the new government in America would not and could not do to Americans what the king had done to the colonists. Hence the Fourth Amendment's requirement that only judges issue search warrants and only after the governmental agency seeking the warrants presents evidence under oath of probable cause of crime.

The Patriot Act--written in defiance of the Constitution and in ignorance of our history--permits federal agents to write their own search warrants, just as the king and Parliament had permitted British soldiers to do. Those agent-written search warrants are intended to be limited to the search for evidence of terror plots and are theoretically limited to the seizure of physical records in the custody of third parties, like lawyers, doctors, hospitals, billing clerks, telephone and Internet carriers, and even the Post Office. (Did you know that federal agents can see your mail and your legal and medical records without permission from a judge?) This abominable piece of legislation sacrificed freedom for safety and enhanced neither. Now the feds want even more personal liberty sacrificed--this time to make it easier for them to collect digital information. Talk Radio News Service / photo on flickrTalk Radio News Service / photo on flickrThe Obama administration wants legislation enacted that will punish Internet service providers who fail to cooperate with FBI requests and court orders. The FBI has revealed that its agents often "lack the time" to obtain search warrants, and so they have gotten into the bad habit of asking Internet service providers to let them in without warrants. This was notoriously done in the Bush-era, during which the feds promised immunity to telephone service providers that enabled the feds to spy on their customers. That spying was criminal and gave rise to civil causes of action for damages, as well, until Congress changed the law retroactively and granted the promised immunity after the Bush administration spying was exposed.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367580065143</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 07:21:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367580081604-29</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's continued Assault on the Fourth Amendment</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367579987980</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 07:19:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some telephone providers declined the government requests then, and some Internet providers decline these requests today. Hence, the proposed legislation would punish those providers who protect the privacy of their customers by telling the FBI to go home. The second category of punishment sought by the administration is for Internet service providers as to which the FBI has obtained a warrant. A search warrant typically authorizes the government to enter private premises and look for the specific items designated in the warrant. But it does not require the custodian of those specific items to find them for the government. This proposed legislation would change all that. The government has subtly revealed that when it comes to digital data it often does not know what it is looking for, and its agents lack the skills to hook into the Internet providers' systems. This raises another set of questions, likely to escape members of Congress as they examine this latest assault on the Fourth Amendment. The Framers were very careful when they wrote the Fourth Amendment, as it imposes the most explicit requirements on the government found anywhere in the Constitution. It requires that all search warrants "particularly describ(e) the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." So, if the government follows the Constitution, it cannot seek what it is unable to identify, and it cannot compel the custodian of whatever records it is seeking to do its work for it. Until now. If enacted, the proposed legislation will punish those Internet service providers that fail to share secrets with the feds. The Obama administration hopes the legislation, if enacted, will enable the feds to set up a system that will let them tap into Internet service providers' data directly from FBI offices, without having to serve the warrant or visit the Internet providers' premises. What a temptation for abuse that will become. It will compel data sharing between the government and Internet service providers that will eviscerate what little remains of personal email privacy. It will profoundly violate the Fourth Amendment by turning employees of Internet service providers into de facto unpaid federal agents. And it will punish all those who decline to go along with this with crippling fines that double every day. Wasn't the Constitution written to keep the government off the backs of the people? Does the government work for us, or do we work for the government?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367580081604</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 07:21:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367580213025-30</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's continued Assault on the Fourth Amendment</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367579987980</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 07:19:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The previous was written by Judge Napalotono ... a NOTED Constitutional expert...and a patriot</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367580213025</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 07:23:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367581610132-31</Id><Title>They Are Murdering Small Business: The Percentage Of Self-Employed Americans Is At A Record Low</Title><Msg>They Are Murdering Small Business: The Percentage Of Self-Employed Americans Is At A Record Low Michael Snyder Economic Collapse May 3, 2013 The percentage of Americans that are working for themselves has never been lower in the history of the United States. Once upon a time, the United States was a paradise for entrepreneurs and small businesses, but now the control freak bureaucrats that dominate our society have created a system that absolutely eviscerates them. This is very unfortunate, because by murdering small business, the bureaucrats are destroying the primary engine of job growth in this country. One of the big reasons why there are not enough jobs in America today is because small business creation is way down. As I mentioned yesterday, entrepreneurs and small businesses are being absolutely devastated by rules, regulations, red tape and by oppressive levels of taxation. If anyone doubts that small business in the United States is dying, just look at the charts below. Sadly, this is what the bureaucrats that run things want. They don’t want us to be independent of the system. Instead, they are much more comfortable when as many of us as possible are heavily dependent on the system in one way or another. If all of us have to go running to the government or to one of the big corporations for a job, then we are much easier to control. But as the control freaks continue to construct their bureaucratic utopia, they are also killing off what once made the U.S. economy so great.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367581610132</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 07:46:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367582867715-32</Id><Title>U.S. transport plane crashes in Central Asia</Title><Msg>U.S. transport plane crashes in Central Asia</Msg><Username>jpmhedgefund</Username><Timestamp>1367582867715</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 08:07:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367583551054-33</Id><Topic><Title>Multiple Obama Birth Certificates Surface In Alabama Eligibility Case</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367466091224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chrissie Gemma and his aliases must think so, look how OBSESSED he is with your posts.

Here's the Senate Majority Leader trying to lay the Obamacare "train wreck" at the feet of a party that didn't cast a single vote for the law, in the context of demanding more funding for the multi-trillion-dollar behemoth: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) says he shares colleagues’ concerns that the Affordable Care Act could become a “train wreck” if it’s not implemented properly. Reid warned that people will not be able to choose health insurance plans on government health exchanges if federal authorities lack the resources to set them up and educate the public. “Max said unless we implement this properly it’s going to be a train wreck, and I agree with him,” Reid said, echoing a warning delivered last month by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.). Reid warned the federal government is not spending enough money to implement the law because of Republican opposition to ObamaCare. “Here’s what we have now, we have the menu but we don’t have any way to get to the menu,” Reid said. “The president is taking money — I wish we had the money just to do this on its own, but he’s agreed, he’s determined he’s going to take money from some of the other things that he feels are less important in the healthcare bill and put it on letting you and others know what’s in the bill,” Reid [said]. Where to begin? First, notice how these problems are never, ever the fault of the disastrous law itself. No, it's always the Republicans' fault -- or the public's, for not properly understanding how great the new program really is. President Obama effectively advanced the latter argument at his Tuesday press conference: Ninety percent of you rubes are already enjoying the wonders of my munificence, even if you're too dense to realize it. Thus, now we're back to Democrats lamenting their inability to "tell better stories" or whatever, even though they've had the presidential bully pulpit for five years, and a generally pliant media running interference for them. We're informed that a law whose price tag has already doubled -- and is likely to rise even further -- requires additional taxpayer dollars to finance yet another PR campaign for itself. But weren't Obamacare's provisions going to convince us all, just as soon as it was fully implemented? Lower premiums! Reduced deficits! Cost curve down! Keep your plan! Plenty of doctors! None of that is actually happening, though, so the only conceivable solution is to appropriate more money to temporarily prop up public perceptions for awhile. "Re-education" funds, as Kathleen Sebelius might call them. Nevertheless, no amount of slick advertising can erase what even elected Democrats and mainstream journalists can see with their own two eyes. (Part-time worker? Sorry, bud). Empirical results are almost irrelevant to the party of "science."</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1367586240795</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 09:04:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367586788380-38</Id><Title>A hot-off-the-presses landmark study on Medicaid</Title><Msg>....the results of which are devastating to government healthcare cheerleaders: In 2008, Oregon expanded its Medicaid program, but because the state could not cover everybody, lawmakers opened up a lottery that randomly drew 30,000 names from a waiting list of almost 90,000 and allowed them to apply for the program. This created a unique opportunity for health researchers, ultimately allowing them to compare the health outcomes of 6,387 low-income adults who were able to enroll in the program with 5,842 who were not selected. Contrary to liberal assumptions, researchers found that those who enrolled in Medicaid spent a lot more on medical care than those who weren’t able to enroll, but didn’t significantly improve their health outcomes. Specifically, researchers found that those who received Medicaid increased their annual health care spending by $1,172, or 35 percent more than those who did not receive Medicaid. Those with Medicaid were more likely to be screened for diabetes and use diabetes medication and to make use of other preventive care measures. The study also examined health metrics including blood pressure and cholesterol. Ultimately, the authors concluded that, “This randomized, controlled study showed that Medicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured health outcomes in the first two years... In a sane political world populated by quasi-rational actors, this research would be a true game-changer. Here we have solid, methodologically-sound evidence that an enormously expensive government program -- Medicaid -- is failing to improve health outcomes for low income Americans, compared to being uninsured. Which is the entire point of the program. It turns out that Medicaid recipients also aren't cutting down on hospital and emergency room visits, another favored talking point for universal coverage. The primary difference between beneficiaries and their uninsured counterparts is that the former group uses healthcare services more, thus raising expenditures. One of this study's co-authors just happens to be a key designer of Obamacare (MIT's Jon Gruber), so this can't be written off some right-wing hatchet job, either. The new program Gruber helped create calls for the massive expansion (by 11 million people) of an old program that Gruber has now determined doesn't work. Ta-da! Liberal activists and journalists, meanwhile, are feverishly churning out copy to distort the results and salvage what they can from this catastrophic blow. Be sure to check out Avik Roy's must-read piece that methodically rebuts apologists' straw-grasping. But will this data earthquake impact actual policy one wit? I'm afraid Allahpundit may be right: Righty wonks are treating this like a bombshell insofar as it might halt Democratic efforts to expand Medicaid under ObamaCare, but I don’t know. It might give confidence to Republicans in purple states, but the blue states will plow ahead. If they did ten more studies confirming this result, those would all be spun away too. This is an “identity” issue for Democrats — they’ll fight to protect the welfare state, whether it works or not, whether we can afford it or not — and as with abortion (or guns on the right), they won’t cede an inch on “slippery slope” grounds. Even if they were convinced that Medicaid isn’t worth the expense, they won’t relinquish a key political bludgeon against the right. Celebrate the result as a win for truth, but not because policy’s likely to shift dramatically. Ultimately, the "party of ideas" is about one idea: Statism. The inefficacy of government programs -- no matter how thoroughly demonstrated -- simply isn't enough to pull the plug (eg: Head Start, the unkillable federal Helium Project, etc). Which is why it'll be full speed ahead on Medicaid expansion in blue (and some red) states, amidst calls to spend millions more on applying lipstick to the Obamacare pig. It's for our own good, you see; we just don't understand well enough yet.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1367586788380</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 09:13:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367588514772-39</Id><Topic><Title>White House Schedule</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363270937569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 10:22:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the president took his appeal for more mexicans to mexico yesterday. his staffers, err lackeys, are still waiting to see what our transformative mooch n chief wants to do today... yesterday (the formal schedule).... 10:15 AM The President makes a personnel announcement 10:45 AM The President departs the White House en route Joint Base Andrews 11:00 AM The President departs Joint Base Andrews en route Mexico City, Mexico 1:00 PM The Vice President meets with law enforcement officials at the White House to discuss gun safety 3:15 PM The President arrives Mexico City, Mexico 4:05 PM The President and President Peña Nieto of Mexico hold a bilateral meeting 5:10 PM The President and President Peña Nieto of Mexico hold a press conference 6:35 PM The President meets and greets with United States Embassy personnel 8:15 PM The President and President Peña Nieto of Mexico meet for a working dinner</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367588514772</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 09:41:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367588546524-40</Id><Title>WAAAAYNEDIIICK...U OK? 52 WEEK HIGH! $ 93.40+</Title><Msg>....get ready, more to come...triple digit stock by the end of the quarter ! grrrrrrrrr!

However, the Obama Administration was warned three times - twice by the Soviets and once by the Saudis - about the Tsarnaev brothers. And the Obama Administration ignored what were matter-of-fact, out in the open warning signs. Anyone who believes that Obama cares about the safety of this nation has not considered the implications of its actions or inactions relative to: Benghazi, Fort Hood, Libya, Egypt, Times Square, and now Boston. The only reason Times Square (2010) was not now the second of three fully successful direct terror attacks against the United States, post-9-11, was because the bomb wound up being a dud. Otherwise, Obama actually failed to uncover that one as well. So, what then is the purpose of Obama's penchant for intrusion into American's privacy - if it is not actually to protect Americans? Obama's stated goal was to "transform America". Bush's was to protect it. Despite Bush’s and the nation's collective failure in the realm of safety against terrorism in September of 2001, Bush did not fail the remaining 7 years thereafter of his administration. Obama has now failed: on year one (2009 Ft. Hood massacre), year two (2010 Times Square bombing), year three (2011 forced Egypt to abdicate to radical Muslim brotherhood and turned Libya over to radical elements including al Qaeda), year four (2012, attack on consulate in Benghazi), and year five (2013, Boston marathon bombing).

In April, the total number of Americans counted as "not in the labor force" declined for the first time since December, but that number was still near a record high at 89,936,000. Those not in the labor force declined by 31,000, from a record high of 89,967,000 in March. That broke the recent record of 89,304,000 not in the labor force in February of this year. Since February 2009, the first full month of Obama’s presidency, 9,549,000 people have left the labor force. There were 80,387,000 Americans not working that month, compared with 89,936,000 not working or looking today, according to the latest economic release from BLS. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) labels people who are unemployed and no longer looking for work as “not in the labor force,”and that includes people who have retired on schedule, taken early retirement, or simply given up looking for work.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1367598401723</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 12:26:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367598564511-60</Id><Title>Obama's Appoval Rating Sinks</Title><Msg>Presidential Tracking Poll for Friday shows that 45% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Obama's job performance.

I find that the local level people in politics that run for unpaid offices are the most honest and genuinely interested people and think the US should consider restructuring our government to get better representation. If you don't have millions or billions of dollars you can't get elected. It has become all about influence pedaling and the Chicago Way political model.

One of those arguments is: capitalism benefits the rich more than it benefits the common man. Let's look at it. The rich have always had access to entertainment, and some times in the comfort of their palaces and mansions. The rich have never had to experience the drudgery of having to beat out carpets, iron their clothing or slave over a hot stove all day in order to have a decent dinner; they could afford to hire people. Today, the common man has the power to enjoy much of what only the rich could yesteryear. Capitalism's mass production have made radios and televisions, vacuum cleaners, wash-and-wear clothing and microwave ovens available and well within the reach of the common man; thus, sparing him of the drudgery of the past. What about those who became wealthy making comforts available to the common man? Henry Ford benefitted immensely from mass producing automobiles but the benefit for the common man, from being able to buy a car, dwarfs anything Ford received. Individual discovers and companies who produced penicillin, polio and typhoid vaccines may have become wealthy but again it was the common man who was the major beneficiary. In more recent times, computers and software products have impacted our health, safety and life quality in a way that dwarfs the wealth received by their creators. Here's a little test. Stand on the corner and watch people walk or drive by. Then, based on their appearances, identify which persons are wealthy. Years ago, it wouldn't have been that hard. The ordinary person wouldn't be dressed as well, surely not wearing designer clothing, nor would they have nice looking jewellery plus, they wouldn't be driving by. Compare the income status of today's airline passengers with those of yesterday; you'll find a greater percentage of ordinary people. That's one of the great benefits of capitalism; it has made it possible for common people to enjoy at least some of what wealthy people enjoy. You say, "Williams, common people don't have access to Rolls Royces and yachts!" You're wrong. Microsoft's Bill Gates is super-rich and can afford to ride in a Rolls Royce and go yachting sailing; so can Williams - just not as long. I can rent a Rolls or a yacht for a day, half-day or an hour. Capitalism is relatively new in human history. Prior to capitalism, the way people amassed great wealth was by looting, plundering and enslaving their fellow man. Capitalism made it possible to become wealthy by serving your fellow man. Capitalists seek to find what people want and produce and market it as efficiently as possible. Here's a question for us: are people who by their actions create unprecedented convenience, longer life expectancy and more fun available to the ordinary person, and become wealthy in the process, deserving of all the scorn and ridicule heaped upon them by intellectuals and politicians? Are the wealthy obliged to "give something back?" For example, what more do the wealthy discoverers and producers of life-saving antibiotics owe us? They've already saved lives and made us healthier. Despite the miracles of capitalism, it doesn't do well in popularity polls. One of the reasons is that capitalism is always evaluated against the non-existent utopias of socialism or communism. Any earthly system pales in comparison to utopias. But for the ordinary person, capitalism, with all of its warts, is superior to any system yet devised to deal with our everyday needs and desires.

First Vice President James Porter will take over the top job Monday. On Friday, he gave short speech to a grassroots organizing meeting at the powerful gun lobby's national convention in Houston. "This is not a battle about gun rights," Porter said, calling it "a culture war." "(You) here in this room are the fighters for freedom. We are the protectors," said Porter, whose father was NRA president from 1959-1960, according to the organization's website. The NRA is fresh off a huge victory over President Barack Obama on gun control, defeating a U.S. Senate vote on a major gun control bill that was introduced after December's mass shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school. Organizers anticipated a rollicking, Texas-sized party — both to celebrate the victory in Washington and recharge for more political struggles as gun control advocates tally their own successes in states around the country. More than 70,000 people are expected to attend the three-day "Stand and Fight"-themed convention, which includes a gun trade show, political rally and strategy meeting.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1367605507697</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 14:25:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367605932019-68</Id><Topic><Title>Multiple Obama Birth Certificates Surface In Alabama Eligibility Case</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367466091224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We all know your motto Spart: "I'd rather fave a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy."</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1367605932019</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 14:32:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367606036096-69</Id><Topic><Title>Markets Hitting Highs, Consumer Data Great...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367605123954</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 14:18:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Barry is at 2.5% GDP and at this exact same time in his presidency Regan was at 5.6%.

Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said last year, "If (former President) Bill Clinton had been in the White House and had failed to address this problem, we probably would be marching on the White House."

Black unemployment is now 14.1 percent. Black teenage unemployment at the beginning of the Obama administration was 35.2 percent. Black teenage unemployment is now 37.9 percent. Last month, Cleaver said: "As the chair of the Black Caucus, I've got to tell you, we are always hesitant to criticize the President.

Go to the "historical prices" tab in BA Yahoo. Enter start dates from about Feb1, 2009 to end dates of about April 30, 2009. You will see that the bottom of 29.36 accured on March 3, 2009 for a gain of 213 percent to today's 92. My earlier post used the April 20, 2009 value of 36.48 to get the 4 year gain of about 150 percent. My math says 150 percent for 4 years is better than Airbus 127 percent gain in 5 years. It's OK to admit you make a mistake once in a while. You probably shouldn't call someone a liar until you have checked the facts." Also, I posted on 3/22/2013 (after the market closed, you know like 1:00 PM Pacifc Time) that TOPS was up 34 percent that day. I didn't tell the board beforehand if I had bought it and wouldn't tell the board if and when I might sell it. See how easy that is.

Investors Business Daily Empty Boast: As we have noted before in our Issues &amp; Insights pages, President Obama has taken credit for an energy boom he had nothing to do with. A government agency now confirms what many have known to be true. The Congressional Research Service has released a report, "U.S. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production in Federal and Non-Federal Areas," that corroborates what we've said. "All of the increase (in oil and natural gas production) from FY2007 to FY2012 took place on non-federal lands, and the federal share of total U.S. crude oil production fell by about seven percentage points," writes Marc Humphries, the government specialist in energy policy who authored the report. During this period, oil production on federal land fell from nearly 1.7 million barrels a day to 1.6 million. At the same time, the share of overall production on federal lands shriveled from 33% to 26%. The difference is found in offshore production. Onshore production actually increased modestly from 2007 to 2012, but offshore dropped from 1.4 million barrels a day to 1.3 million. The story is similar with gas. Production on federal land decreased from 5.5 trillion cubic feet to 3.7 trillion cubic feet. The federal share collapsed from 27.8% to 15.5% of the total. In the case of gas, both onshore and offshore output on federal land have fallen, with offshore tumbling 50%. Meanwhile, private output booms. Oil production on non-federal land grew from 3.4 million barrels a day to 4.6 million and gas rose from 14.4 trillion cubic feet to 20.2 trillion. The good times won't go on forever, though, as long as Washington insists on a close-fisted energy policy. About 43% of all domestic crude reserves are on federal land. Roughly 28% of the gas is under the federal boot.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367612086287</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 16:14:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367612093888-94</Id><Topic><Title>23 of tthe 25 most dangerous neighborhoods in America are Repesented by Black Democrats</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367609351872</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:29:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is no money to be made by anybody so it is ignored just like a majority of your posts. walk into a school in suburbia and shoot up some children and all parties will profit accordingly</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1367612093888</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 16:14:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367612651975-95</Id><Topic><Title>23 of tthe 25 most dangerous neighborhoods in America are Repesented by Black Democrats</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367609351872</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:29:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So you think blacks are killing blacks in gang shoot-outs because there's no money in shooting up innocent school children in their inter city ghetto schools?

Considering Schumer's role as Senate Democrats' chief messaging guru, this is big. Still, I feel compelled to deconstruct his Obamacare goalpost shifting, which is now par for the course on the Left, out of necessity. The first part of his answer is all about coercive government price controls. In short, Obamacare places all sorts of costly mandates on private insurers. To comply with said mandates, insurers raise premiums in order to stay in business. Then "insurance departments" step in and veto the hikes, in order to "protect families." Lawsuits, disruptions, and an exodus from the market ensues.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367619492762</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 18:18:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367619744721-116</Id><Topic><Title>chrisgenna is confused.</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367619243293</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 18:14:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hes not confused...just a falming hypocrite</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367619744721</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 18:22:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367619760661-117</Id><Title>The 747 nothing beats it like the new MD like mismangment</Title><Msg>Boeing loses 747-8 sales, defers deliveries of newest jumbo jet Boeing lost an order for five 747-8 freighters and has deferred deliveries to other customers in a depressed air-cargo market.

If your front door is suddenly kicked in at 3:00 a.m. and criminals rushed into your house, would you know exactly what to do? Jason R. Hanson, a former CIA officer and owner and founder of the Concealed Carry Academy, has shown men and women all over the nation how to protect their families from a deadly home invasion, safely handle a firearm and carry a concealed handgun in 35 states. “There are few things in life as important as being able to protect yourself and your loved ones,” Hanson told Townhall. “A police officer, if you are lucky, will get to your house in nine minutes. If there is a home invasion or any attack, nine minutes can be very quick. In some other places, it may take half an hour or more. Since the police officers can’t be there to save you, we have got to protect ourselves, and a gun is the best way to do it.” Hanson spent six years with the CIA and was trained in almost every self-defense skill ranging from shooting to evasive driving. As a CIA officer, he says, he took his self-defense training and knowledge for granted, only later realizing how many people lack basic understanding of how to defend themselves. “I realized there was a huge need to share with people my CIA ‘secrets’ so they could protect themselves and their loved ones in these unstable times,” he said. He eventually founded the Concealed Carry Academy, which specializes in concealed carry training.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367622658176</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 19:10:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367623359466-136</Id><Topic><Title>To Democrats It's the color of skin not the Content of Character that matters</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1367606360259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 14:39:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmmm, I'll have to ponder on that for a while, Chris.

This gives me a great Segue into refuting your post. In your post the great philosopher Karl Popper believes that all conspiracy theories or all theories in general are non scientific by definition because they cannot be disproved. HOWEVER..... Isnt the Governments story about 19 Saudi Muslims with boxcutters taking over an airplane ALSO and IN ITSELF a conspiracy theory ? Or to look at this another way lets shift the burden of proof and, lets argue that the Governments account of the Kennedy assassination set forth in the Warren report is ITSELF a mere theory. Isnt that in fact true ? Were any members of the Warren Commission in Dallas on Nvov 22 1963 to witness the event ? Didn't the Warren commissions own statements hinge on a dubious theory about a single bullet causing 5 wounds in 2 individuals ? Isnt the Governments version of events on 9-11 merely a theory ? If it were a verifiable fact wouldn't black boxes be found ? ...... A conspiracy theory as distinct from the "official" version can only be called a conspiracy theory if it is advanced by a skeptic and there is the rub. If people suspected of wrong doing are on the inside their explanation of what happened, however implausible cannot be a theory and therefore isn't subject to Karl Poppers test. of theories .</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367624239012</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 19:37:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367624528186-141</Id><Topic><Title>To Democrats It's the color of skin not the Content of Character that matters</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1367606360259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 14:39:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I knew that already!

Instead, President Obama never mentioned Fast and Furious or his administration’s role in the violence that haunts Americans and Mexicans near the border. The investigation of the ATF operation that resulted in hundreds of deaths in Mexico and the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry has been stonewalled by officials within the Obama Administration, but documents show that the ATF tried to use the operation to make the case for stricter gun regulation.

You come to this site, because you get explanations that are not agenda-driven, that are not BS, that are not right-wing or left-wing, conservative or liberal, Republican or Democrat. You get explanations based on my lifetime of unique education and experience. Some of you are young enough to be equipped with the energy and courage to organize whatever resistance there may be to the Gestapo State that is descending on the United States of America. This is your site. Support it. Until the George W. Bush Regime, I never thought that it could happen here. I could not imagine law professors and Department of Justice (sic) officials writing legal memos justifying, in the name of a hyped “war on terror,” the termination of civil rights for United States Citizens. We were the land of the free. The Constitution was our bedrock. Yet, the Constitution and Bill of Rights were easily taken away from the inattentive American people. The Constitution did not protect native inhabitants and slaves who were not considered part of the American population, but the universal suppression in the US of non-whites’ rights produced in the end the civil rights movement that brought moral awareness of the wrongs and successfully hitched its cause to the founding documents of the country. Where today is moral awareness as Washington bombs civilian populations around the globe? Where is the moral conscience of the the civil rights movement as the First Black President, the first member of the oppressed class to sit in the Oval Office, validates the Bush Regime’s assertion of the right of the unaccountable executive to ignore habeas corpus and due process?

Anything, including a column critical of war and the police state, can be declared to be “in support of terrorism.” As the tyrant Bush put it: “You are with us, or you are against us.” The print and TV media and many Internet sites got the message: Serve Washington’s agenda, and will you will prosper. Advertisers and the CIA will pump money into your coffers. Challenge us and you will be demonized and could face a military tribunal, indefinite detention, or assassination. Bradley Manning and Julian Assange are being persecuted for telling the truth. So far, Washington has convinced the public that Washington’s terror is mainly limited to Muslims, who are obligingly demonized by print, TV, and much of the Internet media. However, if Muslim American citizens lack civil liberty, so do all other American citizens. Those who are safe are those who ally with the tyrant and remain subservient. To ally with the tyrant, a United States citizen must have no moral conscience, no sense of justice, no compassion for the innocent and dispossessed. These are the worst kind of Americans; yet, they are the only ones who can succeed in the present environment. Every time I write a column that is the truth or the truth as I am able to discover it, instead of hawking the propaganda line, I move up on the list of those who are persona non grata in the Empire. A writer can find himself demonized and declared a kook simply by reporting findings from distinguished scientists, high-rise architects, structural engineers, first responders, and an international collection of high government officials. Not too long ago a writer or reporter for the Huffington Post discovered to his surprise that Pat Buchanan and I disagreed with all the wars that had been launched to protect us from terrorism. He asked me for an interview, and I agreed.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367627564013</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:32:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367627590442-154</Id><Topic><Title>YOU ARE THE HOPE !!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367627494445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An hour or so after the interview was posted on the Huffington Post, I received an emergency call or email. He had been criticized for interviewing me, “for giving you a forum when you are a 9/11 sceptic.” He was unsure that it was possible for a Reagan presidential appointee to be a 9/11 sceptic and asked if I was. I replied that I had reported the findings of scientists, architects, engineers, and the public testimony of first responders, because I thought these were qualified people whose opinions at least ranked equally with the politicians on the 9/11 Commission and the talking heads on Fox “News” and CNN, none of whom could pass a high school test in the laws of physics, much less high-rise architecture and structural engineering. The Huffington Post writer panicked. Instead of taking down the interview, he felt impelled to assure readers and his boss that he had been deceived. He wrote at the beginning and ending of the interview that he did not know he was interviewing someone about the Iraq War who had given ink to those conspiracy theorists who raised questions about the truthfulness of the US government. He wrote that my views on the wars should be disregarded, because I wrote that scientists, architects, engineers, and first responders provided evidence contrary to the government’s claims. And there you have it. The Huffington Post has far more readers than I do, and far more money. There is no limit on the ability of the Huffington Post to tell and sell the lies of the Agenda. I can remember when I was a Wall Street Journal editor and columnist, a Business Week columnist, a Scripps Howard News Service columnist and appeared regularly in the major mainstream print media and even from time to time on TV talking head programs. Today, the editor or producer who gave me a forum would be fired instantly, and they all know it. It is discouraging that after so many transparent lies and orchestrations–weapons of mass destruction, al-Qaeda connections, Iranian nukes–the majority of Americans still believe the government. Americans are even buying into the line that Syria is ruled by a brutal dictator whose overthrow justifies Washington’s alliance with its 9/11 enemy, al-Qaeda, in order to overthrow a secular ruler who constrains al-Qaeda. Washington has come full circle. Its enemy is now its ally. Washington wasted trillions of dollars and countless lives in eleven years of war and constructed a domestic police state all in order to combat al Qaeda with whom Washington is now allied against the Syrian government.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367627590442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:33:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367627621488-155</Id><Topic><Title>YOU ARE THE HOPE !!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367627494445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The public’s response to the Boston Marathon Bombing is even more discouraging. Not even King George and his Redcoats could achieve what Homeland Security just pulled off–locking down 100 square miles of Boston and its suburbs with heavily armed troops tramping through citizens’ homes barking harsh orders, all justified by a hunt for one 19-year old suspect. It was the Third Reich’s Gestapo in operation right here in “freedom and democracy” America. Ron Paul is correct that the suspension of civil liberty is a greater threat than the bombing. Note the government’s euphemism for martial law–”shelter-in-place.” Two brothers have been convicted in the media and by the Obama Regime, including the president’s own words, of a bombing without the public ever being presented with any evidence except anonymous unattributed reports and a film of the alleged brothers walking with backpacks, which were ubiquitous. I am old enough to remember when it was impermissible for government and media to convict a person prior to the jury’s verdict. Americans once lived in a free country governed by the rule of law in which a person was innocent until proven guilty. What was the reason or evidence for naming the brothers suspects? Was any reason given, or was the film of the two walking with backpacks simply shown over and over, hour after hour, day after day, with the media reporting that these are the suspects. In other words, was it beat into your brain that they were suspects because there they are in the film? If not, why was the same film shown repeatedly? Fox “News” was still showing the film on April 26, eleven days after the bombing and might still be showing it. Did you experience: “Here are the suspects. See them. They have backpacks. See. We know that they are suspects, because, see, there they are.” When is the last time the media investigated anything? A good candidate for investigation is the post-bombing rampage the brothers allegedly went on, robbing a 7/11 store (later contradicted by local police), killing a campus policeman, shooting a transit cop, high-jacking a SUV and releasing the owner. Why would terrorists seeking to escape in order to strike again call attention to themselves in such outlandish ways and release a car-jacked owner to alert the police of the tag number? If the brothers were willing to kill police with gunfire and innocents with bombs, why release the guy whose vehicle they stole so he could inform the police of the license plate and make the brothers’ capture easier? What is the evidence, other than “reports from authorities,” that these events occurred or had any more connection to the brothers than the falsely reported 7/11 robbery that local police disavowed? Why does the US media simply accept whatever government authorities say? Where is the evidence of a first shoot-out and a second shoot-out? The second shoot- out consisted of the authorities bombarding a motionless youth bleeding from wounds in a boat with multiple volleys of stun grenades and then multiple gunshots. The unconscious 19 year old was unarmed and unable to respond to the boat owner who discovered him. As he lies there, he is shot many times, including through the throat, and is on life support. But the very next day, according to the presstitute media, he is providing hand-written confessions.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367627621488</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:33:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367627646751-156</Id><Topic><Title>YOU ARE THE HOPE !!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367627494445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Was the purpose of the reports of a murderous rampage to create fear among the population so that they would accept martial law and home invasions by armed troops ordering American citizens out of their homes with hands over their heads on the pretext that they might be harboring the Boston Marathon Bomber? The videos of the street celebration in which Bostonians thank the police and of the two Boston families, if not scripted by actors, shows Americans who far from opposing the police state welcome it. A father says that he with his daughter in his arms was forced out of his home by troops pointing automatic rifles at their heads, but that he was thankful for the safety the police provided him by violating every civil right that the Constitution gave him. A woman says it was scary but that “the police are just doing their jobs.” Are Americans now so brainwashed that they attribute their safety to the presence of a Gestapo Police State? Why have detention facilities been built? Why did Homeland Security purchase a billion or more rounds of ammunition? Why does Homeland Security have 2,700 tanks and a para-military force? Why aren’t these questions being investigated? The US Constitution is the product of 900 years of human efforts to restrain brutal government and to make government subject to law.
