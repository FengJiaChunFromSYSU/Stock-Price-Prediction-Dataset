By Comrade Krotchsky Surviving May 2nd: Even Reds Get The Blues Post-May-Day depression is a growing malady that affects progressives each year, usually beginning late in the afternoon on May 1 and continuing until the morning of the next May Day. For some, it is simply a result of too much sign-making and short-range marching with very few people giving a damn; for many others the causes range from substance abuse to the frustration over their inability to force the wonderful progressive world order on the unenlightened by government mandate. While most left-wing agitators in the U.S. and other free nations experience mild symptoms, some others are subjected to an almost paralyzing agony. These helpful tips explain how dejected collectivists around the world can combat May Day depression by just taking a few simple precautions. Realize that May Day is just a temporary, one-day celebration; your planned pseudo-Russian revolution will have to wait. Be prepared for the reality that, no matter how strongly you believe in the Comintern, there are very few others on board with you. Get some rest and don't take your perennial rejection too seriously. Prepare yourself for the nasty looks and harsh words of working relatives and friends whom you only see around your birthday. Let little jabs and sarcastic comments about your Communist proclivities go. Arguing or getting upset and making drunken or careless remarks at family gatherings won't solve anything. Save any major discussions about the failure of capitalism for your monthly meetings with other fellow travelers. Create a placard budget. Financial woes are a major cause of May Day depression and anxiety, especially since you, like most left-wing activists, are probably unemployed and depend on the good graces of your family and friends to have a place to sleep and a warm meal.

The case becomes all the more intriguing because Moore is on record questioning Obama’s constitutional eligibility to serve as president. Get Judge Roy Moore’s classic book about his battle for liberty, “So Help Me God: The Ten Commandments, Judicial Tyranny, and the Battle for Religious Freedom.” Speculation abounds online that Alabama Democrats have jumped into the case out of concern Moore may not be so quick as other judges to dismiss challenges to Obama’s eligibility. In a brief of amicus curiae filed last week, the Alabama Democratic Party insists the court is required to dismiss the case. “Stated simply,” the brief reads, “there is absolutely nothing any Alabama court can do to change the reality of President Obama’s election to a second term in office. … No Alabama court has the authority to delve into the legality, conduct or results of that election.” The brief is filled with condemning language, calling the McInnish-Goode case a “baseless attack,” Obama the “object of [their] scorn” and their intent “a jaundiced and jaded political agenda.” Futhermore, the Democratic Party insists, “In order for one to accept the claim that President Obama’s birth certificate is a forgery, one has to buy into a conspiracy theory so vast and byzantine that it sincerely taxes the imagination of reasonable minds.” The document scoffs at “birthers” as a “tiny cabal of zealots” and quotes late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel – not widely recognized as a constitutional expert – to make its case: “These people could have personally witnessed Obama being born out of an apple pie, in the middle of a Kansas wheat field, while Toby Keith sang the National Anthem – and they’d still think he was a Kenyan Muslim.” Yet at least two of the judges sitting on Alabama’s Supreme Court have considered that where all the “birthers” have seen smoke, there may be a fire. In a 2010 interview with WND, Moore said he’d seen no convincing evidence that Obama is a “natural born citizen” and a lot of evidence that suggests he is not. “This is the strangest thing indeed,” he said. “The president has never produced [evidence] in the face of substantial evidence he was not born in our country. People are accepting it blindly based on their feelings, not on the law.” More recently, when a majority of the state’s high court denied a 2012 petition filed by McInnish seeking to require an original copy of Obama’s birth certificate before the sitting president would be allowed on the state’s ballot, Justice Tom Parker filed a special, unpublished concurrence in the case arguing that McInnish’s charges of “forgery” were legitimate cause for concern. Parker wrote, “Mclnnish has attached certain documentation to his mandamus petition, which, if presented to the appropriate forum as part of a proper evidentiary presentation, would raise serious questions about the authenticity of both the ‘short form’ and the ‘long form’ birth certificates of President Barack Hussein Obama that have been made public.” The “certain documentation” Parker refers to is the findings of an investigation conducted by Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. As WND reported, Arpaio and his Cold Case Posse announced there is probable cause indicating the documents released by the White House purported to be Obama’s original, long-form birth certificate and Selective Service registration card are actually forgeries.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367493614198</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 07:20:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367497117753-6</Id><Topic><Title>Multiple Obama Birth Certificates Surface In Alabama Eligibility Case</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367466091224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$.</Msg><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1367497117753</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 08:18:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367497376042-7</Id><Topic><Title>Multiple Obama Birth Certificates Surface In Alabama Eligibility Case</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367466091224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep trying nutcase, we need the laughs.</Msg><Username>freedumber</Username><Timestamp>1367497376042</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 08:22:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367498150000-8</Id><Topic><Title>Multiple Obama Birth Certificates Surface In Alabama Eligibility Case</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367466091224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Won't he just get all his friends from college who knew him, went to classes with him and graduated with him, to testify on his behalf?</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1367498150000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 08:35:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367498689785-9</Id><Topic><Title>AP - Iraq War vet armed with (AR-15) rifle thwarts gas station break-in, police say</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367449613252</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 19:06:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you suppose FOX NEWSPEAK deliberately suppressed this emotionly charged event??

The initiative, dubbed "Madam President," comes well before the next presidential election has even begun to take shape, but has clear implications for Clinton, Democrats' favorite right now to carry the party's banner. "There is one name that seems to be getting mentioned more than others," said Stephanie Schriock, the president of EMILY's List, which supported Clinton during her 2008 bid for the Democratic nomination. "We do not know if Hillary is going to run — but we're hopeful that she may." So intense is the early interest in Clinton's potential candidacy that even her most benign public appearances since leaving her job as secretary of state are scrutinized for signals of her intentions. The runner-up in a bitter, drawn-out primary battle versus Barack Obama in 2008, Clinton's personal approval numbers have never been higher following her stint as the country's top diplomat. To that end, a new national poll released separately on Thursday suggested that Clinton is the overwhelming favorite of Democrats in 2016. Sixty-five percent of Democrats said in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted at the end of last month that they would vote for Clinton in a primary; 13 percent would prefer Biden, while all other contenders register less than 5 percent.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367508288357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 11:24:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367508379126-37</Id><Topic><Title>Multiple Obama Birth Certificates Surface In Alabama Eligibility Case</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367466091224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"...case, dismissed at a lower level...."

It is a network of radicals dedicated to transforming our constitutional republic into a socialist hive. The leader of these radicals is ... George Soros. He has essentially privatized the Democratic Party, bringing it under his personal control. The Shadow Party is the instrument through which he exerts that control. ... It works by siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions that would have gone to the Democratic Party in normal times, and putting those contributions at the personal disposal of Mr. Soros. He then uses that money to buy influence and loyalty where he sees fit. In 2003, Soros set up a network of privately-owned groups which acts as a shadow or mirror image of the Party. It performs all the functions we would normally expect the real Democratic Party to perform, such as shaping the Party platform, fielding candidates, running campaigns, and so forth. However, it performs these functions under the private supervision of Mr. Soros and his associates. The Shadow Party derives its power from its ability to raise huge sums of money. By controlling the Democrat purse strings, the Shadow Party can make or break any Democrat candidate by deciding whether or not to fund him. During the 2004 election cycle, the Shadow Party raised more than $300 million for Democrat candidates, prompting one of its operatives, MoveOn PAC director Eli Pariser, to declare, “Now it’s our party.

Some would be more easily achieved than others. In pledging to look again at an unfulfilled promise dating back to his first election campaign and early days in office in 2009, Obama made plain on Tuesday that it was untenable to keep the 11-year-old camp open. A hunger strike at the camp at the U.S. Naval Base on Cuba began in February, has been joined by 100 of the inmates and has led to force-feedings to keep the weakest prisoners alive, sparking fresh outrage from rights groups over a prison opened under Republican President George W. Bush in 2002. There were about 245 prisoners at Guantanamo when Obama, a Democrat, took office in 2009 and that has dropped to 166. But releases have slowed to a trickle under restrictions imposed by Congress, including a ban on any of them being brought to the United States. No prisoners have left Guantanamo this year. Among current inmates, nine have been charged with crimes or convicted, 24 are considered eligible for possible prosecution, 47 are considered too dangerous for release but are not facing prosecution, and 86 have been cleared for transfer or release. Obama has several options, although it could take a combination of several to clear the camp. PUT SOMEBODY IN CHARGE In January, the State Department reassigned the special envoy who had been in charge of trying to persuade countries to take Guantanamo inmates approved for release, Daniel Fried, and did not replace him. That was widely seen as a signal that Obama was giving up on closing the prison any time soon. Fried arranged for the transfer out of scores of prisoners, but the departures slowed to a crawl after Congress imposed restrictions on them. White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Wednesday the administration was considering naming a senior diplomat to renew the focus on repatriation or transferring detainees. Christopher Anders, the senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said such a "point person" was sorely needed as a first step to manage the administration's effort - but that the person should be from the White House. "For the last three years at the White House, it's been like no one home" on Guantanamo, he said. USE EXCEPTIONS IN LAW TO LET PRISONERS GO Obama has blamed Congress for interfering with his plan to close Guantanamo. Starting in 2011, Congress began restricting transfers out, saying the Defense Department first had to certify a number of things, including that the destination country was not a state sponsor of terrorism and would take action to make sure the individual would not threaten the United States. Starting last year, Congress let some restrictions be waived if it was in the "national security interests" of the United States. Obama has not used the waiver or certification provisions. "For the past two years, our committee has worked with our Senate counterparts to ensure that the certifications necessary to transfer detainees overseas are reasonable. The administration has never certified a single transfer," House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard McKeon, a Republican, said this week. The White House could have pushed harder for officials at the Pentagon to process certifications, said the ACLU's Anders. Wells Dixon, a senior attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York organization that has represented a number of Guantanamo prisoners, said Obama could order the Pentagon to begin certifying transfers out. But he also noted potential risks for the president. "There's no political upside" if Obama certifies that a prisoner can leave and then that prisoner later attacks U.S. interests, Dixon said. SEND PRISONERS BACK TO YEMEN Congress has prohibited the transfer of detainees to countries with troubled security situations. But the United States could decide that new Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour has taken adequate measures against al Qaeda and made the country stable enough to resume repatriations to Yemen. Repatriations were halted in 2010 after a man trained by militants in Yemen tried to blow up a U.S.-bound plane in 2009. Of the 86 prisoners cleared for transfer or release, 56 are Yemenis. The Yemeni government says it wants them home and is building a facility to hold them for rehabilitation. That option also has a potential danger - if a repatriated Yemeni eventually attacked the United States or its interests. USE THE PERIODIC REVIEW BOARD PROCESS Two years ago, Obama signed an executive order establishing extra review procedures for Guantanamo detainees to determine if continued detention were warranted, but the Periodic Review Boards have not been used. This option looks fairly simple, since it involves carrying out the president's own executive order. But there may have been no rush to establish more reviews boards since prisoners cleared by earlier review boards are still being held. USE COURT RULINGS TO GET PEOPLE OUT Dixon suggested the administration could use court rulings to help get prisoners released. Two members of China's Muslim Uighur minority were resettled in El Salvador in April 2012, four years after a U.S. District Court in Washington ruled there were no grounds to hold them. When prisoners challenge their detention in federal court, the government could decide not to contest the case, paving the way for a court order effecting the prisoner's release, said Dixon. He said that could happen in any of the more than 100 detainee "habeus corpus" cases filed in federal court. Obama could instruct the Justice Department to stop contesting those cases. SEND PRISONERS OUT IN A PRISONER EXCHANGE The United States tried to work out a deal to transfer five senior Taliban prisoners back to Afghanistan in return for U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Berghdal, who has been a prisoner of Taliban militants since 2009. The talks were suspended last year. But there will be pressure to return the Afghan prisoners when the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan ends in 2014. This option would depend on how relations evolve with Afghanistan. But the Taliban prisoner release plan also met strong resistance among some members of Congress, especially Republicans, who might object if it resurfaces. CALL ON CONGRESS The legal restrictions on transfers will expire at the end of the fiscal year, on Sept. 30, so Obama could urge Congress not to renew them - and make clear he considers that a political imperative. If the restriction on transferring prisoners to the United States were allowed to expire, Obama could not only transfer Guantanamo prisoners to foreign countries, but could bring some back to the United States for trial in federal court. But some Democrats as well as Republicans argue that bringing Guantanamo inmates to the United States is a security risk. Republican leaders in both chambers have made that a high-profile issue, and Republicans control the House of Representatives. So the option could be bogged down in Washington politics.</Msg><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1367517723757</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 14:02:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367517960275-70</Id><Title>Boeing loses 5 orders for the 747, now to watch MD, er Boeing mess up the Boeing 777</Title><Msg>May 2 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Thursday that it lost five orders for its 747 jumbo jet worth about $1.8 billion at list prices and gained one order for its 777 wide-body plane in the latest week.( not namesd sure you got a firm order then) T Boeing recently said it would slow production of 747s in response to weakening demand for the jet,due to the A380 taking over the jumbo area der !

As well as nine times out of ten, I do not jump into a Bible perspective within a purely political discussion. Like a person whose mindset is given to sports and thus makes illustrations from the ball field or a "play", I cannot help but think of how God's Word might apply to these significant discussions on this board. However, very often leading the charge are others, such as your good friend Hooz, sometimes even yourself. Now, that being said, as you might imagine, I am glad to participate in such discourse - save for outright threads of blasphemy and disrespect to the Lord. Otherwise, I am pleased that God is often on the minds of others, whether they realize it or not, whether they like it or not.

Also the tooling for a 777x wing is going to be expensive and will take up a fair amount of space including a couple of very large autoclaves. That would require a considerable adjustment to the Everett facility. My guess is that one of the reasons for the folding wings will be to make them easier to transport. Putting a joint in a carbon wing is not trivial and will add a fair amount of weight, hard to believe that's just for airport space concerns.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1367524658682</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 15:57:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367524680513-113</Id><Topic><Title>President Hillary Clinton 2016 !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367508288357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 11:24:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>allah's well?</Msg><Username>prog101</Username><Timestamp>1367524680513</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 15:58:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367524818275-114</Id><Topic><Title>President Hillary Clinton 2016 !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367508288357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 11:24:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would we want to change OUR Constitution (written by man with the inspirartion of The Creator) ?</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1367524818275</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 16:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367524915378-115</Id><Topic><Title>RWNJ's whistle DIXIE</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1367523992544</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 15:46:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i whistle the 1812 overature...</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1367524915378</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 16:01:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367525097061-116</Id><Topic><Title>RWNJ's whistle DIXIE</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1367523992544</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 15:46:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>then i pummel their young-ins with pillows and love and say did you see it coming... next time u better b prepared for that much LOVE of the 1812 overarture</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1367525097061</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 16:04:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367525885437-117</Id><Title>Charming: McAuliffe Attended DC Fundraiser on Newborn Son's Delivery Night, Left Wife in Tears</Title><Msg>Dorothy was starting to well up in the backseat. She was having trouble understanding how I could be taking my wife and newborn baby to a fund-raiser on our way home from the hospital. We got to the dinner and by then Dorothy was in tears, and I left her with Justin and went inside. Little Peter was sleeping peacefully and Dorothy just sat there and poor Justin didn't say a word. He was mortified. I was inside maybe fifteen minutes, said a few nice things about Marty, and hurried back out to the car. I felt bad for Dorothy, but it was a million bucks for the Democratic Party... Hey, there were a million union dollars on the line for The Almighty Party. If it took a little discomfort for his exhausted, weeping wife and newborn son to rake in that cash, so be it. Good guy. Oh, then there's this heartwarming account: I was going stir-crazy, which drove Dorothy nuts. 'Isn't there something you need to do?' she finally said. I told her The Washington Post was having a party that evening for Lloyd Grove, who wrote the 'Reliable Source' column. 'Go!' she said. 'You're like a caged animal here. I'll call you if I need you.' I went flying out the door and drove to the party. I kept calling Dorothy to make sure she was fine. I made the rounds at the party and ran into Marjorie Williams, who was writing a story on me for Vanity Fair, magazine. She was shocked to see me at the party. 'Isn't Dorothy having a baby today?' she asked. 'That's right,' I said, 'but she threw me out the room.' Marjorie just couldn't understand how I left Dorothy alone.

What Communists?</Title><Msg>On Wednesday, Senator #$%$ Durbin (D-IL) joined nearly two thousand trade unionists, open communists, socialists, anarchists and illegal aliens at Chicago's May Day march and rally. Two large rally demonstrations that began at Union Park and Chicago's Haymarket Riot monument converged into a giant march that shut down traffic for miles, and ended at Federal Plaza where they were joined by Senator Durbin. Durbin made remarks to the red, yellow and black flag waving crowd about "immigration reform." Opening with "My fellow immigrants," Durbin told the crowd "this is a once in a lifetime chance" to get "immigration reform." Following his speech, I spoke to the senator about his participation: Durbin then mounted a rather bizarre defense of his participation in the rally--on free speech grounds: Rebelpundit: There is a large contingent of Communist Party USA, anarchists, international socialist groups here today that you just spoke to... Durbin: How do you know that? Rebelpundit: Because I've filmed them all day, and you just spoke to them, so I'd like to ask about your participation, why you decided to come out today? Durbin: Well let me just say something, because [pause] I believe in the Constitution. Do you believe in it? Rebelpundit: Because you believe in the Constitution you decided to come out to a rally full of communists and socialists? Durbin: And you know why? Rebelpundit: Why? Durbin: Because we have freedom of speech in America, and that's why you can record this and not be arrested. RebelPundit: You think I should be arrested? Durbin: No, not at all, you have a right to your constitutional rights, and I do, too. Of course, Durbin could go to a #$%$ or KKK rally, too--but does that mean, as a United States Senator, he should?</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367527677964</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 16:47:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367527955359-131</Id><Topic><Title>President Hillary Clinton 2016 !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367508288357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 11:24:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jesus saves.

Obama’s story isn’t true. The NRA doesn’t work like the lobbies Obama is coziest with. And the NRA also wasn’t the tip of the spear in the gun-rights fight this month. Here is the way things really went down: The gun-rights resistance on Capitol Hill began in late March with two first-term Tea Party senators declaring they would filibuster consideration of the gun-control bill. Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid explaining they would oppose invoking cloture on the “motion to proceed” to the bill. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., soon joined them. That rump of three senators expanded to a platoon of 18 who eventually signed onto the letter. In the end, 29 Republicans and two Democrats opposed proceeding to the bill — well short of the 41 needed for a filibuster. Many allies criticized this failed filibuster, but its leaders argue it was crucial to eventual victory. Remember kids, this is a movement that according to the Left and the status quo mongers in the GOP would have you believe it’s dead, What it is, however, is an actual movement. That means it has progressed from its big rally roots to the political activism phase and, fortunately, some of those elected as Tea Party candidates are behaving as such. Yes, the NRA did help but the Obama story about it being this all-powerful lobby that makes Republican members of Congress dance like puppets on a string simply isn’t true. And we should all be used to that from him now.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367528328635</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 16:58:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367529150492-135</Id><Title>The reason to Invade Syria !</Title><Msg>because the Syrian government is winning their civil war... and as good neocon Christians, we can not allow a legitimate government abroad to handle their own affairs !</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367529150492</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 17:12:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367529477578-136</Id><Topic><Title>President Hillary Clinton 2016 !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367508288357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 11:24:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let me tell you seriously what I find objectionable about your preactures, before the goons who side with you only because they can't pass up a chance to caterwaul about me start in. ("Preactures," by the way, is my little term for your preaching/lectures about what the Bible really means and you exhortations to "get right with God.") First off, I go to church to hear expert opinion about what the Bible means. Jesus did not encourage me to listen to folks like you, who trot out their preactures to insinuate that they are holier/more knowing than I am. For all I know, you are just one of those buffoons who stands on a sidewalk waving a large sign with tiny type that includes some Bible verse and then a warning to all of us pagans. Second, I am Lutheran, and it was Martin Luther's firm belief that people should read the Bible themselves and decide for themselves their relationship to God, without the need for "middle man" such as a priest. It was the most significant difference between the church he ended up founding and the Roman Catholic church. Third, I do not believe that using religion to justify or excuse a political philosophy is particularly religious, or valid, or even a good use of time -- yorrs writing or mine reading. Especially in a nation like ours, founded on the priciple that each citizen should be free to worship and express himself in any way his beliefs dictate, though those beliefs should NEVER be used to form, enforce or regulate government policy. Now, I figure you will disengenuosly protest that your preactures have never been used to defend a political viewpoint. But in my recollection, not ONE of your preactures has ever come up on its own -- all have been posted at some point during a political discussion. I tell you this stuff only to make you a better evangelical -- and if you detect more than a bit of patronizing in that remark, then you now know how it feels to be patronized.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1367529477578</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 17:17:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367529583294-137</Id><Topic><Title>Multiple Obama Birth Certificates Surface In Alabama Eligibility Case</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367466091224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not saying Obama did not go to columbia any more then I am saying you are Chris Genna or agreeing with CG that I am spartcus.

Do you have a brain? Do you not recall yesterday when you arrogantly claimed to know what Jesus would think and feel. How can you possibly pretend to agree with Chris's view of reading and interpreting Jesus' words for himself when you constantly inject your religious interpretations and personal religious dogma on this board year after year? Are you so blind to your own hypocrisy? You are a moron because only a moron can be that blind to their own sins and then chastise others for doing EXACTLY what you did only 24 hours ago, by agreeing with Genna's comments. Honestly I don't recall ever running in to anyone as dense as you or as blind to their own hypocrisy as you on a blog or message board. The term is an accurate description and knowing your high regard for a lying self-deluded turd like Obama makes me ecstatic that you think less of me because I see that as a compliment coming from someone as FOS as you.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367536182239</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 19:09:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367536208449-170</Id><Topic><Title>Pulled outta the fine S&amp;W 5-bean salad line...</Title><Username>spartaloon</Username><Timestamp>1367522323979</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 15:18:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a fine example management made out of us</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367536208449</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 19:10:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367536679182-171</Id><Topic><Title>Multiple Obama Birth Certificates Surface In Alabama Eligibility Case</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367466091224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"the case" simmer down my old fr\iend</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367536679182</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 19:17:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367536869692-172</Id><Title>Since chi-chi's and hooters is already taken....</Title><Msg>may I suggest... casaba;s the finest quisine between the 20-20 latitudes and the finest heads of shark-tank or Else! the 20-20...</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367536869692</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 19:21:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367537080537-173</Id><Topic><Title>Since chi-chi's and hooters is already taken....</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367536869692</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 19:21:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sweet holy mother of jesus</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367537080537</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 19:24:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367537690848-174</Id><Topic><Title>Since chi-chi's and hooters is already taken....</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367536869692</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 19:21:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's it////that is your whole presentation.... something called Casaba;s with no sales only a 20-20 and an idea a.

I know exactly what I have said and when I have said it. I stand by my analysis. However, you say, “But in my recollection” and “all have been posted at some point during a political discussion”. So, I challenge you to simply search on my ID and find whether or not “all” of my Bible related posts are spawned by myself or others in political discussions. Here is what you will find: that I posted to the following latest threads (I see all of my posts, even when they are deleted or the whole threads have been deleted): President Hillary Clinton in 2016 – interjection of Bible/religious discussion started by you Which religion is the most violent? – Stickman Proof of Heaven – Spartacus Why was there a Bomb Threat EXERCISE BEFORE the Boston Marathon – Bible discussion started by you Quote of the day – Bible discussion started by Hooz Obama similar to President Lincoln – no Bible discussion on my part Bush kept us safe for 8 years, Obama has failed Americans – no Bible discussion on my part A matter of perspective – Bible discussion started by me, no replies If bulky_bob and Jesus showed today for LARGE – Bisbee_angler tHANKY gOD ALMIGHTY DINDN'T MAKE sATURDAY THE SABBATH OR bULKY bLOB] – bapsycho So you say: “Third, I do not believe that using religion to justify or excuse a political philosophy is particularly religious, or valid, or even a good use of time -- your writing or mine reading. Especially in a nation like ours, founded on the principle that each citizen should be free to worship and express himself in any way his beliefs dictate, though those beliefs should NEVER be used to form, enforce or regulate government policy.” I certainly. As long as we have the freedoms that you cite, I will offer my perspective. And, as I said, I am pleased that others are thinking about God whether or not you realize it or like it. And thanks for the chastening, a reflection of compassion. When the Lord chastens us, it is good. - BB</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1367542435700</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 20:53:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367543217707-200</Id><Title>And Just When You Thought That You Had Heard It All...</Title><Msg>http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/end-team-experts-says-humanity-faces-extinction-233025693.html Stay thirsty my friends.</Msg><Username>headless_shop</Username><Timestamp>1367543217707</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 21:06:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367543543075-201</Id><Title>The End Is Near...</Title><Msg>I told ya so... ha ha ha http://news.yahoo.com/warren-buffett-joins-twitter-gains-10-000-followers-164619709.html Stay thirsty my friends.</Msg><Username>headless_shop</Username><Timestamp>1367543543075</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 21:12:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367544347946-202</Id><Topic><Title>“This could be a career ender for Michele Bachmann”</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367543110440</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 21:05:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>her five-foot frame said no bendy-straws for sarah palin';s million$ Casaba's : the finest restaurant chain between 0 - 20 latitude where we make it just like yo momma's</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367544347946</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 21:25:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367544687582-203</Id><Title>Printing money at the Denver Mint 1960</Title><Msg>I already have have a job....better than that including the FBI cut apricots in half and fill an 4' x 8' tray for a quarter</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367544687582</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 21:31:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367544691616-204</Id><Topic><Title>President Hillary Clinton 2016 !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367508288357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 11:24:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The perception is the reality, I'm afraid.

Chris, you seem to thing that I am a "holier than thou" person. Did I not twice tell you that I was "lower than the low"? I am a sinner, like yourself. In these past two years, by fervent reading of God's Word, I have become even more aware of my own sinfulness and unworthiness of Jesus' love and mercy and His salvation. And I am compelled to share His Word. Perhaps this message board is not the correct venue, but the Lord owns everything anyway. Chris, search your own heart and ask whether your issue is with with Bulky Bob or God's Word.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1367552718661</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 23:45:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367553499005-214</Id><Title>IAM pretty sure on this one or 110%</Title><Msg>On May 3rd 1972 I was not in PARIS China Cat Sunflower into I Know You Rider by the Grateful Dead.
