Boeing is an MBA jobs company (look at the CEO's resume). It has lots of jobs for MBA types that like to hold meetings and look at stop light charts and meaningless metrics. SpaceX is a company that in-sources everything. They find engineers to think, run, design and build everything for the company. They don't seek "process" answers to everything, as if you could define a process for thinking and common sense. Boeing is a bureaucracy of management robots who are looking to expand their empires (means more money to them). At Boeing engineers are non-value added costs. Boeing cannot learn from SpaceX because those in power like their perks and benefits and they are in alignment with what the "prestigious" university systems (Harvard, Yale, etc) in the US teach. Everything is "how do you maximize shareholder value." Do you think SpaceX is trying to maximize shareholder value? There is a world of difference between Boeing and SpaceX. SpaceX is a self-learning organization and Boeing is a self-perpetuating bureaucracy. They are orthogonal systems. The only reason Boeing is alive is it takes a long time for the big old dinosaur to die-off. SpaceX is the new breed. At the beginning NASA even thought SpaceX did not have the management capability to build space going products. Why did they think that? Because NASA was a self-perpetuating bureaucracy. Fortunately for the US citizens funding for NASA is down the tubes and a private company is showing us that you don't need an army of bureaucrats to go into space, but you need thinking engineers. Think about it.</Msg><Username>zevach</Username><Timestamp>1357907648054</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:34:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357907715758-41</Id><Topic><Title>Bill Clinton named Father of the Year!</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1357845868263</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 14:24:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They gave Barrack Obama a Nobel Peace Prize so this makes perfect sense</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1357907715758</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:35:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357907773107-42</Id><Topic><Title>better put your shoes on \beat mir-guns 112-15 lb class</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357906239804</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:10:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wish I was from your planet, I can't understand your language.</Msg><Username>the_novice_anti_cramer</Username><Timestamp>1357907773107</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:36:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357907797970-43</Id><Topic><Title>Just ban assault weapons and automatic weapons...............</Title><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1357904454837</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 06:40:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What are your plans -- going for your 15 minutes of fame as a mass murderer?</Msg><Username>bottomline5182</Username><Timestamp>1357907797970</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:36:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357908080551-44</Id><Topic><Title>Just ban assault weapons and automatic weapons...............</Title><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1357904454837</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 06:40:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are no " assault type weapons " or " automatic weapons " available for public consumption in the USA ..........

But it’s not the first time that Obama has lauded the notion of responsible Americans using firearms to protect himself and his family while concurrently eviscerating that very same right for the American people. During an ABC Nightline interview broadcast on December 26 yet recorded before the Sandy Hook shooting, Obama said one of the benefits of his re-election was the ability “to have men with guns around at all times,” in order to protect his daughters. In addition, the school attended by Obama’s daughters in Washington D.C. has no less than 11 armed security guards on duty at all times, yet the idea of arming teachers and school officials to prevent school massacres has been dismissed by gun control advocates who want school campuses to remain “gun free zones” where victims are disarmed and shooters are free to carry out their rampage unimpeded.</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1357908265718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:44:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357908322815-48</Id><Topic><Title>Arms, Well Regulated and Militias</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357873062755</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:57:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>2nd amendment is a foolish, childish amendment that appeals to our more violent natures and should have been removed from the Constitution 100 or so years ago.</Msg><Username>bbkenno</Username><Timestamp>1357908322815</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:45:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357908345968-49</Id><Topic><Title>Genna pay your Fair Share</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357872634563</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:50:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Genna is a sponge</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1357908345968</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:45:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357908464935-50</Id><Topic><Title>Arms, Well Regulated and Militias</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357873062755</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:57:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Repubs have been busy trying to enslave and de-educate the populace to the level of drooling fools.

Did you hear the latest? Yesterday during his White House press briefing he actually said that deficit reduction is not a worthy goal. Here’s the quote … "Most importantly because deficit reduction is not a worthy goal onto itself," said Carney, talking about government spending. "This is all about making our economy stronger, making it more productive and allowing it to create even more jobs. That is the most important thing when it comes to economic policy as far as the President is concerned." Yeah, that’s according to the administration that has racked up $1+ trillion deficits every year thus far and with no end in sight! This is coming from an administration that has added more to our national debt than almost every other president combined! This is coming from an administration that is on pace to hit $20 trillion in national debt before the end of his second term. The truth is that deficit reduction is not a worthy goal to Obama because he doesn’t know how to accomplish it. He CAN’T accomplish it by increasing the size and scope of our government, as he has already done and will continue to do. Even with his precious tax increases, it won’t make a dent in our deficit because our government simply spends too much. Yes, we could grow our way out of this mess, but Obama doesn’t know how to do that either! Taxing the producers, the job creators and more government spending isn’t exactly a recipe for economic growth.

"Economic freedom is the fundamental right of every human to control his or her own labor and property. In an economically free society, individuals are free to work, produce, consume, and invest in any way they please, with that freedom both protected by the state and unconstrained by the state. Since reaching a global peak in 2008, sadly, economic freedom around the world has continued to stagnate. Today launches the 19th edition of the Index of Economic Freedom, produced by The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal. The 2013 Index was edited by Ambassador Terry Miller, director of Heritage’s Center for International Trade and Economics; Kim Holmes, Ph.D., Heritage’s Distinguished Fellow; and Edwin J. Feulner, Ph.D., Heritage’s president. What are the reasons for the worldwide sluggishness? As Ambassador Miller writes in The Wall Street Journal, “Particularly concerning are the rise of populist ‘democratic’ movements that use the coercive power of government to redistribute income and control economic activity.” While “corrupt political and legal environments cause underdevelopment in poorer countries,” Miller writes, “unfortunately, economic favoritism and cronyism exist in advanced democracies, too.” Americans are well aware, and the overall U.S. score has been dropping since 2009. From 2009 to 2010, the U.S. declined from being a “free” economy to “mostly free.” This year, it ranks 10th in the world." 1 Hong Kong 2 Singapore 3 Australia 4 New Zealand 5 Switzerland 6 Canada 7 Chile 8 Mauritius 9 Denmark 10 United State</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357914720706</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 09:32:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357915058447-75</Id><Topic><Title>"An armed man is a citizen.

We will see about the unknowns and they are unknown and go SPEEA the people who did design the 777 not the 787, outsourcing did not work on the outsourced 787 design, why just look at the facts the 787 is 3.5 years late to delivery, it is 30 billion over cost estimates, it cost 400 million per plane to deliver and only brings in 100 million due to being late penality and deep "lemon" discounts. the 777 a union SPEEA designed plane was made on time and sold per budget and is one of the best airplanes , in my opinion that Boeing built and BTW the profit and 100% no fatatilty of the 777 is a fact.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357918323693</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:32:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357918332765-95</Id><Title>Dreamliner uses Lithium Ion Batteries - These are unstable &amp; can start fires</Title><Msg>I can not believe that Boeing chose to use Lithium Ion batteries. I fly RC airplanes using Lithium Ion batteries and know for a fact that if these batteries get overcharged (from a generator or DC charger for example) that they will catch on fire. Also, if the charge rate is too high, they will swell up and can also start a fire. The fire tends to be very hot and explosive in nature. Buyer beware!!!!

In the past ten years, more people than ever have received concealed carry permits and are arming themselves in their homes and on their property. As a result, rape, murder and assault are down. Responsible armed citizens stop violent crimes from happening everyday. The latest news comes from Wisconsin where an armed grandmother stopped the robbery of a grocery story and saved herself from a knife slashing in the process. Robberies happen far too often, but a robber coming face-to-face with a gun-carrying grandmother is a little more rare. Ernestine Aldana owns a grocery store near the corner of Muskego Avenue and Becher Street in Milwaukee. On Dec. 14, Aldana was working in the store when a man entered the store and pulled a knife on her. "I was really scared," she said. But as the man reached for cash from the drawer, Aldana pulled a gun from underneath the counter. "I didn't think," she said. "I didn't remember what was being said. I just took a step back, grabbed the gun and that was that." As the gun came out, the man ran away. Aldana said she and her husband have owned the grocery store for just over two years and have not encountered any problems before this. She said her son bought the gun for their protection, but they never thought they would have to use it. The last sentence there is key. Anti-Second Amendment gun grabbers portray gun owners as crazed killers when in reality, they purchase firearms for self-protection in hopes they'll never have to use them. In the case when a firearm is necessary for self defense, it's really necessary.

If Boeing executives had gone with SPEEA to design the 787 then they would have got a plane delivered on time and budget like the SPEEA did when they designed 777 one of the best Boeing Airplanes. The only thing Boeing about the 787 design is the Boeing logo on the plane the rest is outsourcing or better stated management failure .

So Boeing Management how is that cheap 787 outsourcing working for you now?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357922029531</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:33:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357922271019-127</Id><Topic><Title>Rectal-Cranial Inversion Moment of the Day</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357914038123</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 09:20:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why did Democrats quit calling the Bush tax-cuts the "tax cuts for the rich" and started calling them "tax cuts for the middle class" when they wanted to keep them for 98.4% of tax payers?</Msg><Username>libsrwimpy3</Username><Timestamp>1357922271019</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:37:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357922519170-128</Id><Title>FAA Launches Review of 787</Title><Msg>FAA has launched a comprehensive review of the Design and Assembly of the 787 with emphasis on the Electrical system.</Msg><Username>wallstsharks</Username><Timestamp>1357922519170</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:41:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357922552290-129</Id><Topic><Title>Rectal-Cranial Inversion Moment of the Day</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357914038123</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 09:20:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Paying down the deficit is not the only objective.

The really great part was that there were a bunch of senior engineering managers (mostly MacDac clones) sitting on a podium in front of us during the whole thing. Senior man was David Swain, a Stonecipher protege. His face turned beet red and he was so mad when it was over he couldn't speak for a minute or two. When he did respond it was the usual useless gibberish you got from that crowd. Shortly after that the fellowship rules were changed to allow the firing of Senior Tech Fellows (they do not have SPEEA protection). What made the paper so powerful was that it stated the problem in a language that the managers could understand even though he was a highly regarded structural engineer. Outsourcing made no sense from a business as well as an engineering perspective and that was one of the main reasons that Douglas lost out to Boeing in the commercial airplane market. If the same business model was applied to Boeing by the Stonecipher crowd it would happen to Boeing. Sadly, the 787 proved he was right from both an engineering and business perspective. The only reason Boeing hasn't gone down has been the steady cash flow coming in from the legacy models and a very favorable market.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1357922872290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:47:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357923068193-133</Id><Topic><Title>Why the Dreamliner is turning into the NIGHTMAREliner!</Title><Username>boulmichone</Username><Timestamp>1357753377856</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 12:42:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ron, your right only the first 3 787 were not used to sell to customers, skeaking about selling those other 12- 787 planes that were not scrapped, they were each sold to customers at a loss per plane of 300 million each.

On Tuesday, Cincinnati Fox affiliate WXIX thoroughly debunked many of Morgan’s claims (video follows with transcribed highlights and commentary): Video at News Busters. After playing a clip of Morgan’s interview with radio host Alex Jones, WXIX’s Ben Swann said, “The stat that Piers Morgan was continuing to cite, one that Great Britain which banned guns about fifteen years ago had only 35 gun-related murders in 2011 compared to the United States which had 11,000. Let’s start there because that number is not correct.” Swann then broke down the FBI crime statistics for 2011 showing that there were 12,664 homicides in the U.S. Of those, 8,583 were caused by firearms. “But of those,” said Swann, “400 are listed as justifiable homicide by law enforcement, 260 justifiable homicide by private citizens.” As such, Morgan has been routinely citing an incorrect figure for the U.S. Morgan was also misstating Britain’s gun-related homicide rate in 2011 which was actually 59 NOT the 35 he repeats over and over again. Not surprising that facts really aren’t important to folks such as Morgan. But that’s just the beginning, because what anti-gun media members such as Morgan completely ignore is the differing crime rates relative to the population. “The U.S. has the highest gun ownership rate in the world, an average of 88 guns per 100 people,” Swann stated. “That puts it first in the world for gun ownership.” If there was a significant correlation between gun ownership and homicide, America should therefore be one of the highest nations in the world in terms of gun-related murders per fixed number of people. Not so said Swann. “Honduras, El Salvador, and Jamaica have higher rates. So do 24 other countries. The U.S., despite being number one in gun ownership is number 28 in gun homicide with a rate of 2.97 per 100,000 people.” But here’s where it really gets interesting. “The UK has the second highest overall crime rate in the EU,” Swann said. “The UK has the fifth highest robbery rate, the fourth highest burglary rate. But more importantly, the EU named Britain as the most violent country in the EU.” Swann noted that in the UK, there are 2,034 violent crimes per 100,000 people. By contrast, there are 466 violent crimes per 100,000 here in America. “We’re not even in the top ten,” Swann said. This means that Britain’s violent crime rate is over five times that of the U.S. Not surprisingly, Morgan chooses to ignore this statistic. Also of note, Swann’s sources for some of the numbers he cited were Britain's Daily Mail and Guardian. Maybe that will convince Morgan – but don’t hold your breath.

Violent crime – including violent crime using guns – has dropped massively over the past 20 years. The violent crime rate - which includes murder, rape, and beatings - is half of what it was in the early 1990s. And the violent crime rate involving the use of weapons has also declined at a similar pace. 2. Mass shootings have not increased in recent years. Despite terrifying events like Sandy Hook or last summer’s theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, mass shootings are not becoming more frequent. “There is no pattern, there is no increase,” says criminologist James Allen Fox of Northeastern University, who studies the issue. Other data shows that mass killings peaked in 1929. 3. Schools are getting safer. Across the board, schools are less dangerous than they used be. Over the past 20 years, the rate of theft per 1,000 students dropped from 101 to 18. For violent crime, the victimization rate per 1,000 students dropped from 53 to 14. 4. There Are More Guns in Circulation Than Ever Before. Over the past 20 years, virtually every state in the country has liberalized gunownership rules and many states have expanded concealed carry laws that allow more people to carry weapons in more places. There around 300 million guns in the United States and at least one gun in about 45 percent of all households. Yet the rate of gun-related crime continues to drop. 5. “Assault Weapons Bans” Are Generally Ineffective. While many people are calling for reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons – an arbitrary category of guns that has no clear definition – research shows it would have no effect on crime and violence. “Should it be renewed,” concludes a definitive study, “the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.” The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is as horrifing a crime as can be imagined. It rips at the country’s heart and the call to action is strong and righteous. But as Joe Biden and his panel of experts consider changes to gun laws and school-safety policies, they need to lead with their heads and not just their hearts. Over the past dozen years, too many policies – the Patriot Act, the war in Iraq, the TARP bailouts – have been ruled by emotion and ideology. Passing sweeping new restrictions on Second Amendment rights won’t heal the pain and loss we all feel but just may create many more problems in our future.

It took Boeing several scandals and the termination of Mike Sears who went to Yale or was it Jail. That is one of the worst Managment failures of Boeing. Boeing looked a gift hoarse in the mouth due to short term profit goals Boeing in return for that decision, was never offered the next new plane on the government dime. The reason Boeing bought MD was the defense programa nd it lost the JSF, and was changed from a good company to a outsource business model company with Harry Stonecipher and now James M. No wonder both Northrop and LMT stock price is much better than Boeing for the last year, Boeing mangement forgets the largest entitiy is not Boeing , it is the Federal government. do not work with the government and when a Democratic President pro union man is in power and now SPEEA negotiation and the 787 disaster, timing for SPEEA is good , bad for Boeing .

Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood went a step further: "I believe this plane is safe, and I would have absolutely no reservations about boarding one of these planes and taking a flight," he said.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1357925447133</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 12:30:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357925448141-150</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing -SPEEA contract negotiation resume today</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357922029531</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:33:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thankyou for the thumbs up !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357925448141</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 12:30:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357925543419-151</Id><Topic><Title>HUEVOS RANCHERO</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357923238827</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:53:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GUMMI BEAR PAWS ALAS THE GREENBAY PECKERS/CHEESEHEADS -THE STICK DON'T REMEMEBR THE KEEZAR DAYZ SO WELL</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357925543419</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 12:32:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357926242805-152</Id><Topic><Title>The ROOT cause of these problems is BOSTON !</Title><Username>frankmalone90</Username><Timestamp>1357921399825</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:23:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Security let frankmalkone90 through all checkpoints even though he has no papers and crossed the from egypt to the promised land in egypt they promised a five stare hotel from 3-6 am apparently there was a problem with NO PAPERS que ?</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357926242805</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 12:44:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357926311750-153</Id><Topic><Title>The 2nd Amendment exist to Protect us from the government</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357910781024</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 08:26:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sounds like insane talking , hopefully for your sake the SWAT team will only injure you and you will be able to rest peacefully the rest of your life in a mental hospital.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1357926311750</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 12:45:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357926483271-154</Id><Topic><Title>Quality Issues with Boeing Airlines - My opinion</Title><Username>pvemul</Username><Timestamp>1357751310946</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 12:08:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well BA is dipping and BA needs your money go for it !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357926483271</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 12:48:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357926746077-155</Id><Topic><Title>The ROOT cause of these problems is BOSTON !</Title><Username>frankmalone90</Username><Timestamp>1357921399825</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:23:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see no problem many people have no papers who like to smoke cigarrettes between their thumb and second finger... just in case</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357926746077</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 12:52:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357927273935-156</Id><Topic><Title>Ys Just Gotta Love it When A bleeding Heart Liberal Gets Educated</Title><Username>libsrwimpy3</Username><Timestamp>1357923196924</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:53:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Aside from the fundamental issue that this post has nothing whatsoever to do with Boeing, comparing raw numbers of crimes in the UK to those in the US is misleading in and of itself. The statistic of violent crimes per 100,000 people is likely to be effected by a wide variety of factors. Chief among them is population density. The more people per square mile, the more likely that crime will occur. The UK has 243 million people living in 94 thousand square miles (or an average of about 670 people per square mile). The US has about 316 million people living in 3.8 million square miles (or about 83 people per square mile). Obviously these national averages don't take into account that urban environments are much more densely populated than rural environments, but to make your comparison of violent crimes between the two countries valid, you need to compare apples to apples. For example, if you compare the crime statistics of London (population 8.2 million; density 13,466 per square mile) to New York City (population 8.2 million; density 27,013 per square mile), you might be getting closer to a valid comparison. At the end of the day, as others have noted, Morgan's specific numbers may have been off or outdated, but even the numbers you acknowledge, 7923 gun deaths in the US (not including those you term "justifiable" which is a matter of interpretation) vs. 59 in the UK, show that the order of magnitude was not off.</Msg><Username>tinkdprthghts</Username><Timestamp>1357927273935</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 13:01:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357927320829-157</Id><Topic><Title>FAA statement</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1357925447133</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 12:30:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FAA is looking into it, as is their job.

If there is evidence of cheating or evasion, then it's a whole new ballgame.

The largest city is South Lake Tahoe, which is also divided at the state line and mostly in California. My point was that, if you were going to live in "Tahoe", you would be best to live on the Nevada side. Sales tax rates are also less. Property taxes are comparable. Calif = 1% of assessed value (+ muscellaneous "tax assessment districts" and bonds), Nevada = 0.35 x Assessed Value x 3.2%. Perhaps I should have also said, "retired". Since California has lost its mind on taxation, some of my friends, most of them still working, have been talking about moving out. At some point, the "great weather" does not sell anymore.

Li-Ion batteries are used EVERYWHERE. How's your iPhone, iPad, or iPod, Blackberry, Galaxy3, MP3 player, etc. doing? If Apple and Samsung can get the Li-Ion batteries working without significant issues, how much more an airplane which goes through rigorous design and testing. Sometimes, there are failures. For planes, that includes engines, wings, flaps, rudders, landing gear, what have you. Sometimes the failure results are catastrophic, often they are not. It is good that the U.S. FAA indicates that it will conduct a further review of safety. That is welcome, but probably will not unveil much related to Li-Ion batteries. This technology was first developed 40 years ago, with first commercial/consumer use in the early 1990's. To show their extent of use, they are included in commercial and government satellites which have no ability to be serviced (change them out) and are required to operate for 12 to 15 years.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1357928599317</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 13:23:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357928667786-168</Id><Title>Fifty-one Ways To Leave Your Lover</Title><Msg>I ain;t boning/deep poling your kind no more</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357928667786</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 13:24:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357929479593-169</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing warned on the 787 , a prescient warning on outsourcing comes true!</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357919535437</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:52:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh no , a thubs down</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357929479593</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 13:37:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357929606405-170</Id><Topic><Title>We are going to Tahoe...</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357882074769</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 00:27:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apperently you only blow your hole and have never been there.

I was at the conference when he presented his paper (he did it remotely from a hospital bed over the speaker system which made it even more powerful). The really great part was that there were a bunch of senior engineering managers (mostly MacDac clones) sitting on a podium in front of us during the whole thing. Senior man was David Swain, a Stonecipher protege. His face turned beet red and he was so mad when it was over he couldn't speak for a minute or two. When he did respond it was the usual useless gibberish you got from that crowd. Shortly after that the fellowship rules were changed to allow the firing of Senior Tech Fellows (they do not have SPEEA protection). What made the paper so powerful was that it stated the problem in a language that the managers could understand even though he was a highly regarded structural engineer. Outsourcing made no sense from a business as well as an engineering perspective and that was one of the main reasons that Douglas lost out to Boeing in the commercial airplane market. If the same business model was applied to Boeing by the Stonecipher crowd it would happen to Boeing. Sadly, the 787 proved he was right from both an engineering and business perspective. The only reason Boeing hasn't gone down has been the steady cash flow coming in from the legacy models and a very favorable market.

All of those reasons, a lot of them brought about by the economic crisis, influenced the delivery date. Of course Boeing would have delayed if safety had been a concern, but those other issues were the defining ones. And EVERY model has been scrutinized before and after production has begun. Everyone who has grown accustomed to the reliability of the 737 or 747 has forgotten various issues and upgrades those models have undergone over the years. Not many things come off the drawing board perfect.

Next, the military do not fly their very special planes 24 hours per day 7 days per week 365 days perr year. The military planes that are carbon fiber , are not banged aroound by ground crew and hundreds of flying customers, if there is a down problem with a military plane they have several more planes to fly and unlimited government funding on the spot if needed, to fix the downed plane. This is backed by the money printing press and black programs funding. I will take your opinion under advisement, Hart-Smith is my advisor, I will go with his opinion he said the cheap ooutsourcing was what bankrupt another passenger plane making company and he said the same thing will happen to Boeing. Each 787 delivered cost 400 million ot make and the return is 100 million after late penality and multiple plane order discount. Once more if the 787 was safe the FAA and the NSTb and 15 firetrucks and 40 firefoghter would not be lossing a lithium batter out of the plan as it can not be stopped once it catches fire. per the Chief 787 Boeing Enginerr that alone make the plane unsafe , not to mention the several other issues that you claim were taken care of with an extra 3.5 years to be sure the 787 is safe.

Profs would see salary pools of 5 percent during the first two years of the contract and 4 percent in the last two years. Techs would see salary pools of 4 percent annually for the duration of the contract, with an additional lump sum payment equaling 1 percent of their salary in years one and two. Under this revised offer, profs would average $85,600 in additional pay and performance-based incentive payments (EIP) over the life of the agreement.Techs would average $61,200 in additional pay and incentive payments. Our proposals on health care (Washington, Oregon, California and Utah) and retirement remain unchanged from our pre-Thanksgiving offer. Throughout these negotiations, our goal has remained the same — a market-leading contract that rewards employees while keeping the company and workforce competitive for future work. We’ve worked to resolve our differences with the SPEEA negotiations team, withdrawing many proposals that were important to the company. Since our initial offer back in September, we’ve shown considerable movement by increasing our salary proposal twice and revising our medical proposal to lower paycheck contributions. We encourage you to visit the negotiations website where you’ll find new fact sheets with all the details of the new offer, as well as an updated Pay &amp; Benefits Estimator that shows what the offer means to you. Boeing and SPEEA’s negotiations teams have agreed to continue discussions next Wednesday.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1357936377534</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:32:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357937408848-196</Id><Topic><Title>time to buy again</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1357673764472</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:36:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Heck no ! sold yesterday at 77.11 ,,,tried to buy back today at 74.31 It did'nt get that low.</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1357937408848</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:50:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357937425930-197</Id><Title>boeng expands in Utah</Title><Msg>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Aircraft maker Boeing Co. announced Friday it will expand manufacturing operations in Utah by opening a third factory in the Salt Lake City area to fabricate a tail piece for the Boeing 787. Boeing is taking over a factory originally built by KraftMaid Cabinetry in the Salt Lake suburb of West Jordan. Boeing has 575 employees in Utah and said it will add 100, paying factory wages that state officials said will average $65,000 a year. Hiring will begin immediately for engineers and project managers, and Boeing will add production workers after converting the KraftMaid factory into a production facility for carbon-fiber aircraft parts, said Craig Trewet, director of Boeing Salt Lake. Chicago-based Boeing assembles the 787 in Seattle and has had operations in Utah for 25 years. It makes flight deck parts, has a paint shop and assembles the 787's vertical tail fin at other locations near Salt Lake's airport. In West Jordan, Boeing will make horizontal stabilizers for the aircraft's tail. "The site we've chosen is an ideal location to add composite manufacturing capability focused on Boeing's key business strategies," said Ross Bogue, vice president and general manager of Boeing Fabrication. "This new facility will provide a real competitive advantage in our supply chain." Boeing said it will take two years to redesign the 850,000-square-foot factory. Gov. Gary Herbert joined company officials Friday for the announcement and has authorized tax incentives and other benefits for Boeing's expansion. The company will be entitled to a 20-percent rebate on payroll, income and sales taxes at the new location for a maximum incentive of $1.3 million over 10 years, said Michael Sullivan, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Economic Development. In addition, Utah offered Boeing up to $225,000 in matching funds to train new manufacturing workers. That makes it more likely that Boeing will hire Utah residents rather than bring in workers from other locations, Sullivan said.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1357937425930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:50:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357938784471-198</Id><Title>747-8</Title><Msg>Are there any orders for this plane or this model 747-8 will be phased out.

The truth is that most of southern Europe is experiencing a full-blown economic depression right now. Sadly, most Americans are paying very little attention to what is going on across the Atlantic. But they should be watching, because this is what happens when nations accumulate too much debt. The United States has the biggest debt burden of all, and eventually what is happening over in Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and Greece is going to happen over here as well. The following are 20 facts about the collapse of Europe that everyone should know... #1 10 Months: Manufacturing activity in both France and Germany has contracted for 10 months in a row. #2 11.8 Percent: The unemployment rate in the eurozone has now risen to 11.8 percent – a brand new all-time high. #3 17 Months: In November, Italy experienced the sharpest decline in retail sales that it had experienced in 17 months. #4 20 Months: Manufacturing activity in Spain has contracted for 20 months in a row. #5 20 Percent: It is estimated that bad loans now make up approximately 20 percent of all domestic loans in the Greek banking system at this point. #6 22 Percent: A whopping 22 percent of the entire population of Ireland lives in jobless households. #7 26 Percent: The unemployment rate in Greece is now 26 percent. A year ago it was only 18.9 percent. #8 26.6 Percent: The unemployment rate in Spain has risen to an astounding 26.6 percent. #9 27.0 Percent: The unemployment rate for workers under the age of 25 in Cyprus. Back in 2008, this number was well below 10 percent. #10 28 Percent: Sales of French-made vehicles in November were down 28 percent compared to a year earlier. #11 36 Percent: Today, the poverty rate in Greece is 36 percent. Back in 2009 it was only about 20 percent. #12 37.1 Percent: The unemployment rate for workers under the age of 25 in Italy – a brand new all-time high. #13 44 Percent: An astounding 44 percent of the entire population of Bulgaria is facing “severe material deprivation”. #14 56.5 Percent: The unemployment rate for workers under the age of 25 in Spain – a brand new all-time high. #15 57.6 Percent: The unemployment rate for workers under the age of 25 in Greece – a brand new all-time high. #16 60 Percent: Citigroup is projecting that there is a 60 percent probability that Greece will leave the eurozone within the next 12 to 18 months. #17 70 Percent: It has been reported that some homes in Spain are being sold at a 70% discount from where they were at during the peak of the housing bubble back in 2006. At this point there areapproximately 2 million unsold homes in Spain. #18 200 Percent: The debt to GDP ratio in Greece is rapidly approaching 200 percent. #19 1997: According to the Committee of French Automobile Producers, 2012 was the worst year for the French automobile industry since 1997. #20 2 Million: Back in 2005, the French auto industry produced about 3.5 million vehicles. In 2012, that number dropped to about 2 million vehicles. One thing that these shocking numbers cannot convey is the tremendous amount of pain that many average Europeans are living through on a daily basis at this point. To get a peek into what life is like in Greece these days, check out this short excerpt from a recent Bloomberg article… Anastasia Karagaitanaki, 57, is a former model and cafe owner in Thessaloniki, Greece. After losing her business to the financial crisis, she now sleeps on a daybed next to the refrigerator in her mother’s kitchen and depends on charity for food and insulin for her diabetes. “I feel like my life has slipped through my hands,” said Karagaitanaki, whose brother also shares the one-bedroom apartment. “I feel like I’m dead.” For thousands of Greeks like Karagaitanaki, the fabric of middle-class life is unraveling. Teachers, salaries slashed by a third, are stealing electricity. Families in once-stable neighborhoods are afraid to leave their homes because of rising street crime. All over Europe, people that have lost all hope are actually setting themselves on fire in a desperate attempt to draw attention. Millions of formerly middle class Europeans have lost everything and are becoming increasingly desperate. Suicide and crime are skyrocketing all over southern Europe and massive street riots are erupting on a regular basis. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning. Things are going to get even worse for Europe. Meanwhile, those of us living in the United States smugly look down our noses at Europe because we are still living in a false bubble of debt-fueled prosperity. But eventually we will feel the sting of austerity as well. The recent fiscal cliff deal was an indication of that. Taxes are going up and government spending is at least going to slow down. It won’t be too long before the effects of that are felt in the economy. And of course the reality of the situation is that the U.S. economy really did not perform very well at all during 2012 when you take a look at the numbers. The cold, hard truth is that the U.S. economy has been declining for a very long time, and there are a whole bunch of reasons to expect that our decline will accelerate even further in 2013. So if you are an American, don’t laugh at what is happening over in Europe at the moment. We are headed down the exact same path that they have gone, and we are going to experience the same kind of suffering that they are going through right now. Use these last few “bubble months” to prepare for what is ahead. At some point this “hope bubble” will disappear and then the time for preparation will be over.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357938927106</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 16:15:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357939348478-200</Id><Topic><Title>747-8</Title><Username>ariel.lacson</Username><Timestamp>1357938784471</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 16:13:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are still building and delivering them.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1357939348478</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 16:22:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357939698506-201</Id><Topic><Title>Man Shoots Robbery Suspect, Protects 2-Month-Old Son</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1357830787108</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:13:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>..Two burglars took 14 people hostage overnight at a Nordstrom Rack store in Los Angeles, stabbing one hostage in the neck and sexually assaulting another.

"Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain."

A: Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group, called it "pretty remarkable." "There does appear to be a systematic problem either with the manufacturing process or with some of the technologies," he said. "At the moment, the 787 is a money-loser. Boeing doesn't expect to begin making a profit on the jet until 2015. Most analysts opinion is farther out at 2021 per analysts opinion. Didn't it take Boeing a long time to get the 787 airborne? A: Boeing applied to the FAA to make the 787 in 2003.. The first paying passengers took flight in October 2011, more than three years behind schedule. What's at stake for Boeing? A: Any more production delays could further upset the airlines that are eager to start flying the plane and cost Boeing millions of dollars in contractual penalties. If major changes are needed, the plane might weigh more, cutting its fuel efficiency. Orders could shift to the Airbus A350.

I just told a friend of mine -- even though I sit behind this microphone and I try to be civil and so forth -- I can barely contain my fury about what's going on in this country. I'm just being honest with you. I can barely contain it. I'm so frustrated by this tyranny, you have no idea. Now we can analyze it, we can intellectualize it, we can parse it and so forth and try to unravel it. But I'm just telling you, from an emotional point of view, it is just so damned infuriating to see the greatest country on the face of the earth run by a bunch of lilliputians, who are constantly attacking it from within. No discussion on the news programs about an imperial president exercising an authority he does not have under our constitution. Nothing. No discussion about all the lives saved and all the people protected as a result of the Second Amendment. Nothing. They continue to perpetuate the lie, the big lie that somehow, some new regulation, some new government fiat would have prevented what happened in Newtown, Connecticut. And then they pretend that they're for law enforcement. They pretend that they're hard on crime when they're not. We have evidence over one decade after another of how the very same people pushing for gun control against law-abiding American citizens support radical left-wing judges who are soft on criminals, support weakened sentencing rules, decriminalizing this and that. Since when was Obama strong on fighting crime? Since when has Obama supported law enforcement? But here he is, you know, 'we have to stop gun violence.' No, we have to stop violent criminals. Now, there's a fury in me -- I'm just being honest with you -- that I'm trying to contain. Biden, the #$%$ Senator from Delaware, taking his train back and forth and back and forth on Amtrak. Oh wow, what a guy. Anyway, so they may do by executive fiat -- I'm trying to read between the lines -- a national gun database. Now, why would we need a national gun database? Well, listen, we need to know who has the weapons, at all times, and how many weapons they have and what weapons they have. How come? Why? The guy that killed all those people in Newtown, Connecticut, we know who he was and we know who had the weapons, his mother. So what does this national database have to do with anything? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Oh, okay, but we need one anyway, right? To prevent what exactly? To prevent what?

If I agree with Mr Aboulafia or Hart-Smith or techpath2000 or you, why take credit for them or you Ron if I agree with you. If I do not agree with all but part of what you have to say I may just post what you have to say if it is good , based on my opinion. For example I do not care for foulmouther constantly posting airplane orders but I do not suggest he stop it is his message board too. Ron, since I am a very poor in the grammer or spelling department, it is just easier on me and for you to read the post that covers my thoughts on what is important . If it is a stock like NOK that I made 24% on or JRCC when it went up 100% during the last few weeks of the presidential election and I knew it would, I will post my thoughts. there are several reader who watch for my tips and probably make some money on them, then there are a lot of readers who just slam everything who cares so far you seem ok to me except I guess you annoyed with me now. I post the stock market trading becauses it is mine. I did point out it was from Mr Aboulafia , it seems to me and at least 4 other thumbs down readers that you done me wrong here, Ron. Finally , if we all were limited to original writings and original readings then only one person could be Shakespear and no person could quote or read him by your reasoning. If you do not like me , or my user coments I suggest you put me on ignor and have a good day sir!</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357963923325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 23:12:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357966380612-250</Id><Topic><Title>What does a coplete FAA review mean is it serious problem for Boeing ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357948202578</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 18:50:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BTW, Ron I figure you already know which is from me and which is a professional opinion. You mean you really don't know, then why are you attempting to be my English teacher or publishing editor here ? . Ron your writing skills are excellent and your understanding of the 400 million loss on the 787 was right. My skills are limited to stock trading and my disgust for the Chicago outsourcing MD business model that is killing the once geat Boeing company from within. . I do believe in Hart Smith and he said it all when he said outsourcing would lead Boeing into bankruptcy and he was right. Ron, while it may appear to you that do not I care about Boeing, in fact, I do and I want Boeing to be wressled away from the people in Chicago that are destroying Boeing from within . Ron, , that is a common problem with rich companies, politically connected people who are useless leaders but with political power(FBI) are given a postion that they have no qualification for.(SKA) Look at the work history of James M he is a total failure , was passed over at GE and had to leave, while at MMM the company did poorly and now is doing better, he got theBoeing job due to political connections(FBI) and the guy who hired him Lewis Platt had no airplane manufacturing experience. Lewis Platt , well they just knew Mulally was part of the old managment versus union problem , since he could not adapt they let him go. Ron, that was the best thing that could happen to Mulally, he actually larned from that turn out, and then really started to work with Ford unions by holding meetings with the union on a monthly basis and not scapegoatig the union. Ron, it might seem to you that I love Unions I do not. Ron, it is not the union, the union represents the workers and they give the input to the union who pass that on to the company. Ron , sure union do a lot of evil too. What Boeing got in return for Phil Condit buying a bankrupt MD was a continued contempt for unions with the added mismangement in a higher gear becases Boeing then became a outsourced business model manufacturer on abig scale with the 787. Boeing went from Phil Condit, in my opinion, the worst of the old school Boeing CEO's to an even worse Md mangment team , Phil ended up giving Boeing a Stonecipher and then to a totally incomepetent James Mac, who in his entire career was a failure. He had his 5 year to proove himself at Boeing, , the 787 is his contribution. Ron I know it was alrady going with Stonecipher but James Mac if he cared , could have turned the company around or maybe not due to the heavy Mac men on the Board. The 737 and the 777 were not James Mac's and while the sonic crusier was Mulallys failure the 787 was a morfed version that this Mac failed company went to and then add the Md outsourcing cheap ways and you have the worst of everything. Now Ron dont tell me you enjoyed reading this over professional past and drops that I think are spot on .
