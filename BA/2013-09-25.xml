SEATTLE, Sept. 19, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing (BA) and GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the commercial aircraft leasing and financing arm of General Electric (GE), announced today that they have completed an order for 10 787-10 Dreamliners. The order, valued at $2.9 billion at list prices, completes the commitment originally announced during the 2013 Paris Air Show in June and builds momentum in the airplane leasing market for the 787-10. "These airplanes are an excellent addition to our broad portfolio of modern, fuel-efficient aircraft," said GECAS President and CEO Norman C.T. Liu. "This order enables us to offer our airline customers an airplane with the lowest operating costs." The new 787-10, launched in June 2013, will extend and complement the family, carrying 300 to 330 passengers up to 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 km) and accommodating more than 90 percent of the world's twin-aisle routes. The 787-10 also will be 25 percent more fuel-efficient than airplanes of its size today and more than 10 percent better than anything being offered by the competition for the future. "As a leader in the leasing industry, GECAS's 787-10 order is a strong statement about the capabilities of this highly efficient airplane," said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. "The 787-10 will provide GECAS customers the efficiencies and passenger comforts needed to succeed in an increasingly competitive marketplace." The 787-10 will feature the 787 family's unique interior. The interior technologies make the passenger experience more enjoyable, including large, dimmable windows; cleaner air; higher humidity; lower cabin altitude; bigger stowage bins; soothing LED lighting and a smoo</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1380109075480</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 07:37:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380109132048-28</Id><Topic><Title>787 status 9-20</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379688857337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 10:54:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1380109132048</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 07:38:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380109219978-29</Id><Topic><Title>unmanned F-16 milestone</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379964201822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 15:23:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awesome !!!</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1380109219978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 07:40:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380109294285-30</Id><Topic><Title>BA maintenance</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1380036717458</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 11:31:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good news</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1380109294285</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 07:41:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380109370313-31</Id><Topic><Title>boeing contracts</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1380058632358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 17:37:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the info</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1380109370313</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 07:42:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380110596997-32</Id><Title>Why ObamaCare is so Unaffordable</Title><Msg>Mike Adams Natural News September 25, 2013 Right now, all across America, employees are receiving notices that their insurance coverage is being dropped because it isn’t “compliant” with Obamacare. Simultaneously, employers everywhere are slashing jobs, cutting hours and downsizing their operations just to stay afloat by avoiding the most punishing requirements of Obamacare. Across the economy, Obamacare is devastating American workers and casting tens of millions of people into a state of despair. Image: Obamacare. Why is Obamacare — the “Affordable Care Act” — so unaffordable? Why is it causing jobs, hours and insurance policies to be gutted all across America? Because it was designed as a political weapon to destroy private sector jobs so that more people would become dependent on government entitlements, food stamps and welfare programs. Mass victimization is a political strategy, and Obamacare is the weapon It’s time you learned the truth about Obamacare and how victimization is a political “weapon of mass destruction.” The Democratic party thrives primarily on victimization. The more destitute workers become, the more they demand handouts from politicians, and no party is more willing to widely distribute handouts than the Democratic party. Ensnaring people in a cycle of poverty and dependence is the democrats’ long-term re-election strategy. The more people who live in poverty, in other words, the more powerful the Democrats become. (In fairness, the Republicans’ long-term re-election strategy is to ensnare nations in endless wars, conflict and engineered terrorism. But that’s another article altogether. For the record, I endorse the platform of the Canary Party.) Because of this dynamic, the Democratic party is terrified by individuals who can take care of themselves. Self-empowered people quickly learn they don’t need as much government in their lives, and they tend to vote for smaller government.

Even the 767 got more net orders than the 787. And no one is ordering the plane that is actually being delivered now: the 787-8. New orders made now for the -10 won't see deliveries in this decade. Carriers are ordering under the assumption that, given another decade, BA can finally figure out how to build this plane.

Note the program accounting for the 747-8. They ran up billions in development expenses for years. Those expenses were deferred; they sat on the balance sheet. Boeing promised they would be matched to revenues as the plane was delivered. On first delivery Boeing said they didn't have enough orders for the 747-8 and would never make a profit. They've taken over $3 billion in charges on that program so far. They call these "non-recurring" so people don't include them when talking about the company's EPS. Also look at the program accounting for the C-17. They've recognized profits for years and deferred expenses. Now that the program is being shut down those deferred expenses will start showing up as "non-recurring" charges. There will be a $100 million charge this quarter, and you can be certain there will be $100s of millions more. The company has reported profits on that program in every one of the last 70 quarters. After all the charges are done I doubt the program will show positive profits over its entire life. The accounting block for the 787 is 1100. Boeing has historically never used an accounting block greater than 500. They are using such a large accounting block because that's the only way they can claim profitability. I seriously doubt they will ever deliver 1100 units, and even if they do there will be so many "non-recurring" charges to the program any claims of program "profit" will be economic fiction.

The health insurance exchanges, marketplaces for uninsured people and consumers who don't get health benefits from their employers, are scheduled to launch on Oct. 1 for an enrollment period that runs through the end of March for 2014 coverage. This latest analysis of what the health insurance plans will cost comes just six days before people will be able to find out what they'll actually pay. "For millions of Americans, these new options will finally make health insurance work within their budget," Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said during a conference call with reporters Tuesday. Reporters were provided access to the report prior to its publication. The figures released by the Department of Health and Human Services represent averages and prices will vary widely by geographic location as well as family size, age, tobacco use and income. Even the average price of a so-called bronze plan, designed to cover 60 percent of medical expenses not counting monthly premiums, masks big variation. The average price of the cheapest bronze plan in Minnesota is $144 while in Wyoming, comparable coverage costs $425 on average, not including subsides. For people who currently are uninsured and who qualify for financial assistance or enrollment in Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor, the average prices look to be low: 56 percent of uninsured will be able to get coverage for less than $100 a month per person, Gary Cohen, director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, said during the conference call.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1380118967282</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 10:22:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380119464747-43</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Target Raised</Title><Username>duffymagoo</Username><Timestamp>1380114744066</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 09:12:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is the second time since the last earnings release that the Bernstein analyst has cut numbers and raised his price target.

His revenue estimate for Q3 was cut from $22.5 billion to $22.4 billion after the last release, and today he cut to $22.1 billion. With these cuts all his estimates are below consensus. Watch for other analysts to follow suit as we approach the earnings release. They will cut estimates so Boeing can "beat", then they will raise their price targets based on some forecasted metric 5 to 10 years in the future.

No one will want to operate those early builds that have been sitting around for years and have all sorts of custom, unique modifications.

Guess who loses ??? Suspected thief shot, killed in Maple Valley confrontation King County prosecutors will review self-defense statutes in weighing whether a former Marine was justified in fatally shooting a suspected truck thief in Maple Valley. By Jennifer Sullivan Seattle Times staff reporter King County prosecutors will be reviewing state self-defense statutes in weighing whether a former Marine was justified when he shot and killed a suspected car thief outside a relative’s Maple Valley home early Tuesday. The man told King County sheriff’s investigators he walked out of his aunt’s home shortly after midnight and confronted a man who was inside his Toyota pickup. Deputies say the former Marine, who was armed with a 9-mm handgun, had a concealed-weapon permit. The man ordered the alleged car prowler to the ground and the suspect briefly complied, a law-enforcement source said. But when the suspect heard that police had been summoned, he got up and headed for a stolen Honda that his girlfriend had parked nearby, a law-enforcement source said. The Marine fired at a tire on the Honda, the source said. The suspect responded by pulling out his gun and firing, said King County sheriff’s spokesman Charlie Akers.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1380134807704</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 14:46:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380134853068-82</Id><Topic><Title>and the DARWIN award for this week goes to . .</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1380134807704</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 14:46:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Marine fired at a tire on the Honda, the source said. The suspect responded by pulling out his gun and firing, said King County sheriff’s spokesman Charlie Akers. The law-enforcement source said it appears the Honda was then driven toward the former Marine. The gunfire that killed the alleged car thief did not harm his girlfriend, Akers said. The man who was killed, a 27-year-old, has not been formally identified. His girlfriend, who was arrested in connection with an outstanding warrant for burglary, has also not been identified. Akers said questions about self-defense have been brought to his attention. “Is it possible he (the former Marine) could be charged with reckless discharge (of a firearm)? Maybe. Could he be charged with murder? I doubt it,” Akers said. Authorities say the former Marine told them he received special training in how to shoot at cars while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Akers added that the alleged car thief was “bringing a gun to commit felony crimes.” “I think self-defense goes out the window,” he said in reference to the dead man. Property owners can use “reasonable force” to defend their property, Mary Fan, an associate professor of law at the University of Washington, said Tuesday. “Usually, you can’t use deadly force to defend your property, but when it comes to self-defense laws, we are in the West and our laws tend to be more protective of the property owner,” Fan said. “Bottom line is, your use of force has to be proportional,” she said. Sheriff’s deputies were called to the shooting scene in the 21800 block of Southeast 236th Place at 12:12 a.m. after a report of someone trying to steal a vehicle and shots being fired. Upon arriving, deputies found the alleged thief dead, Akers said. The former Marine was questioned and released by deputies. Kristin Hague, of Maple Valley, identified the former Marine as her nephew, according to KING 5. She said he was at her house for a family get-together.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1380134853068</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 14:47:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380135579336-83</Id><Topic><Title>Missing low pressure fuel filters!.........really?</Title><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1380133213539</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 14:20:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boing is like Obama blaming everything on everyone else.

The deal is the latest blockbuster order from Asia's budget carriers for Airbus or Boeing (NYSE:BA - News) jets, as a huge surge in the number of middle-class travelers with disposable incomes pushes up industry traffic forecasts. Wednesday's announcement in Paris confirmed a Reuters report on Tuesday. Of the 92 jets, 62 are set to become firm orders with purchase rights - or options with undefined delivery dates - for a further 30. The airline plans to lease eight more planes. The plane order was part of an economic package signed during a visit to Paris by Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, but only materialized after lengthy negotiations.</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380137180924</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:26:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380137182862-87</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Target Raised</Title><Username>duffymagoo</Username><Timestamp>1380114744066</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 09:12:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If it gets to $127 or $146....I will have some skin in the game</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1380137182862</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:26:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380137354392-88</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Scientists: IPCC Report Must Communicate Consensus</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1380042861094</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 13:14:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly the reverse, Bob.

BA has shown no sign of wanting a stock split, and none of the other companies have won the Korean order yet, either.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1380138398750</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:46:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380138520757-96</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus signed 6 billion order with China has backlog of 5000 planes Airbus stock has bettered Boeing for years</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380120176109</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 10:42:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>let me respond har har har har har and har is Paul Allen still your close personal friend whistle har har har har har what do you think about that from your apartment estate in Everett downtown by the shipyard low rent area</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380138520757</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:48:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380138620764-97</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus signed 6 billion order with China has backlog of 5000 planes Airbus stock has bettered Boeing for years</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380120176109</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 10:42:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>78% is the opportunity cost that was missed by not being in Airbus up 153% or tsla up almost 800% yep that is no good</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380138620764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:50:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380138732308-98</Id><Topic><Title>now in 57 days tesla is up 57% boeing not so good still 16% Airbus soaring with airplane orders</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380137770222</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:36:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So are you saying you bought TSLA 3 years ago and have made the 798% ?</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1380138732308</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:52:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380138852538-99</Id><Topic><Title>POOR WAYNE, FRED, ZIPD, ELON WHATEEEEEVER...</Title><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1380138703255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:51:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You shouldn't pick on the mentally challenged.</Msg><Username>mrstock52</Username><Timestamp>1380138852538</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:54:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380138925005-100</Id><Topic><Title>charleston</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1380125834366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 12:17:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LAN air 787 is on a flight this afternoon.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1380138925005</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:55:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380138961349-101</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing prepares for a tongue lashing on the 787 from a customer on poor quality 787 dreamfailure outsourcing plane</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1379962400495</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 14:53:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lets remind the Boeing stock lover group, who mostly admit they own no Boeing stock or , tsla or airbus stock with that kind of commitment, then they are just stumping the BA stock for suckering investors into Boeing a worse stock then airbus up 153% to 78% for BA in 3 years and missing tsla up 798% for 3 years</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380138961349</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:56:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380139087376-102</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus signed 6 billion order with China has backlog of 5000 planes Airbus stock has bettered Boeing for years</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380120176109</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 10:42:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wayne, err Fred, err Veronica, err George, err Elon is a special kind of retarted.</Msg><Username>mrstock52</Username><Timestamp>1380139087376</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 15:58:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380139240499-103</Id><Topic><Title>LOT 787 issue</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1380133309546</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 14:21:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is a manufacturing idiom that inspection does not add quality to a product, and on the face of it, that is true: only engineering and production workers add quality to a product.

William Robert “Tosh” Plumlee started his career as a CIA contract pilot in the late 1950s, delivering guns and ammunition on behalf of the agency to Fidel Castro.

But does it really matter what I think about the fate of those that reject Jesus? Only what the Word of God has to say is important. There are several points that you made. Why do I repeat the message? Well, why do people re-ask the question? So I offer my perspective - my right, just as they offered their perspective. Have you noticed that you never question their motives for bringing up the subject of God, Jesus, the Bible, etc. But my responses alone merit scathing replies with various unflattering commentary - don't worry my feelings are not hurt, perhaps scraped. You mention compromising (or uncompromising, in my case). Look, I gather that you do not regularly study the Bible. But there is a simple response. Read chapters 2 and 3 of Revelation. This will also help Hooz to understand Ghandi as well. There the Apostle John is being told by Jesus (chapters 2 and 3 are direct quotes of the Lord) about the seven churches of the time and they are also intended to illustrate the future Christian Church(es). In particular the church at Laodicea: "I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth."

According to a report in the New York Times, the Long Island Republican Congressman, who previously told his Republican colleague to “keep quiet,” had some further harsh words for the Texas Senator, calling him a “fraud” and a practitioner of “governmental terrorism.” At heart, the disagreement between the two Republicans is not over ends but means. Both wish to see Obamacare repealed, but King argues the only reasonable pathway to that goal is through the ballot box. “I believe in democracy, and I don’t mean that in a Fourth of July way,” King told the Times. Cruz, on the other hand, has engaged in what many consider a quixotic campaign to leverage the threat of a government shutdown in order to force Senate Democrats and President Obama to defund the controversial health care bill. About two-thirds of the Republicans in the House of Representatives agree with him, Mr. King asserted: “A lot of them are intimidated by the Ted Cruz wing. There were robocalls and efforts in districts throughout the country during August against Republicans, telling them why they had to support defunding Obamacare. “What do you accomplish? You build up this mailing list for Cruz, and a fund-raising list. And you also are going to generate primaries against people who I would consider to be good Republicans, pretty solid conservative Republicans.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380155178994</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 20:26:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380155344847-140</Id><Title>Ted Cruz’s Fake Filibuster Isn’t The Same As Wendy Davis’s Real One</Title><Msg>As Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) engages in a long speech in opposition to the Affordable Care Act, many of the nation’s top newspapers aren’t highlighting the Tea Party lawmaker’s efforts on their front pages, and several media outlets have actively criticized him for working to force a government shutdown. Cruz’s fellow conservatives say that amounts to the height of media bias — pointing out that outlets were much more receptive to Cruz’s colleague, State Sen. Wendy Davis (D-TX), when she filibustered a package of abortion restrictions in the Texas legislature over the summer. “Gee I wonder why NYT and WaPo and everyone else gave ecstatic coverage to Wendy Davis but not to Ted Cruz. I just can’t make sense of it!” right-wing commentator John Podhoretz tweeted. After comparing the headlines covering Davis and Cruz, the Right Scoop blog concludes “the bias couldn’t be more obvious.” The Washington Examiner laments the fact that Davis was called a media hero and Cruz is being labeled a “grandstander,” suggesting that’s probably because the media supports legalized abortion and doesn’t want to defund Obamacare. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) took the comparison even further, tweeting, “If ObamaCare were an infant Democrats would support a filibuster to kill it.” It’s true that the two senators from Texas are being received very differently in the media. But a perceived media bias isn’t the only reason why that could be the case. In fact, the disparities in the coverage could reflect the gulf between the actual impact of the lawmakers’ filibuster efforts. Davis successfully delayed an anti-abortion bill that didn’t come up for a vote during Texas’ regular session, but that was brought up for consideration during a special legislation session that was specifically convened to give lawmakers more time to enact abortion restrictions. Davis’ 11-hour filibuster — during which she wasn’t allowed to sit down, take a sip of water, cede the floor, or stray off topic — ran out the clock on that special session. The Senate was not able to vote on the abortion bill in time. Davis’ efforts were backed by hundreds of grassroots protesters who rallied against the abortion restrictions for weeks. Cruz, on the other hand, decided to launch a “speaking filibuster” against a continuing resolution that must be passed in order to keep the federal government operating. He’s standing in opposition to the funding bill because, after House Republicans added a provision to defund Obamacare, the Democratic-controlled Senate will surely strip that out of the final legislation. Cruz wants to stall the bill — and ultimately force the government to shut down next week — unless Democrats agree to defund Obamacare. But it’s not actually a real filibuster. The Senate will vote on the legislation on Wednesday afternoon regardless of how long Cruz speaks. And the effort doesn’t actually have that much support. Republican leadership has split with Cruz over this strategy, and recent polling has found that just seven percent of GOP voters actually favor defunding Obamacare in this way. And ultimately, Cruz’s filibuster doesn’t have the same policy implications as Davis’ did. Davis was attempting to block a piece of legislation from imposing new restrictions on Texas’ abortion clinics and enacting a new ban on abortion procedures after 20 weeks. Her filibuster very well could have successfully prevented those new provisions from taking effect. (Ultimately, it didn’t, because Gov. Rick Perry (R) called another special session and ensured that Democrats couldn’t delay the bill in the same ways again.) Cruz, on the other hand, is trying to attack a law that’s already in place. Even if he succeeded at forcing through a funding bill with a provision to defund Obamacare left intact, it wouldn’t actually do much to halt the central provisions at the heart of health reform. And if he succeeds at shutting down the government, that will disrupt many federal programs, but it won’t slow the enrollment process for the health law’s new insurance plans. Billions of dollars have already been appropriated to fund Obamacare, and those can’t be removed unless the law is totally repealed. Both lawmakers are from Texas. Both have spoken for a long time on the floors of two different legislative bodies. Both want to block a vote from happening. Both will ultimately be unsuccessful. Both will probably take advantage of this to raise money for their upcoming political campaigns. There are definite parallels, but the similarities end there. Davis and Cruz are operating in entirely different contexts. Even though Davis didn’t end up single-handedly blocking the package of abortion restrictions from taking effect, she had a much greater chance to effect real policy change than Cruz does — and she didn’t threaten to take the government funding hostage while doing so. The mainstream media could be making editorial decisions based on those distinctions. Conservatives have a long history of alleging a pro-choice media bias. They took a similar tact last spring, claiming that mainstream outlets were covering up the murder trial of the illegal abortion provider Kermit Gosnell (who has since been sentenced to prison for life). Just like this latest controversy, that sounded like a logical takeaway on the surface. But the evidence wasn’t there to back up those claims, either.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380155344847</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 20:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380155801640-141</Id><Topic><Title>The Genius of Barack Obama</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380062401516</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 18:40:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It takes a genius to do that.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380155801640</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 20:36:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380156454742-142</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Scientists: IPCC Report Must Communicate Consensus</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1380042861094</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-24 13:14:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chris - Possibly wrong interpretation of what I said. But for clarity: what I think relative to whether they will spend eternity with or away from God is not the determining factor. Just as (I think I gather) you think that it does not matter what one believes. Bapsycho also has that belief - which is what led to most of the discussion. He (?) said that he believes in Jesus - BUT, all paths lead to God. That is contrary to what the Bible says. And only what the Bible has to say on this matter is relevant - is what I would assert. Further, Bapsycho is the one who pressed me to say what I believe. It is not that I do not care or are not concerned - in fact, just the opposite. I share the truth (of the Bible) so that anyone can make up their own mind. It is hard to follow the truth if one does not know what it is. I could remain silent - but then I would be the same as the Laodecians. So, when you asked, do I think that they will spend eternity without God? Again, only what the Bible has to say is relevant. And, I quoted John 14:6 (I am the way, the truth, etc.) as the basis for Jesus being the only way - according to the Bible. A person that does not believe that is calling Jesus a conveyor of falsehoods. Invariably this takes us down the path of "how could a loving God, etc., etc." I know that His judgment will be perfect. I am motivated, Chris, because I know that He is a loving God and that He would have all be saved. - BB</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1380156454742</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 20:47:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380156729913-143</Id><Title>Obama the fraud in chief.....Obama care is not good enough for his family, or Congress or Federal Workers</Title><Msg>Cruz exposes the fraud for what it is.

I think not or you would have been able to spot the fallacy in Cokie Roberts lazy and incorrect analysis. Please tell me did someone challenged her to provide data to support her belief?
