But anyone who has been on this board any length of time knows who started it. Newcomers have only to read your previous dozen or so posts to get it. And when you're not questioning everything I did in my military service or subsequent civilian career you seem to latch on to deductions about my size based on a mug shot. As for making fun of your sensitive parts, I will not mention your a n u s if you will drop all your oh-so-clever cracks about what you deduced from a mug shot that I had to remove from facebook to discourage your stalking. You are the master of the ad hominem attack, with the added talent of incessantly whining about others' ad hominem attacks. And the fact that you think others on this board can't read you posts and see what I'm saying is TRUE, proves you are insane. You and Floyd are Abbot and Costello -- and it's all because I don't believe Santa Anna was invading America at the time of the Alamo, don't believe the NWO wanted John Lennon because he was about to become a U.S. citizen -- and I'm not sure the Bilderburgers are so bad if you have them with cheese and curly fries.

Is it because he’s too “extreme.” Or is it because he’s talented and impervious to the oft-applied “stupid” charge routinely thrown at conservatives? This, after all, would make him dangerous, wouldn’t it? No doubt Dean finds Cruz contemptible and on the fringe. But maybe what scares him most about Ted Cruz occupying the Oval Office is that he could, well, actually win it, and thus if he did, would seek to radically change Washington by (gasp!) reining in federal spending, balancing the budget, returning power to state and local governments, and restoring civil liberties. I shudder at the very thought. Don’t you? Liberals, for their part, reflexively turn blue in the face when they think about someone like Ted Cruz running the country. “God help us if he gets to be anything more than the Senator from Texas,” Dean intones on national television -- apparently without the slightest hint of irony. No matter that the current president’s own reputation for lawlessness isn’t just destructive; it’s probably unprecedented. And yet I’m sure this disturbing trend is perfectly acceptable -- or at least tolerable -- to Dean and his band of supporters. Why? Because President Obama is a Democrat. Three words: God help us.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1377607937358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 08:52:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377609129774-21</Id><Title>From Jeffry Bartash of Market Watch yesterday!</Title><Msg>Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected orders to drop a seasonally adjusted 4.9% in July, mainly because of a sharp decline in orders for Boeing commercial jets.

Ayo Kimathi, an acquisitions officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement who is in charge of buying weapons and ammunition for the government, operates the website named "War on the Horizon." It includes descriptions of an "unavoidable, inevitable clash with the white race." Kimathi is black. Kimathi, who calls himself the "Irritated Genie," told his supervisors that the website was set up to sell concert and lecture videos. Kimathi has been with the department since 2009. His website criticizes whites, gays, those of mixed race, and blacks who integrate with whites. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, earlier this week reported on Kimathi's role in running the site. The report showed the site's content strayed far beyond concert promotion, warning about a coming race war. The website declares, “in order for Black people to survive the 21st century, we are going to have to kill a lot of whites – more than our Christian hearts can possibly count,” the Alabama-based SPLC said in its report. One of Kimathi’s former supervisors at DHS told SPLC’s Hatewatch that, "Everybody is the office is afraid of him,” and that his co-workers are “afraid he will come in with a gun and someday go postal."</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople3</Username><Timestamp>1377611058864</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 09:44:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377611705282-24</Id><Title>Black teen girls assault white woman; charged with 'ethnic intimidation'...</Title><Msg>PITTSBURGH — Three teenage girls are facing several charges, including ethnic intimidation, after police said they brutally beat a 32-year-old woman Sunday in Pittsburgh’s North Side.

Jorge DelaPaz was arrested on charges of assault in the third degree of an elderly person, carrying a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a permit, criminal posession of a pistol and interfering with police. Police say on Sunday, Aug. 25, the elder New Haven man was eating a hamburger in the Goffe Street Park following a Toni Harp mayoral campaign-sponsored event that afternoon when he was approached by the 35-year-old. Police say DelaPaz told the elder white male that he shouldn’t be “in his park where young black kids are playing”. When the man refused an order from DelaPaz to pick up a football, DelaPaz punched the man multiple times in the face, knocking him to the ground. Police say several witnesses supported the victim’s account of the unprovoked attack.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople3</Username><Timestamp>1377611975477</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 09:59:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377613011209-26</Id><Topic><Title>“God Help Us if [Ted Cruz] Gets to be Anything More Than the Senator From Texas”</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1377607937358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 08:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's hard to figure out why Democrats and establishment Republicans have such a rabid fear of people who think our government should obey the constitution and be rational with our economy.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople3</Username><Timestamp>1377613011209</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 10:16:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377614348102-27</Id><Topic><Title>“God Help Us if [Ted Cruz] Gets to be Anything More Than the Senator From Texas”</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1377607937358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 08:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Frighten?

There is no creative thinking and the company is sinking. They need to go in and fire everyone who does not have a minimum of a bachelor’s degree. People love to argue that experience rules, well you can teach a monkey to pop rivets. These same people arguing the fact that experience rules are the same slow thinking brain dead individuals protecting their management jobs with their high school diplomas. I compare these same people to those who have been college professors for 40 years with no change in habits or real world experience.

Abedini was first arrested in the country more than a decade ago for proselytizing, but was freed and told he could return to visit family in his homeland as long as he refrained from evangelizing. When he went back to Iran last year to help build a secular orphanage, however, he was arrested. Abedini has now been imprisoned for 335 days, and is being severely abused and psychologically tortured by radicals at Evin Prison. “While we remained hopeful that Iran would use its own appeal process to finally show respect for Pastor Saeed's basic human rights, again Iran has demonstrated an utter disregard for the fundamentals of human rights,” said Jordan Sekulow, Executive Director of the ACLJ, which represents Pastor Saeed’s wife and their two children. “We are exploring all options with Pastor Saeed’s family, including options in this country and abroad to bring more pressure on Iran from the U.S. and other countries around the world. The decision is deeply troubling and underscores Iran’s continued violation of principles of freedom of religion, association, peaceful assembly, and expression.” Abedini’s wife, Naghmeh, called the decision “devastating” and expressed her disappointment with the U.S.’s silence on the case.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople3</Username><Timestamp>1377627015760</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 14:10:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377627324559-45</Id><Topic><Title>How Come the Kent Raven Hates the U.S. Constitution.</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople3</Username><Timestamp>1377626401518</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 14:00:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't oppose lower taxes or smaller government.

Meanwhile, the Arab League gave its backing to an international response calling the regime in Damascus “totally responsible for this heinous crime”. The statement by the council of the Arab League, meeting in emergency session, gives some legal cover to the US if it chooses to take action. But the council, dominated by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, also called upon the UN Security Council to overcome its divisions and agree “deterrent” measures against Syria.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1377627913453</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 14:25:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377628268383-51</Id><Topic><Title>Bush sought and received support from congress to attack Saddam whereas Obonzo says "F" congress.</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1377619465831</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 12:04:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You oppose them when they something and you whine when they don't.

In the case of Kuwait, they were clearly attacked. In the case of Afghanistan, we clearly had the right to pounce on them. In the case of Iraq, we had no business going in there, save for both Reps and Dems agreed that it should be done on the erroneous pretense of WMDs. And, continuing our misguided approach towards use of our military, we should not have attacked Libya - except that post Benghazi 9-11-2012, we should have then attacked Libya. Seems like the President has everything bass-ackwards. Now, if it is really true that Syria's mishandling of chemical weapons - not simply use - is a threat to us and our allies, then perhaps that is a valid reason.

The situation in Syria has always been a proxy war between the United States and Russia, and that is even admitted by the mega news networks who don’t ever dare to mention Obama’s secret orders demanding support for the Syrian rebels back in 2011 (in order to crush the Putin-backed Assad). But that all changed when Israel directly attacked a Russian missile depot, launching what amounts to a direct attack on the Russian forces. obama-ww3-russiaAs you may be aware if you actively read Storyleak or Infowars, Russia ultimately called upon a ‘combat readiness’ drill following this attack. More than 160,000 Russian troops from across the nation met with naval ships, aerial bombers and fighters, and other assorted military wings in order to attain ‘immediate combat readiness’. It is no coincidence that this coincided with the Israeli attacks on Russian missile depots, which the media was even able to confirm publicly through US officials after weeks of silence over the attack. As you can plainly see, Russia is not playing around. But either is Obama in his crusade to destroy any shred of hope left for the relations of the United States and Russia. It was on the Jay Leno show appearance we clearly saw this reality. Obama and Leno: Putin Is Hitler, Stalin Combined for ‘Rounding Up Gays’ It was back during his appearance on the Jay Leno show, the part which was entirely ignored in the US while simultaneously becoming a major headline internationally, where Obama and Jay directly compared Putin to Hitler and Stalin. That’s right, Hitler and Stalin. Not only did the talk show host bring this up in what surely amounts to the Obama administration goons setting it up on the teleprompter, but they went and accused Putin of ’rounding up the gays’ like Hitler rounded up the Je</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377645751198</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 19:22:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377645860339-105</Id><Topic><Title>Rogue Nations to Attack Syria !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1377627913453</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 14:25:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shooting Scoring...but what does it matter...Obama is plunging the World ever closer to a world war....and when has he ever care a fiddlers you know what about who the Constitution says declares war ?</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377645860339</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 19:24:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377646197282-106</Id><Topic><Title>The Kent Raven is part of the 9%</Title><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1377602036836</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 07:13:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, my !

Quite an alliance! Was it not the Three Musketeers who shouted “All for one and one for all” each time they sought combat? This really should be the new battle cry if – or when – the statesmen of the Western world go to war against Bashar al-Assad. The men who destroyed so many thousands on 9/11 will then be fighting alongside the very nation whose innocents they so cruelly murdered almost exactly 12 years ago. Quite an achievement for Obama, Cameron, Hollande and the rest of the miniature warlords. This, of course, will not be trumpeted by the Pentagon or the White House – nor, I suppose, by al-Qa’ida – though they are both trying to destroy Bashar. So are the Nusra front, one of al-Qa’ida’s affiliates. But it does raise some interesting possibilities. Maybe the Americans should ask al-Qa’ida for intelligence help – after all, this is the group with “boots on the ground”, something the Americans have no interest in doing. And maybe al-Qa’ida could offer some target information facilities to the country which usually claims that the supporters of al-Qa’ida, rather than the Syrians, are the most wanted men in the world. There will be some ironies, of course. While the Americans drone al-Qa’ida to death in Yemen and Pakistan – along, of course, with the usual flock of civilians – they will be giving them, with the help of Messrs Cameron, Hollande and the other Little General-politicians, material assistance in Syria by hitting al-Qa’ida’s enemies.

Do you want to review that comment you made? Well how do you stand on that now? Biden:Yes I do. I want to stand by the comment I made. The reason I made the comment was as a warning. I don't say those things lightly, Chris, you've known me for a long time. I was chairman of the judiciary committee for 17 years or its ranking member. I teach separation of powers and constitutional law. This is something I know. So I got together and brought a group of constitutional scholars together to write a piece that I'm going to deliver to the whole United State Senate pointing out the President has no constitutional authority...to take this nation to war against a county of 70 million people unless we're attacked or unless there is proof we are about to be attacked. And if he does, if he does, I would move to impeach him. The House obviously has to do that but I would lead an effort to impeach him. The reason for my doing that, I don't say it lightly, I don't say it lightly. I say it because they should understand that what they were threatening, what they were saying, what it was adding up to be, what it looked like to the rest of the world we were about to do would be the most disastrous thing that could be done in this moment in our history that I could think of.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1377652296027</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 21:11:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377652362476-137</Id><Topic><Title>Republican Policy on Syria</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1377639720966</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 17:42:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Quite likely the weirdest post ever by bB.

From NewsMax: Healthcare professionals are warning that there could be a wide gap between the number of people seeking medical treatment under Obamacare and the number of doctors available to provide it. A triple threat — more people needing care, tens of thousands of doctors reaching retirement age and a growing number of physicians getting so frustrated with bureaucracy that they want out — could undermine any improvements the law envisages. The large number of retiring doctors emphasizes the gap that is likely to widen between the number of people needing medical care and the pool of medical professionals. Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research told Fox News some doctors are even leaving their profession prematurely to avoid the headache of Obamacare. "There are a lot of doctors who are just so frustrated; today with all the bureaucracy involved in taking care of patients that they're retiring early." For many across the country, doctor shortages are already a reality: Nearly one in five Americans already lives in a region designated as having a shortage of primary care physicians, and the number of doctors entering the field isn't expected keep pace with demand. About a quarter million primary care doctors work in America now, and the Association of American Medical Colleges projects the shortage will reach almost 30,000 in two years and will grow to about 66,000 in little more than a decade. In some cases, nurses and physician assistants help fill in the gap. Dr. David Goodman of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice expects the problem to become worse nationally when about 30 million uninsured people gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act. "There's going to be lines for the newly insured, because many physicians and nurses who trained in primary care would rather practice in specialty roles." The lack of doctors and therefore lack of quality care may be another reason why this law is now "more unpopular than ever." As Obamacare begins to take full effect, it seems we can look forward to more quality time spent in waiting rooms.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1377653712825</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-27 21:35:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377655731038-144</Id><Title>The North African Golden Glassware and Ceramics Shop</Title><Msg>warning- Infidel shopers must realize if they break it they own it for any of our tribal relics and icons !!
