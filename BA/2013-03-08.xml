Going to need men of Backbone....McCain and Lindsay Grahm are obvious sellouts...story below Last night, Senator Rand Paul led a historic filibuster against Barack Obama's targeted drone strikes on American citizens. By the end of the night, numerous senators found their way to the floor to Stand With Rand! But not Senator Lindsey Graham. When Senator Graham finally found his way to the floor this morning, it wasn't to side with the American people in this common-sense fight. Instead, Lindsey Graham enthusiastically attacked Rand Paul for filibustering, saying "it's not fair to the President" because the decision to murder American citizens should "reside in the Commander in Chief." And to no one's surprise, Senator John McCain joined his statist buddy to ridicule Rand Paul for having the nerve to oppose our government murdering American citizens. What was Rand Paul's crime? He simply wanted Attorney General Eric Holder to answer the question, "does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?" Well, just this afternoon, Barack Obama caved - and Eric Holder answered Rand Paul's question with a "NO." --------------------------------------------------------------------- .....Economic Collapse is now inevitable......but there is still a chance to save the Constitution and the rule of Law...Rand Paul in 2016</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1362745081962</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 07:18:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362745386260-20</Id><Topic><Title>Rand Paul: New American Hero</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1362745081962</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 07:18:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buddy you could not have picked a better man than mitt romney ! the stupid folks that don't no there #$%$ from a hole in the ground cost this country a set back od 20 years c!!!!!!!!!

Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, just released his final report to Congress. You remember Iraq, right? That place we invaded ten years ago this month and razed to the ground? Well, it seems we've spent some $60 billion on building it back up again (the lion's share of that money going to a bunch of the same corporations which profited wildly off the war itself) to very little appreciable gain. To wit: the contractors took a bunch of the money, the corrupt government we created during the war stole a bunch more, and we gained with that expenditure a nifty pile of nothing much, even as we were spending approximately $15 million a day. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that we have spent $767 billion in Iraq since the invasion. The National Priorities Project, a US-based research firm, puts the number at $811 billion. Make no mistake: Iraq was a Republican war, championed by Republicans, advocated by Republicans, defended by Republicans, which paid out vast sums of taxpayer dollars to corporate friends of Republicans. Anyone who says, "But the Democrats did it, too," fine, OK, please name for me the Democrats umbilical connected to Halliburton and KBR. I'll wait. Now these same Republicans have delivered us into this sequester because they say we can't afford things like Medicare, Social Security, clean air, safe food, the Post Office, staffed control towers, jobs, and adequate hospital care. The greed frenzy of trickle-down nonsense. Two massive tax cuts, and two wars. Rampant war profiteering. Comprehensive obstructionism in Congress when presented with any effective proposals for salvaging the economy. Now, the sequester, all brought to you by your friends in the GOP, who tell us that we're broke, and can't afford nice things anymore...but whatever you do, don't look at all the ways we throw billions at our friends through the money laundering process of warfare and militarization......</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362755973777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:19:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362756343927-43</Id><Topic><Title>Make no mistake: Iraq was a Republican War</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362755973777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:19:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Roger that Ahkmed, we'll never look to Dumbos to defend Liberty in our Nation or anyone else's</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362756343927</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:25:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362756760703-44</Id><Topic><Title>Make no mistake: Iraq was a Republican War</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362755973777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:19:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So glad we could count on you.

Yuri Bezmenov is a former KGB agent and an expert on ideological subversion. He discusses the slow process of demoralization that transformed America from a conservative and mostly homogeneous country into a socially-marxist and egalitarian one.- 1984 Interview… It's a great brainwashing process which goes very slow and is divided into four basic stages. The first one being "demoralization". It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation. Why that many years? Because this is the minimum number of years required to educate one generation of students in the country of your enemy exposed to the ideology of [their] enemy. In other words, Marxism-Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generation of American students without being challenged or counterbalanced by the basic values of Americanism; American patriotism.... The result? The result you can see ... the people who graduated in the 60's, dropouts or half-baked intellectuals, are now occupying the positions of power in the government, civil service, business, mass media, and educational systems. You are stuck with them. You can't get through to them. They are contaminated. They are programmed to think and react to certain stimuli in a certain pattern [alluding to Pavlov]. You cannot change their mind even if you expose them to authentic information. Even if you prove that white is white and black is black, you still can not change the basic perception and the logic of behavior.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362758473095</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:01:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362758771305-51</Id><Topic><Title>Make no mistake: Iraq was a Republican War</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362755973777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:19:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if not chrissy, who are you then, chrissy or contard the dumbo mobro jihad is a circle jerk of a couple people (chrissie and/or spart) and hundreds of IDs, contard, the psychotic, is a freelance progressive/communist, among other despicable things</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362758771305</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:06:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362758930724-52</Id><Topic><Title>Make no mistake: Iraq was a Republican War</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362755973777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:19:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumbo err mobro err jihadmo err spaz err censored err despicablemo</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1362758930724</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:08:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362759007304-53</Id><Topic><Title>Make no mistake: Iraq was a Republican War</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362755973777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:19:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Roger err ahkmed err dumbos err spaz err censored err spazmo err islaMOspaz</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1362759007304</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:10:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362759044646-54</Id><Topic><Title>Make no mistake: Iraq was a Republican War</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362755973777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:19:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Iraq was not a war.

Cheap is not always best. This is what happens when you place bean counters in position of control and strength. The first news of 787 was that Boeing would be popping one out every 3 days; Boeing would simply assemble fully completed 3 or 4 sections and join them together like model airplanes. It sounded simple enough. When was the last time the 777 was grounded worldwide? The 787 appears to have some growing pains because this is the first time Boeing has tried this type of charley/foxtrot assembly. And, the moral of the story is: Cheaper isn't always better Q: How, do we knock down a fire in flight, then? A: By not having one. does anyone actually believe anything that the Boeing shills say at this point? Thanks the the idiots who came from McDonald Douglas. When pilots are afraid to fly your bird, you know you have serious problems! They did it once and they are doing it again ANA's problems aren't over with-and Boeing execs can't help themselves; instead of any meaningful response, the policy guidance seems to be to defend, deny, minimize, obscure, confuse and diminish.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362759257252</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:14:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362759415188-56</Id><Topic><Title>Liberal Re-invention of Education</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362753500275</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 09:38:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Censored err spaz err yuri err subersion err censored brain damage err spazMO</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1362759415188</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:16:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362759491129-57</Id><Topic><Title>Liberal Re-invention of Education</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362753500275</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 09:38:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not quite.

And I haven't heard enough to give me comfort on that one," Sadoway said.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362760135091</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:28:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362760402509-69</Id><Topic><Title>Make no mistake: Iraq was a Republican War</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362755973777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:19:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ahkmed, err sparty, the freelaoder suffers from "profit " envy, in a never ending war against private sector employers ahkmed, like most dumbos, elite and not, falls down on the side of wealth transfer verse production/creation</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362760402509</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 11:33:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362760431251-70</Id><Topic><Title>Liberal Re-invention of Education</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362753500275</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 09:38:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hard to imagine what kind of life that censored lives.

This means that the number of Americans not in the labor force increased 296,000 between January and February. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) labels people who are unemployed and no longer looking for work as “not in the labor force,” including people who have retired on schedule, taken early retirement, or simply given up looking for work. The increase marks the second month in a row, after rising in January from 88.8 million in December. Those not in the labor force had declined in December from 88.9 million in November. The nation's unemployment rate decreased to 7.7 percent in February, down from 7.9 percent in January. Overall unemployment “has shown little movement, on net, since September 2012,” the Labor Department said.

Other objects can also be attached to the platform for cooling. What's more, the prototype NIST refrigerator, which measures a few inches in outer dimensions, enables researchers to place any suitable object in the cooling zone and later remove and replace it, similar to an all-purpose kitchen refrigerator. The cooling power is the equivalent of a window-mounted air conditioner cooling a building the size of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. "It's one of the most flabbergasting results I've seen," project leader Joel Ullom said. "We used quantum mechanics in a nanostructure to cool a block of copper. The copper is about a million times heavier than the refrigerating elements. This is a rare example of a nano- or microelectromechanical machine that can manipulate the macroscopic world." The technology may offer a compact, convenient means of chilling advanced sensors below standard cryogenic temperatures—300 milliKelvin (mK), typically achieved by use of liquid helium—to enhance their performance in quantum information systems, telescope cameras, and searches for mysterious dark matter and dark energy. As described in Applied Physics Letters, the NIST refrigerator's cooling elements, consisting of 48 tiny sandwiches of specific materials, chilled a plate of copper, 2.5 centimeters on a side and 3 millimeters thick, from 290 mK to 256 mK. The cooling process took about 18 hours. NIST researchers expect that minor improvements will enable faster and further cooling to about 100 mK. The cooling elements are sandwiches of a normal metal, a 1-nanometer-thick insulating layer, and a superconducting metal. When a voltage is applied, the hottest electrons "tunnel" from the normal metal through the insulator to the superconductor. The temperature in the normal metal drops dramatically and drains electronic and vibrational energy from the object being cooled. NIST researchers previously demonstrated this basic cooling method, but are now able to cool larger objects that can be easily attached and removed. Researchers developed a micromachining process to attach the cooling elements to the copper plate, which is designed to be a stage on which other objects can be attached and cooled. Additional advances include better thermal isolation of the stage, which is suspended by strong, cold-tolerant cords. Cooling to temperatures below 300 mK currently requires complex, large and costly apparatus. NIST researchers want to build simple, compact alternatives to make it easier to cool NIST's advanced sensors. Researchers plan to boost the cooling power of the prototype refrigerator by adding more and higher-efficiency superconducting junctions and building a more rigid support structure.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA) said on Friday it is consolidating its North American flight maintenance training operations in Miami, a shift that will move all flight simulators for the 787 Dreamliner AND other aircraft out of the Seattle area. Miami is the company's largest flight-training center and is preferred by airlines based in Latin America, as well as the United States, Middle East and Europe, Boeing said... Boeing said the plan to relocate (simulators) training to Miami was FIRST ANNOUNCED in 2008, as part of its plan to move training centers closer to where airlines need them. "With the 787 grounded, there's a lessening of the training demand," Condelles said. "There's an opportunity with that situation to relocate to Miami." He said the two 787 simulators that will be moved are expected to be reassembled and certified by regulators during the summer. In the meantime, Boeing will rely on 787 simulators in London, Singapore and Shanghai.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362781384743</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 17:23:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362781424550-115</Id><Topic><Title>One of James O'Keefe's ACORN Videos Is Costing Him $100,000</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362764703802</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 12:45:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here's more for you to like Hooz. 'Former ACORN Director Gets $445 Mil From U.S. Treasury' The Obama Administration has given a former director at the scandal-plagued Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) nearly half a billion dollars to offer “struggling” Illinois homeowners mortgage assistance, a Judicial Watch investigation has found. It means the ACORN official (Joe McGavin) will go from operating a corrupt leftist community group that’s banned by Congress from receiving federal funding to controlling over $445 million in U.S. taxpayer funds. The money is part of a $7.6 billion Treasury Department program to help the “unemployed or substantially underemployed” make their mortgage payments. In this case, JW found that a subcomponent of the state-run Illinois Housing Development Authority, known as the Illinois Hardest Hit Program, received a generous $445,603,557 Treasury infusion. The Obama Administration established Hardest Hit in 2010 to provide targeted aid to families in states hit hardest by the economic and housing market downturn, according to its website. In early 2011 McGavin was appointed as director of Hardest Hit. Before that he was director of counseling for ACORN Housing in Chicago and operations manager for a Chicago ACORN offshoot called Affordable Housing Centers of America (AHCOA). His strong ties to ACORN make him a suspect candidate to handle such a huge amount of taxpayer dollars. The Obama-tied community organization supposedly shut down after a series of exposés about its illegal activities, including fraudulent voter registration drives and involvement in the housing market meltdown. Read all about it in Judicial Watch’s special report, “The Rebranding of ACORN.” The legal scandals led Congress to pass a 2009 law banning federal funding for ACORN, which for years enjoyed a huge flow of taxpayer dollars to promote its various leftwing causes.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362781424550</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 17:23:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362781451074-116</Id><Topic><Title>One of James O'Keefe's ACORN Videos Is Costing Him $100,000</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362764703802</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 12:45:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Obama Administration has violated the congressional ACORN funding ban, however. Last summer Judicial Watch uncovered records that show ACORN got tens of thousands of dollars in grants to “combat housing and lending discrimination.” The money came via Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which awarded a $79,819 grant to AHCOA. In addition to violating the ACORN funding ban, the grant was astounding because federal investigators had previously exposed fraud by the same Florida-based ACORN/AHCOA affiliate. HUD’s inspector general found that the group “inappropriately” spent more than $3.2 million in grants that were supposed to be used to eliminate lead poisoning in its housing program.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362781451074</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 17:24:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362781564223-117</Id><Topic><Title>One of James O'Keefe's ACORN Videos Is Costing Him $100,000</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362764703802</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 12:45:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Barry is as crooked as Bernie Madoff and should be in jail.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362781564223</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 17:26:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362782036683-118</Id><Title>Obama was so Cool it Made you Democrats ignore the Obvious</Title><Msg>You ignored the fact that he never had a real job....that he never accomplished anything as a Senator and that most of his votes were "present."
