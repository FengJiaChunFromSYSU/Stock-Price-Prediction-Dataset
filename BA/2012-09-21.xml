The web site Hill Buzz posted FB messages from Stevens high school male friend as well as some gay looking high school pics of the ambassador. Note the author of the HillBuzz piece, Kevin DuJan, is gay and posts a number of non US links that are covering this attack. Obama is throwing the gay community under the bus to to appease the anti gay Muslims. DuJan writes: The Serbian consulate employee identified himself to me as “Dino” and wouldn’t give me any more of a name than that, but told me it was no secret that Chris Stevens was gay and that “it was stupid to send him to Libya as the ambassador when he was a known homosexual”. Dino explained in great detail that the brutal sodomizing of Stevens’ corpse was something that Muslims do to show the “utmost disrespect to the body” and that this is “a great insult in Islam” reserved for homosexuals. ”It is like making him a woman in death and he will be a woman now after life” the Serbian explained to me. There’s a good chance this guy was Muslim too, and gay, which makes my head spin more than a little since he seemed to have no anger at all in his voice that Muslims in Libya assassinated the American ambassador and then sodomized his corpse. “He should not have gone there” was the general consensus from this man. You won’t hear any of this in the media, no doubt, but in Chicago’s diplomatic circles at least there is no doubt that Chris Stevens was gay and that pretty much anyone in the diplomatic world knew that. That includes the Libyans who were hired as security at the consulate in Benghazi who betrayed Ambassador Stevens and assisted in his murder. UPDATE: 9/16/2012 — the corrupt media is still not reporting on Ambassador Stevens being raped by Muslims before and after he was assassinated. The Left is claiming “that didn’t happen” and also showing only cropped images of the Ambassador, shirtless, with captions saying “he’s being carried to safely by helpers from the crowd!”. No, the Muslims were stripping him naked, removing his belt and pants, and raping him. The uncensored photos show the man stripped nude and being dragged off by Muslims to be violated. The corrupt media is whitewashing all this because it (a) makes Muslims look terrible for raping Ambassador Stevens (and then his corpse) and (b) it hurts Obama for people to know that Muslims raped the male American ambassador before and after killing him. Male-rape is not what this administration wants to talk about six weeks before an election. You can EASILY read all about the rape via foreign news sources in the Middle East which have no qualms reporting it.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1348207516131</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 02:05:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348209052102-2</Id><Topic><Title>State republicans will get hammered</Title><Username>andse2003</Username><Timestamp>1348184070965</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 19:34:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You guys are an interesting lot. Of late, I simply post a pure political statement, but there is always a retort with some sarcastic comment about the Bible. Now that doesn't particularly bother me because I will not have to answer for that. Thus, then, the conversation unfolds. And while I like and encourage the challenge - I can certainly handle it with some measure of aplomb - there is a danger of "casting your pearls ..." (Matthew 7:6). Certainly not a problem if there were an honest conversation about the Bible. We start political, you guys then interject a "to your way of thinking humorous" Bible comment, then you deride me for simply pointing out what the Bible says. And then you judge me and then tell me not to judge. What a hoot! I find that very curious that you guys do this and, perhaps, though you may not realize it, you have a fear that you are lost. Deep down, you know that you may be in trouble. That, of course, is a burden on my heart. Now, I don't know that at all for sure, and you probably do not either, which is the worst state for you to be in - to not know what will befall you for eternity. There is a remedy for that. And if you were truly a "brother in Christ", your commentary would not take on this level of contempt, hatred and derision. If you felt that I was in error, you would, in kindness, counsel me. There is one, however, on this board, that is by the way a liberal, and I can tell that he is likely a brother. "And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ." (Romans 8:9). So let me be specific: Dem666, you seem stuck on the notion that I bear "false witness". False witness of what? Unless you have a scriptural basis for that, it is simply your judgment and without merit. So, let it all out. Don't be shy. George...chickenhawk, of course I have read Matthew 6 as well as Matthew 1-5, and 7 through 28, and all of the New Testament, and all of the Old Testament. And, right now I am starting all over. And you? This is not a matter of boasting, this is a matter of loving God's Word. So if there is a particular concern of yours, say it. Don't be vague. Look, if you have an issue with hearing/reading what the Bible says, say so. But don't throw a Bible Bomb out at me and expect that I might be silent. I am following your lead and I take that that you have God on your mind - whether you realize it or not. There is always the principle of "shaking the dust off one's foot". That is also in Matthew, 10:14. Matthew is a tremendously rich Gospel, but my most favorite is the Gospel of John in which is captured the love of God and the exhortation to love one another. Sometimes love is tough, by saying the truth, though it falls on unwelcome ears.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1348209052102</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 02:30:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348228012718-3</Id><Title>Unions and Moochers Lookout</Title><Msg>If Mitt Romney becomes President the gravy train is over for unions and moochers.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1348228012718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 07:46:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348228381510-4</Id><Topic><Title>Unions and Moochers Lookout</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1348228012718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 07:46:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only 6% of workers are in a union.

I don't blame everything on unions and your minimizing the power of unions by being only 6% of workers. Unions play an important role in key sectors of the US economy including aerospace, auto, education, police, fire, sanitation, public transportation, hospitals among others. My beef is not with unions per se. They serve an important role in obtaining fair wages and working conditions. My beef is with union strikes. Strikes cause a great deal of damage to many and often have a substantial impact on the economy. I am against unions using strikes as leverage in collective bargaining. There are also unions that use their weight to stunt business growth. I am in favor of mediation and arbitration to reach a fair wage agreement.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1348231267468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 08:41:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348231818473-11</Id><Topic><Title>Romney opens up 4 point lead in Ohio and is up by 3 in Florida</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1348183287540</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 19:21:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The EIB poll????

"Citizens United" does blowback. See NYT homepage: September 20, 2012 Cash Low, Romney Striving to Find New Large DonorsBy NICHOLAS CONFESSORE, JO CRAVEN McGINTY and DEREK WILLIS Mitt Romney entered the final months of the presidential campaign with a cash balance of just $35 million, racing to find new large donors and rally low-dollar contributors in August even while he raised tens of millions of dollars for the Republican Party. Mr. Romney’s campaign took in $67 million that month but also spent about that much, twice the rate of spending as in any prior month, according to reports filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission. More than half of what Mr. Romney raised in August was money he could not spend until after his party convention at the end of the month. And he grew so short of available cash that his campaign borrowed $20 million and sharply curtailed advertising, even while doling out post-convention bonuses to a handful of senior staff members. The new numbers, along with disclosures filed by major “super PACs” supporting the two candidates, challenge the appearance of financial strength that had burnished Mr. Romney over the summer, and show unexpected strengths for President Obama going into the fall. While Mr. Romney’s combined fund-raising apparatus began September with $168.5 million in cash, much of it was sitting in the accounts of the Republican National Committee, which reported cash on hand of about $76.6 million. While an estimated $42 million remains in his joint account with Republican Party committees, only some of it will be available to Mr. Romney for his general election campaign. Mr. Obama and the Democrats, by contrast, began the fall campaign with less money over all, about $125 million. But federal law guarantees candidates, not parties, the lowest available ad rate in the days leading up to a general election. Thanks in part to his army of small donors, Mr. Obama gathered more money in his own campaign account than Mr. Romney, whose advantage lies in raising large checks that primarily benefit the R.N.C. Mr. Obama began September with a balance of $86 million, even after spending $65 million on advertising. He raised over twice as much money as Mr. Romney in checks of under $200, which donors can give repeatedly without quickly hitting federal contribution limits. Far less money went to the Democratic National Committee, which is playing less of a role for Mr. Obama at this stage in the race. Mr. Obama did not transfer to the committee any money from their joint fund-raising committee, which holds most of the cash Mr. Obama has raised for the party. Instead, the committee borrowed $8 million. And while the Republican committee spent heavily on advertising in August, its Democratic counterpart spent most of its money on field efforts, including large transfers to state parties, ending the month almost $5 million in the red. The Republicans’ lead in overall cash on hand could still give Mr. Romney some advantages: The Republican National Committee, for example, could devote any portion of its cash on hand to so-called independent expenditures, which are paid for with party money but cannot be coordinated with Mr. Romney’s or the committee’s strategists. And the filings suggest a significant amount of untapped money waiting for the Republican nominee on the sidelines. At least 32,000 donors have given the maximum of $2,500 to Mr. Romney’s campaign for the primary season running through August, according to an analysis by The New York Times, but have not contributed to the general election. That group that could generate about $81 million with a second round of general election checks. But prospecting for those checks will take time. While Mr. Obama can count on a steady stream of small contributions donated over the Internet, Mr. Romney’s intake depends more on a heavy schedule of fund-raisers in cities around the country, detouring to deep-pocketed cities far from swing states. Mr. Romney’s cash crunch in August also reflected the rapid expansion of his campaign organization, a task Mr. Obama undertook months ago, using his early cash to open offices and hire staff while Mr. Romney was still spending heavily to win the Republican primary. Mr. Romney and the Republican committee spent more on advertising in August, $47.7 million, than in July, $36.8 million. And combined spending on turnout, strategy and research nearly doubled from July to August. Spending on computer equipment and support reached a million in August, twenty times the amount spent in July, while payroll went to $4.1 million from $2.5 million. Another set of expenditures is likely to draw grumbles from Mr. Romney’s allies given his campaign’s current struggles: The day after accepting the Republican nomination, Mr. Romney gave what appeared to be $192,440 in bonuses to senior campaign staff members. At least nine aides received payments on Aug. 31 well in excess of their typical biweekly salaries, including $25,000 each for Matthew Rhoades, the campaign manager; Lanhee Chen, a policy adviser; and Katie Biber, the general counsel. Rich Beeson, the political director, received $37,500. The super PAC backing Mr. Obama also raised more than its Republican counterpart in August, a rare head-to-head win for Democrats in an arena overwhelmingly dominated by Republican groups and donors. Priorities USA Action, founded by former aides to Mr. Obama, raised a record $10 million in August, compared with the $7 million raised by Restore Our Future, the super PAC founded by former Romney aides.

More on this later, but the fact that the administration is treating our sacked consulate as a "crime" scene is telling. This was a terrorist attack. An act of war. (Andy McCarthy, call your office). We've dispatched criminal investigators to look into it, but they still haven't even made it to ground zero yet? Nine days after the fact? Why? (2) "Witnesses tell CBS News that there was never an anti-American protest outside of the consulate. Instead, they say it came under planned attack." As I wrote this morning, the administration is at last beginning to acknowledge the latter fact, but the former element is crucial, too. If there really were no protests outside the consulate before the ambush began -- as multiple news outlets are now reporting -- even the premise of the administration's fictional account is false. CBS says the facts on the ground are in "direct contradiction" to the White House's statements. The administration is still saying that the raid could have spun out from spontaneous protests that didn't even exist. (3) "What's clear...is that the public won't get a detailed account of what happened until after the presidential election." This conclusion strongly reinforces several of my theories about the White House's foot-dragging and misdirection on the Benghazi raid. We have a murdered ambassador and sensitive intelligence missing, and the administration is in pure political CYA mode. Where, out of curiosity, is our Commander-in-Chief on all of this? We know he hasn't taken a single question from the media about the attacks, his spokesman is punting questions to the State Department, and the State Department has explicitly stated it won't field questions on the subject. Bill Hemmer asked Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt if the American people can expect to hear from the president, now that this story has taken several drastic turns since his original September 12 rose garden statement (no questions). Labolt's answer contains many words, but the message is clear: No.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1348239186486</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 10:53:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348239407819-28</Id><Title>CNN is now reporting that Amb.

Rep. Rick Berg (R-N.D.) is running against former Democratic state attorney general Heidi Heitkamp to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad in a race that continues to be close. When asked whether he agreed with Romney's characterization of nearly half the country, Berg said "absolutely not." "The American way is you probably start at a zero tax rate and you work yourself up," he said, according to the Washington Post. "I mean, that’s where I come from. I just think it's unfortunate how that came out. I haven't talked to him personally about that. But from my perspective, we need to help people up. We need to lift them up, help them have the opportunity to succeed,” Berg said. Berg joins a host of other GOP Senate candidates who have said they disagreed with Romney's "47 percent" remarks: Sens. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.), as well as George Allen in Virginia, Linda Lingle in Hawaii and Linda McMahon in Connecticut. Some Republican House candidates running for reelection also have voiced concerns about the comments.</Msg><Username>stupidrightwingbigot</Username><Timestamp>1348247949302</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:19:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348248029766-42</Id><Title>Fish</Title><Msg>You are starting to show your ethnic dislike persona.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1348248029766</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:20:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348248070839-43</Id><Topic><Title>Where do the 47% live...</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1348245928167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:45:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why?

In that same time Boeing has lost about 2.8% Now for the past week term, the ratio is the same thing, so . for the week BA is down 1.84% and for the year to date BA is down 4.61% apple is up for the week 1.28% and for the year to date up 72.86%. This has been the same pattern for 15 years now, and will be the same thing next year, so for the BA shareholders who pump BA or the smart investors that make money on Apple it is your choice. Pretty simple really BA makes 5.7% net and apple makes over 26% with better dividend and has billions in the bank and owes nothing. Boeing has billions of debt on the 747-8 and 787, pensions,development costs on the 767 tanker the 737max and the 777x, and is late 2 yars for the 747-8 and 4 on the 787 years and in that time Apple has developed a new phone that is selling millions of new phones as you read this each one making over 26%net. So that is what the managment of apple and Boeing has done for the shareholders</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1348275756304</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 21:02:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348276635160-68</Id><Topic><Title>Do Obama Supporters Really think Communism OK</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1348254585973</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 15:09:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do Obama Supporters Really think ????
