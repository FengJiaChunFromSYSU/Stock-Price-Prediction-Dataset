Apparently, the Department of Justice was involved in setting up meetings between the NAACP and local officials, and the Department of Justice even arranged police escorts for protesters… On April 15, 2012, during the height of the protests, the Orlando Sentinel reported, “They [the CRS] helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee according to Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.” The paper quoted the Rev. Valarie Houston, pastor of Allen Chapel AME Church, a focal point for protestors, as saying “They were there for us,” after a March 20 meeting with CRS agents. Separately, in response to a Florida Sunshine Law request to the City of Sanford, Judicial Watch also obtained an audio recording of a “community meeting” held at Second Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Sanford on April 19, 2012. The meeting, which led to the ouster of Sanford’s Police Chief Bill Lee, was scheduled after a group of college students calling themselves the “Dream Defenders” barricaded the entrance to the police department demanding Lee be fired. According to the Orlando Sentinel, DOJ employees with the CRS had arranged a 40-mile police escort for the students from Daytona Beach to Sanford. Under what conditions is it ever acceptable for the federal government to arrange police escorts for protesters? And why did the Obama administration want to help them? What was the goal?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373605133345</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 00:58:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373605407237-3</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden: Hero, Knave or Fool?</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373392716386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Daniel Ellsberg: "The country I stayed in was a different America, a long time ago."

The highhandedness of our arrogant leaders today would fit well in that movie. We find a VP Joe Biden that threatens to hurt millions of poor people of South American by imposing economic sanctions if they provide asylum to one man. What was the crime of that one man. Snowden's crime was his showing of love for the US Constitution and his fellow countrymen by revealing lies made by a General Alexander and a Mr. Clapper regarding the secret NSA. Thanks to Snowden, changes are being made to make the FISA court fall in line with the US Constitution. But that does not help whistleblower Mr Snowden. Last night I saw on CBS evening news with Scott Pelley a US Border Patrol Officer incognito fearing that by going public he would lose his job or become another Snowden. What he revealed is that drug smugglers bringing in less than 150 lbs of marijuana caught at the border in Texas are not prosecuted. My question is why is it that we have elaborate laws protecting corporate whistleblowers but there is no legal mechanism protecting whistleblowers in revealing government corruption.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1373634871006</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 09:14:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373637436941-15</Id><Topic><Title>White House Schedule</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363270937569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 10:22:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like another longggg weekend, yesterday’s pandering and meet with 1963 loyola championship team must have been exhausting 10:30 AM The President and the Vice President receive the Presidential Daily Briefing 12:45 PM Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373637436941</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 09:57:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373638482878-16</Id><Topic><Title>108</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1373624238607</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 06:17:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SURE HOPE SO ;-) LOVE IT !!!!</Msg><Username>cutthemoffnow</Username><Timestamp>1373638482878</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 10:14:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373639350669-17</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing now 107, hows good is that ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373606412531</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 01:20:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tesla new 52 week high today!,</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373639350669</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 10:29:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373639451708-18</Id><Title>TSLA Reached a New 52 Week High at $126.45, seems like facts work better than propaganda for making money</Title><Msg>TSLA rose 0.66% to a new 52 week high of $126.45.

What further will be lost the next time criminal terrorists strike? President Barack Obama took our hunger for hope and change and gave us a totalitarian police state in what can only be characterized as an epic failure, a grand bait and switch, which is the most recent fascist coup waged upon American liberty. With torture, spying, murder, and perma-war, all three branches of the U.S. government – the President, Congress, and courts – have abused the Constitution and lost all legitimacy. From this point forward, it is only a hop, skip, and jump to an iron-fisted authoritarian dictatorship. The entire American citizenry – and soon global humanity – is now assumed to be guilty and data-mined for evidence, on the presumption that everyone is a terrorist until proven innocent. America has become a two-party fascist state. President Obama's message of progressive hope has collapsed into a totalitarian nightmare – as the government he leads spies on and murders its own citizens; while torturing, falsely imprisoning, and waging drone based perma-war terrorizing innocents. Critics are harassed by the IRS, as the media are bullied into silence. This failed Presidency has further laid the groundwork for final collapse of U.S. liberty under the guise of security, while ignoring immediate threats posed by abrupt climate change and ecosystem collapse.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1373643457418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:37:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373643608745-34</Id><Topic><Title>Janet Napolitano Resigning</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373640814057</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 10:53:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we will gain when Homeland Security is abolished !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1373643608745</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:40:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373643645916-35</Id><Topic><Title>Presidents roll back civil liberties</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1373643457418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:37:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>c'mon man- since when are enemy combatants who are attacking this country even tho they may be located in this country given a trial or are their actions debated in the legislature-- what the h are you guys babbeling about?</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1373643645916</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:40:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373643765812-36</Id><Topic><Title>Obama administration at least partially responsible for turning the George Zimmerman trial into racially charged spectacle</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373544768798</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 08:12:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gee, and your nick suggested you would not have strong opinions...</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373643765812</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:42:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373643861281-37</Id><Topic><Title>Presidents roll back civil liberties</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1373643457418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:37:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the CIA defines enemy combatants as two or more individuals doing jumping jacks...</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1373643861281</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:44:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373643951415-38</Id><Topic><Title>Obama care failing while Obama hypes it....</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1373642378950</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:19:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Up until the tea party-led ban on earmarks a few years ago, McConnell played out this dichotomy across Kentucky. In Washington, he voted against a health care program for poor children. In Kentucky, he funneled money to provide innovative health services for pregnant women. In Washington, he railed against Obamacare. In Kentucky, he supported free health care and prevention programs paid for by the federal government without the hassle of a private-insurance middleman. This policy ping-pong may not suggest a coherent belief system, but it has led to loyalty among the GOP in Washington and something close to fealty in Kentucky. It has advanced McConnell's highest ideal: his own political survival. McConnell's hold on Kentucky is a grim reminder of the practice of power in America -- where political excellence can be wholly divorced from successful governance and even public admiration. The most dominant and influential Kentucky politician since his hero Henry Clay, McConnell has rarely used his indefatigable talents toward broad, substantive reforms. He may be ruling, but he's ruling over a commonwealth with the lowest median income in the country, where too many counties have infant mortality rates comparable to those of the Third World. His solutions have been piecemeal and temporary, more cynical than merciful. And with McConnell's rise into the GOP leadership, his continuous search for tactical advantage with limited regard for policy consequences has overrun Washington. McConnell has more than doubled the previous high-water mark for the number of filibusters deployed to block legislation, infamously declaring that his "top political priority" was to make President Barack Obama a one-term president. This obstruction has had serious consequences, as the Great Recession grinds on and large-scale problems like climate change march inexorably forward. Congress has failed to address the nation's most pressing challenges, and America has come to look more and more like McConnell's Kentucky.</Msg><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1373643951415</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:45:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373643984454-39</Id><Topic><Title>Liberalism failing across the map Illinois gov. stopped paychecks until the Pension budget is fixed</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1373641978126</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:12:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>liberalism is on the march every where- its conservatism that's falling on its face- the conservatism of the posters on this board who call themselves conservatives stems from pre 16th century- the Taliban conservatism is from the 7th century.

Airbus and Boeing pay about the same dividend, . Factually, Airbus over time has gained 213% in five years in stock price so Airbus bettered Boeing as it only gained 70%. Investing in Boeing means you missed huge on Airbus. As soon as the A350 starts delivery with safe NiCad batteries , expect Airbus to better Boeing stock price by another 100% in a short time. Frankly , as a stock market investor , today you need to be in better stocks like TSLA and SCTY and be able to move when and if the huge gains stop. If you must hold and not pay attention then go with Disney , a much safer stock is up 127% over five years and has continued to pay a dividend and it yields currently 1.12% , Boeing is up only 70 5 in 5 years and pays a 1.85% yield dividend . Disney has paid a dividend even in the recession so when you factor in 127% gain in Disney stock price to only 70% for Boeing Disney can be shown by fact to be much better than BA use the Yahoo finance stock chart go to 5 years or max, enter BA , then click compare and enter DIS the symbol for Disney and you can see Disney has never been beat over 5 years by BA and pays a great dividend so much saver that a lithium powered late 787 , pick you stock to make money and for safety of investment an airplane like the 787 is not safe then look at other better stock there are plenty but not IGZ a Boeing hack tried to tell me this stock was better he was so ignorant.

"Today's ruling vindicates the EU's long-held claims that Boeing has received massive U.S. government hand-outs in the past and continues to do so today," said EU Trade Commissioner . WTO estimated that the cost of U.S. subsidies for European aerospace industry "run into billions of euro" and said the U.S. government "should now put an end to such harmful subsidies." Including subsidies from certain U.S. states, that would be the 3 billion in tax subsidies that Washington State Taxpayers gave Boeing to stay 100% with Everett for the 787 assembly , instead Boeing moved to Carolina. Boeing is a company that cant be trusted on promise or delivering on schedule on the 787 Boeing is not a good investment if you cant trust the Boeing management then you should never invest in Boeing .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373647388838</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 12:43:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373647416681-89</Id><Topic><Title>Is this the 3rd fire this year?

Do foreign Engineers do agood job, in somethings yes and something no? A plan has a million parts just imagine anyone goes wrong is still a good design. Bye GOD how on earth can a company track so many parts and assemble them just right. Boeing has many many interesting products.

Metal components manufacturer Precision Castparts Corp , a primary supplier to Boeing, dropped as much as 6.4 percent before trading down 3.2 percent at $229.73 in heavy afternoon trading.

The photos show discoloration on the top of the fuselage just forward of the tail, due to charring of the paint from internal heat. This tells us several things: 1.) (most important) It's not merely smoke venting from the battery box, and it caused damage to a structure. This was more severe than either of the battery fires, which caused no damage outside the battery rack. 2.) Skeptics will probably dislike my reasoning, but physics wins, and the fact that there is apparent damage to the fuselage is what convinced me it wasn't the battery. While the original battery box is a different case, the batteries simply don't have enough total energy, even if they burned completely up, to burn through the titanium box. 3.) The battery is on the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the wing. The damage is on top of the fuselage, I'd say a good 30-40 feet behind where the battery is located. For the battery to have caused a fire that burned up through the cabin to damage the crown would have involved a lot of burning in the cabin, which would have produced huge amounts of smoke and charring of the crown at least up to the wing. I see two main candidates offhand: (a) Electrical fire. This could be bad, especially if it was found to be a wire chafing issue. Wire chafing has been an issue in aircraft since before WWII, and the more complex the plane, the more difficult it is to find and fix. A less serious cause of electrical fire would be a problem with a relay or electrical panel. A defective version of one of those is much easier to replace with a re-designed version. This is, I believe, the main cause of aircraft fires. An Airbus A330 actually had an onboard fire this past May that was traced to the wiring for the in-flight entertainment system.</Msg><Username>manoflemuncha</Username><Timestamp>1373655656604</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:00:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373655685746-307</Id><Title>Heya Money Makers!

The U.K. Air Accident Investigation Branch "has sent a team to investigate an incident to a Boeing 787 at Heathrow," according to a message on its Twitter account as well. In a separate incident, another 787 aircraft suffered problems Friday when a Thomson Airways flight was grounded because of "technical issues," a spokesman for the airline said. The flight, TOM126, had taken off from U.K.'s Manchester airport and was headed to Sanford, Fla., but had to return to Manchester "as a precautionary measure," the spokesman said. The aircraft, which can carry some 290 passengers, was at near capacity. There were no injuries and passengers disembarked. Engineers were inspecting the plane, the spokesman said. The 787 has suffered a spate of smaller technical glitches that have forced airline operators to delay and cancel numerous flights.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373656627468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:17:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373656662354-325</Id><Title>Starvin Marvin was apparently found in the overhead comparment chewing threw the wires</Title><Msg>if you do not know who starven marven is consider yourself lucky you have 30mins of pure pleasure ahead of you on southparkstudios . com ...your welcome</Msg><Username>opele1</Username><Timestamp>1373656662354</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:17:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373656686425-326</Id><Topic><Title>Worker sets plane on fire?</Title><Username>lawstuff22</Username><Timestamp>1373655085383</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 14:51:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Industrial espionage, Airbus anyone?</Msg><Username>sdietrich</Username><Timestamp>1373656686425</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:18:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373656731064-327</Id><Topic><Title>You can't outsource quality (I've said all along!)</Title><Username>sdietrich</Username><Timestamp>1373656613319</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:16:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how is that cheap outsourcing going for you now James McNerney</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373656731064</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:18:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373656879277-328</Id><Topic><Title>Somewhere over a major ocean someday one catches on fire.</Title><Username>yainvestor2</Username><Timestamp>1373655743671</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:02:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no shortage of water then to get it put out.</Msg><Username>patootie_galore</Username><Timestamp>1373656879277</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:21:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373656888670-329</Id><Title>how is that cheap out sourcing working for you now james mcnerney /</Title><Msg>the union offered to build it for 5 billion dollars, 5 years ago now its still not working the 787 is a 30 billion over cost estimates plane , and might be grounded twice in one year the DO Jones is down 38 points today all on BA !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373656888670</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:21:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373656946301-330</Id><Title>NOT Grounded</Title><Msg>There is NO call to ground the other 787 planes.

The U.K. Air Accident Investigation Branch "has sent a team to investigate an incident to a Boeing 787 at Heathrow," according to a message on its Twitter account. More woes for Boeing's Dreamliner, as an empty Ethiopian Airlines 787 catches fire. Train derails south of Paris. Homeland Security Sec. Janet Napolitano resigns. WSJ's Jason Bellini reports. Photo: AP In a separate incident, another 787 aircraft suffered problems Friday when a Thomson Airways flight was grounded because of "technical issues," a spokesman for the airline said. The flight, TOM126, had taken off from U.K.'s Manchester airport and was headed to Sanford, Fla., but had to return to Manchester "as a precautionary measure," the spokesman said.The aircraft, which can carry some 290 passengers, was at near capacity. There were no injuries and passengers disembarked. Engineers were inspecting the plane, the spokesman said. The 787 has suffered a spate of smaller technical glitches that have forced airline operators to delay and cancel numerous flights. Those types of issues aren't necessarily uncommon for a new jetliner like the Dreamliner, which first began carrying passengers in 2011. However, a fire aboard an aircraft is a considerably more serious event and is likely to be evaluated separately from the jet's teething issues. Television footage of Heathrow showed damage to the top of the jet's body near the passenger doors at the rear of the 787. That area of the aircraft houses the crew rest compartment, which sits above the passenger cabin. The 787's twin lithium-ion batteries are installed below the floor in electrical bays near the nose and between the wings of the aircraft, far from the damaged area visible in the footage.

They wanted to make a statement, even though they knew it couldn't survive the Senate or the White House veto. They passed it anyway -- without one Democratic vote -- to proclaim this is who we are. Who are they? They just passed a farm bill that included about $195 billion in subsidies to "farmers" (read: agribusiness) over 10 years, while eliminating food stamps and nutrition programs from the bill as "extraneous." Forty-seven million Americans receive food stamps. Nearly half are children under 18; nearly 10 percent are impoverished seniors. Food stamps are often the difference between hunger and survival. Republicans famously seem intent on being a party of white sanctuary, writing off all people of color, yet more whites receive food stamps (over one-third of all recipients) than blacks or Hispanics. This is how they choose to be identified. They will bring the government to a halt to defend against any tax hikes on millionaires, or to fend off the closing of corporate tax shelters. They will vote in lockstep to take the sequester cuts entirely out of domestic programs -- education, clean water, pre-school -- in order to protect a Pentagon budget that remains the biggest source of waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government. And they will lavish subsidies on agribusiness while throwing children and seniors off the bus. Having stripped food stamps out of the farm bill entirely, they did not even have the common decency to pass any kind of food stamp provision separately. They haven't gotten around to getting a "consensus" on that. This wasn't intended as legislation. It was intended as a declaration of identity. This is who they are. Think about that.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373668462509</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 18:34:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373668617679-477</Id><Title>Breaking News....787 Fire Caused By Rosie O'donnell Phart</Title><Msg>That is one huge weapon of mass destruction......</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1373668617679</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 18:36:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373668638139-478</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Month at Bilderberg meeting by Henry Kissinger</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373588692876</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 20:24:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo: "the context of the wider discussion" I see...you mean the wider discussion regarding "individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government" ...which is exactly what is happening right now ?

Barclays’ new customer agreement terms (PDF) – set to come into force from October 9, 2013, will also permit the bank to collect social networking data as well as using private transaction information to bombard customers with unsolicited “services and products”. “The information we use will include location data derived from any mobile device details you have given us. This helps us protect you from fraud,” states the document. This suggests that phone companies in Britain must have given Barclays some kind of back door access to people’s private cellphones in order to track their precise location, whether in real time or after potential fraud has been reported. All modern cellphones can be tracked down a location which is accurate within 50 meters. Police, governments and corporations already use such data to spy on individuals for both surveillance and data harvesting.

Democrats grilled the Republican author of a bill that has prompted fervent demonstrations and put Texas at the center of the nation’s abortion debate. Following Friday’s debate, the Senate was scheduled to vote on the tough abortion restrictions and could send the bill to Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who has said he will sign it. As senators debated, they could clearly hear hundreds of protesters outside of the chamber in the Capitol rotunda cheering, chanting and singing, “We’re not going to take it anymore.” The circus-like atmosphere in the Texas Capitol marked the culmination of weeks of protests, the most dramatic of which came June 25 in the final minutes of the last special legislative session when a Democratic filibuster and subsequent protest prevented the bill from becoming law. Abortion-rights advocates dressed in orange Friday, some carrying gynecological devices and signs, while anti-abortion activists wore blue and held images of fetuses and Bible verses. House Bill 2 would require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, allow abortions only in surgical centers, limit where and when women may take abortion-inducing pills and ban abortions after 20 weeks. Only five out of 42 existing abortion clinics meet the requirements to be a surgical center, and clinic owners say they can’t afford to upgrade or relocate. Sen. Glen Hegar of Katy, the bill’s Republican author, argued that all abortions, including those induced with medications, should take place in an ambulatory surgical center in case of complications. Democrats pointed out that childbirth is more dangerous than an abortion and there have been no serious problems with women taking abortion drugs at home. They also planned to introduce numerous amendments to add exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to remove some of the more restrictive clauses. Sen. Rodney West, a Dallas Democrat, asked why Hegar was pushing restrictions that federal courts in other states had suspended as possibly unconstitutional. The measures under consideration Friday mirror restrictions passed in Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kansas, Wisconsin and Arizona. “There will be lawsuit. I promise you,” West said, raising his right hand as if taking an oath. Passing the law in Texas would be a major victory for anti-abortion activists in the nation’s second most-populous state. A lawsuit originating in Texas would also likely win a sympathetic hearing at the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Other Democrats questioned the intent of the bill, and whether it was intended to regulate abortion clinics out of existence. “What would concern me is the political aspect of a political movement across this country … this rush to pass this for political purposes,” said Sen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat. He said it was clear the bill was part of national conservative agenda attempting to ban abortion and infringe on women’s rights one state at a time. Whitmire also pressed Hegar on why the Texas Medical Association, Texas Hospital Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology opposed the bill. He asked Hegar how he could ignore these experts. Hegar said he’s heard from “numerous exerts and doctors” who support the restrictions. “And what do we do if they are right and we don’t pass this legislation?” he added. The bill could shut all but five abortion clinics in Texas and would be a win long-eyed by conservatives who make abortion a key campaign issue, but the raucous debate has also given Texas Democrats newfound momentum. The Republican majority is expected to ultimately pass the bill, with Democrats left to do little more than enter into the legislative record material that could help defeat it in federal court. The Senate’s leader, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, was determined not to let anything — or anyone — derail a vote. Troopers thoroughly checked the bags of person entering the gallery, which holds almost 500 spectators. Senate Sergeant-At-Arms Rick DeLeon said no props — including speculums and coat hangers — would be allowed into the Senate gallery, per decorum rules. Troopers tossed tampons, perfume bottles, moisturizers, pencils and other things into the garbage. The leader of the chamber’s Democrats, Sen. Kirk Watson of Austin, later said he intervened to stoop troopers from confiscating feminine hygiene products from women seeking to watch the debate. Each spectator was issued a copy of the rules of decorum, which stipulate there can be no demonstrations or attempts to disrupt the chamber’s work. The Texas Constitution gives Dewhurst the authority to jail those who break those for up to 48 hours, no court necessary. Sen. Dan Patrick, a chief proponent of the bill, said that if debate goes on too long, Republicans will move to cut off debate. “I’m not going to let it go on forever tonight,” he said. Democrats successfully blocked the bill in the regular legislative session. During the first special session, the Senate didn’t take up the bill until the final day. That allowed Fort Worth Sen. Wendy Davis to use a filibuster to delay a vote. When Republicans rushed to try to pass the bill in the session’s final 15 minutes, angry protesters began shouting and screaming from the gallery. Dewhurst could only watch with frustration as a half-dozen state troopers tried to remove more than 450 people. Democrats believe Republicans have overreached in trying to appease their base and alienated suburban women, a constituency that helped President Barack Obama win re-election.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373670556347</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 19:09:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373670591451-495</Id><Topic><Title>Man the nut juobs are coming out of the wood work</Title><Username>opele1</Username><Timestamp>1373670296612</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 19:04:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't know.

I’m talking about Edward Snowden, of course, the former CIA employee and NSA contractor whose leaking to the Guardian has exposed a vast global spying apparatus secretly constructed by Washington. The weeks-long Hate aimed at Snowden reached its apogee when prominent "journalists" started going after the reporters who broke the Snowden story, principally Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, inferring that it was Greenwald and the Guardian who put Snowden up to penetrating the NSA. These aren’t just wingnut bloggers we’re dealing with here, but two prominent legacy-media reporters: David "Meet the Press" Gregory and Walter Pincus, of the Washington Post. When Gregory demanded to know why Greenwald shouldn’t be prosecuted alongside Snowden, that was the Establishment baring its teeth. One should never assume their bark is worse than their bite, but clearly this display of anger is born of sheer frustration. Snowden, after all, has thrown our rulers and their court jesters in the media on the defensive. Not since David bopped Goliath on the noggin has a single individual landed such a decisive blow on a giant, unwieldy bully. Washington is reeling from the impact of the Snowden revelations, not just on the international plane but on the home front as well. In spite of battalions of politicians of both parties dutifully denouncing the NSA leaker as a modern day Benedict Arnold, and weeks of media hysteria over the alleged "damage" he has done to our national security, the American people aren’t buying the Official Narrative: a recent Quinnipiac poll reports: "American voters say 55 – 34 percent that Edward Snowden is a whistle-blower, rather than a traitor, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released tod</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373672434730</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 19:40:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373672559303-520</Id><Title>Need to make a buck or two?? get someone to sabotage a 787 or two for you- oh and be sure to short BA b4 you set any fires</Title><Msg>considering that Boeing experimental can operate 787 aircraft without incident for 2 years in a row it becomes ever more apparent that ANA and JAL are not the victims of faulty equipment but rather their own sabotage.

Ted Cruz, Iowa Rep. Steve King, former Rep. Allen West and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions are all planning to appear at an anti-immigration reform rally held by a group with close connections to the white nationalist movement. According to Right Wing Watch, the Black American Leadership Association (BALA) is not the grass-roots organization it purports to be, but rather a longstanding cabal of anti-immigration activists who have “deep connections” to white nationalist John Tanton, a man the Southern Poverty Law Center calls “the racist architect of the modern anti-immigrant movement.” The march, called the “D.C. March for Jobs,” with its “Just say ‘No’ to Amnesty” theme is slated for Monday and is expected to draw a heavily tea party-affiliated, far-right crowd. Michelle Cottle at the Daily Beast wrote Friday that BALA is believed to be “the latest in a series of minority front groups providing anti-immigration extremists cover from charges of racism.” Tea party leaders, wrote Cottle, have been “downright giddy” at having a group of activists of color on hand to point to when critics call out the recent anti-immigration reform putsch by conservatives as a display of racial animus. BALA founder Leah Durant claims that the group’s mission is to protect the economic viability of African-Americans in the U.S. by stemming the tide of undocumented workers it believes are streaming into the country, thereby preventing the widespread black unemployment they say would result from the “devastating effects of amnesty and mass immigration.” In a June open letter to the Senate Gang of Eight, BALA “implor[ed] each Member to fulfill his or her duty to the millions of Americans struggling to find work” by killing the Senate bill and taking measures to reduce immigration. Durant has found herself inundated with media attention from right-outlets, including invitations to appear with Bill O’Reilly, Laura Ingraham, Mike Huckabee and others. BALA’s efforts to kill immigration reform have been trumpeted by the Daily Caller and the National Review. Cottle wrote that while BALA’s existence only dates to the publication of its Facebook page in mid-May, at least a dozen of its members are long-time anti-immigration activists have have spent decades pushing the message that immigration will be economically devastating to the black community. Under different names over the years, including the African American Leadership Council, Choose Black America and the Coalition for the Future American Worker, this group of activists have been pushing policy agendas that Cottle called “misleading, dangerously divisive, and sadly predictable.” Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Human and Civil Rights, told Cottle, “We’ve seen this before. This is the same page pulled from an over-20-year-old playbook.” Several BALA leaders — Durant, Frank Morris, the Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, and T. Willard Fair — have worked for, lobbied with or supported the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a notoriously anti-Latino, pro-eugenics organization that the SPLC classifies as a hate group. FAIR was founded by John Tanton, who, in the late 1980s, was outed as a racist when portions of his private correspondence were made public — letters and memos in which he railed against the “Latin onslaught” and said that society was doomed without a “a European-American majority — and a clear one at that.” Aaron Flanagan of the Center for New Community told Cottle that BALA’s newfound utility to the anti-immigration right is “blatant tokenism.” He said, “And tokenism is not a word I use lightly.” Henderson expressed disappointment. “It’s troubling when opportunists use the economic challenges of the African-American community as cover for ideological and political extremism to align themselves with groups like FAIR, which had their own genesis in the eugenics movement.” Joining the Republican Party politicians at Monday’s march will be fiery fundamentalist Christian pastor O’Neal Dozier, who was Florida state director of Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA)’s presidential campaign in 2012. Dozier declared that former Gov. Mitt Romney (R-MA)’s Mormonism made him a threat to the country and that it would “taint the Republican Party” to choose Romney as its nominee. Dozier is also known for his extreme anti-LGBT and anti-Muslim statements, including the belief that homosexuality is the “paramount of sins” and that same sex partnerships are “something so nasty and disgusting that it makes God want to vomit.” He has publicly stated that Islam “has a plan, a 20-year plan, to take over America from within.” Mother Jones reported that a charity Dozier supported and lobbied for with local Republican politicians swindled Haitian immigrants out of $3 million by charging them for U.S. work permits and other papers that they never received.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373672737145</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 19:45:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373673197941-526</Id><Topic><Title>FAA now forced to shut down 787 for six plus months</Title><Username>wise4us</Username><Timestamp>1373660883422</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 16:28:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right, no self respecting waffle wants to sit untouched and cold.</Msg><Username>husseindamuud</Username><Timestamp>1373673197941</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 19:53:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373673201077-527</Id><Topic><Title>Strangely enough</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373665655909</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 17:47:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the middle of the road by the pretenders sounded awesome in the Mannheim, W.

The conservative black pastor who was once the chapter president of the Garland, Texas NAACP called Jackson and Sharpton “race hustlers” and said they are “acting as though they are buzzards circling the carcass of this young boy.”</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1373678995183</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:29:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373679210544-565</Id><Topic><Title>It doesn't sound like me...</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373677561346</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:06:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>back by Mondy hopefully we did not pencil another SRWB for $3 dollar surgery ] and...tell your Congressperson and my SRWB congressperson once you get to upper bowl of Kaprun it is all downhill</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373679210544</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:33:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373679342648-566</Id><Topic><Title>It doesn't sound like me...</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373677561346</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:06:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pencil surgery</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373679342648</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:35:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373679974919-567</Id><Topic><Title>Will all 787's be grounded next week?</Title><Username>qzeck71</Username><Timestamp>1373676627976</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 20:50:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yet another idiot lives</Msg><Username>thisgameistooeasy</Username><Timestamp>1373679974919</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:46:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373680125306-568</Id><Topic><Title>Ethiopian Dreamliner is totaled</Title><Username>broad_and_south</Username><Timestamp>1373678812740</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:26:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Doesn't need an autoclave- plz put YOUR bong down</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1373680125306</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:48:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373680245308-569</Id><Title>Outside reversal day on BA today...</Title><Msg>should push this to the low 80's upper 70's over the coming month.</Msg><Username>didyousay226npa</Username><Timestamp>1373680245308</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:50:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373680384165-570</Id><Title>Not Good, Fire Burned Through the Fuselage</Title><Msg>Don't think leaving a coffee pot on would do that this, looking like a more serious problem (sabotage, three times, really?) .

The flight crashed while trying to land at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday. Those names turned out to be racist jokes, ones that fooled an Oakland television station enough to broadcast them on the air. During its noon newscast Friday, KTVU-TV read the four names on the air and showed an accompanying graphic. As reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, it soon became clear that the names were fakes and possibly meant to make fun of the fact that many of the passengers on Saturday's crash were Asian: "The first name — “Captain Sum Ting Wong” — should have been a give-away that something really was wrong. But [co-anchor Ted] Campbell kept reading… “Wi Tu Lo, Ho Lee #$%$, Bang Ding Ow.” The station later issued an apology: "KTVU general manager Tom Raponi said 'We are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again.'

No passengers were on the plane, which was connected to an external ground power source, according to people briefed on the incident. It was also not clear if any maintenance was under way or how long the fire had been burning, though it was intense enough to burn through its carbon-composite skin on the top of the fuselage near the tail. That area was not next to either of the plane’s new lithium-ion batteries, which caught fire or emitted smoke in two earlier incidents that led to the grounding of the first 50 787s. Unless they were charging, aviation experts said, the batteries would not have been in use if the plane were connected to ground power. A team of British safety investigators began examining the plane shortly after the fire was put out. But no one involved — the investigators, Boeing, the airline or the airport — commented on the possible cause of the fire. Other experts said that some of the plane’s wiring, and the oxygen systems for passengers, would have passed through the damaged area, which was above the rear galley. It was also possible the fire migrated from another part of the plane, they said. Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation consultant at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., said the possibilities ranged from “something pretty benign,” like a lit cigarette or a coffee machine left on, to a serious flaw in the plane’s new electrical system, which includes other innovative components besides the batteries. Or, he said, it could be something “not as easy or as terrible,” like a component that was installed incorrectly.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1373687945592</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 23:59:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
