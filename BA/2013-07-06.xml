WHEN EUROPEANS WERE SLAVES: RESEARCH SUGGESTS WHITE SLAVERY WAS MUCH MORE COMMON THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED COLUMBUS, Ohio – A new study suggests that a million or more European Christians were enslaved by Muslims in North Africa between 1530 and 1780 – a far greater number than had ever been estimated before. The research is available in: 'Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500-1800' Then there were the Moors whom also had White slaves. Search: 'Moorish Rulers - Black Kings / White Slaves pt 1' The author states: "I am happy to discuss the role of black Africans in the enslavement of YOUR ancestors. In fact I have a video that discusses the literally thousands of ships and the over 1,500,000 whites that where shanghaied and taken back to North Africa by black Riff Pirates and Moors as SLAVES ...and this﻿ continued long after slavery was abolished in America and lasted for much longer. In fact the Etymology of [SLAVE] comes from the white "Slavic" people ...due to their constant enslavement!"" _____________________________________________________ The portrayal of only Blacks suffering from slavery is nonsense and an emotional crutch that many ignorant Blacks use as an excuse and that #$%$ race card pimps constantly use to make ignorant Whites feel guilty.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1373132659988</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 13:44:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373133003019-11</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Dominated State Legislatures</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1373116206338</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 09:10:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do I have thoughts on this?

The incident once again brought attention to the problem of slavery. At this moment, millions of men, women, and children—roughly twice the population of Rhode Island—are being held against their will as modern-day slaves. Sometimes referred to as bonded laborers (because of the debts owed their masters), public perception of modern slavery is often confused with reports of workers in low-wage jobs or inhumane working conditions. However, modern-day slaves differ from these workers because they are actually held in physical bondage (they are shackled, held at gunpoint, etc.). Modern-day slaves can be found laboring as servants or concubines in Sudan, as child "carpet slaves" in India, or as cane-cutters in Haiti and southern Pakistan, to name but a few instances. According to Anti-Slavery International, the world's oldest human rights organization, there are currently over 20 million people in bondage. Where does this slavery take place? Who are the faces behind these atrocities? Slave Trading on Africa's West Coast The slave trade in Africa was officially banned in the early 1880s, but forced labor continues to be practiced in West and Central Africa today. UNICEF estimates that 200,000 children from this region are sold into slavery each year. Many of these children are from Benin and Togo, and are sold into the domestic, agricultural, and sex industries of wealthier, neighboring countries such as Nigeria and Gabon. The most recent incident involved the MV Etireno, which was refused from ports in Gabon and Cameroon. When the ship reached Cotonou, Benin, in April, 2001, police began an investigation of the captain and crew. More adults than children were believed to be aboard.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1373133250964</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 13:54:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373133385784-13</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Dominated State Legislatures</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1373116206338</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 09:10:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exposing yourself for the race baiting moron that you are is priceless Hooz.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1373133385784</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 13:56:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373133774919-14</Id><Topic><Title>Hooz is a race card pimp who never mentions the White slaves that Africans and Arabs had</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1373132659988</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 13:44:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually, that statement is libelous, as I have never played the race card in my life.

It was not immediately known whether there were any injuries. The Boeing 777 was supposed to land on runway 28 left at the airport, said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown. She said the sequence of events was still unclear, but it appeared the plane landed and then crashed. A video clip posted to YouTube shows smoke coming from a silver-colored jet on the tarmac. Passengers could be seen jumping down the inflatable emergency slides. Television footage showed debris strewn about the tarmac and pieces of the plane lying on the runway.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1373142214843</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 16:23:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373142224950-53</Id><Topic><Title>777 Fleet To Be Grounded</Title><Username>wolftts</Username><Timestamp>1373138344696</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 15:19:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think I agree, shock.

Glide path guidance had to be switched to 28L (was it done?). Otherwise they had no glide path guidance, and the pilot did it visually and came in obviously too low. Tragic. Or, kept 28R guidance set in and that guided him too low or not accurately .... I believe 28R sticks out further, so the glide path would come in lower if using 28L ... have to check the approach. Also, it appears the FO was flying since the plane landed "right" of centerline. That's a tendency ... so it is just a first guess. Tragic ... but not Boeing's fault as my first guess.</Msg><Username>linecpt</Username><Timestamp>1373146968541</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 17:42:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373147081226-74</Id><Topic><Title>Probably pilot error</Title><Username>linecpt</Username><Timestamp>1373146968541</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 17:42:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the insight.

You should buy Airbus stock. The 777 flew over water the whole way to California and the only other power problem on landing was another 777 with iceing, that problem was alledgedly never going to ahppen again. A plane landing needs power and this plane was nose up that means both engines were not responding and there was a power problem , not a pilot error. This will be the first large body crash in over 10 years, the last really huge cartwheel was the MD plane crash. Hopefully other than injuries no lifes were lost. . This is an example of Boeing mangment not modernizing the 777, attempting to get the last cent out of what was the best land last all Boeing engineered plane . The onlyother crash was identitcal the jet engines did not respond after a long flight which was caused by icing. The plaen is ther and the FAA and the HSTA board can not say the dead pilots were at fault now as they did not die. Hoepfully the 777 will be grounded until this issue is fixed. So two groundings now the 787 and perhaps the 777.. So nose high usually means no power , . Now the boeing barkers who want to sell you stock in BA all the time will say, jojvaz,it was boeing or airline workers sho sabotoged the pl;ane, spartacus99991 will say that its no big deal , minor problem and crtiticise anyone who says that all could be killed on board if boeing does not fix this problem, his ssecond named neospart99 will have some other excuse. Foulmoutharbor wil report we need another 777 ordered now, domerrrr will have some troll statment, joedokes and Barbing will say we will get to 120 dollars per share trust me.

Stefanie Turner was walking to her hotel on the waterfront across from the runway at San Francisco International Airport when she saw a landing plane coming in at a bad angle, its tail very low. "As we were watching, we saw the Asiana flight approaching, and we saw that the angle was wrong," she said.

They were flying a visual, and I would guess still a sidestep to 28L since SFO likes to depart 28R. Assume the pilots knew well ahead of time about the notams telling them that they weren't going to have approaches that had glidepaths, then they had to use the VASI system which should have worked to visually do it, if used correctly. Or, possibly set up the automation on the aircraft to assist the approach as an aid ... still they needed to monitor the approach visually. Still it doesn't seem it is going to be a Boeing problem. I hope it wasn't because they were surprised at the last minute as to the conditions of the approaches at SFO, or the non flying pilot had his head in the cockpit trying to set up some automation at the last minute.</Msg><Username>linecpt</Username><Timestamp>1373162030408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 21:53:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373162031688-126</Id><Topic><Title>What eyewitnesses saw...</Title><Username>zoroaster85</Username><Timestamp>1373141386201</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 16:09:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MSNBC........only an insane Marxist Communist would watch that channel.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1373162031688</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 21:53:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373162285288-127</Id><Title>Only 2nd major accident of a 777 in 18 years</Title><Msg>The 777 has a fantastic record," said Tom Haueter, who retired last year from the National Transportation Safety Board, where he was the head of aviation accident investigations.</Msg><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1373162285288</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 21:58:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373162534305-128</Id><Title>Airplanes built by union labor are risky</Title><Msg>.....the government FFA provides a false sense of security.
