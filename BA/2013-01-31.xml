Interesting contractual detail! Is this agreement unconditional or does it consider the circumstances, i.e. the reason for late delivery? As we all know, grounding of the B787 is NOT the fault of SPEEA. I wonder why should such an agreement put Boeing out of the line of fire? At least, they would'nt deserve it.</Msg><Username>divesius</Username><Timestamp>1359622696370</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 03:58:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359625000291-21</Id><Topic><Title>the next shoe to fall the SPEEA strike and why it will happen</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359583463106</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:04:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>During a strike the AOG crew, per contract is allowed to work (Airplane on ground) a damaged plane at a off factory site. Thi si because Boeing knows a customer can recoup dmages from Boeing if their is a problem caused by the company. Also Boeing wants the customer to have a good relation with Boeing. Like a car manufacturerr will visit a car down ont eh raod tow it to the servie center and fix it, same idea. Except a flaming 787 can not pull over to a cloud and let everyone off. If a plane in the factory is not able to be produced due to a strike it is a standard agreement , Boeing skates. The planes out the door and delivered , will cost Boeing a lost revenue charge, from the customers. Boeing has 2 billion in stock buyback to cover for some time. If you noticed most stocks were down today and Boeing held in a down market on weak earnings . AS I have pointed out since 1-9-2013 the volume of traded shares has gone up from 5 million per day to over 6 million perday. That is a trailing average, the actual volume is higher , the stock price is making lower highs and lower lows a classic sell off by major institutions. Easy to see , same thing for Apple after 15 year run and the death of Steve Jobs. Mr Jobs took 1 dollar per year in wage and the rest in increased value of the stock price. His successor at Apple is like the CEO of Boeing very high wage and stock options and benefits so he does not have any worries. These executives are parisites, they do not have to be responsible, they still keep their golden retirement and can bankrupt the company . Hostess executives blamed the union and kept their golden retirment. Boeing is going the same way. The Boeing stock price has been flat for a year and down compared with the Dow no reason to own BA and a lot of risk to hold it. S and P and Dow have beat Boeing YTD and for a year less risk and a lot more return. Now as far as the CEO opinion on the 787, what he said was he did not factor any problem in to the revenue. One analyst put the grounding at 5 billion dollar charge. So someplace in between no effect and 5 billion. most likely. In 2003 on rollout the CEO said the plane would be flying in two months too, Hereis the statement and the facts, "Boeing CEO Jim McNerney told the crowd that the plane would fly within two months. Instead, the company soon announced the first of what would be many delays. It would be more than two years before the plane's first test flight." Do not take the Boeing kool aide and forget the dog and pony show .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359625000291</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 04:36:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359626588150-22</Id><Topic><Title>-+$+- The Boeing Company to be featured on MAD MONEY tonight! -+$+-</Title><Username>lucianoanderson120</Username><Timestamp>1359569677040</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 13:14:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good report !</Msg><Username>mara.meisel</Username><Timestamp>1359626588150</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 05:03:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359628160327-23</Id><Topic><Title>Lithium batteries not good</Title><Username>post7999</Username><Timestamp>1359620890633</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 03:28:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The LI batteries being talked about for the 787 are hardly related to disposable LI batteries.

Who knows, it's all speculation as we the time frame for a possible solution is unclear. But Boeing's management as well as the bosses of All Nippon Airways are in total denial mode.

On the January 29 edition of the O'Reilly Factor, O'Reilly hosted Powell to discuss "racial politics," voter suppression, and voter fraud, but failed to provide important context, including any mention of a crucial Voting Rights Act case set to be argued before the Supreme Court on February 27. In part, this case will turn on the historic civil rights law's efficacy at preventing the type of race-based voter suppression Powell described. The problem that recent photo voter ID laws purport to address - voter fraud committed in person - is "virtually non-existent." Nevertheless, in the past two years, state Republican legislators and right-wing allies have aggressively pushed such laws that add another identification requirement for voting, even though voter identification is already required across the country. Under the Voting Rights Act, federal courts have recently confirmed that new voter ID laws in jurisdictions with a history of voter suppression have a prohibited effect on African-American and Hispanic voters. O'Reilly refused to acknowledge any of these facts in his interview with Powell, even as Powell tried to explain them to him:</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359642329221</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 09:25:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359642419238-37</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Operation ' Rig the Vote '</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359388018912</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 10:46:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump !</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359642419238</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 09:26:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359642424519-38</Id><Title>ATF Royally Screws Up, Again - ATF Machine Guns Ends Up On The Streets of Milwaukee</Title><Msg>You've probably heard the old joke about how the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms should be a convenience store not a federal agency, but the latest ATF screw up in Wisconsin proves they aren't even capable of doing that properly. From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: A store calling itself Fearless Distributing opened early last year on an out-of-the-way street in Milwaukee's Riverwest neighborhood, offering designer clothes, athletic shoes, jewelry and drug paraphernalia. Those working behind the counter, however, weren't interested in selling anything. They were undercover agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives running a storefront sting aimed at busting criminal operations in the city by purchasing drugs and guns from felons. But the effort to date has not snared any major dealers or taken down a gang. Instead, it resulted in a string of mistakes and failures, including an ATF military-style machine gun landing on the streets of Milwaukee and the agency having $35,000 in merchandise stolen from its store, a Journal Sentinel investigation has found. When the 10-month operation was shut down after the burglary, agents and Milwaukee police officers who participated in the sting cleared out the store but left behind a sensitive document that listed names, vehicles and phone numbers of undercover agents. And the agency remains locked in a battle with the building's owner, who says he is owed about $15,000 because of utility bills, holes in the walls, broken doors and damage from an overflowing toilet. The sting resulted in charges being filed against about 30 people, most for low-level drug sales and gun possession counts. But agents had the wrong person in at least three cases. In one, they charged a man who was in prison - as a result of an earlier ATF case - at the time agents said he was selling drugs to them.

The LWNJs believe this it can be regulated any way they want to regulate it. The U.S. constitution does not give a person the right to vote but LWNJs believe this non right can not be regulated or restricted in any way especially requiring voters to have an ID. From Wikipedia "The "right to vote" is not explicitly stated in the U.S. Constitution except in the above referenced amendments, and only in reference to the fact that the franchise cannot be denied or abridged based solely on the aforementioned qualifications. In other words, the "right to vote" is perhaps better understood, in layman's terms, as only prohibiting certain forms of legal discrimination in establishing qualifications for suffrage. States may deny the "right to vote" for other reasons."</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1359645362023</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:16:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359645957188-55</Id><Topic><Title>GOP mouthpiece Oppose Voting Rights !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359642329221</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 09:25:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lowlifes??

This is risking to damage Boeing's reputation even more.</Msg><Username>divesius</Username><Timestamp>1359647619906</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:53:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359647699777-68</Id><Title>Where's the Eveready Bunny when you need him?</Title><Msg>It's not just batteries!</Msg><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1359647699777</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:54:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359647826721-69</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing the actual quarterly loss , a look at the CEO earnings report</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359647224297</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:47:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My O my.</Msg><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1359647826721</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:57:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359647926630-70</Id><Topic><Title>Keeping small dangerous weapons from unstable people</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1359263920059</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 00:18:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...didn't Junior instigate the Fast and Furious project ..

No everyday Joe should be able to vote for mob rule to violate another man's property rights. "Once one accepts the principle of self-ownership, what's moral and immoral becomes self-evident. Murder is immoral because it violates private property. Rape and theft are also immoral -- they also violate private property. Here's an important question: Would rape become morally acceptable if Congress passed a law legalizing it? You say: "What's wrong with you, Williams? Rape is immoral plain and simple, no matter what Congress says or does!" If you take that position, isn't it just as immoral when Congress legalizes the taking of one person's earnings to give to another? Surely if a private person took money from one person and gave it to another, we'd deem it theft and, as such, immoral. Does the same act become moral when Congress takes people's money to give to farmers, airline companies or an impoverished family? No, it's still theft, but with an important difference: It's legal, and participants aren't jailed." -- Walter Williams</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1359649239731</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 11:20:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359649257908-79</Id><Title>Techincal Analysis</Title><Msg>In looking at the chart, (just eyeballing it), it looks like if it breaks ~73.50 -$73.75, it will go to $70 - $71.

The date of the hearing was announced on Wednesday. His status emerged after his 2011 drunken driving arrest in Framingham, Massachusetts. When he was arrested, he told police he would “call the White House”, before being charged with drink-driving.

The U.S. Federal Reserve underscored that view by leaving in place its monthly $85 billion bond-buying stimulus plan on Wednesday, arguing the support was needed to lower unemployment. "The bottom line is that there are no signs of a shift away from QE3," said Vassili Serebriakov, strategist at BNP Paribas referring to the Fed's bond-buying program. "Moreover, recent data suggest that the economy remains well short of the substantial and sustained improvement that the Fed is looking for." That saw the euro break above key resistance around $1.3500 and move close to $1.3570, a high not seen since November, 2011. As a result, the dollar index .DXY fell to a six-week low around 79.183. It was last at 79.263. "The DXY is threatening support at 79.2. From a technical perspective, a clear break of that level would open further USD downside," Serebriakov added.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1359650866628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 11:47:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359650998092-90</Id><Title>Addressing Gun Violence In America</Title><Msg>Mature Adults: lets discuss what we can do, as a nation, to prevent further bloodshed.

Since Boeing produces 737's at 35 a month and has started the rate increase to 38 a month, the 737 delivery rate should follow but so far this month the delivery number indicates there are production planes sitting on a runway storage area somewhere. On the 787 issue, the Boeing shorts and Boeing haters are in a panic as you can see from the frequency of the posts and the inane content of the posts. It will continue and probably increase even after the situation is resolved as their paranoid mentality forces them to deny the findings.

After watching an unedited video of the proceedings I saw no rude outburst so I questioned Hooz and asked him to point out the time stamp for the outburst that Abby Zimet was claiming happened. As usual I got no response. The likely source of the false story was likely MSNBC which aired an edited version of actual events which falsely portrayed gun rights supporters as rude thugs. Here's the Story from Huffington Post. ____________________________________________________ MSNBC Criticized For Editing Of Newtown Gun Hearing (VIDEO) By DAVID BAUDER 01/30/13 10:09 PM ET EST AP On Monday, MSNBC's Martin Bashir reported on hearing testimony given that day by Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son, Jesse, was killed last month in the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn. In the hushed hearing room, Heslin said, "I ask if there's anybody in this room that can give me one reason or challenge this question: why anybody in this room needs to have ... one of these assault-type weapons or military weapons or high-capacity clips?" Heslin paused for five seconds and looked around him. No one else spoke. "Not one person can answer that question," he said. Then, someone in the audience shouted: "The Second Amendment shall not be infringed." After the audience was admonished by a legislator not to speak, Heslin said, "Anyway, we're all entitled to our own opinion, and I respect their opinions and thoughts, but I wish they'd respect mine and give it a little bit of thought." Video aired by Bashir Monday omitted the challenge, depicting Heslin saying: "Why anybody in this room needs to have ... one of these assault-type weapons or military weapons." At that point, without any pause, the audience member's interjection about the Second Amendment was heard. Heslin's comment about respecting opinions was omitted. The camera then focused on Bashir, who said, "a father's grief interrupted by the cries of a heckler." The passage as aired by MSNBC received criticism for being deceptive. "This is not how a legitimate, professional news organization operates," said Brent Bozell, founder of the Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog. "MSNBC's relentless anti-gun advocacy is bad enough, but this is downright dishonest."</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1359676617341</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 18:56:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359677675596-171</Id><Topic><Title>Hoozdik fell for a fabricated story that falsely portrayed supporters of gun rights</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1359676617341</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 18:56:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Hooz fell head over heals for Communism/socialism.

I was aware that MSNBC was accused of fabricating news but had not found a cogent explanation of how that was sequenced. Is there not enough truth out there for folks to formulate their opinion? I am astounded that MSNBC would sink this low. In the mean time, it was gratifying to see even the liberal press jump on Al Gore for his blatant hypocrisy, i.e., his selling out to Fossil Fuel Press Al Jazeera, giving rise to an element of hope that the mainstream media has a conscience - though it is entirely possible that it is akin to hair which continues to grow on a dead corpse.

The Apostle Paul warned Christians, "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms" (Ephesians 6:12). Whether through Democrat or Republican, it doesn't matter, Satan is at work. You call it "psyopsed", I call it the result of rejecting and being disobedient to God.

An engineers' strike could cripple production of all Boeing airplanes and would complicate a wide-ranging review of the 787 Dreamliner by the Federal Aviation Administration. It also could impede an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board into charred batteries on two 787s that prompted a grounding of the entire 787 fleet last week. Boeing has said it has other engineers it can draw on in the event that its engineering workforce walks out. The ballot to be mailed on Feb. 5 recommends members reject the "best and final" contract that Boeing offered on Jan. 17. The votes will be tallied on Feb. 19. . Boeing's offer would enroll new employees in a defined contribution retirement plan, a shift from the defined benefit plan that current employees receive. The union objects to that change, saying it would reduce benefits over the long term. Boeing has said it is trying to reduce pension costs. In fourth-quarter results released Wednesday, it said discretionary cash pension contributions tripled to $1.6 billion in 2012 from the year before, and are expected to be $1.5 billion in 2013. The Management decision to outsource the 787 instead of utilizing SPEEA cost an additional 30 billion in failure . So let’s look at the 1.5 billion to keep a engineering group on the job now, seems cheap ! If Boeing executives ’s had put the bonus money they gave themselves instead NOT fully funding the workers’ pensions prior to being required to do so by the Government, then this would not be an issue. The Parasites in Chicago need to start leading by example they should cut their pensions, bonus and pay first and by a huge amount as it is excessive . . Boeing CEO Jim McNerney's compensation jumped 34% last year as the board of the Boeing rewarded him for delivering the new 787, so how’s those grounded 787 deliveries working for you Boeing stockholders now ?. The executive pay is gone but the 787 plane are grounded no return of the bonus money! How does personal use of stockholders money work for you Boeing shareholders? Boeing also spent $324,504 so McNerney could use the company jet for personal travel. Boeing also paid McNerney $798,392 in perks, life insurance premiums and contributions to his retirement plan; and yet because Boeing refused to fully fund the workers pension funds until the government required it, Boeing wants to skate on the pensions now. Worker’s at Boeing in net wages would have to work about 10 years to earn $798,392 dollars , and they would only be able to make that much without a single Company forced strike. The strike will go because Boeing has a contractual agreement with customers , during a strike the Boeing Company is not liable for late deliveries, so until the 787 problem is solved and the plane ready to move , no reason for Boeing except public fear of safety for the 787 and the customers needing the plane to fly , not much chance of that so far.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359687964804</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 22:06:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359690832845-187</Id><Title>6 year old girl expelled for bringing Toy Gun to school</Title><Msg>WLTX news reports that six-year-old Naomi McKinney brought a small transparent plastic toy gun to school for a show and tell, causing her teachers to freak out. The kindergartner’s father told reporters that he was called to Alice Drive Elementary in Sumter, South Carolina, because his daughter “was fixing to be expelled.” “I got in the car and rushed down there and when I got in there the principal told me that she had a gun at school and she pulls it out and it is a little clear plastic gun.” Hank McKinney said. “You have to show some kind of judgment,” the father continued. “I know there is a lot going on with guns and schools and that is tragic but a six year old bringing a toy to school doesn’t know better.” The school has expelled Naomi indefinitely, saying in a statement that weapons or replica weapons are prohibited. School officials refused to release any pictures or details of the offending item, saying they are “part of the child’s discipline record.” “I’m sorry anything can be a weapon,” the father said. “A pencil is more of a weapon than the toy gun she brought to school.” When the parents tried to appeal, the school sent them a letter saying that the girl would be subject to criminal trespassing charges if she is seen on the campus or at any school sponsored event. Naomi will instead be assigned a home-based instructor from the school district, according to officials. When asked what her intentions were regarding the dangerous weapon, the girl said “I chose to bring it to school because I thought I could show my friends it because they might like seeing it.” When asked to react to her expulsion, Naomi said “I felt bad because i didn’t want to miss all my friends”. Clearly she is very much a dangerous terror threat and has been dealt with accordingly.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359690832845</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 22:53:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359692518953-188</Id><Title>AB A350 may use lithium batteries</Title><Msg>They say they are doing parallel R &amp; D with another battery source.
