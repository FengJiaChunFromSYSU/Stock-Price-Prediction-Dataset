Are set to vote for a strike. And they rarely strike. In nearly 70 years of representation, the members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace have walked out on just two occasions for a total of 41 days - earning them a reputation for being pushovers in negotiations. But, the union has marched steadily, and with a new militancy, toward a strike that could affect how quickly Boeing can implement a fix to its grounded 787 Dreamliner. SPEEA Members are voting this week on whether to reject Boeing's latest contract offer and authorize a strike, as union leaders recommend. On Tuesday, the union will tally the votes. At stake is an estimated $200 million a month in cash that Boeing is losing by not delivering the 787, which is grounded until a fix for its burning battery problem is found and regulators approve it. A walkout by engineers also could slow or halt production on Boeing's other airplane lines for the 737, 777, 767 and 747, several of which have been speeded up to capitalize on a huge book of orders. . SPEEA has billed this strike as a low-risk way to get Boeing back to the bargaining table The sticking point is Boeing's insistence on putting new hires into a defined-contribution retirement plan instead of the traditional pension SPEEA members have. SPEEA said the new plan pays 40 percent less over a 30-year career, Boeing is living through a modern-day gold rush, except the 787 and the 747. High oil prices and easy financing have spurred airlines to order record numbers of new, fuel-efficient planes. Boeing is speeding up its factories to deliver them as fast as possible. The CEO gave himself a 34% pay raise and has a defined pension of 22 million dollars fully funded, while the CEO started by cutting the pay of the engineers to less than the last contract on the first best and last offer and then offered a less #$%$ slightly better pay, to make a comparison offer, and expects the workers who are the best workers in the world, to not see this ploy and wants to make offer even less the benefits for the workers and it does not sit well .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361170032689</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 01:47:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361171778121-8</Id><Topic><Title>Tim Tebow's Positive Message</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1361053082407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 17:18:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YAAWWWWNNNNNNNNNNN (Ghod® is dead, in case you doidn't know)</Msg><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1361171778121</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 02:16:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361171813082-9</Id><Topic><Title>Leading Geneticist: Human Intelligence is Slowly Declining</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361108902670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 08:48:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you a wussy analgonqueen wanna-be?</Msg><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1361171813082</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 02:16:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361182304586-10</Id><Topic><Title>Battery Fix As I Predicted</Title><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1361159387207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 22:49:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You do not need to tell everyone how stupid you are.

I think if the 787 had this battery failure containment system implemented in the original design, the 787 would still be flying, and at most BO would be under FAA pressure to reduce the number of failing batteries. The question is, will the FAA accept this after the fact solution that really should have been there from day one, or will they demand a complete solution before letting the 787 fly again.

The problem is that admitting that you are wrong is the hardest thing in the world to do, especially if you are not an engineer. It would mean all your premises were wrong. All the #$%$ you were feed in MBA school was so much #$%$. Stonecipher was wrong even though he had engineer Hart to tell him how wrong he was. In the end the story will be the unions ruined Boeing. The bungles of management will never come home to roost as the rich write the history books and the reporters and authors run to where the money is. However, all of us who worked the engineering, who saw the fiasco coming, who spoke out against the decisions being made, who were told we were not "team players", though the company values "diversity", we will know, but the rest of the world will still believe that clowns with MBAs and political science degrees are capable of managing complex engineering projects by looking at meaningless metrics, spreadsheets, and power point stop light charts.</Msg><Username>zevach</Username><Timestamp>1361192458786</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 08:00:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361194504871-15</Id><Topic><Title>Leading Geneticist: Human Intelligence is Slowly Declining</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361108902670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 08:48:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get a job you De-Gennarette</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361194504871</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 08:35:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361194775328-16</Id><Topic><Title>Battery Fix As I Predicted</Title><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1361159387207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 22:49:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just boggles my mind.....We've known for a while that lithium batteries are a fire/explosive hazard (Laptops).

That was a well known fact, and put in print many times during the 80's sometime after MSFt was conceived. MSFT didn't have the cash to pay the new employees salaries commensurate with Silicon Valley saleries in California. So they asked their employees to take a risk, and in lew of cash, take stock in MSFT. The rest is history. All of those employees became millionaires, and I ran into a number of them.

Also I think BA under estimated the task of keeping a LI battery with 10 cells operating safely. The fact is the more cells a LI battery has the harder it is to keep one cell from going into an unsafe condition. This is why cell phones which use a single cell LI battery hardly ever go up in smoke compared to laptops which use 3 to 4 cell LI batteries despite the fact there are way more cell phones. Also as the battery size gets larger, the chance of it going up in flames grows from failures, another reason a laptop LI battery is for more prone to a failure induced fire. I do think LI batteries can be made safe enough for aircraft use, but containment is only part of the solution. BA needs to go back to the drawing board, and completely redesign the battery management system. This time it needs to monitor every aspect of every cell it the battery. Voltages, temperatures, charging rate, discharge rates, charge capacity, of each cell in the battery. So that a failing cell can be detected early enough that the battery can be removed from service before it has a major failure. The big question is by the time you add the weight of the containment system, the more sophisticated battery management system, and the added cost, are the LI batteries still cost effective?</Msg><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1361202351610</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 10:45:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361203774024-28</Id><Topic><Title>If Human Intelligence is Slowly Declining was is the Democar party also Slowly Growing?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1361200292915</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 10:11:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you and Joe have a competition going on to see who could be the most absurd low intelligent poster of the day?

The reasons are many. First , and of the greatest importance, switching the battery system causes a loss of Aircraft Model certification basically starting the entire process over pushing the re-launch back anywhere from 10-24 months. Second, Boeing Management would have to assume even a hint of responsibility for this debacle, and THAT is simply unacceptable, it would be professional leprosy T. Wilson once said "Management is the art of getting things done in spite of the system". It occurs to me that the 787 debacle is an instance of the reverse: the system triumphing over getting things done. That is the essence of bad management Boeing executives failed to understand the risk of the outsourcing model for aerospace engineering and why it was a bad idea, blinded in part by the illusion of reduced costs ($). Then when the outsourcing model failed, they directed engineers to fly around the world to fix the mess. These same leaders now fail to recognize the risk of an Engineering strike, in spite of all that has gone wrong, evidenced by their nickel-and-dime approach to the contract negotiations ($$). Now, in the midst of this crisis, these same leaders are desperately trying to salvage earnings ($$$) with a cockamamie workaround that won't pass muster with the flying public. It's time for the Executive Leadership to trust in the integrity of sound engineering to design a proper solution. The short-term financial blinders ($$$$) worn by Boeing's management team is what got them into this mess, risks losing their vital engineering talent and now seems to demonstrate to the world that they can't even see the risk to the company's integrity and reputation, let alone safety to the public. Sad day for Boeing shareholders when Boeing management continually states it believes in its products but constantly delays schedules and finds more problems. Shareholder revolt should become a priority. So Boeing does not know what causes the battery fires and the solution is to protect the plane from the next onboard fire perhaps while the plane is over water and hours from land, at night. Actually titanium does burn, while it does have a high ignition temperature, the internal jet engine parts are not titanium alloy where the hot gasses come into contact with the fan parts. So Boeing has a battery that cannot be put out of fire once started and is going to contain the out of control fire with a titanium box? It is difficult to extinguish Titanium which is already on fire, CO2, water and foam will only feed it with more oxygen. It also burns with a very high temperature (sometimes it is used in fireworks). Titanium has a melting point approximately 400°F above the melting point of steel. Boeings fix is like putting a fire shield around your child’s room so the fire does not spread, while your child is still in the room. You can exit the plane at 30000 feet and 600 mph one time only. what's interesting is the ability to correct the issue is already at hand and yet they refuse to implement such a fix. are these people really just that stupid? do you really think that the flying public is going to just step on the plane without thinking "i wonder if it will catch fire this flight" clearly that is the thought of every passenger, and pilot, as long as there are li-ion batteries powering the systems. Boeing Managers have choices and yet they have chosen the wrong what we are watching is the epic collapse of Boeing, in slow motion Contain and vent the fire outside of the aircraft? You’re kidding right?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361212915755</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 13:41:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361214122602-39</Id><Topic><Title>new battery means new certification process, more time delay , forget safety , follow the money</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361212915755</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 13:41:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post... smart travelers will avoid the 787 DEATHLINER at any cost!</Msg><Username>queen_of_fartz</Username><Timestamp>1361214122602</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 14:02:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361215265202-40</Id><Topic><Title>If Human Intelligence is Slowly Declining was is the Democar party also Slowly Growing?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1361200292915</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 10:11:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do they do more drugs than RepubliCon politicians?

First of all, never admit to any wrongdoing, even if the people you represent are knee-deep in s#!t. Cruise line customers, much like voters, are simply not qualified to understand what they are experiencing. They are obviously leaping to pessimistic conclusions about the reality around them. "Stop being so negative," urged Carnival Cruise Lines president Janus Jacobson. "People need to focus on the positive, and the cruise experience will be more rewarding." She then went on to explain that "you create your own reality" and that the only reason passengers were covered in s#!t is because "they brought that on board with them like baggage." It's the Law of Attraction, right? Thus, it's all the passengers' fault. Jacobson went on to explain away specific concerns that have been brought to her attention by sickened passengers who described barely surviving in "vile" conditions: • Those plastic bags handed out to passengers to defecate into are actually a new "green technology" known as "recycled food reclamation receptacles." • The mattresses strewn across the decks in a shantytown arrangement aren't any sort of negative vacation experience; it's actually all part of a new feature called "ocean-side camping." • Passengers aren't actually knee-deep in s#!t. Instead, they are enjoying yet another new feature of Carnival Cruise Lines called "composting at sea" where passengers get to see their own feces turned into compost to grow salad greens served on the next Carnival cruise! • The lack of food on the cruise is part of Carnival's new "surprise weight loss experience" designed to reverse the 10 - 15 pounds customers usually gain on a cruise. • The smell of smoke in the rooms, caused by the engine catching fire and burning up, was actually just an "delightful aroma of roasted coffee" that Carnival says was really coming out of the kitchen, not the engine room. • The lack of electricity and air conditioning is part of Carnival's new age "sweat lodge cleansing experience," complete with vomiting and near-death experiences, both of which are designed to induce "spiritual visions" and turn you into a master of enlightenment. As the Triumph docked this evening, Carnival Cruise Lines CEO Janus Jacobson declared victory for the passengers, saying, "This is the first cruise ever offered in which passengers actually lost weight rather than gaining it. People who want to lose weight will now be lining up to join our next cruise, featuring an all-you-can-eat parasite cleanse buffet with roasted black walnut hulls and castor oil." See, there's nothing so bad that it can't be explained away using the same logic that the federal government uses to report unemployment numbers or inflation. Heck, passengers should be thanking Carnival Cruise Lines for delivering such an unforgettable Gulf of Mexico cleansing experience</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361235801800</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 20:03:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361236354496-66</Id><Topic><Title>Here is your #$%$! moment of the day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1361225233426</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 17:07:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.

Although this seems to be one of the most extreme cases of children being disciplined over toy guns and gun gestures, it is far from isolated. As we have seen over the past few weeks, in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, it is now a daily occurrence. Ealier this month, a student in Florence, Arizona was suspended because he had a picture of a gun on his computer. At the beginning of the month, it was reported that a six-year-old kindergartner in South Carolina was suspended for taking a small transparent plastic toy gun to school for a show and tell. A day before that incident we reported on the five-year-old in Massachusetts who faced suspension for building a small toy gun out of lego bricks and play-shooting his classmates. We also reported on an incident that erupted when a discussion between two children about a toy nerf gun caused a lockdown and a massive armed police response at two elementary schools in the Bronx. In another incident, a Long Island high school was also placed on lock down for 6 hours in response to a student carrying a toy nerf gun. In yet another recent incident, a five-year-old girl was suspended after a three hour grilling, and described as a “terroristic threat” when she brought a pink bubble gun to school. A South Philadelphia elementary student was searched in front of classmates and threatened with arrest after she mistakenly brought a “paper gun” to school. A 6-year-old boy was suspended from his elementary school in Maryland for making a gun gesture with his hand and saying “pow”. Days after that incident, another two 6-year-olds in Maryland were suspended for pointing their fingers into gun shapes while playing “cops and robbers” with each other. In Oklahoma, a five-year-old boy was also recently suspended for making a gun gesture with his hand. And finally, a 13-year-old Middle School seventh grade student in Pennsylvania was also suspended for the same hand gesture.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361238338790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 20:45:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361241128505-69</Id><Topic><Title>10 year old arrested for Toy Gun Again</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361238338790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 20:45:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good thing I am not a child today doing what I routinely did when I was one.

The rule was keep it in your pocket during class, or have it confiscated until the end of the year. If that sounds bad enough, I would have fore sure run foul with the likes of the ATF, home land security, and the FBI, for doing what we considered fun back in those days. Like making acid bombs, which today are considered at the very least a destructive device, and by some a weapon of mass destruction. Which to us back then was a way to make a loud, but stinky bang.

As you can see the amount is from the non-partisan CBO . As you can see Ombummer's ineffective stimulus cost more and by the time you add in Odrama's war costs in Iraq Afganistan and countries we aren't even at war with like Pakistan, Cornel West's 'war criminal' Obama has outspent Bush by a country mile and MSNBC are on an acid trip if they are claiming $3 trillion in costs. ________________________________________________ From Politifact: Did the stimulus cost more than the war in Iraq? Washington Examiner editorial page editor Mark Tapscott warned readers Aug. 23, 2010, to expect to hear a lot from Democrats about the cost of the Iraq War. It might be expensive, he said, but not as expensive as President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus. Citing data from conservative writer Randall Hoven, Tapscott said, "Obama’s stimulus, passed in his first month in office, will cost more than the entire Iraq War -- more than $100 billion more." Really? Could the nearly seven-year-long war cost less than the 2009 stimulus, which was designed to keep the U.S. economy from sliding into a depression? (actually the depression ended in June 2009) At first glance, the numbers look pretty close. The most recent figures from the Congressional Budget Office, released in August 2010, put the total cost for the stimulus -- from February 2009 through 2019 -- at $814 billion. Estimated funding for the war in Iraq totals $709 billion from 2003 to 2010, according to the same CBO report. As for the war cost, we found a variety of opinions on the total. Some reports have higher estimates than the CBO’s for that same time period. A July 2010 report from the Congressional Research Service estimated the cost at $748 billion, which includes costs for the military, the State Department and foreign aid, and Veterans Administration medical costs related to the war. Add in supplemental appropriation from 2010, and you get about $750 billion, said James R. Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group that studies tax and fiscal issues. Another expert on defense spending told us it’s also important to account for inflation. "The cost of the Iraq War going back seven years and the cost of the stimulus act through 2019 cover a broad stretch of time over which inflation becomes important," Todd Harrison, a senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said in an e-mail. The center is a think tank that focuses on defense issues. Adjusted for inflation, the cost of the Iraq War to date totals $756 billion and the stimulus act totals about $820 billion, according to Harrison.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1361244600426</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:30:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361244740000-82</Id><Topic><Title>"Hubris" - selling of the Iraq War</Title><Username>murrymom</Username><Timestamp>1361242602811</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 21:56:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you Hoozdik's mom?</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1361244740000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:32:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361244797752-83</Id><Topic><Title>"Hubris" - selling of the Iraq War</Title><Username>murrymom</Username><Timestamp>1361242602811</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 21:56:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What the TV expose fails to look into is the possibility that Saddam transferred WMD into Syria shortly before the Iraq war.
