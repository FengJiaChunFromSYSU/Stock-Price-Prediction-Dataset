That’s an outright denial of political reality, but Mr. Romney’s willingness to stray from the truth is at the root of what’s really going on. His campaign has been losing ground since the two political conventions. All the reliable national polls now show Mr. Obama ahead, and in two cases substantially so — beyond the margin of error. A variety of polls also shows Mr. Obama with growing leads in most of the important swing states. To some extent, Mr. Romney’s diminishing stature is because of two recent statements that revealed his deficiencies to a newly interested audience. He falsely suggested that the Obama administration was sympathetic to the violent Muslim protests in Libya and Egypt, illustrating his ignorant and opportunistic critique of foreign policy. And he was caught on video belittling nearly half the country for an overreliance on government handouts. These moments, though, were not fumbles or gaffes. They were entirely consistent with the dismissive attitude Mr. Romney has routinely shown toward non-Americans or the nonrich. Now even long-undecided voters are starting to catch on and dismiss him. In Wisconsin, for example, a hotly contested state that has veered Republican in recent elections, Mr. Obama leads Mr. Romney by 17 points when voters are asked who cares about their needs and problems, according to a Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll published last week of likely voters. The poll found that only 10 percent of voters said his policies would favor the middle class. (This poll was taken before the video showing his disdain for 47 percent of the country.) Voters don’t react positively when a candidate speaks incomprehensibly about taxes, as Mr. Romney did on “60 Minutes.” He said he would lower everyone’s tax rate by 20 percent but that everyone would wind up paying essentially the same taxes because he would limit unspecified deductions and exemptions. Even on its face, that makes little sense. If everyone will pay the same taxes, how does that stimulate growth or reduce unfairness? In fact, tax experts say the rate cut is such a huge benefit for the rich that it can’t be balanced by curbing their deductions. But listeners don’t have to do the math to calculate how fundamentally hollow the proposal is. Asked about the government’s responsibility to the 50 million Americans without health insurance, Mr. Romney said they already have access to health care: in emergency rooms. That, of course, is the most expensive and least effective way of providing care, as someone who once advocated universal care has reason to know. But it also reeks of contempt for those left behind by the current insurance system, suggesting that they must suffer with illness until the point where they need an ambulance. Mr. Romney is free to pursue this shallow, cavalier campaign for six more weeks, but he shouldn’t be surprised if voters increasingly choose not to pay attention.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1348567109878</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 05:58:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348569503103-5</Id><Topic><Title>Why Romney Is Slipping</Title><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1348567109878</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 05:58:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only thing slipping is your brain............</Msg><Username>alangonquin11</Username><Timestamp>1348569503103</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 06:38:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348570649567-6</Id><Title>Apple Co-Founder Wants to Be an Australian Citizen: Report</Title><Msg>Does the wealthy see the writing on the wall here in the US. Message to all the wealthy, TAKE YOUR MONEY AND JUST LEAVE THE US AND START YOUR COMPANIES IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, would like to become an Australian citizen, The Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported on Tuesday, citing the roll out of Australia’s national broadband network as one of the reasons for the move. The idea behind Australia’s $38 billion National Broadband Network is to allow all Australians to have high-speed internet access by 2021. “It’s one of the reasons why I actually like this country and want to become a citizen,” the AFR reported Wozniak as saying. “I live in a country where we don’t have any regulation of telecommunications.” Wozniak told the Australian newspaper that his home in California was not connected to a broadband service, referring to the options available to him as a “monopoly.” Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 with Steve Jobs and created the original Apple computer. He left Apple [AAPL 690.79 -9.305 (-1.33%) ], now the world’s most valuable listed company, in 1987, and is an author and philanthropist. According to the AFR, Wozniak, who was in Australia last week during the launch of the iPhone 5, told a local radio station that he was “underway to become an Australian citizen.” “It turns out I can keep my American citizenship. I intend to call myself an Australian and feel an Australian, and study the history and become as much of a real citizen here as I can,” the AFR quoted Wozniak as saying. Wozniak lined up outside the Apple store in Chermside, Brisbane on Friday to buy the iPhone 5, the AFR reported. Earlier this year, Facebook’s co-founder Eduardo Saverin renounced his U.S. citizenship. Saverin is a citizen of his native country Brazil, but is a permanent resident of Singapore, where he has lived since 2009.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1348570649567</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 06:57:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348572371897-7</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Starting to Slip in All Polls!</Title><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1348528345990</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 19:12:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In reality polls show a dead heat.

Are that deluded or moronic? "Obviously, the "47%" statement was a bad one - not unlike "my Mus.lim" faith, "you didn't build that", and "the private sector is fine". " There are gaffes (misstatements) like "my Mus.lim" faith", quotes taken way of of context intentionally "you didn't build that", and "the private sector is fine" to score political points. And then there is getting caught saying exactly what you meant to say, like Mitt did. If he said 47% did not pay taxes and would never vote for him and he won't waste time trying to change their mind, that would have been fine. Even though a lot of the 47% are his supporters. But he went further, way further, disrespecting and disparaging those 47%, and he didn't even get his characterizations right. He wrote off half the country and claim they not taking personal responsibility and implied they were lazy. I think most Veterans, students, retired people, and the working poor (the vast majority of the 47%) have been slandered and he owes them an apology. Never happen, his arrogance won't allow it. We heard him just right, IN CONTEXT, and he is getting drubbed for it exactly like he should. God is not impressed with your attempt to mislead people.

His commandments say you should not lie, I guess you are just another "religious" hypocrite." There is a lot of material here to talk about. Now, let's talk about your own faith for a moment. What form does that take? How are you so wise and informed as to know with what God is impressed or not? That makes you unique amongst all human beings that are living and have ever lived and will live. Read Isaiah 55:8,9 and Romans 11:34 and report back to me. I am here exercising my right to formulate a political opinion. Get the mote out of your own eye before you worry about what beam you might think that I am carrying. Further, go to the Mother Jones website and read the entire transcript. Take the link on the 47% issue. You will see that he simply says that 47% will vote for Obama no matter what. His mistake was in oversimplification by talking about people that will not vote for him in the same breath as those not paying taxes. At some level, it is substantially true, although it came out stupid. Just as stupid as many of the things that Obama says without the pre-canned speech and the teleprompter. Just as stupid as the President insisting on telling the nation for two weeks that the attack on the Libyan embassy and killing of the U.S. ambassador was spontaneous and a result of the infamous video - even though immediately, and likely beforehand, there was evidence to the contrary and the opposite report from the President of Libya. In this case, Obama had two weeks to think about his lies.

I'm disappointed you didn't even attempt to answer the question. It is not just a question of regulation. But there should be a large number of buyers and sellers, and information about the transactions in the marketplace should be transparent. So if Goldman is a player, then they can use their size to distort the market. In the case of employees, it is rare indeed to know what your coworkers are making, so there is little transparency. Also in the case of Aerospace engineers, there are only a few places to work. Since there are obvious barriers to moving to Europe, Brazil, or Canada to work for one of Boeing's major competitors, the creation of a free market for employee by simply deUnionizing is a highly questionable proposal. In addition, your answer was factually incorrect. You may want to check Wiki in the future to make sure you are close to the facts. Arthur Anderson is not gone, they still exist. A large portion of it "Acenture" certainly still exists. It was not "corrected" by the free market but by the Justice Department. Which also levied the fines. It appears that the employees were absorbed by other accounting firms. Here is a snippet of the wiki page: "On June 15, 2002, Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice for shredding documents related to its audit of Enron, resulting in the Enron scandal. Although later reversed in a pyrrhic Supreme Court victory, the impact of the scandal combined with the findings of criminal complicity ultimately destroyed the firm. Nancy Temple (Andersen Legal Dept.) and David Duncan (Lead Partner for the Enron account) were cited as the responsible managers in this scandal as they had given the order to shred relevant documents. Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not allow convicted felons to audit public companies, the firm agreed to surrender its CPA licenses and its right to practice before the SEC on August 31, 2002 - effectively putting the firm out of business. It had already started winding down its American operations after the indictment, and many of its accountants joined other firms. The firm sold most of its American operations to KPMG, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young and Grant Thornton LLP. The damage to Andersen's reputation also destroyed the viability of the firm's international practices. Most of them were taken over by the local firms of the other major international accounting firms." ..... "As of 2011, Arthur Andersen LLP has not been formally dissolved nor has it declared bankruptcy. Ownership of the partnership has been ceded to four limited liability corporations named Omega Management I through IV. As of 2011, Arthur Andersen LLP still operates the Q Center conference center in St. Charles, nowadays mostly used for Accenture trainings."</Msg><Username>vtguru56</Username><Timestamp>1348606365380</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 16:52:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348606484330-74</Id><Topic><Title>'Cranks and crazies' have taken over US Republicans, says Australian minister</Title><Username>cloroxcowboy</Username><Timestamp>1348463495560</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 01:11:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The crazies and cranks have reduced the Grand Old party into nothing but a cult for fanatical crackpots with severe personality disorders.
