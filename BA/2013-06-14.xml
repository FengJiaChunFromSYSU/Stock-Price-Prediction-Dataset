Michael Snyder Economic Collapse June 14, 2013 Well, isn’t that convenient? At the moment when the Obama administration is feeling more heat then ever before, it starts another war. Suddenly everyone in the mainstream media is talking all about Syria and not about the IRS scandal, Benghazi,NSA snooping or any of the other political scandals that have popped up in recent weeks. As if on cue, Obama made headlines all over the globe on Thursday by claiming that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons against the rebels “multiple times”, and that the U.S. was now ready to do more to assist the rebels. That assistance is reportedly going to include “military support” for the rebels and a no-fly zone over at least part of Syria is being discussed. Without a doubt, these are acts of war, and this conflict is not going to end until Assad has been ousted. But Assad will not go quietly. And all it would take is for Assad to fire a couple of missiles at Tel Aviv for a huge regional war to erupt in the Middle East. And what happens if Russia or China decides to get involved in the conflict in Syria? Obama is playing with fire, but he has shown again and again that he is willing to do virtually anything if it will benefit him politically. As far as the Obama administration is concerned, there is no such thing as a coincidence. The timing of this announcement regarding Syria was not an accident. If Obama wanted to use chemical weapons as an excuse to go after Syria he could have done it weeks ago, or he could have waited several more months before taking action. He chose to do it right now for a reason, and hopefully the American people will be able to see right through this. So exactly what are we going to be doing for the Syrian rebels? Well, we will defini</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371209863981</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 07:37:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371210065843-13</Id><Topic><Title>Showden is no Patriot !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371130293987</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 09:31:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>= i just wrote the Tea Party Patriots and Republican Party asking them to run "winning" challenger in primary against john boehner = LOL, you are such a funny guy! :)) I'd love to see what you wrote.

Well, according to George Will, Lois Lerner had her finger in at least one other pie, specifically the US Senate race between Democrat #$%$ Durbin and Republican Al Salvi: In the fall of 1996, at the campaign's climax, Democrats filed with the Federal Elections Commission charges alleging campaign finance violations by Salvi's campaign. These charges dominated the campaign's closing days. Salvi spoke by phone with the head of the FEC's Enforcement Division, who he remembers saying: "Promise me you will never run for office again, and we'll drop this case." He was speaking to Lois Lerner. After losing to Durbin, Salvi spent four years and $100,000 fighting the FEC, on whose behalf FBI agents visited his elderly mother demanding to know, concerning her $2,000 contribution to her son's campaign, where she got "that kind of money." When the second of two federal courts held that the charges against Salvi were spurious, the lawyer arguing for the FEC was Lois Lerner. If, indeed, Holly Paz has been fired, why is Lois Lerner still on (taxpayer-paid) administrative leave? The Government Oversight and Reform Committee should call in the Christian Coalition, Al Salvi, and anyone else who has been victimized by Lerner, hear their stories, and then call her back to respond. Would she take the Fifth (again)?!</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371215132993</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 09:05:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371215866586-16</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 in 4 black Children live in 2 Parent Homes</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371151829713</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:30:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good point maramwp......yes there is a high cost that come with the acceptance of immorality.

Obama’s promise frequently comes in response to pleas from donors to reject TransCanada Corp (TRP).’s proposed Keystone XL project, a $5.3 billion pipeline that would carry tar-sands oil from Canada to U.S. refineries. Opponents of the pipeline say it would increase greenhouse-gas emissions by encouraging use of the tar sands. While Obama has not detailed the specifics of his plan to the donors, pipeline opponents anticipate the package will include a plan from the Environmental Protection Agency to issue final rules to limit greenhouse-gas emissions from new power plants. In April, the EPA delayed issuing the rule after the electric-power industry objected on legal and technical grounds. Since then, the agency has been rewriting the rule to address those concerns. The White House plan may also include a standard for limits on existing power plants, something EPA officials have said they expect to propose in the next 18 months. Final decisions about the specific policies included in the president’s package are still being made, according to a person close to the White House.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1371220144907</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 10:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371220178969-47</Id><Topic><Title>WAYNEDICK-FEB RAMPAGE .....</Title><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1371219007571</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 10:10:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing should hire him to do the PR$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1371220178969</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 10:29:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371220654997-48</Id><Topic><Title>BA to $150 by 12/31/13</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1371220128707</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 10:28:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure hope it goes that high.... :-) But not too sure we can get there this year.

The prototype of the A350 – a composite, fuel-efficient plane that will compete against Boeing's 787 Dreamliner – will fly at mid-year, Bregier says. The first A350 deliveries are expected in 2014. As the plane gets certified, Airbus decided in February to stick with a nickel-cadmium battery rather than try a lithium-ion battery like the ones that have left the Dreamliner grounded since mid-January. Bregier says lithium-ion batteries are still attractive, but that putting them on Airbus planes He says he there are too many uncertainties surrounding the new batteries. "I'm on the safe side. I'm not saying Boeing is not on the safe side – this is not up to me. This is (up) to FAA and other agencies," Bregier says. Translation, they are unsafe and he knows better than to put passenger lives at risk when the NiCad batteries work with good safety record. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Dreamliner on Jan. 16, after an All Nippon Airways flight made an emergency landing in Japan with a smoldering battery. The incident came after a Jan. 7 battery fire in a Japan Airlines plane parked in Boston. "It's not to make Boeing's life more difficult," Bregier said of the battery decision. "Their life is difficult enough right now." Asked how Airbus would compete with a potential Boeing 777X, Bregier said the A350-1000 already slated for delivery in 2017 will carry just as many passengers but at 25% greater fuel efficiency. "To my knowledge, this is Boeing's response to the very successful A350-1000 that we have launched and started to market more aggressively," Bregier said. "It is not easy to match and beat. The ball now is in Boeing's camp." Bregier broke ground Monday on a manufacturing plant in Mobile, Ala., which will build the A320 family. Airbus already has plants in Germany and China, so opening one in the U.S. made sense because this country will be the largest market for planes for</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371221434638</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 10:50:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371221458041-59</Id><Topic><Title>WAYNEDICK-FEB RAMPAGE .....</Title><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1371219007571</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 10:10:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The stock price isn't the only thing that defines the quality a company.</Msg><Username>oldbuck56</Username><Timestamp>1371221458041</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 10:50:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371221598978-60</Id><Topic><Title>McCain is insane</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371216909104</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 09:35:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>in the case of Syria - our humanitarian nose and voice is all thats needed.

Christianity"</Title><Msg>Senator Rand Paul's Remarks below: Last year in Pakistan, 14-year-old Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head by the Taliban for being a girl and for wanting to go to school. If you haven’t seen the YouTube videow of Malala being interviewed on national television, speaking out for the education of girls, watch and you will be amazed at her poise and grace. Malala never met the great Urdu poet Parveen Shakir, who grew up in Pakistan when women could become highly educated and even Prime Minister. This line from one of Shakir's poems reminds me of Malala: "They insist upon evaluating the firefly in daylight. The children of our age, have grown clever." Why would anyone want to kill this innocent young girl? Because Malala, in her young life, insisted on exposing the firefly to daylight. Her "crime," as seen by the Taliban, is to believe in enlightenment, to believe that out of the darkness a flicker of tolerance can glow and grow to overcome ignorance. Americans are seen by Pakistanis as infidels and invaders. We will not in a thousand years bring enlightenment to Pakistan, only Pakistan can do that. When Pakistan begins to police Pakistan better, when girls who long for nothing but freedom and education are embraced -- rather than gunned down by murderous thugs -- then will progress finally be made. My heart breaks for Malala and her family. It breaks for all those who suffer under violent oppression in the name of religion. It breaks for those who cannot grow up to be poets and teachers, but mostly it breaks for those who cannot speak without being gunned down by extremists. I can only hope that the violence done to her will motivate those who believe in both Islam and peace and tolerance to stand unanimously and proclaim this violence does not represent them. That the Taliban does not represent them. That gunning down children in cold blood does not please their God. The violence and intolerance against girls is also directed toward Christians. It saddens me to see countries that are supposedly our allies persecute Christians. It angers me to see my tax dollars supporting regimes that put Christians to death for blasphemy against Islam, countries that put to death Muslims who convert to Christianity, and countries who imprison anyone who marries outside their religion. There is a war on Christianity, not just from liberal elites here at home, but worldwide. And your government, or more correctly, you, the taxpayer, are funding it. You are being taxed to send money to countries that are not only intolerant of Christians but openly hostile. Christians are imprisoned and threatened with death for their beliefs. In Pakistan, Asia Bibi, a Christian, sits on death row. Her crime, according to her, is that she dared to drink from a glass that belonged to a Muslim co-worker. According to her co-workers, she insulted the Prophet. In our country, we refer to such quibbling as gossip. In Pakistan, if you are a Christian, it can land you on death row. Recently, in Pakistan, a 12-year-old with Downs syndrome was imprisoned and charged with a death penalty crime for burning the Koran. After weeks she was released after a local Imam was accused of actually sprinkling pages from an Arabic book into a fire near the little girl. Dr. Shakil Afridi is not a Christian but his imprisonment by Pakistan is nonetheless an injustice. He was tortured and held without charge for nearly a year. He was shackled with his hands behind his back for months and he was finally imprisoned, likely for the rest of his life for the crime of helping America get Bin Laden. How do your leaders respond? 90 % of them voted against my bill that would have put restrictions on this aid. My bill said that Libya, Egypt, and Pakistan would get no more foreign aid from the US taxpayer unless they turned over the assassins that killed our ambassador, pledged and verified that they CAN and WILL protect our embassies, and in the case of Pakistan they must release Dr. Afridi. Overwhelmingly, I was voted down. Is it any wonder that Congress has a 10% approval rating? In Egypt, in Pakistan, they burn our flag—I say not one penny more to countries that burn the American flag! Even when we’ve tried through good intentions to make the world a better place our actions have often backfired. During the Iraq War, over a quarter-million Iraqi Christians fled Iraq. Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator but his government was secular and therefore relatively safe for Christians. Christians, however, feared the Shiite government that we helped put in place after Saddam, and they fled in droves. Where did these Christians go? They headed mostly for Syria, joining the over one million Syrians who have lived as Christians since the time of Christ. Now, the senate is attempting to arm the rebel forces in syria, many of whom are al quaeda or affiliates. they do so out of a miguided attempt to stop the violence in syria. Instead their actions will bring more violence and more persecution of Christians, who have long been protected in Syria. Before the Arab Spring, Christianity flourished in small outposts, like the Coptic Christians in Egypt. I had hoped that the Arab Spring would bring freedom to long-oppressed people throughout the Middle East, but I fear the Arab Spring is becoming an Arab winter. Today, Christians in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria are on the run—persecuted or under fire—and yet, we continue to send aid to the folks chasing them. While they burn the American flag and the mobs chant Death to America, more of your money is sent to these haters of Christianity. Even if all the atrocities to Christians were not occurring in these countries, we simply don’t have the money to engage in this foolishness. We must borrow the money from China to send it to Pakistan. While American soldiers spent a decade fighting to liberate Iraq and while American taxpayers have sent roughly $470 million each year in aid, Christians in Iraq are the subjects of what Carl Moeller, president of Open Doors, describes as “religicide.” Before the toppling of Saddam Hussein, Mosul, a city in Iraq, was home to some 75,000 Christians, but now the number has dropped to around 25,000. Christian homes are set on fire, bombs are being placed in their cars and Christian families are receiving letters threatening them to leave Iraq or be kidnapped or killed. American soldiers have also risked their lives for the sake of these countries liberation. Our young men and women have fought for a noble cause but the law of unintended consequences is an unforgiving one. These countries are not our true allies and no amount of money will make them so. They are not allies of Israel and I fear one day our money and military arms that we have paid for will be used against Israel. This fight has made me unpopular in Washington but I am willing to risk unpopularity with politicians to do what I am convinced is right. The new leader of Egypt is Mohammed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Recently, he stood by when a radical cleric said a prayer for the destruction of Israel and her supporters in his presence. Actually, it is worse, he did not just stand by, he was seen to mouth the word “Amen” as the cleric said these words of hatred. How does your government respond? The bipartisan consensus in Washington vows to increase Egypt’s funding. The President is currently requesting a billion dollar increase in aid to Egypt. This is an outrage! It is amazing that so many in Washington fail to see who the real enemies are. We should immediately stop sending F-16’s and tanks to Egypt!</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1371225428102</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 11:57:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371225470043-72</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus 350 first flight and burns 25% less fuel than a 787, no lithium batteries and TSLA up as I said,BA not so good</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371216663708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 09:31:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No it isn#$%$ lifted from the Airbus website for the A350 which has been there for many years and is referring to older generation aircraft that the A350 is intended to replace, not the 787.</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1371225470043</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 11:57:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371225496826-73</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus 350 first flight and burns 25% less fuel than a 787, no lithium batteries and TSLA up as I said,BA not so good</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371216663708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 09:31:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FATHER Z OR AS YOUR AVATOR DID YOU DISCUSS THIS WITH YORU CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND Paula Allen , "whsteffanms on his posts and MSFT, eh! 18-Jun-11 01:42 pm whsteffanms...

Let's look at some cities where large percentages of black Americans live under poor conditions. Experiencing a violent crime rate of 2,137 per 100,000 of the population, Detroit is the nation's most dangerous city. Rounding out Forbes magazine's 2012 list of the 10 most dangerous cities are St Louis; Oakland, Calif.; Memphis, Tenn.; Birmingham, Ala.; Atlanta; Baltimore; Stockton, Calif.; Cleveland; and Buffalo, N.Y. The most common characteristic of these predominantly black cities is that for decades, all of them have been run by Democratic and presumably liberal administrations. Some cities -- such as Detroit, Buffalo, Newark, N.J., and Philadelphia -- haven't elected a Republican mayor for more than a half-century. What's more is that in most of these cities, blacks have been mayors, chiefs of police, school superintendents and principals and have dominated city councils. You might ask, "What's the point, Williams?" Let's be clear about it. I'm not stating that there's a causal relationship between crime, poverty and squalor on the one hand and, on the other, Democratic and black political control over a city. Nor am I saying that blacks ought to vote Republican. What I am saying is that if one is strategizing on how to improve the lives of the poorest black people, he wants to leave off his to-do list election of Democrats and black politicians. Also to be left off the to-do list is a civil rights agenda. Racial discrimination has little to do with major problems confronting black people. Today 72 percent of black babies are born out of wedlock. Being born and finding out that your mother is 17 years old, that your grandmother is 35 and that you don't know who or where your father is is not a good start on life. In fact, it's a near guarantee for school dropout, poverty and crime, but such a start in life has nothing to do with racial discrimination. Law-abiding poor black people suffer the nation's highest rates of criminal victimization from assaults and homicide. More than 50 percent of homicide victims are black. Would anyone claim that this victimization is caused by racist groups preying on the black community? In addition to victimization, the level of lawlessness in many black communities has the full effect of a law banning economic growth. That's because the thugs are equal-opportunity thugs who will rip off a black-owned business just as they'd rip off a white-owned business. Black education is a disaster, but who runs the violent, disruptive big-city schools, where education is all but impossible? For the most part, it's not white people. Go to a city such as Detroit and you'll find that blacks have been superintendents, principals and most of the teachers for years. Most black high-school students, in Detroit and other cities, can't read, write and compute as well as sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade white students, but is it because of racism? What the elite teach is not only futile but counterproductive. For example, speaking standard English in an English-speaking country is critical for self-improvement. But that's not the lesson from the nation's multiculturalists, who call for the celebration of native languages and dialects. Sloppy-minded academics and assorted hustlers have taught that poor English, gangsta rap, men wearing pigtails and thug behavior should not be criticized but become a part of the celebration of diversity. Black people could benefit from an honest examination of the bill of goods they've been sold. Such an examination would not come from black politicians, civil rights leaders or the black and white liberal elite. Those people have benefited politically and financially from keeping black Americans in a constant state of grievance based on alleged racial discrimination. The long-term solution for the problems that many black Americans face begins with an absolute rejection of the self-serving agenda of hustlers and poverty pimps. Walter E.

According to an American Community Survey, by the U.S. Census Bureau, the top 10 poorest cities with populations more than 250,000 are Detroit, with 33 percent of its residents below the poverty line; Buffalo, N.Y., 30 percent; Cincinnati, 28 percent; Cleveland, 27 percent; Miami, 27 percent; St. Louis, 27 percent; El Paso, Texas, 26 percent; Milwaukee, 26 percent; Philadelphia, 25 percent; and Newark, N.J., 24 percent. The most common characteristic of these cities is that for decades, all of them have been run by Democratic and presumably liberal administrations. Some of them -- such as Detroit, Buffalo, Newark and Philadelphia -- haven’t elected a Republican mayor for more than a half-century. What’s more is that, in some cases for decades, the mayors of six of these high-poverty cities have been black Americans. You say, “What’s the point, Williams?” Let’s be clear about it. I’m not stating a causal relationship between poverty and Democratic and/or black political control over a city. What I am saying is that if one is strategizing on how to help poor people, he wants to leave off his list of objectives Democratic and black political control of cities. According to Albert Einstein (attributed), the definition of insanity is "doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” Crime is one of the results of the liberal agenda. Blacks are 13 percent of the population but are more than 50 percent of murder victims. About 95 percent of black homicide victims had a black person as their murderer. Blacks are not only the major victims of murder but also suffer high victimization rates of all categories of serious violent crime. Most often, another black is the perpetrator. During the 1960s, academic liberals and hustling politicians told us that to deal with crime, we had to deal with its “root causes,” poverty and discrimination. My colleague Thomas Sowell has pointed out that in 1960, the total number of murders in the United States was lower than in 1950, 1940 and 1930, even though our population had grown and two new states had been added. The liberal agenda, coupled with courts granting criminals new rights, later caused the murder rate to double, and the rates of other violent crimes also began to skyrocket. Crime imposes a hefty tax on law-abiding residents of black neighborhoods. Residents bear costs of having to shop outside of their neighborhoods; criminals have driven many businesses out. Children can't play safely in front of their homes. Fearing robberies, taxi drivers, including black drivers, often refuse to accept telephone calls for home pickups and frequently pass black customers by on the street. Neighborhood property values are lower as a result of crime. Plus, there’s the insult associated with not being able to receive pizza or other deliveries on the same terms as people in other neighborhoods. Often, politicians who call for law and order are viewed negatively, but poor people, particularly poor black people, are the most dependent on law and order. In the face of high crime, wealthier people can afford to purchase alarms, buy guard dogs, hire guards and, if things get too bad, move to a gated community. These options are not available to poor people. The only protection they have is an orderly society. Democratic and black politicians are beholden to and serve the interests of the powerful vested interest groups, such as labor unions, teachers unions and assorted liberals, not the ordinary people who voted them into office. Otherwise, they wouldn't begin to allow the rampant crime and nearly systematic destruction of learning opportunities for generations of black children by governmental schools.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371226812508</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 12:20:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371227067064-81</Id><Topic><Title>McCain is insane</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371216909104</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 09:35:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" Don't assume I support the goals of you right-wing crazies." ....

The A350 will be made from 53 per cent carbon fiber; the 787 is 50 per cent carbon fiber. Both are long range and can fly in excess of 8,000 miles without refueling. Somewhat bigger, the A350 will have 270-440 seats to the 787’s is 210-330. Both come in three models although the smallest 787 may be dropped. A350 or Boeing 787? (answer: A350). credit: Airbus The A350 promises 25 per cent fuel consumption improvement from its “current long range nearest competitor (it’s unclear what plane Airbus is comparing the A350 to on fuel efficiency, but offers it as a replacement for “any [Boeing] 747 operator”); the 787 claims to deliver 15 per cent better fuel efficiency over the similarly-sized (and aged) Boeing 767. Of course, there are major differences. One area in the A350 that will distinguish it from other passengers jetliners, though, will be the cockpit which will have six “very large LCD displays” comprising the flight information center instead of the he need for the hundreds of individual circuit breakers typically found in jetliners. Six "very large" displays in the A350 cockpit. credit: Airbus A major difference is that the biggest model, the A350 1000, will carry up to 100 passengers more than the biggest 787. Boeing’s answer to that is the 747-8 Intercontinental, a new model of the world’s first jumbojet.

When W.E.B. Dubois criticized Marcus Garvey's back-to-Africa movement, Garvey dismissed him as "purely and simply a white man's n***er." Dubois responded in kind, blasting Garvey as "without a doubt the most dangerous enemy of the black race in America and the world." There were attacks and counterattacks between Booker T. Washington and DuBois. Carter adds, "Many a great thinker in our history, from Arna Bontemps to Ida B. Wells to James Weldon Johnson to Paul Robeson, has chafed under the pressure to conform or be ostracized. Black intellectuals had no monopoly on being attacked for straying away from the conventional "wisdom". In a 1960 speech to the Nation Association of Manufacturers, S.B. Fuller, founder of Fuller Brush, opined, "Even more than racial barriers, it is a lack of understanding of the capitalist system that keeps blacks from making progress." Fuller was echoing Booker T. Washington's argument that racial progress came from having something to sell. For that sin, black leaders led a boycott against Fuller Brush, causing him $8 million in loses and near bankruptcy. Carter says, and I agree, "We as a people should have learned a lesson about the importance of permitting, encouraging, even cherishing, critical thinking. By encouraging open and robust debate about the problems confronting our community, we can march upward toward a better tomorrow. If instead we choose to stifle the voices of dissent, it is hard to see how we will get anyplace at all." No people, particularly black people, can afford a monopoly on ideas. Only in an unfettered marketplace of ideas will better ideas emerge. And black Americans need better ideas. After all who in their right mind can say that: after years and trillions of dollars spent on government programs like urban renewal, Head Start, and War on Poverty there's no more urban blight, black kids can read and write as well as white kids and poverty has been eliminated?

This will redirect the conversation and avoid the personal hurt of being called a racist. The following is a guide to some of these tactics and when to use them. But I have _____ friends – This one is old school using it straight out is unlikely to be effective. Jon Kay has tried a version of the inverse “some of my worst enemies are white” with limited effectiveness. If you have someone in your family with a white saviour complex “I have a nephew or niece” may be the best way to work this tactic. We just have different opinions – This approach is used when you’ve said something flat out horrible. One way of phrasing this is “it’s a free country” although that may make you feel like you are a child throwing a tantrum at being punished for taking a crayon someone else had momentarily put down. One can also get into a philosophical debate over the nature of fact and opinion. If you’ve got any new age post-modern tendencies you can talk about how there is no such thing as facts or a singular worldview. Since your worldview sees other people as evil you’ll want to just brush over that part of it. Talk about emotions and politeness – When you are racist to other people they are likely to respond with emotion, you did after all insult them and insinuate they were subhuman. Insisting on a tone for the conversation allows you to deflect whilst telling the person you are abusing they cannot respond to you in the way they want achieving double racism. Diverse cultures – This move is perhaps the worst used. Often people just blurt out the words multicultural society or melt pot when accused of racism. This tactic when done properly is a contextualized version of “we all have opinions” insisting that the diversity of our country is completely outside a history of colonialism. Often these words get misused and diverse simply means not</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1371236377852</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 14:59:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371236430223-113</Id><Topic><Title>Silencing Dissent</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371235231251</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 14:40:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Point to ‘spokespeople’ – One of the cool tricks white governments have is to pay certain malleable non-white individuals as spokespeople. Their role is to say racist things so white people feel okay with it. If you are going to be racist it isn’t important to know the names of any people in the group you’re maligning except these spokespeople. Going after Muslims, know Tarek Fatah attacking women know Anne Coulter, slagging indigenous folks, know Senator Brazeau. The basis of this deflection tactic is that everyone from the group you assaulting is the same so watch out for backlash on that front. But I know all about you/them – If you are lucky you may momentarily be able to deflect with your prior indulgence in poverty tourism. This basis of this tactic is simple: you have seen the people you are talking about, ergo what you are saying is based in fact and not tempered by the racial assumptions you brought to your encounter. To get maximum time on this deflection tactic tell a really specific story about said group which you can then extrapolate well beyond its logical limits. We are all immigrants – This argument is used almost solely against first nations. It attempts to challenge the “here-firstedness” of indigenous people when “here-firstedness” is a central tenant of white law. To attempt to delegitimize claims is based on anthropological claims that people in North America came here pre-whiteness from Siberia. It becomes a diversionary tactic because it ignores the elements from the same theoretical body that humans originated as a species in East Africa. Following this logic said racist’s Ethiopian cab driver should be telling him what to do.

As a follow on CNBC will allow James McNerney will be on CNBC nest Monday at 6 to make his story for his failed 787. It does not matter what the Boeing CEO says, the record is established for the 787 ,it is 4 years late and 30 billion over expected cost and a fire hazard, nor does it matter what the retired MD attorney, who goes by the name of spartacus9991 , and is paid, by Boeing , to follow me and harass me all the time.As long as I post here ,spartacus9991 will have a Boeing paycheck . Yesterday, spartacus99991, slipped up and added another part of his reason for following me for about 10 years. He has been with me since I first pointed out that apple under Steve jobs was a much better stock than Boeing about ten years ago and never quit. Lately spartacus99991, is after me with my comparisons between Boeing ACAD up 1000% in a year and then TSLA compared to Boeing . I notice spartacus9991is a professional .

States run by Republican governors — Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana, Arizona, Virginia, South Carolina, Nevada and Georgia — claimed the top ten spots this year, unchanged from last year’s list. Meanwhile, Democrat-controlled Massachusetts, Illinois, New York and California ranked at the very bottom of the list. New Jersey, run by Republican Gov. Chris Christie, filled out the bottom five at #46. The rankings are based on the survey responses of over 700 business chief executives who either have bases in that state or operations there. The metrics used included tax and regulatory atmosphere, quality of the workforce and living environment. The most dramatic one-year jump in ranking occurred in Ohio, which climbed 13 spots to 22nd place. One CEO commented that Ohio “has made a dramatic turnaround under Republican leadership.” Republican Gov. John Kasich succeeded Democrat Ted Strickland in the 2010 mid-term elections. Democrat-controlled Delaware saw the most dramatic drop in ranking, dropping 13 spots to 27th place. Several Republican governors used the respected survey as an opportunity to brag on behalf of their states. “This vote of confidence from business leaders across the nation further highlights that Texas is the epicenter for economic prosperity in this country,” said Texas Gov. Rick Perry in a press release. Fifty-two Fortune 500 companies are now based in Texas. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whose state ascended from 41st place in 2010 to 17th place this year amidst several controversial public union reforms, boasted that “this three-year increase in ranking continues to show our economy is better off than it was a few years ago, and Wisconsin is on track to becoming one of America’s best states for business.” Another Republican occasionally mentioned as a potential contender for the 2016 GOP Presidential nomination, Gov. Bobby Jindal, guided his state’s impressive 33-spot rise in the rankings since 2009. Louisiana ranked number 11 this year, its highest position ever. What did CEOs say about bottom-ranked California, a state where Democrats have enjoyed a supermajority in the legislature? “California is getting worse, if that is even possible,” bemoaned one CEO. “[I] am not aware of any businesses other than entertainment that will be expanding or moving into CA. It is a black hole,” observed another. The editors of Chief Executive piled-on, rating California’s development trend indicator as “negative,” noting that the “major income-tax hike in November hastens [the state’s] self-imposed economic decline.” Chief Executive concluded that labor and tax policies were important drivers of States’ success in the survey. For example, the recent drive to enact “right-to-work” laws in many states has prompted corporate investment, according to the publication. “When . . . Indiana became a [right-to-work] state, Caterpillar announced that it would move its London, Ontario plant to Muncie,” observed the editors. States without an income tax, or states such as Oklahoma and Kansas which have instituted recent tax-reforms, also fared particularly well in the rankings. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously referred to the states as “laboratories,” where citizens could “try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.” It seems clear liberal experimentation in California has failed, while conservative experimentation in Texas is a resounding success.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1371236993600</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 15:09:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371237211140-117</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus 350 versus Boeing 787: the differences and many similarites</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371230007313</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 13:13:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as an aold MD attorney who is paid to follow me since I posted how bad Boeing did compared to Apple until Steve jobs death you should be happy that as long as I am here you get a paycheck spartacus9991 you are an old attorney that worked for MD .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371237211140</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 15:13:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371237521518-118</Id><Topic><Title>No surprise – Red states dominate CEO survey of best places to do business</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1371236993600</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 15:09:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No surprise is right.

Raids at these plants have resulted in the arrests of unauthorized workers and have brought renewed attention to the controversies surrounding employment practices of the meat packing and processing industry. In particular, media accounts of these events have heightened a negative image of meat packing and processing companies as users and exploiters of illegal labor and as poor corporate citizens in their communities. The U.S. meatpacking industry has a long history of employing immigrant labor. Over a century ago, Upton Sinclair’s classic novel The Jungle depicted the life of immigrants working in the Chicago Stockyards. More recently, census data from 2010 show that roughly one-third of workers in the industry are foreign-born, although the number is likely higher since Census data under report undocumented workers. Jeffrey Passel of the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that 20 to 25% of workers in the meat packing and processing industry were undocumented migrants in 2005, although the current proportion is likely lower due to increased enforcement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the recent economic recession. The controversy surrounding meat packing’s employment of immigrant labor has been particularly acute because of the industry’s more recent expansion into the rural Midwest and South. While in Sinclair’s day meatpacking was predominately an urban industry, by 2000 more than 60% of meat packing and processing jobs were located in rural areas. Most rural areas have a lower number of foreign-born residents than urban areas, so meatpacking growth is more likely to change the demographics of their host communities. And, because meatpacking plants are atypically large relative to other rural employers, industry growth can influence the overall economy of a rural area to a much greater extent than would be seen in an urban one.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1371240124244</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 16:02:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371240282289-140</Id><Topic><Title>US to Arm Executioners in Syria !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371228034320</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 12:40:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and on the other side of the scale the brutal dictator Assad supported by I ran and Hizbollah used weapons including chemical to murder close to 60,000 innocent women and children and left homeless millions more.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1371240282289</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 16:04:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371240322907-141</Id><Topic><Title>Did poordumbtard vote for Ron Paul?????</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1371238815867</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 15:40:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He also is pro union....IOWs.....he is in favor of labor extortion rather than a free labor market..

Is that right? In speech to conservatives Friday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush raised eyebrows with the words he chose to discuss the benefits of immigrants producing many young workers. By Peter Grier Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Friday told an audience of conservatives that the future of the US economy depends on immigrants in part because they are “more fertile” than native-born Americans and thus will produce many young workers to help support the aging US boomer generation. “More fertile”? Yes, that’s a formulation Mr. Bush has used before, but it’s now drawing a lot of criticism on Twitter and elsewhere on the Web. That’s because it’s not the right word. “Fertile” means “capable of reproduction,” so what Bush was saying was immigrants are more physically able to have children. That’s not true. “Jeb Bush, a regular Bill Nye the Science Guy,” read one typical Twitter comment. RECOMMENDED: 14 Republicans who might run in 2016 What Bush meant to say was that immigrants have a higher birthrate. In the years ahead, the United States will need a large cohort of young workers to pay taxes to help support the Social Security and Medicare expenses of retirees. With the native-born birthrate sinking toward a record low, immigration could be a big help in this regard, runs Bush’s real argument. “Immigrants are more fertile, and they love families, and they have more intact families, and they bring a younger population. Immigrants create an engine of economic prosperity,” was Bush’s full quote during his speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s annual conference in Washington. It’s true that immigrant women per capita have more children than native-born women. Last November, a comprehensive Pew Research Center analysis of the latest available government data found that the immigrant birthrate in 2010 was 87.8 live births per every 1,000 women of childbearing age. The equivalent figure for native-born women was 58.9. (It’s also true that the immigrant birthrate is declining. Hispanics are having fewer children per capita as they assimilate into US culture, as did previous waves of immigrants throughout US history.) Want your top political issues explained? Get customized DC Decoder updates. To see why high birthrates might be a help, consider that preliminary figures show the 2011 birthrate for all women was 63.2 births per 1,000, according to Pew. “That rate is the lowest since at least 1920, the earliest year for which there are reliable numbers,” wrote Pew’s Gretchen Livingston and D’Vera Cohn. By contrast, the birthrate in 1957, at the height of the baby boom, was 122.7, nearly double today’s rate. Aside from his weird word choice for his birthrate argument, Bush gave a “civil speech on serious issues,” judges NBC’s deputy political editor Domenico Montanaro. Besides backing comprehensive immigration reform, he pushed for greater North American energy production; further changes to the education system, such as using student achievement to rank schools; and greater support for families, including nontraditional ones. “Let me remind you, families don’t look all the time like they used to, and that’s OK,” Bush said. “We have to be supportive of a single mom or dad, or the grandmother taking care of young children.” But on Friday at least, the right-leaning conference that Bush spoke to was not buying it. “Bush’s arguments for immigration reform were met with near silence from the conservative crowd Friday, and following his speech the former Florida governor received a polite standing ovation,” CNN reported. In contrast, firebrand Rep. Michele Bachmann (R) of Minnesota received loud applause from the same crowd for opposing the current immigration reform effort. In general, the tea party and anti-immigration-reform Republicans remain suspicious of Bush. Within the current GOP, he stands as a moderate. “We need to embrace ‘comprehensive immigration reform’ because ... fertility? Remember when Barbara Bush said, ‘We’ve had enough Bushes?’ ” gibed the conservative website Twitchy following Bush’s speech Friday.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371256605989</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 20:36:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371257208224-170</Id><Topic><Title>Paris Air Show- Vote on Boeing vs Airbus Stock Price</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371247771854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 18:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Boeing launches the 787-10x and starts taking orders for the 777x, then Boeing will win totally sales.

Can't project a % as don't know if Boeing will hopefully launch these planes</Msg><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1371257208224</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 20:46:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371258170284-171</Id><Topic><Title>Paris Air Show- Vote on Boeing vs Airbus Stock Price</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371247771854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 18:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I vote Airbus stock % increase will lead if the A350 does a fly-by(which I expect to happen) Boeing if the A350 does not do a fly-by.</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371258170284</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 21:02:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371258560246-172</Id><Topic><Title>Paris Air Show- Vote on Boeing vs Airbus Stock Price</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371247771854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 18:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, Elon Musk is heavily into aerospace, even if tsla isn't part of it.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1371258560246</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 21:09:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371259463391-173</Id><Topic><Title>And Now, For Your #$%$ Moment of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371256605989</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 20:36:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Obama supports AlQaeda in Syria, shouldn't he be arrested under the NDAA for supporting terrorists ?</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1371259463391</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 21:24:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371264485674-174</Id><Topic><Title>McCain is insane</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371216909104</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 09:35:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>McCain is one crazy democrat pretending to be a republican.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1371264485674</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 22:48:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371264851057-175</Id><Title>Marines land Osprey aircraft on Japanese ship</Title><Msg>A U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey aircraft made an unprecedented landing Friday on a Japanese naval vessel off the California coast.

When caught red-handed, they respond with anger and threats, then weave new fabrications to explain away whatever they were caught doing. A sociopath caught red-handed with a suitcase full of cash he just stole, for example, might declare he had actually rescued the money from being stolen by someone else, and that he was attempting to find its rightful owner. He's the hero, see? And yet, in reality, he will simply pocket the money and keep it. If you question him about the money, he will attack you for questioning his honesty. Sociopaths are masters are presenting themselves as heroes with high morals and philosophy, yet underneath it they are the true criminal minds in society who steal, undermine, deceive, and often incite emotional chaos among entire communities. They are masters at turning one group of people against another group while proclaiming themselves to be the one true savior. Wherever they go, they create strife, argument and hatred, yet they utterly fail to see their own role in creating it. They are delusional at so many levels that their brains defy logical reasoning. You cannot reason with a sociopath. Attempting to do so only wastes your time and annoys the sociopath one excuse after another</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1371268481885</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 23:54:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
