They also worry about defense contracts that have been scaled down, lost or threatened because of Boeing's inability to deliver on its promises. Take, for instance, Boeing's role as systems integrator of the Army's ambitious Future Combat Systems program, the Pentagon's second-biggest weapons development program. It has been scaled back partly because of poor performance. Analysts also are expecting Boeing to swallow a charge against earnings of up to $500 million related to the June 22 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of the Sea Launch commercial satellite launch joint venture. Boeing owns 40% of heavily indebted Sea Launch. Companies in Norway, Russia and Ukraine own the rest. On June 23, Boeing delivered its most disquieting news yet. Ground testing of the 787 Dreamliner had revealed a structural failure in the world's first jetliner made mostly of composite materials rather than aluminum and steel. The discovery of 36 tiny weak points where the wings join the fuselage forced a last-minute scuttling of the 787's first flight. It was the fifth time in two years that Boeing had to tear up its 787 test and delivery schedules. Worse, officials still can't say for sure when the project will get back on track, though they hope the plane will fly by year's end. Industry analysts were particularly peeved that this latest delay came less than a week after Boeing executives had assured them at the Paris Air Show that the 787's first flight would be before the end of June. Wags, who'd already been calling the Dreamliner the "7-LATE-7," came up with an even more scathing nickname: The "Nightmareliner."</Msg><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1344951844000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 09:44:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344952592000-24</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan's Budget Is An Empty Fairy Tale</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_86</Username><Timestamp>1344944120000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 07:35:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>catholic ryan should listen to his bishops about love and charity for the poor and downtrodden!

The reason: Romney attracted 15,000 at a rally over the weekend. The email: Paul -- I just got this disturbing report: Yesterday's Romney-Ryan rally in North Carolina pulled in an overflow crowd of 15,000 people. There's no spinning that number. It's a LOT of people, and the Republican base in energized. And that's not all. Since the VP announcement, Romney's campaign has brought in over 70,000 donations from his Tea Party base.

Cut This Ad! Clinton COS on Ryan: ‘This Guy is Amazing.’ 9:09 AM, AUG 14, 2012 • BY WILLIAM KRISTOL Bill Bennett suggested on his radio show this morning that the Romney-Ryan campaign (or someone else) cut an ad to make famous these remarks (delivered a year ago at the University of North Carolina) about Paul Ryan by Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles: The following clip would make a nice 30-second ad: “Have any of you all met Paul Ryan? We should get him to come to the university. I’m telling you this guy is amazing. ... He is honest, he is straightforward, he is sincere. And the budget that he came forward with is just like Paul Ryan. It is a sensible, straightforward, serious budget and it cut the budget deficit just like we did, by $4 trillion. … The president as you remember, came out with a budget and I don’t think anybody took that budget very seriously. The Senate voted against it 97 to nothing." Getting this ad up in swing states with a real buy behind it would do two things: It would go a long way to inoculate the ticket against the attacks on the Ryan budget; just as important, it would introduce Paul Ryan to voters as an impressive man and public servant. I think conventional wisdom doesn't yet appreciate how much of a positive Ryan can be for the ticket. Publicizing Bowles's comments could help shape the public's view of Ryan—and improve the public's view of Mitt Romney, the man who picked him.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1344957686000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 11:21:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344957785000-34</Id><Topic><Title>Obamaville Campaign In Full Panic Mode</Title><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1344957134000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 11:12:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The "Right One" and you?</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1344957785000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 11:23:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344957980000-35</Id><Topic><Title>''American Spring'' Coming?</Title><Username>skeptically97</Username><Timestamp>1344910595000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 22:16:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Infowars-News for retards.</Msg><Username>ichbinienmachoman</Username><Timestamp>1344957980000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 11:26:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344958596000-36</Id><Title>X-51 scehduled flight today</Title><Msg>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. — The Air Force plans a key test of an experimental aircraft designed to fly at six times the speed of sound, or about 3,600 mph. The Los Angeles Times ( http://lat.ms/PcyZEz) reports the unmanned X-51 WaveRider is expected to reach Mach 6 Tuesday when it's dropped by a B-52 bomber and takes flight off the Southern California coast near Point Mugu. Engineers hope it sustains its top speed for 300 seconds, twice as long as it's gone before. Last year in its most recent test, the X-51 fell for about four seconds before its booster rocket ignited, but the aircraft failed to separate from the rocket and plunged into the ocean. Designed by Boeing Co., the aircraft is intended to allow the Pentagon to deliver strikes around the globe within minutes.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1344958596000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 11:36:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344958930000-37</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan's Budget Is An Empty Fairy Tale</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_86</Username><Timestamp>1344944120000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 07:35:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very cool... it's heartening to see that there are a few honest Republicans around, for whom unchecked greed is not seen as a virtue.

"They're going to put you all back in chains," Biden added, presumably referring to Romney and new running mate Paul Ryan. Some Republicans objected to Biden's use of the word "chains." Former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer: "The press pounded (Sarah) Palin when she talked about 'blood libel' ... what will they do about Biden's 'chains' remark." A fired-up Biden also appeared to forget where he was. At the end of his speech, Biden told supporters that, with their help, he and President Obama "can win North Carolina again."

By the way, Paul Ryan was a good choice for Romney. Ryan is the ventriloquist who will sit Romney on his knee and tell him what to say.

But as is generally the case with running mates, Ryan gives only a slight boost to Romney. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 50% of Likely U.S. Voters now have a favorable opinion of Ryan, while 32% view him unfavorably. This includes 29% with a Very Favorable view of Romney’s vice presidential pick and 13% with a Very Unfavorable one. Only 13% are now unfamiliar with Ryan, and five percent (5%) are not sure about him. (To see survey question wording, click here.) Forty-three percent (43%) of voters think Romney made the right choice when he chose Ryan to be his running mate. Twenty-two percent (22%) disagree and think it was a bad choice. A sizable 35% aren’t sure. But 36% now say they are more likely to vote for Romney with Ryan as his running mate. Twenty-nine percent (29%) say they are less likely to vote for the Republican, while just as many (30%) say the vice presidential selection has no impact on their vote. In the key swing state of Ohio, the initial reaction to Ryan is also modestly positive. Ryan’s numbers are in line with findings in the early going for the vice presidential candidates in 2008. Voters were slightly more critical of Republican John McCain’s choice of then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. But Palin’s favorables were a bit higher than Ryan’s, and a comparable number of voters said her selection made them more likely to vote for McCain. The choice of Ryan also gets slightly better reviews than Barack Obama’s selection of longtime Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate. Biden’s favorables were comparable to Ryan’s, but voters were evenly divided over whether Biden’s selection made them more or less likely to vote for Obama. (Want a free daily e-mail update? If it's in the news, it's in our polls). Rasmussen Reports updates are also available on Twitter or Facebook. The survey of 1,000 Likely Voters was conducted on August 12-13, 2012 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC. See methodology. Voters are now evenly divided over whether Ryan is ready to be president if necessary. Thirty-seven percent (37%) say yes, 36% no. Twenty-seven percent (27%) are not sure. This is comparable to feelings about Biden just after he was picked but far better than initial perceptions of Palin. Seventy-one percent (71%) of voters regard Ryan as ideologically conservative, including 40% who say he’s Very Conservative. That’s more conservative that voters think Romney is and puts Ryan nearly as far to the political right as voters think the president is to the political left. Predictably, there are sharp partisan differences of opinion on most questions related to Ryan. Eighty-three percent (83%) of Republicans view Ryan favorably, and 72% think Romney made a good choice in picking him as his running mate. Fifty-four percent (54%) of Democrats give Ryan unfavorable marks, and only 18% view Romney’s selection as a good one. Among voters not affiliated with either major party, Ryan’s favorables have risen from 36% in July to 50% now. Thirty-eight percent (38%) of unaffiliated voters are more likely to vote for Romney as a result of the Ryan pick versus 29% who are less likely to do so.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1344967218000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344967715000-65</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Boeing Picking a Fight with Engineers and Techs?</Title><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1344913224000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:00:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SPEEA has been directly responsible for protecting and/or gaining between $60,000 and $100,000 in total compensaion (pay and benefits) over my 32 year career.

Boeing called upon its workforce to pull together to save the company. SPEEA members put personal and family obligations aside to toil endless hours to save the 787, stop the 747-8 from collapsing, secure the 767 tanker, and squeeze out increasing rates and efficiencies on the 737 and 777 programs. On the defense side, SPEEA members found new and innovative ways to deliver ever greater value for the customer in a climate of shrinking defense budgets. Boeing asked much of you and you delivered." "Today, The Boeing Company is reporting record sales and income to Wall Street. There is a 4,000 plane backlog on the commercial side and even BDS turned a profit. The shareholder dividend just went up (again); the machinists’ union secured a contract leaving their salaries about 18% over market; and corporate executives are receiving double-digit pay increases (Boeing CEO Jim McNerney received a 16% pay increase in 2012) and bonuses reported to be as large as a full year’s salary." So, we were a vital force in saving the company from their own disasterous management decisions and putting them on track to make LOTS of money. Now they want to "reward" us with REDUCED compensation? Where is the "team". Where is the "shared destiny". Seems like Boeing is the one who is being a FOUL weather friend.</Msg><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1344971077000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:04:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344971324000-71</Id><Topic><Title>Are the I sraelis Truely INFALLIBLE</Title><Username>skeptically97</Username><Timestamp>1344968969000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:29:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are a idiot.</Msg><Username>makboe</Username><Timestamp>1344971324000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:08:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344971348000-72</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Boeing Picking a Fight with Engineers and Techs?</Title><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1344913224000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:00:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump it</Msg><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1344971348000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:09:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344971513000-73</Id><Topic><Title>Voter Fraud Non-Existent But Let's Pass A Bunch of Voter Suppression Laws</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_86</Username><Timestamp>1344969911000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:45:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post!

I am also one of the most accurate Las Vegas oddsmakers and prognosticators. Accurate enough that I was awarded my own star on the Las Vegas Walk of Stars. And I smell something rotten in Denmark. Obama has a big skeleton in his closet. It’s his college records. Call it “gut instinct” but my gut is almost always right. Obama has a secret hidden at Columbia- and it’s a bad one that threatens to bring down his presidency. Gut instinct is how I’ve made my living for 29 years since graduating Columbia. Obama and his infamous strategist David Axelrod understand how to play political hardball, the best it’s ever been played. Team Obama has decided to distract America’s voters by condemning Mitt Romney for not releasing enough years of his tax returns. It’s the perfect cover. Obama knows the best defense is a bold offense. Just keep attacking Mitt and blaming him for secrecy and evasion, while accusing him of having a scandal that doesn’t exist. Then ask followers like Senator Harry Reid to chase the lead. The U.S. Senate Majority Leader appears to now be making up stories out of thin air, about tax returns he knows nothing about. It’s a cynical, brilliant, and vicious strategy. Make Romney defend, so he can’t attack the real Obama scandal. This is classic Axelrod. Obama has won several elections in his career by slandering his opponents and leaking sealed documents. Not only do these insinuations and leaks ruin the credibility and reputation of Obama’s opponents, they keep them on the defensive and off Obama’s trail of sealed documents. By attacking Romney’s tax records, Obama’s socialist cabal creates a problem that doesn’t exist. Is the U.S. Senate Majority Leader making up stories out of thin air? You decide. But the reason for this baseless attack is clear- make Romney defend, so not only is he “off message” but it helps the media ignore the real Obama scandal. My answer for Romney? Call Obama’s bluff. Romney should call a press conference and issue a challenge in front of the nation. He should agree to release more of his tax returns, only if Obama unseals his college records. Simple and straight-forward. Mitt should ask “What could possibly be so embarrassing in your college records from 29 years ago that you are afraid to let America’s voters see? If it’s THAT bad, maybe it’s something the voters ought to see.” Suddenly the tables are turned. Now Obama is on the defensive. My bet is that Obama will never unseal his records because they contain information that could destroy his chances for re-election. Once this challenge is made public, my prediction is you’ll never hear about Mitt’s tax returns ever again. Why are the college records, of a 51-year-old President of the United States, so important to keep secret? I think I know the answer. If anyone should have questions about Obama’s record at Columbia University, it’s me. We both graduated (according to Obama) Columbia University, Class of ’83. We were both (according to Obama) Pre-Law and Political Science majors. And I thought I knew most everyone at Columbia. I certainly thought I’d heard of all of my fellow Political Science majors.</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1345000974000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:22:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345000996000-104</Id><Topic><Title>The end will come if Obama releases his Columbia records</Title><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1345000974000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:22:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But not Obama (or as he was known then- Barry Soetoro). I never met him. Never saw him. Never even heard of him. And none of the classmates that I knew at Columbia have ever met him, saw him, or heard of him. But don’t take my word for it. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2008 that Fox News randomly called 400 of our Columbia classmates and never found one who had ever met Obama. Now all of this mystery could be easily and instantly dismissed if Obama released his Columbia transcripts to the media. But even after serving as President for 3 1/2 years he refuses to unseal his college records. Shouldn’t the media be as relentless in pursuit of Obama’s records as Romney’s? Shouldn’t they be digging into Obama’s past–beyond what he has written about himself–with the same boundless enthusiasm as Mitt’s? The first question I’d ask is, if you had great grades, why would you seal your records? So let’s assume Obama got poor grades. Why not release the records? He’s president of the free world, for gosh sakes. He’s commander-in-chief of the U.S. military. Who’d care about some poor grades from three decades ago, right? So then what’s the problem? Doesn’t that make the media suspicious? Something doesn’t add up. Secondly, if he had poor grades at Occidental, how did he get admitted to an Ivy League university in the first place? And if his grades at Columbia were awful, how’d he ever get into Harvard Law School? So again those grades must have been great, right? So why spend millions to keep them sealed? Third, how did Obama pay for all these fancy schools without coming from a wealthy background? If he had student loans or scholarships, would he not have to maintain good grades? I can only think of one answer that would explain this mystery. Here’s my gut belief: Obama got a leg up by being admitted to both Occidental and Columbia as a foreign exchange student. He was raised as a young boy in Indonesia. But did his mother ever change him back to a U.S. citizen? When he returned to live with his grandparents in Hawaii or as he neared college-age preparing to apply to schools, did he ever change his citizenship back? I’m betting not. If you could unseal Obama’s Columbia University records I believe you’d find that: A) He rarely ever attended class. B) His grades were not those typical of what we understand it takes to get into Harvard Law School. C) He attended Columbia as a foreign exchange student. D) He paid little for either undergraduate college or Harvard Law School because of foreign aid and scholarships given to a poor foreign students like this kid Barry Soetoro from Indonesia. If you think I’m “fishing” then prove me wrong. Open up your records Mr. President. What are you afraid of? If it’s okay for U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to go on a fishing expedition about Romney’s taxes (even though he knows absolutely nothing about them nor will release his own), then I think I can do the same thing. But as Obama’s Columbia Class of ’83 classmate, at least I have more standing to make educated guesses. It’s time for Mitt to go on the attack and call Obama’s bluff.</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1345000996000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:23:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345001783000-105</Id><Topic><Title>The end will come if Obama releases his Columbia records</Title><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1345000974000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:22:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why don't we have Obama release those records the same time Romney gives the tax returns from 2009 to 2003 What harm would that do Obama graduated - did Romney pay much taxes????</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1345001783000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:36:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
