Concerns are not only shared among Republicans and Independents, but by a majority of Democrats. The poll, released Tuesday, finds that 68 percent of voters are concerned about their health care under the new system. That includes 43 percent “very” concerned and another 25 percent “somewhat” concerned. The number feeling concerned is more than twice that of those who are unworried (31 percent). Even a 56-percent majority of Democrats feels concerned (31 percent “very” concerned). By comparison, 72 percent of independents and 77 percent of Republicans feel that way. The poll also finds a 54-percent majority wants to go back to the health care system that was in place in 2009. About a third -- 35 percent -- thinks it would be better to leave the new law in place. The Obama administration has been frantically trying to get young people onto Obamacare exchanges in order to prevent a collapse of the legislation but a majority of young people, 60 percent, are skeptical and worry about what will happen to their healthcare under the new system. Monday, a new USA Today/Pew Research Center poll showed a majority disapprove of President Obama's handling of healthcare despite Obamacare being his signature piece of legislation.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1379427600022</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 10:20:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379427785784-40</Id><Topic><Title>Target moved up</Title><Username>ashok66</Username><Timestamp>1379336635397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 09:03:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mommy!.....BA no goey downey!!</Msg><Username>cunyhound</Username><Timestamp>1379427785784</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 10:23:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379427832053-41</Id><Topic><Title>787-9 first flight scheduled at 10AM PDST</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1379427497666</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 10:18:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SEATTLE, Sept 17 | Tue Sep 17, 2013 1:21am EDT (Reuters) - Boeing Co formally scheduled the first flight of its 787-9 Dreamliner jet for Tuesday at 10 am Pacific Time (1700 GMT), a flight that brings closer the stretch version of the high-tech plane. The 787-9 is 20 feet (6.1 metres) longer than the current production model, the 787-8, allowing it to carry 40 more passengers, for a total of 290. The new version also is expected to travel about 300 nautical miles farther. Airlines want the greater capacity and range to increase revenue on globe-spanning routes. Tuesday's flight follows a series of problems with the Dreamliner 787-8 since it entered service in late 2011, three and a half years behind schedule. The plane was grounded for more than three months earlier this year after two batteries overheated, producing a fire in one case. The plane also has had problems with its electrical panels and other systems. Boeing said late on Monday the flight of the 787-9 would go ahead on Tuesday, weather permitting, at Paine Field in Everett, Washington, about 25 miles (40 km) north of Seattle, where Boeing has its main 787 assembly lines. The flight is expected to last about five hours, Boeing said.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1379427832053</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 10:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379427868008-42</Id><Topic><Title>Almost Rich</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1379423135935</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 09:05:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course you don't have any money in the stock mkt so you're totally against Big Ben's $85B per month purchases.....why that amount could have been used to carpet bomb from Pakistan to Syria and if that level wasn't needed to do that since it's inception the remainder could have been refunded via tax cuts (which unless you're super rich might amt to 1 hot dog per ball game a month)..........

Perhaps they realize that this law is a raw deal for them, too. Meanwhile, some liberals are crowing about insurance premiums rising less than they might have in some states (which is still a far cry from the sharply reduced costs we were promised). How are some states holding intense rate shock somewhat at bay? By significantly scaling back access and choices for consumers. The Los Angeles Times reports: The doctor can't see you now. Consumers may hear that a lot more often after getting health insurance under President Obama's Affordable Care Act. To hold down premiums, major insurers in California have sharply limited the number of doctors and hospitals available to patients in the state's new health insurance market opening Oct. 1. New data reveal the extent of those cuts in California, a crucial test bed for the federal healthcare law. These diminished medical networks are fueling growing concerns that many patients will still struggle to get care despite the nation's biggest healthcare expansion in half a century. Consumers could see long wait times, a scarcity of specialists and loss of a longtime doctor. "These narrow networks won't work because they cut off access for patients," said Dr. Richard Baker, executive director of the Urban Health Institute at Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles. Health "coverage" does not equal healthcare.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1379434362928</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 12:12:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379434446237-63</Id><Topic><Title>Taps at Navy Yard this Morning</Title><Username>censored53</Username><Timestamp>1379434139899</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 12:08:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It doesn't matter what you're carrying if someone snipes you from the back.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1379434446237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 12:14:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379434671243-64</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing expands in Montana</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379433476039</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 11:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>About how many do they employ there?</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1379434671243</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 12:17:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379434762386-65</Id><Title>Al Qaeda calls for "unbelievably small" attacks inside United States</Title><Msg>DUBAI (Reuters) - Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri urged small-scale attacks inside the United States to "bleed America economically", adding he hoped eventually to see a more significant strike, according to the SITE monitoring service.

'And if you take this line and you project what has been happening into the future, we will get less and less competitive. So we need something else.' "Buffett insists that without changes to Obamacare average citizens will suffer. "'What we have now is untenable over time,' said Buffett, an early supporter of President Obama. 'That kind of a cost compared to the rest of the world is really like a tapeworm eating, you know, at our economic body.' "Buffett does not believe that providing insurance for everyone is the first step to take in correcting our nation's healthcare system. "'Attack the costs first, and then worry about expanding coverage,' he said. 'I would much rather see another plan that really attacks costs. And I think that's what the American public wants to see.

We’re getting people who call,” Wolf said Monday during an event marking the launch of the Citizens’ Commission on Benghazi, a panel of former military and intelligence officials who are investigating unanswered questions surrounding the Benghazi incident. ________________________________________________ This is a great example of a freedom loving American standing up to the lying immoral thug Obonzo.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1379437063928</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 12:57:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379437070909-75</Id><Topic><Title>Feds collect record taxes...Deficit Still $755B</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1379435424626</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 12:30:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Democrats know this, but being socialists it is all about their libs in govt controlling the money, and directing it to who they want to give it to.

Most voters agree a federal government shutdown would be bad for the economy, but they're willing to risk one until Democrats and Republicans in Congress agree on ways to cut the budget, including cuts in funding for the new national health care law. Just 20% of Likely U.S. Voters believe a partial shutdown of the federal government would be good for economy, according to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey. Fifty-six percent (56%) say such a shutdown would be bad for the economy, even though payments for things like Social Security, Medicare and unemployment would continue. Sixteen percent (16%) think it would have no impact. (To see survey question wording, click here.) But 58% favor a federal budget that cuts spending, while only 16% prefer one that increases spending. Twenty-one percent (21%) support a budget that keeps spending levels about the same. This helps explain why 53% would rather have a partial government shutdown until Democrats and Republicans can agree on what spending to cut. Thirty-seven percent (37%) would prefer instead that Congress avoid a shutdown by authorizing spending at existing levels as the president has proposed. Some conservative Republicans in both the House and Senate are refusing to approve a budget unless it slows or stops funding for the health care law, but the president and most congressional Democrats are adamantly opposed to any such cuts. However, 51% of voters favor having a partial government shutdown until Democrats and Republicans agree on what spending for the health care law to cut. Forty percent (40%) would rather avoid a government shutdown by authorizing spending for the health care law at existing levels.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1379438163400</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 13:16:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379438308010-82</Id><Topic><Title>787-9 first flight scheduled at 10AM PDST</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1379427497666</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 10:18:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Weather at everett deteriorating.

And for that lightweight and strong metal, the American aircraft maker comes to this small city in the Ural Mountains.At the Avisma titanium foundry, a once-secret factory that made nuclear missile parts during the cold war, titanium ribs for Boeing airplanes are stacked in piles like lumber. In an annex, a Boeing and Avisma joint venture called Ural Boeing Manufacturing grinds forged parts destined for America. A third of all Boeing jet landing gear assemblies are made with titanium beams from Russia. The Russians make titanium parts that are unseen but no less important on planes like the new 787 Dreamliner and the workaday commuter airplane, the 737. Boeing buys so much titanium from Russia — the airplane maker plans $18 billion in purchases over the coming decades — that it now researches new alloys with the Russians. In Moscow, a thousand miles to the west, a team of 1,400 aerospace engineers designs airframes and wings, in part using Russian titanium components. “Russia is a critical partner for 787 titanium parts,” Sergey Kravchenko, the director of Boeing’s office in Russia, said in a written response to questions. The factory “has the largest in the world press for titanium forgings and Boeing takes full advantage of this unique capability,” he wrote.</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1379439613959</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 13:40:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379439843249-94</Id><Topic><Title>Bloated Pig</Title><Username>stckpkr7000</Username><Timestamp>1379439097289</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 13:31:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, such worries watching my stock portfolio becoming top heavy in Boeing but for now I'll ride the wave.

Two pistols were also recovered. So why all the reports about the gunman and an AR-15?

Police Chief Rodney Monroe described the events of the evening, which ended in one of his officers, Randall Kerrick, turning himself in on charges of voluntary manslaughter. At approximately 2:30 a.m., a man knocked at the door of a home in northeast Charlotte. The woman inside thought it was her husband and answered it, but was surprised to find “it was a person she did not know or recognize. She immediately closed the door, hit her panic alarm and called 911,” Monroe said. The man allegedly continued to try to get the woman’s attention after she’d called 911. Police arrived at the scene minutes later, at which point the deceased, former Florida A&amp;M football player Jonathan Ferrell, “immediately charged towards the three officers, one in particular. That officer fired his weapon several times, striking individual multiple times.” Ferrell died at the scene. Shortly thereafter, police found what they “believe to be the vehicle that belonged to the individual who was shot. It’s quite possible he was seeking assistance. Based on the accident, it was a pretty serious accident.” Chief Monroe said that Ferrell would have been forced to climb out the back window of his vehicle, and that the property he approached was the nearest house to the scene of the accident. In another statement issued late Saturday night, police said “[t]he evidence revealed that Mr. Ferrell did advance on Officer Kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive. Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter.”</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1379465852312</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 20:57:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379466050239-142</Id><Topic><Title>Obviously a righteous shooting (if you are a George Zimmerman fan)</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1379465852312</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 20:57:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>12 shots were fired, 10 struck the victim.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1379466050239</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 21:00:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379466281476-143</Id><Title>☛☛☛GET OUT asap.....RUSSELL 2000 @ average 83 P/E !
