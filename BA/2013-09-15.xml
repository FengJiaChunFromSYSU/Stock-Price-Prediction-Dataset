Is he really that old or is he saying he worked on the 747 years later and that then qualifies him to be one of "the incredibles"? From the Boeing website history: "During the late 1960s, some 50,000 Boeing people belonged to a group called "The Incredibles." These were the construction workers, mechanics, engineers, secretaries and administrators who made aviation history by building the 747 -- the largest civilian airplane in the world -- in less than 16 months."</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1379218121971</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 00:08:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379219081522-2</Id><Topic><Title>777</Title><Username>d_proch</Username><Timestamp>1379190032062</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-14 16:20:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing is creating a new automated way to make the 777x Times are a changing at Boeing!</Msg><Username>d_proch</Username><Timestamp>1379219081522</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 00:24:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379226691726-3</Id><Title>Is Boeing Heading for a Stock Split?</Title><Msg>It sure looks like it!

To the contrary, virtually every claim he has ever made has been shown to be patently false. The guy is a chronic liar. He's claiming to have worked on the 747's original development program in the 1960s and that he's one of "The Incredibles", but given his well documented history of lying it's almost certainly false. Consider the following. - He once claimed to have worked on the 737 production line for five years and at anytime could tell us all, with great ease, which A/Ps are moving down the production line in Renton and which operator each A/P is destined for. I actually work for Boeing, in Renton, and called his bluff by asking him some very simple questions about the A/Ps moving down the production line and he couldn't back up his claims. Wayne is a chronic liar. - He once claimed to be a retired, former, high-ranking HR manager for a Top Ten aerospace company and claimed that all he had to do was report me to Boeing Ethics (apparently for attempting to correct his tsunami of misinformation and lies) and it'd be a "done deal" (i.e. I'd be terminated). It didn't happen. Wayne is a chronic liar. - He once claimed to have spoken to a Ms. Andrews at Boeing Ethics and she was looking for me. I asked him to give me her phone number or location (e.g. building, floor, column, etc) and told him that I'd be more than happy to talk to her. All I heard was crickets. Wayne is a chronic liar. - You may have missed it, but he's now claiming that you and I are the same person and as you're no doubt aware that assertion is false. And no, simply having worked on the 747 doesn't make one a member of "The Incredibles". There are many, many more lies I could site, but you get the idea. All you need to remember is this. Wayne is a chronic liar.</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1379255830462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 10:37:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379255972447-17</Id><Topic><Title>serious coin lost on the boeing tanker 700 million so far, or how to spot a Boeing hack dpooch eh</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1379179155667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-14 13:19:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right you are jjovaz.

The A380 was 3years late, billions over budget. More A380s were grounded individually then an entire fleet of 787s all at once. The first seventy or so A380s have to be grounded to fix the cracks in the wings or did you forget that fact. Other earlier problems for the A380 were those wonderful Rolls Royce engines leaking oil and blowing up. I am sure that brought joy to passengers who saw it through the windows. Like Boeing, Airbus learned from their mistakes and I am sure that the A350 will have less flaws then the A380 did. The difference is that Boeing airplanes are more efficient then Airbus airplanes. Once Boeing releases the 777X, that eliminates the need for the A350-1000. That is why Lufthansa will select the 777X over the A350-1000.</Msg><Username>morisretired</Username><Timestamp>1379256774279</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 10:52:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379257221519-20</Id><Title>whatever happened to waynedickenson961</Title><Msg>did this looser finally get run over by a Boeing 747?

The difference is that Boeing hasn't to spend as much money developing the 747-8 versus what Airbus had to spend developing the A380. Plus Boeing has a freighter version of the 747-8, where is Airbus A380 freighter? There were two Qantas A380s where the turbines disks in the Trent engines causing damage to the wings and there has been at least one oil fire. When the wings on those Qantas A380s were being inspected that is when they found the cracks inside the wings developing. Qatar delayed taking delivery until later in the production line past those defective parts inside the wings causing cracking to occur. It's doubtful that Virgin Atlantic will ever take delivery of the A380s they ordered and look forward to receiving their Boeing 787s.

CBX try as you will, remember this there is a very good reason Airbus betters Boeing 130% stock price gain over 3 years to 76% gain for boeing and for the year 51% Airbus stock price gain , on growth compared to 47% stock price gain for Boeing mainly on stock buy back for Boeing . Airbus is a better company. Boeing is nothing but a logo with MD management a failure caused by Phil Condit paying way too much for a bankrupt Md company that sparti worked for there is another failure each time he posts his crapola failure is soon to follow. I make my money trading stocks and would never own Boeing, you can call me gay, fired employee or as sparti now claims a racist bottom line is that is just all he can do shout and pound the table I have facts and figures on my side. btw scty up 15% this last week and it is not a buy and hold but a great swing trader stock tht is another elon musk stock , and yes I called the short squeeze on tsla in may and have made a huge gain and now day trading it as I can read a stock chart last week was a clear buy on nok when msft purchased it 19% gain for me so far in 5 days easy . but you probably own no stocks why are you here ?</Msg><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1379282663727</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 18:04:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379282820285-62</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1379280847031</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 17:34:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Also old, angry, white . . . .</Msg><Username>sammy.shakedown</Username><Timestamp>1379282820285</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 18:07:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379283088097-63</Id><Title>Is Wayne a racist?

Science Airbus revises A380 break-even point Now 420 aircraft, up from 270 By Lester Haines, 20th October 2006 Related stories Airbus parent company EADS has announced a new break-even point for its troubled A380 programme - 420 aircraft as opposed to the previous 270, the BBC reports. Current orders for the A380 stand at 159. The A380 roll-out has now been delayed three times due to "wiring problems" and the first example will not be delivered until October 2007. New Airbus big cheese Louis Gallois recently admitted "painful" job losses were likely as a result of the knock-backs, while Rolls-Royce earlier this month suspended A380 engine production while "waiting for more details about requirements from Airbus". Airbus has calculated that the whole sorry saga will cost it €2.8bn in profits over the next four years, added to the €2bn it announced back in June 2006. Airlines, meanwhile, have expressed growing frustration at the situation. Qantas, which won't take delivery of the first of 12 A380s it's ordered until August 2008, recently asked: "How are we going to mount the capacity in the short-term?" Emirates, the biggest customer to date with 43 on order, admitted it was "reviewing its options".</Msg><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1379289691591</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 20:01:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379289721965-70</Id><Topic><Title>School privatization is a hoax, “reformers” aim to destroy public schools</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1379282876087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 18:07:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Plain and simple, you leftists despise competition, and want union protectionism.

I do get the "popularity" thumbs/ up/down vote effect. Hooz asks what Bible verse might apply to this abominable behavior of Girouex. I draw upon my understanding and knowledge of the Bible and home in on a verse that says it simply and succinctly. A verse to which this Brent guy should have paid more attention. Unfortunately, many some how look at this life as a sort of eternity of its own - though it seems it gets shorter and shorter as we get older. But, as children, life seemed to last "forever". We know different now that we are adults. When "justice" is not applied, in this case, we feel a sense of illness in our society. What should be done to this guy? The Bible, in the Old Testament, would have prescribed having him being stoned to death. There was a time when we executed kidnappers and rapists. But, now, we are much more enlightened. And, the lack of justice is exceedingly frustrating. In the end, if we fail to impose some sort of reasonable punishment, those that have faith and believe what the Bible says, that man is headed for a heap of trouble - unless he repents. If he does not harden his own heart. The Bible says, "Seek the Lord while He may be found." That is why I provided that verse. Our system of justice is flawed and, day after day, is getting more incompetent, but the Lord will execute perfect justice that lasts for eternity.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1379296844883</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 22:00:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379297570420-91</Id><Topic><Title>Alaska Airlines</Title><Username>morisretired</Username><Timestamp>1379284259570</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 18:30:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good news for JetBlue Airlines, they came in second place for being the most efficient airline in the United States.

The Airbus A320 that JetBlue utilize are so, so for fuel economy but can not beat the Boeing 737s that Alaska Airlines uses when it comes to fuel economy.</Msg><Username>morisretired</Username><Timestamp>1379297570420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 22:12:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379297959054-92</Id><Topic><Title>morisretired said BA has 747-8passenger/freighter ?

They sucked the money right out from their customers so that they can offer the A400 later freighter for less money then what the original customers are paying.</Msg><Username>morisretired</Username><Timestamp>1379297959054</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 22:19:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379298268798-93</Id><Topic><Title>whatever happened to waynedickenson961</Title><Username>blackjackkid41</Username><Timestamp>1379257221519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 11:00:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ditto, good riddance to that looooooser</Msg><Username>thesilverarrowflies</Username><Timestamp>1379298268798</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 22:24:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379303492124-94</Id><Topic><Title>School privatization is a hoax, “reformers” aim to destroy public schools</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1379282876087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 18:07:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hoodz offers thoughts of a union paid shill. We need an education revolution to sweep aside old school union shill #$%$ like Diane Ravitch. "I'm going to be writing a lot about the book in future emails, but I want to start with the most important revelation: Diane Ravitch (the author of hoodz_weiner_duh_turd's union shill screed) has been getting paid A LOT of money by the unions in the form of speaker fees – Brill estimates $10,000 per appearance and $200,000 over the past year – which by itself isn't a problem EXCEPT that: a) she's never disclosed these large payments, which anyone listening to her should know about; and b) she's a total hypocrite for criticizing reformers like me for supposedly making a lot of money from our activities (when in truth I've never taken a SINGLE PENNY and have instead given countless thousands of dollars and hours), while doing precisely this herself."</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1379303492124</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 23:51:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379303991303-95</Id><Topic><Title>School privatization is a hoax, “reformers” aim to destroy public schools</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1379282876087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 18:07:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He meant to say he was in SCHOOL.
