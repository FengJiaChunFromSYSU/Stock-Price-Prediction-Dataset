"And I absolutely agree with Edward Snowden. It's worth a person's life, prospect of assassination, or life in prison or life in exile — it's worth that to try to restore our liberties and make this a democratic country." Editor's Note : Video Exposes Dangers of Obamacare Law He cited the NSA's phone- and Internet data collection programs as evidence that the nation has reached the "capability" of becoming a police state. "When people understand that their every conversation of every kind on phones, email, chat logs whatever, is being recorded and can be retrieved, that will certainly curtail people's freedom of speech over any digital means," Ellsberg continued in an interview carried on HuffPost Live. "It gives the government blackmail capability over the population at large . . . With the digital stuff alone, we have a surveillance capability that outmatches any police state in the history of humanity." Ellsberg can claim many similarities to Snowden, the NSA contractor who leaked information on government phone and Internet data collection programs, and Manning, who provided government files to WikiLeaks. In 1969, Ellsberg was working as a military analyst with the RAND Corp. when he copied thousands of Defense Department documents on Vietnam War decisions that would later become known as the Pentagon Papers. In 1971, he gave the files to The New York Times and other newspapers. President Richard Nixon tried to stop the Times from publishing them, but the newspaper continued after a court cleared the way, citing First Amendment rights.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377335761818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-24 05:16:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377337864616-10</Id><Topic><Title>My Impersonation of HoozdikHertz</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376876757320</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 21:45:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you mean other then Bulky and Ali and a dozen others ?

That is what set the stage in Afghanistan some 30 years ago. Is killing another hundred thousand to stop the killing the answer?

The second member of the super-efficient 787 family rolled out of the Everett, Wash., factory today to the flight line, where teams are preparing it to fly later this summer. At 20 feet (6 m) longer than the 787-8, the 787-9 will extend the 787 family in both capacity and range, carrying 40 more passengers an additional 300 nautical miles (555 km). The 787-9 leverages the visionary design of the 787-8 such as its exceptional environmental performance — 20 percent less fuel use and 20 percent fewer emissions than similarly sized airplanes — and passenger-pleasing features. With the second and third airplanes in final assembly, Boeing and the 787-9 are on track. First delivery to launch customer Air New Zealand is set for mid-2014.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1377391027025</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-24 20:37:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377391081266-58</Id><Topic><Title>The right’s black crime obsession</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1377389856827</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-24 20:17:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Raven quote: "too bad Loons have to use it to make some racist political point."
