According to the latest poll of congress 1/3 of Dems and 95% of rebubs aren't interested. Google 'Eyes Turn to Antarctica as Study Shows Greenland’s Ice Has Endured Warmer Climates' for brand new peer reviewed evidence that Greenland was much warmer than today. _______________________________________________________ "An important discussion is developing among climate and polar researchers around the central point of a landmark Nature paper on Greenland conditions during Earth’s last (very warm) interval between ice ages. The paper, in which a critically important Greenland ice core is analyzed by 133 authors from a host of research centers, concludes that the vast ice sheet largely endured over a period of 6,000 years that was warmer than what is forecast for coming decades." "The lead researcher, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen of the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen, offers useful insights in a news release from the university: The new results…show that the climate in Greenland was around 8 degrees C. [14.4 degrees F.] warmer than today during the last interglacial period, the Eemian period, 130,000 to 115,000 thousand years ago. “Even though the warm Eemian period was a period when the oceans were four to eight meters higher than today, the ice sheet in northwest Greenland was only a few hundred meters lower than the current level, which indicates that the contribution from the Greenland ice sheet was less than half the total sea-level rise during that period,” says Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, Professor at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen…." _______________________________________________________ Yes you read correctly it averaged 14.4 degreesF warmer than today according to ice core data and Greenland didn't melt away and there was OBVIOUSLY NO TIPPING POINT. You only need to go back 6,000 years to find summers where the Arctic sea ice was ice free. There are 4 different scientific proxies leading to that conclusion. I just exchanged messages with a climate scientists using satellites to analyze Greenland ice melt rate and there has been no acceleration over the past decade. The average net ice loss for Greenland and the Antarctic combined since 2002 has contributed .33mm of sea level rise.</Msg><Username>nanotwo</Username><Timestamp>1359349434600</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 00:03:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359349936301-2</Id><Topic><Title>Karl Marx Is More Relevant Than Ever</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1359331193597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 18:59:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Marx's criticism of Laissez-faire capitalism was brilliant, but his proposed alternative proved to be far worse.</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1359349936301</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 00:12:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359351261307-3</Id><Title>When, oh when is this pig going to crash???</Title><Msg>We should have seen $60 last week!!!</Msg><Username>eucheme</Username><Timestamp>1359351261307</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 00:34:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359352193520-4</Id><Topic><Title>Government Officials Can Still Own Assault Weapons Under Feinstein Bill</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359315286828</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:34:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>19 td, looks like a conspiracy to me.</Msg><Username>foggedin94019</Username><Timestamp>1359352193520</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 00:49:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359353765750-5</Id><Topic><Title>John Kerry Grilled By Rand Paul Over Presidential Power In Constitution</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359254176691</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:36:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rand Oaul is now an expert on the Consitution?

You didn't really believe that Obama cared about "democracy" in Egypt did you? He certainly doesn’t care about it here. Do you remember how he was like a school child jumping up and down in the White house raising his hand before the American public (really the world) giving one briefing after another on how Mubarak had to go, for "Arab Spring" cleaning? Calling and badgering Mubarak over and over. I mean it was hourly. In concert was Fareed Zakaria, a Muslim, on CNN constantly goading him to "do something". Mubarak reluctantly gave up power. But he was old and tired. What did Mubarak tell Obama, "you are young and you do not understand"? Telling. He got that right. Then democracy, "Sharia law style", set in with Muslim Brotherhood Egyptian President Morsi declaring that Jews were descendants of pigs and apes: "This is what these occupiers of the land of Palestine know — these blood-suckers, who attack the Palestinians, these warmongers, the descendants of apes and pigs." And, Obama, like the school child that he is, still gave Morsi some more tanks and F-16s. Result: former partner in Middle East peace agreement now very hostile neighbor to Israel. Then there was Libya. Kind of neutral under Qaddafi, not necessarily benign, but very under control. Again the plethora of White House briefings, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria giving advice to “do something now”, bombing without the approval of the American people and Congress, and then Obama's "kinetic action" (we will never understand what that meant) destroyed a sovereign government and military not at war with the United States and converted Libya, previously under control, into a hotbed of al Qaeda. Another notch on the new hostility towards Israel. So why the immediate need to eliminate Israel friendly/neutral countries into Israel hostile countries, but Syria, already Israel hostile, and a client state of Iran, only gets "hand slaps" and Patriot missile batteries for Turkey, for "show", to make it look like we are "doing something". And, guess what, Fareed Zakaria is rather mute, only giving tepid commentary on Syria. How about "no fly zones" and "bombings" and "destruction" and "hourly press conferences"? You see, Syria's loss of 60,000 people does not matter relative to the greater goal of establishing Israel hating countries that surround her. Now, you can dislike Israel, but you cannot ignore what is the truth of what Obama "has wrought". Why he is doing this is a part of the larger picture. The man speaks in "riddles".

Wall Street had been working on the assumption that safety inspectors would find the root cause of two battery incidents in the United States and Japan within weeks and Boeing would implement a speedy fix costing no more than a few hundred million dollars. But on Thursday, the head of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it was only "early" in its investigation of a fire on a Japan Airlines Co Ltd jet in Boston on January 7, while Japanese aviation authorities appear no closer to resolving a battery problem that caused an emergency landing of a domestic All Nippon Airways Co Ltd flight last week.

Wade is by far the worst. During a segment last week, Toure went on what he called an abortion rant in which he thanked God and country abortion was there to "save him" at a time when taking care of a baby and becoming a father would have been inconvenient for him. He also refers to abortion as a "safety net." Got that? Toure was willing to end the life of an unborn child so his own life could remain convenient and less responsible. He's proud of it, too. His argument is similar to that of the one made in Salon last week titled, "So what if abortion ends a life?"

I would put the life of a mother over the life of a fetus every single time — even if I still need to acknowledge my conviction that the fetus is indeed a life. A life worth sacrificing."

Now, one Wisconsin sheriff is taking the adage seriously, telling residents they should take firearms classes because he ‘needs them in the game.’ In the radio ad, Clarke tells residents personal safety isn't a spectator sport anymore, and that "I need you in the game." "With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option," Clarke intones. "You could beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back." Clarke urges listeners to take a firearm safety course and handle a firearm "so you can defend yourself until we get there." "You have a duty to protect yourself and your family. We're partners now.

In the 2011 blockbuster “Battle: Los Angeles,” the City of Angels faced an attack from an outside force that threatened everyone in the town and their way of life. In reality, though the alien enemy from that film doesn’t exist, an outside force has significantly undercut the vibrancy of a town known for its vast array of film and television productions. The external force? Tax credits, which are quickly moving film and television productions far away from the Hollywood Hills. The production of “Battle: Los Angeles” brings this situation into stark focus. Ironically enough, the movie about aliens attacking Los Angeles was predominantly shot far away from the city it portrayed. Much of “Battle: Los Angeles” was actually filmed in Louisiana, a state that is taking full advantage of California’s high taxes and helping to create a burgeoning industry in the state. As the Los Angeles Times reported, “Except for the movie’s opening sequences at Camp Pendleton and the alien beach attack in Santa Monica, 90% of the film was shot in Louisiana’s capital, Baton Rouge, and Shreveport in the northwest part of the state.” This wasn’t the first time that Hollywood surrendered a major production to a state that was actively competing with California for business. What is interesting, though, is that despite seeing the effect a higher tax burden is having in their industry as productions head to the South, many celebrities continue to extol the virtues of higher taxes.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1359386754454</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 10:25:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359386946983-37</Id><Topic><Title>Wis.

After so many assaults on voting rights and the electoral process itself have been advanced, it is easy to imagine that Priebus, Karl Rove and their team could get away even with so audacious an initiative as the rigging of presidential elections. Priebus is counting on precisely that cynicism, as well as the neglect of the story by major media, to enable the plan to have Republican legislatures and governors in key swing states—Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin—arrange for the distribution of electoral votes not to winners of the popular vote statewide but to the winners of individual congressional districts. Because of the gerrymandering of congressional district lines, the scheme would in 2012 have shifted the circumstance so that, in Pennsylvania for instance, the losing candidate, Republican Mitt Romney, would have won the overwhelming majority of the state’s electoral votes. Under at least one scenario entertained by Priebus and his minions, Romney’s 5 million–vote loss of the popular vote nationally still would not have prevented him from assuming the presidency. Impossible? Hardly. Because of gerrymandering and the concentration of Democratic votes in urban areas and college towns, a 1.4-million vote majority for Democrats in congressional races nationwide in 2012 was converted into Republican control of the US House and gridlocked government.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359387499739</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 10:38:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359387503018-44</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals are the only ones........</Title><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1359150919733</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 16:55:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Libs don't really believe in much of anything.

Republicans who hold power in states that have voted Democratic in the last few presidential contests, including Virginia and Pennsylvania, are considering a change to their apportionment of electoral votes. Instead of a winner-take-all system for the state, electoral votes would be doled out by congressional district, using highly-gerrymandered maps. The result is that a state like Pennsylvania, which voted for President Obama by more than 5 percent in 2012, would have given most of its electoral votes to Mitt Romney.

The discussion turned to Boeing’s vaunted expertise in making aircraft wings. Wilson evidently came across as boastful—so much so that a young General Electric executive named Harry Stonecipher suggested that Boeing was arrogant. “And rightly so,” came Wilson’s serene reply. The exchange, which was recorded in Fortune magazine a few years ago, is worth recalling partly for what has happened to Stonecipher in the meantime— and partly for what has happened to Boeing. In a remarkable twist of fate, Stonecipher now fills Wilson’s old job at Boeing. But whereas the Boeing that Wilson led in the 1970s utterly dominated the skies, today’s Boeing is another matter. Its once masterful technological leadership is gone and, in an orgy of indiscriminate outsourcing, Stonecipher is presiding over the destruction of what remains of Boeing’s erstwhile manufacturing greatness—not least the world-beating wing business that was the apple of Wilson’s eye. As the American press has latterly come to realize, Boeing is an embattled company. But while the media has focused on a defense contracting scandal that has recently engulfed the company, this is a tempest in a teacup compared to the real story: the unpublicized tragedy of Boeing’s declining competitiveness. After decades of shortsighted management, Boeing has become so hollowed out that the impact is clearly visible in America’s rapidly worsening trade deficits. Indeed, respected experts fear Boeing is already so enfeebled that it may be forced to exit its core business in commercial airliners within a decade. This in turn would undermine its defense business, with distinctly ominous implications for America’s longterm security. Just how important that business is can be judged from the fact that, after decades of industry consolidation, the Boeing group now subsumes most of the contractors that executed the Apollo moon project. Part of the problem is that Airbus, a puny also-ran in Wilson’s time, has recently leapfrogged to global leadership in airliner sales. But a larger part is a sea change in Boeing’s concept of itself. In a philosophical metamorphosis whose significance has been lost on the American press, Boeing is now pleased to call itself a “systems integrator.” An unfortunate echo of the New Economy bubble, this self-description effectively reduces America’s most Olympian manufacturer to the level of a thousand catch-as-catch-can software consultancies. Boeing’s top management has presided over one of the most lamentable downsizing programs in American corporate history. Not only has the Boeing group cut 77,000 jobs in the last seven years, but it has euthanized its research and development department—all this while spending $10 billion to “enhance shareholder value” in a buy-back of one-sixth of its outstanding stock. The key to the new Boeing is a Faustian bargain with Japan. In a rerun of earlier American industrial implosions, Boeing has come to rely more and more on Japanese contractors for its most advanced engineering and manufacturing. Heavily subsidized by the Tokyo government, Boeing’s Japanese partners are delighted to lowball their contract prices and spend heavily on the sort of advanced research and development that in happier times Boeing would have eagerly—indeed jealously—reserved for itself. All this powerfully props up Boeing’s short-term profits. But what’s in it for Japan? Plenty.

The New York senator angrily admitted yesterday that the pop queen has not called him to say sorry after she turned last week’s inaugural bash into an unexpected Milli Vanilli concert by lip-syncing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” “I have not heard from her before, during or after,” a testy Schumer told The Post after he was asked if Beyoncé had called him to give a musical mea culpa. “She did not talk to me at all. I didn’t say any words to her, period.” It was clear the senator did not want to talk about the debacle at President Obama’s inauguration, which he organized and hosted. When cornered at his regular Sunday press conference, Schumer snipped that he had no idea at the time that Beyoncé was lip-syncing. “I couldn’t tell,” he said, “I only saw her from the back.” Beyoncé seemed to bring down the house with a stunning rendition of the National Anthem — before the truth about her fake oratorio was uncovered. She has not apologized to anyone for the mime routine. Schumer has been credited with drawing the pop diva and her hubby Jay-Z to the inauguration, where many said they stole the show from the president and first lady walking hand-in-hand on the steps of Capitol Hill. Schumer was seen beaming with pride just steps behind Beyoncé while she appeared to be belting out the National Anthem. Obama administration insiders and inauguration planners were in the dark about Beyoncé’s decision to use a prerecorded tape of her singing with the Marine Band during the swearing in. The were later left fuming over the embarrassment, according to reports. Some on Capitol Hill have even placed the blame on Schumer for the Star-Spangled sham. “Sen. Schumer promised Beyoncé, but he delivered Milli Vanilli instead,” quipped one Republican congressional aide last week.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1359391229116</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 11:40:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359391637302-62</Id><Topic><Title>The Third Amendment</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359332817449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:26:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>be leery when Republicans speak of rights and religion !!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359391637302</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 11:47:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359391902182-63</Id><Topic><Title>Schumer wants apology from Beyonce for lip-syncing at inauguration...</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1359391229116</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 11:40:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"her phony?"

It won't be Republicans that give her a stage but the Dem media will welcome her as a useful idiot to help them in dividing the Republican party further. When I hear Boehner make the claim that Obama is trying to destroy the Republican Party I can only laugh. While it created enough fear in the beltway among other Republicans to reelect Boehner, the truth is that so far all damage has been all self-inflicted. The tactic of using fear of Obama is OBVIOUSLY a failed tactic as it did not MOTIVATE conservatives to get off their #$%$ and vote against Obama in 2012, duh. The loud and clear message is that the Republicans need a leader that will motivate conservatives to unite in order to get up off their collective #$%$es and vote in the next election.

To make up the lost revenue, these governors would raise the state sales tax. These proposals are “open, explicit reverse Robin Hoodism” writes Paul Krugman, The New York Times columnist and author of many books including "End This Depression Now!" The elimination of the income tax would result in a huge tax break for the rich, Krugman notes, and “substantial losses for the bottom 60%.” A higher sales tax disproportionately affects ordinary, working class families, he argues. “It’s not something that you can easily justify in economic terms,” Krugman says in an interview with The Daily Ticker. “There’s no real justification for it except we like rich people.” According to Krugman, middle and lower income people, not the rich, are already paying the highest marginal tax rates in the country. Furthermore, the higher sales tax would not beget benefits such as stronger safety nets or universal health care, programs that would be used by the majority of those states' residents. In Kansas for example, popular social programs have already been slashed. Kansas Governor Sam Brownback has allowed private insurers to take over the state’s Medicaid system; he cut back the state’s welfare rolls and wants to reform state employees’ pensions in addition to merging government agencies. Brownback's office is reportedly eying more areas for consolidation. Krugman says the Republican plan to hike state sales tax could be modeled after the European nation Scandinavia, a country with very high sales tax rates and a “less progressive tax system” than the U.S. The revenue generated by the high taxes are used to provide Scandinavian citizens with a “very good social safety net” and more financial security, according to Krugman. The income tax elimination proposals may very well be signed into law because there’s little political risk to the politicians involved, Krugman says. The states that are pursuing such measures are heavily Republican and the governors would “face no retribution from the voters…and are obliged to cater to their Republican interest groups,” he argues. The Nobel prize-winning economist says these initiatives are proof that the Republican party has no interest in changing its image with voters and are moving the GOP more toward the right.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359397391653</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 13:23:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359397515708-80</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Operation ' Rig the Vote '</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359388018912</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 10:46:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Time for America to retire the GOP !</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359397515708</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 13:25:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359397695405-81</Id><Topic><Title>Why are Liberals so Stingy When it Comes to Charity</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1358529102641</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:11:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that how you perceive taxes?

It also is not clear whether any fix - particularly if the probes lead to the identification of a major design fault - would also be costly. At the same time, it will be starved of the cash it was expecting for delivering 787s it is still producing at the current rate of five per month, which could add up to $300 million per month, analysts estimate. And the longer the planes are grounded, the more Boeing is exposed, as airlines may start to reconsider orders and - in extreme cases - cancel some, especially if the battery fix adds weight to the plane and reduces its vaunted fuel efficiency.

Each state can GAIN new revenue as the replacement of a income tax with a sales tax, closes the tax loop hole for being a pimp, a drug dealer, a #$%$, etc.. These states WILL become a THREAT to other states as it will make them attractive to business and this would hurt high income tax blue states. Krugman is spinning as usual because he fears the threat of having Republican/Independent governors, currently running 30 states, making progress towards balancing their budgets and being prosperous as blue states continue down the #$%$.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1359400827452</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:20:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359401009728-88</Id><Topic><Title>Battery Choice Saved 40 Pounds</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1359261000650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:30:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That patent looks to have been for outer space use as heat pipes are expensive, but in space offten the only means of clooling due to there being no air to provide cooling. Cheaper and easier way add a lot of cooling would be to put fins on the case and fill it with a non conductive inflamable non toxic fluid to trasfer heat from the cells to the case to be disapated. In normal use I doubt this kind of cooling is really needed, but when a cell goes into meltdown it might be enough to stop if from cascading from one cell to the next until the whole battery does a 3 Mile Island. What BA needs to do is find a way to prevent one cell having a meltdown from sending the rest of the cells into a meltdown too like has been happening. At that point it would simply be a dead battery, and at most if a lot of them go bad a maintenance issue.</Msg><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1359401009728</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:23:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359401012856-89</Id><Title>This is very bad news for Boeing</Title><Msg>The joint U.S. and Japanese investigation into the Boeing 787's battery problems has shifted from the battery maker to the manufacturer of a monitoring system.

The public has been led to believe that humanity faces an apocalyptic future based primarily on IPCC model forecasts of certain climate indicators such as temperature, feedbacks, water vapor, etc. A new study from CIRES, University of Colorado, and Physical Sciences Division/NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, Boulder, Colorado (all the major US based climate centers), finds that the climate models used by the IPCC as a basis to promote an climate in the future are failing. Combined with an announcement two weeks ago by the United Kingdom,s premiere climate center the MET Office, that reached the same conclusion, it is clear that IPCC models are failing. Given the emerging facts I think Obama and Kerry face an even more daunting task of convincing the public that climate doom is at hand and that we need sweeping reform to escape climate Armageddon. Search "An Empirical Benchmark for Decadal Forecasts of Global Surface Temperature Anomalies by Matthew Newman" to access the PDF of the new paper. 'New paper finds climate models offer little beyond simulating a random walk' "A paper published today in the Journal of Climate finds that climate models have little to no ability to provide skillful forecasts of global surface temperatures on timescales of a decade or more. According to the author, "These results suggest that current coupled model decadal forecasts may not yet have much skill beyond that captured by multivariate red noise." Translation: state-of-the-art climate models that simulate the ocean and atmosphere together [called "coupled models"] offer little predictive ability beyond simulating a random walk [also called "red noise"] over periods of 10 or more years."</Msg><Username>nanotwo</Username><Timestamp>1359404266400</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 15:17:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359404424556-102</Id><Topic><Title>Democrat Party Now Fully Aligned with the Communist Party USA</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1359224213749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:16:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>= Neither do they look into how horribly evil communism is.= Unregulated, "laissez faire" capitalism is no less "evil."

As the Washington Times reported last week, “Mrs. Feinstein’s measure would exempt more than 2,200 types of hunting and sporting rifles; guns manually operated by bolt, pump, lever or slide action; and weapons used by government officials.” Back in 1995, while carrying a concealed weapon for her own protection, Feinstein simultaneously called for Mr. and Mrs America to “turn em all in.” Feinstein’s hypocrisy has been matched or surpassed by virtually every other public figure now pushing for the second amendment to be eviscerated. - Barack Obama himself, while leading a gun control agenda he planned “under the radar” back in 2011, admits that he goes shooting ”all the time.” - While Obama claims that semi-automatic assault rifles should only be in the hands of members of the military, the Department of Homeland Security has purchased no less than 7,000 fully automatic assault weapons for the purposes of “personal defense,” in addition to more than 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition over the last 10 months alone. - While refusing to even consider the idea of arming teachers and school officials to prevent school shootings,Obama recently signed a law that would give him and all past and future presidents armed Secret Service protection for life. - During an ABC Nightline interview broadcast on December 26 yet recorded before the Sandy Hook shooting, Obama said one of the benefits of his re-election was the ability “to have men with guns around at all times,” in order to protect his daughters. In addition, the school attended by Obama’s daughters in Washington D.C. has no less than 11 armed security guards on duty at all times. - A new investigation by the Daily Caller has found that Media Matters For America, a pro-gun control organization that admittedly conspires with the White House to influence news, hired a staffer to carry a firearm to protect founder David Brock. The staffer had no permit to carry a concealed firearm and was later hit with multiple felony charges. The Glock handgun used to defend Brock was bought using Media Matters’ funds. - When investigative reporter Jason Mattera asked New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg if he plans to disarm his entire security team to comply with his own gun control mandate, Mattera was accosted, harrassed and followed by security and Bloomberg refused to answer the question. - Michael Moore, another vehement proponent for gun control, also has armed bodyguards, one of whom was arrested for carrying an unlicensed weapon at New York’s JFK airport back in 2005. - Despite the fact that its subsidiary Warner Bros. routinely distributes blockbuster movies that are replete with gratuitous gun violence, Time Warner Cable recently issued a company-wide ban on television ads that show “guns pointed at people.” - Numerous celebrities involved in a PSA campaign called ‘Demand a Plan’ that exploited the Sandy Hook massacre to push for gun control routinely star in movies and television productions in which depictions of gun violence is commonplace. - Prominent gun control advocates like Piers Morgan, who base their argument on reducing gun violence, routinely threaten violence against ideological adversaries. Morgan once spoke of his desire to use machine guns to “take out” his critics, while also making jokes with his guests about murdering second amendment advocate Alex Jones with a semi-automatic assault rifle during his CNN show on January 8. The agenda-driven and factually bankrupt political arguments of gun control advocates may be somewhat easier to stomach if the people making them were not rampant hypocrites who – while calling for the American people to be stripped of their right to bear arms – are precluding themselves from being subjected to the same treatment.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359413383210</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 17:49:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359413406849-155</Id><Topic><Title>SUPERBOWL surprise....crazy show opener</Title><Username>frankmalone90</Username><Timestamp>1359411389212</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 17:16:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Had to laugh.. very good before earnings.

I know that there were two battery fires. I know that both fires were related to the Li-Ion batteries. I believe that both fires were the result of thermal run-away within the batteries (based on the pictures that I've seen). I know that this battery chemistry is very volatile and not robust, and that there have been many other fires caused by this battery chemistry not being properly controlled. And I know that I have kept these batteries from being deployed on very expensive, very reliable spacecraft due to the inherent safety risk of the thermal run away problem. I know that i have designed and tested monitoring circuits for similar batteries. And I know how fickle they can be. I believe it will take them six months to design, develop, test, and integrate a new charging and monitoring system and another 2 - 4 months to get it approved by the regulatory agencies. I believe that they have other battery chemistry options that they will employ during this period, but it will still take them 2 - 3 months to get them tested, integrated and approved (unless they can simply pull a system from the 757, 767 or 777, which I doubt). I know that they will have to pay concessions to the airlines for lost service, while these planes are grounded. And I believe that they are talking about a $1 to $ 2 Billion charge when its all over. And I just shorted the stock a week ago, after it became apparent that the grounding were related to the Li-Ion chemistry.</Msg><Username>madrusky</Username><Timestamp>1359418465849</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:14:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359418599612-176</Id><Topic><Title>Guess how long it takes BA to fix 787 battery problems</Title><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1359401341552</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:29:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great plan, nidan!

These people are baggers who have nothing to offer but the quack remedies of their masters who are the super rich - Kochs, Mellons, Olins, Duponts etc all billionaires with skrewey idias about economics, ethics, theology and their place in the politics of this country.</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1359424200751</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:50:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359424507571-184</Id><Topic><Title>Its not the battery - its the electrical system</Title><Username>justkeepushin</Username><Timestamp>1359419452208</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:30:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since you are so keen on the electrical system, which part is the issue?</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359424507571</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:55:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359424634054-185</Id><Title>Is the Dreamliner the Product of Trying to Please the T Baggers and super capitalists in Our Government</Title><Msg>Hmmmmmmmm it seems to me that Boeing is still a public owned organization and not a bureau of the US government but I suppose there are a lot of baggers inside the walls at Boeing willing to do substandard work to sabotage the company for allowing union workers to strike or bargain for contracts</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1359424634054</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:57:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359424749372-186</Id><Topic><Title>Let's send this pig to the single digits....</Title><Username>eucheme</Username><Timestamp>1359406796024</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 15:59:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are going to lose your butt shorting Boeing sonney</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1359424749372</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:59:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359424776346-187</Id><Topic><Title>the company is an Obama Green Energy subcontractor to Boeing. any body got an idea</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1359418897185</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:21:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What are you talking about??</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1359424776346</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:59:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359424857361-188</Id><Topic><Title>Laissez-faire Capitalism Is Free Treade - That's Why Democrats Hate the Idea</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1359405462565</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 15:37:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hawfaeces what do you know about free trade- you have spent most of your life being a welfare bum</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1359424857361</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 21:00:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359425013699-189</Id><Topic><Title>Laissez-faire Capitalism Is Free Treade - That's Why Democrats Hate the Idea</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1359405462565</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 15:37:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"econprof"???

Socialism by definition says the resources and businesses are owned by the government and people are paid to operate them. Otherwise, people in a socialist state are free beings. Communism, by definition is socialism plus a totalitarian form of government that extends to every facet of life and most likely involve coercion and indoctrination. Religion is not allowed because it interferes with revering state first. The USSR was a communist government. VietNam is mostly a communist government.

A lot of people express concerns of BA halting 787 production, I think the chance of that happening is about zero. I also don't think there will be much, or any change in the charging system even if they ditch the LI batteries. As they have stated the battery monitoring circuits controls the charger, so if they change batteries the new battery monitoring circuits can axiomatically make any adjustments to charging as needed. The big issue if they keep the LI batteries will be containment, or the lack of it which I suspect played a large part of the reason for the FAA grounding all 787's. The heavy bowing of the box shows it was pushed to its limit to contain the raging infernal similar to a runaway atomic reactor doing the Three Mile Island, I don't think the FAA at this point will settle for anything less than complete containment of a catastrophic battery failure, other than venting the nasty fumes outside of the aircraft. So other than for discoloration, a worst case failed battery will have to show no sign of damage on the outside. I don't think there will be much of a change in the batteries unless they opt for a chemistry change to one of the newer somewhat less volatile ones like LifePO. As for the battery control board, I expect a massive ground redesign that makes the old one look primitive. For sure it will monitor each cell for voltage, temperature, and control charging on a per cell basses. That will insure no single cell is subject to overcharging, and if a cell starts to get a little to warm before it gets out of control it will signal the charging system to drop the charge rate, or even stop it and isolate the battery from the electrical system to give it a chance to cool down before it goes into a thermal runaway state. I think all the engineering work can be done in about 6 months, and if I was BA I'd get a prototype case for demonstration purposes done in a month, it might no even be close to the final case design, but that wouldn't matter as I would want to ASAP show the FAA and the world BA can totally contain even the worst battery failure.</Msg><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1359426558423</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 21:29:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359427435785-199</Id><Topic><Title>Guess how long it takes BA to fix 787 battery problems</Title><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1359401341552</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:29:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This would assume a robust quality assurance system is in place at the B.

I should have used the same term at all times to prevent confusion, my mistake. The redesign will likely have a sub-module outside of the case to record and log events in case a battery failure destroys the one in the case. As for the charging circuitry, any replacement battery is going require similar charge rates and voltages, as the design of the aircraft’s electrical systems dictate the electrical characteristics of the battery. The aircraft will require X voltage + 0r – X, at least X capacity, and need to charges at at least X rate in order to provide the power needed for the planes electrical systems. With the battery monitoring and control circuit controlling charging, unless the new battery is outside the voltage and charge rate the battery needs, there is no need to change it, and any battery outside of the current charging systems abilities will likely require a full redesign of the whole 787 electrical system, and why on earth would BA do that since there is no reason to do so.</Msg><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1359431744691</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 22:55:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359432631598-204</Id><Topic><Title>Can Any Of You Liberals Tell Us What's Wrong with Communism?</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1359412402203</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 17:33:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well the difference is really quite simple you see.
