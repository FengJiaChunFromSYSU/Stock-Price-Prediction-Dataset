Frankly, domerrrrr45 you can't stand it that I comment that Airbus is up today on stock price and Boeing is down today . Domerrrrr45 you really don't like it when I compare Airbus stock increase to Boeing for year to date , Airbus beats and betters Boeing year to date by 52% to 42% and for 5 years Airbus betters Boeing by 194% to a lousy 63% for Boeing . Next Tesla and Boeing comparison money to money on May 24 Boeing closed for the first time recently above 100 and today it is 107 that is 7% gain But tesla closed above 100 at 110 on May 29, mind you tesla was already up over 300% for the past two years prior to may 29, since then to now tesla is at 142 that is another gain of 29% you really hate me only because domerrrrr45 I point out how lousy and risky boeing stock is compared to Airbus and tsla. So how am I doing domerrrrr45? I figure I will keep using the boeing message Board for about 10 more years , by that time Boeing will be a niche player or bankrupt just like their management bankrupted McDonnell Douglas .

LOT, the first European airline to add the Dreamliners to its fleet, currently has four of Boeing's flagship planes that were grounded for months earlier this year over concerns with overheating batteries.

"The research-and-development cost has skyrocketed." Udvar-Hazy said his guess is that Boeing will have to deliver 1,500 Dreamliners just to break even. That's almost twice the current tally of firm orders, at 843. A typical initial assumption for break-even on a new jet program is more like 400 or 500 airplanes. Suggesting a break-even of 1,500 indicates the financial impact of the jet program's delays has been catastrophic. Udvar-Hazy is famous in aerospace for his invention of the aircraft-leasing business, which made him a billionaire with his former company International Lease Finance Corp. (ILFC). Business Week puts the net breakeven point at 2021 for example on the 787. Remember this is all without the consideration of the 4 month groundings that came later than the predictions or the continued failures on the 787 which will continue as the plane was not designed in house like the 777 was, so no control. The 777 development was supported by other Boeing programs. From now on what is missing is that unit production cash outflows are lower than cash inflows related to deliveries (penalties not taken into account), and that is something the Boeing company faces going forward with more and more failures the 787, the 767 tanker being fixed cost and already a loss, the 747-8 a loss with only the 737 due for a update and the 777x due for a update more and more The military programs are also not as strong a money maker now too. Boeing plane programs will make less and less money to cover the huge real loss on the 787 going forward. This failure cannot be sustained , Boeing will go bankrupt within 10 years.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1375882032032</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 09:27:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375882610489-16</Id><Topic><Title>IS WAYNEDICK.....</Title><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1375834710740</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-06 20:18:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another flury of idiotic posts this morning</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1375882610489</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 09:36:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375882881086-17</Id><Topic><Title>Exactly when is it that Boeing will be net-net profitable on the Dreamliner or Boeing bankruptcy in 10 years</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1375882032032</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 09:27:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To compare apples with apples, between 2011 and 2030 I included 2,154 787s delivered, all those that 787 assembly lines could produce.

While that is true, as Professor Milton Friedman frequently pointed out, economic efficiency and greater wealth should be seen and praised as simply a side benefit of free markets. The intellectual defense should focus on its moral superiority. Even if free markets were not more efficient and not engines for growth, they are morally superior to other forms of human organization because they are rooted in volun- tary peaceable relationships rather than force and coer- cion.They respect the sanctity of the individual. The preservation of free-market capitalism requires what philosopher David Kelley has called the entrepre- neurial outlook on life, which he in part describes as “A sense of self-ownership, a conviction that one’s life is One’s own, not something for which one must answer to some higher [earthly] power.” If we accept as first principle that each owns himself, what constitutes just and unjust con- duct is readily discovered and does not require rocket science. Unjust conduct is simply any conduct that violates an individual’s ownership rights in himself when he has not violated those same rights of others. The lat- ter phrase when he has not violated those same rights of others allows for fines, imprisonment, and execu- tion when a person has infringed the ownership rights of others. Therefore, acts such as murder, rape, and theft, whether done privately or collectively, are unjust because they violate private property. There is broad consensus that collective or government-sponsored murder and rape are unjust; however, government-spon- sored theft is another matter. Theft, being defined as forcibly taking the rightful property of one for the ben- efit of another, has wide support in many societies that make the pretense of valuing personal liberty.That theft, euphemistically called income redistribution or trans- fers, is often defended by lofty phrases such as: assisting the poor, the elderly, distressed business, college stu- dents, and other deserving segments of society.

Hart-Smith, who had worked for Douglas Aircraft and joined Boeing when it merged in 1997 with McDonnell Douglas, was one of the elite engineers designated within the company as Senior Technical Fellows. His paper was a biting critique of excessive outsourcing, a warning to Boeing not to go down the path that had led Douglas Aircraft to virtual obsolescence by the mid-1990s. In 2011 James Bell Chief Accountant for Boeing said, “ Boeing projected that the cost to build each Dreamliner will drop below the price paid by the buyer around 2015, providing positive cash flow for the first time.” But that projection was in 2011 and since t</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1375887325871</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 10:55:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375887844494-32</Id><Title>EXACTLY DICKWAYNEDICK.....</Title><Msg>When will you disappear...with your daily garbage..</Msg><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1375887844494</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 11:04:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375889593012-33</Id><Topic><Title>Exactly when is it that Boeing will be net-net profitable on the Dreamliner or Boeing bankruptcy in 10 years</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1375882032032</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 09:27:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>domerrrrr45 you asked me a question, your not reading or your ignorind my messages I already told you exactly when here is your question domerrrrrr45 said," EXACTLY DICKWAYNEDICK..... .

On the 777, the costs were largely inside Boeing's own factories and within its control. But Boeing's business model for the 787 relies heavily on outsourcing, ( read Hart-Smith)so the costs are baked into the big sections that arrive from suppliers around the globe. To reduce costs, Boeing will have to renegotiate pricing contracts. Because suppliers were so heavily hit by the program's delays, Boeing had to raise the prices it paid them for the early units that cost so much to build. "At some point in the future, that contractual price is something Boeing hopes to negotiate lower," Copeland said. With so much in the hands of suppliers, he said, the pace of overall cost reduction is harder to predict from outside.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1375891231241</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 12:00:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375891965603-42</Id><Title>Airbus up today .81% ,5 years 194% betters Boeing down today .92% , AB up 194% gain betters BA 53%</Title><Msg>domerrrrrr45 and company, if you quitname calling me and stop talking twice as much as your one mouth should allow you, and begin to listen twice as much as your two ears should allow you, and also read my user comments twice as much as your two eye's can work for you, , then domerrrrr45 your pocketbook would be up , domerrrrr45 you would be up 194% with Airbus over 5 years and not up a pathetic 63% for 5 years with Boeing.

Whether we like to think of it as such, our fiscal problems, as well as many others, are rooted in immoral government conduct. Let me start off by referring to the U.S. Constitution, or what I prefer to call the citizen's rule book. To say something meaningful about taxation one must also say something about expenditures. I know that nowadays one risks being labeled an extremist if he looks to the Constitution for guidance about what the federal government should be doing, but I will happily accept that risk. Article I, Section 8 of our Constitution is very relevant to today's discussion. Article I, Section 8 begins by granting Congress authority to lay and collect taxes. In the passages that follow, it enumerates a broad category of activities (namely nineteen) for which Congress has spending authority for which it can use its taxing authority. Among those activities, for those who have not bothered to inspect, are common defense, coinage of money, establish of post offices and courts. I have not done the numbers but I am guessing that the amount of money necessary for Congress to pay for these constitutionally, and by the way moral, authorized functions of the federal government would come to no more than $400 billion or so at the most. Obviously, that amount differs significantly from today's expenditure level of $1.6 trillion. Even that expenditure figure does not capture total spending because we have an underground government - the so-called "off-budget" expenditures as well as government-mandated spending by its citizens - such as ADA, OSHA, EPA dictates. I do not believe that we can restore government to its proper role in a free society by focusing our energies on the revenue side of the equation. In saying this, I in no way wish to demean the yeoman-like efforts of all those who worked to come up with a better method of taxation. I do not mind being corrected, if I am totally off base, but I see the debate between the flat tax, national sales tax and our current tax code as essentially one of which is the best way for government to subjugate its citizens? That is, of course, not a totally meaningless question because, given that we are going to accept subjugation, there are, I suppose, preferable methods to be subjugated. The debate over the form of taxation we should have legitimates the level of government spending. It is spending, not taxation, that is the true measure of the burden of government. After all there is no necessary reason why government has to tax in the first place. At one extreme Congress could acquire all the resources it needs simply by printing currency. Or Congress could borrow and require citizens and other entities to hold a portion of their holdings in government securities. Of course there would be severe problems associated with either of those methods but the point is that government spending, not taxation, is the proper measure of the burden of government activity. That is the major problem that needs to be addressed. Throughout most of our nation's history, up to the beginning of the twentieth century, the federal government spent no more than three or four percent of the nation's output except during war times. During that interval, it did not make much of a difference what form of taxation supported federal government activity. In fact, excise taxes carried the burden. But even if we had today's income tax code, there would not have been much of a problem. In other words, if federal spending is only three or four percent of the GNP, almost any kind of a tax system is not going to impose that much of a burden. And I am sure, were that the case, we would not be gathered here today to discuss substituting a flat tax for the current code. Some might ask what congressional spending should be cut so that we would not have to worry about the form of taxation. A French philosopher, Frederic Bastiat, gave us the best guide, in a little book titled, The Law, wherein he suggested a way of identifying legal plunder saying, "See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime." Clearly, at least two-thirds of all federal spending fits Bastiat's description of legal plunder or what I call legalized theft. So if we eliminated legal plunder from the scope of congressional activity, the form of taxation could easily be a non-issue. Some may wish to quarrel with my description of Congress' business as legal plunder. If you do so, just ask yourselves how does Congress get money for, say, farm subsidy programs, S&amp;L bailouts or foodstamp programs. It uses intimidation, threats and coercion to take what rightfully belongs to one citizen and gives it to another to whom it does not belong. The mission of virtually every cabinet department is to distribute the loot. There is neither moral or constitutional authority for Congress to commit plunder. Turning to the Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal, notwithstanding what I have argued, there are nonetheless some benefits to its enactment. First, it would reduce Congress' ability to grant one group of Americas special privileges denied to another group of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee are two of the most powerful committees in Congress. Its members have the largest political war chests. They are the focus of Washington's lobby groups who pay handsomely and work diligently to have favors bestowed upon them. The Army-Shelby flat tax would go a long way towards eliminating privilege granting. That may explain some of the political resistance to the flat tax. Another benefit of the Armey-Shelby flat is lower tax compliance costs. According to various estimates, the compliance costs of our current tax code comes to 5.5 billion to 6 billion hours in recordkeeping, filling out tax forms, going to court, seeking methods to avoid taxes, etc. The Armey-Shelby flat tax would create a GNP windfall. If Americans were spending those tax compliance hours in productive activity, we would be considerably richer. The current tax compliance costs are estimated to be equal to the annual outputs of the auto, truck and aircraft industries combined. As evidenced my remarks, I am a purist or what the news media and maybe even some of you might call an extremist. But I am not so much of a purist that I cannot see that a flat tax is a major improvement over the status quo. But if there is a flat tax enacted, there should be a supermajority vote required to increase the rate, say, four fifths of both houses and a simple majority to decrease the rate. My reason is quite simple. Like the Framers of our constitution, I do not trust Congress. With the current complex tax code, there are numerous legal ways to hide our money from the revenuers. With a simple flat tax, those hideaways would be eliminated. Then, if Congress raised taxes we would be up that proverbial creek without a paddle. Walter E.

Maybe the only reason you have no life is your ego is writing checks on the loss compared to Boeing that you cant stand so you are attempting to destroy the messenger. Domerrrrr45, . your losing aginst a better stock at 194% gain for Airbus by not being in Airbus, and want me to stop pointing this gap out . Domerrrrr45, apparently you do not like it that any potential buyer of Boeing may now know and go with Airbus . Domerrrrr45, after all, a rational investor would go with 194% gainer over a 63 % gainer. While a angry Boeing investor like you Domerrrrr45, is not doing as good and your attitude demonstrates the loss you have missed and the reaction is not a good reflection on your investment ability . anger does not work stock charts and stock market skill does work that is why I make money and you are in a stock like Boeing that is an outsourcer and already has lost to bankruptcy it is guaranteed , you just are living in denial.

Export credits have become a hot issue since Delta Air Lines Inc sued the U.S. Export-Import Bank in April in an effort to stop their use for Boeing's 777 and 787 planes. Delta wants the Ex-Im bank to stop helping state-owned foreign airlines buy wide-body jets from Boeing, because it says that puts U.S. airlines at a cost disadvantage. The airline noted that Emirates Airline and Korean Air Lines Co Ltd - among the biggest buyers of 777 and 787 planes - do not use U.S. government aid. Delta was joined in the lawsuit by the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents 47,000 pilots at 28 U.S. airlines, and Hawaiian Airlines, the largest carrier in Hawaii.

That’s true both for federal income taxes and total federal taxes.[2] Income taxes: A family of four in the exact middle of the income spectrum will pay only 5.3 percent of its 2013 income in federal income taxes next year, according to a new analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center (TPC).[3] Average income tax rates for these typical families have been lower during the Bush and Obama Administrations than at any time since the 1950s (see Figure 1). As discussed below, 2009 and 2010 were particularly low because of the temporary Making Work Pay Tax Credit. Overall federal taxes: Overall federal taxes — which include income, payroll, and excise taxes, and imputed corporate taxes — on middle-income households in 2009 were at their lowest levels in decades, according to the latest data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Federal Income Taxes Have Declined Significantly in Recent Decades Federal income taxes on middle-income families have declined significantly in recent decades. In 1998-2000, the years before the 2001 tax cut enacted by President Bush and Congress, the median-income family of four paid roughly 8.0 percent of its income in individual income taxes, according to TPC estimates — a smaller share than in any year since 1967.[4] The Bush tax cuts further reduced taxes for middle-income taxpayers, and January’s “fiscal cliff” bill (the American Taxpayer Relief Act) made these middle-income tax cuts permanent. TPC estimates that the median-income family of four will pay 5.3 percent of its 2013 income in federal income taxes when it files its return next year. The 5.3 percent rate (as well as the other rates discussed here for 2013 and other years) is the effective tax rate, or the percentage of its income that a family pays in taxes.

This is the sum of good government.” -Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1801 “Congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically enumerated.” -Thomas Jefferson “When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated.” -Thomas Jefferson to Charles Hammond, 1821. The Writings of Thomas Jefferson, (Memorial Edition) Lipscomb and Bergh, editors, ME 15:332 “The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground.” -Thomas Jefferson, letter to E. Carrington, May 27, 1788 “The moment the idea is admitted into society that property is not as sacred as the laws of God, and that there is not a force of law and public justice to protect it, anarchy and tyranny commence. If ‘Thou shalt not covet’ and ‘Thou shalt not steal’ were not commandments of Heaven, they must be made inviolable precepts in every society before it can be civilized or made free.” -John Adams, A Defense of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America, 1787 James Madison, the Father of the Constitution, elaborated upon this limitation in a letter to James Robertson: “With respect to the two words ‘general welfare,’ I have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers connected with them. To take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the Constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators.” In 1794, when Congress appropriated $15,000 for relief of French refugees who fled from insurrection in San Domingo to Baltimore and Philadelphia, James Madison stood on the floor of the House to object saying, “I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents.” -James Madison, 4 Annals of congress 179 (1794) “…[T]he government of the United States is a definite government, confined to specified objects. It is not like the state governments, whose powers are more general. Charity is no part of the legislative duty of the government.” -James Madison “If Congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money, and will promote the general welfare, the government is no longer a limited one possessing enumerated powers, but an indefinite one subject to particular exceptions.” James Madison, “Letter to Edmund Pendleton,” -James Madison, January 21, 1792, in The Papers of James Madison, vol. 14, Robert A Rutland et. al., ed (Charlottesvile: University Press of Virginia,1984). “An elective despotism was not the government we fought for; but one in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among the several bodies of magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limits without being effectually checked and restrained by the others.” -James Madison, Federalist No. 58, February 20, 1788 “There are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.” -James Madison, speech to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, June 16, 1788</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1375902803271</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 15:13:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375903258501-76</Id><Topic><Title>airbus 330</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1375902373563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 15:06:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny how Boeing incident get plaster all over the wires and not a peep of this anywhere!!!</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1375903258501</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 15:20:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375903881277-77</Id><Title>Why is it so hard for the Liberal Mind to Comprehend......</Title><Msg>....that there is a moral difference between taxing people for a park that all citizens have a right to enjoy and taxing Fred because he makes a lot of money so they can give it to John who wants to make solar panels.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1375903881277</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 15:31:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375904167516-78</Id><Topic><Title>The Moral superiority of Free Markets</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1375884065094</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 10:01:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is not double taxation.

Here are some helpful questions the NSA may consider using when evaluating a new applicant: 1. If your boss asks you, are you able to lie to Congress. 2. Have you read the Constitution of the US, if yes can you ignore what it says. 3. Can you follow orders even if you find them morally reprehensable. 4. Can you keep it secret if your boss directs you to aid in the overthrow of the gov't. 5. Do you like listening in on other people's private conversations without them knowing, especially elected officials or friendly foreign gov't heads. 6. Do you think corporate espionage is ok 7. Can you keep everything you learn as secret as quid pro quo for pay. 8. Do you regard whistleblowers as evil. 9. Do you find that reaching ends justify all means. 10. Do you feel that in order to have a safe country people must give up all their expectations of privacy. I think your qualified to work for the NSA.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1375923420662</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 20:57:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375925486224-122</Id><Topic><Title>Which stock is better?

The e average open market trades are 8 million per day. So this is a huge after market share get in, it is based on TSLA beating earnings , actually blowing them out. Elon Musk, has taken a page out of Steve Jobs playbook, beat the earnings by a wide margin; surprising all the analysts especially Goldman Sacks who wrote a negative sounding report the day after the TSLA stock was upgraded to the NASDAQ 100. Actually GS upgraded the share price but is playing catch up. Elon Musk is a very sharp man. He is a serial maker of great things, he made and sold paypal for 1.5 billion dollars. Like Steve Jobs, he will make his money based on stock performance , or selling his companies. He is not at all like James Mcnerney CEO of Boeing a guy that the man, Jack Welch, said you have to leave GE your not good enough. Now, James McNerney is bankrupting Boeing, with the same business plan that bankrupted McDonnell Douglas , (outsourcing )as Hart-Smith of Boeing pointed out it will end in the same result . The MD business plan wrapped in a Boeing logo will end in Bankruptcy. That is guaranteed, as MD has got rid of all the experienced real Boeing engineers who could have saved Boeing. Now in fact due to outsourcing, the 787 is dead, the 747-8 is dead. the 767 fixed cost -dead, the 737 Max like the 747-8 will be a MD outsource so its dead, the 777X dead, so with no income from the real heritage Boeing planes, to fund the failed 787 You need to get out of Boeing now . As Tom O'Brien stated a month ago , "Boeing is dead on the vine' it will top out at the last recent high of 107 and then retrace to 71, you should all be out of Boeing and in Airbus or TSLA good luck, if you refuse to think it over and stay with a bankrupt company it is just 10 years away .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1375925486224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 21:31:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375928563296-123</Id><Title>I Voted for President Obama</Title><Msg>In general Obama is a good President and wants to do good.
