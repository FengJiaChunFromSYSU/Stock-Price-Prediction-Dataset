I feel sorry that young kid got killed. But they didn’t have enough evidence to charge him. Something clearly went wrong that night. Clearly something went wrong. I feel bad for anybody who loses a kid, but if you looked at the case and you don’t make it — there was some racial profiling, no question about it. But something happened that changed the dynamic of that night, and I know — that’s probably not a popular opinion among most people but just looking at the evidence I agreed with the verdict. I just feel bad because I don’t like when race gets out in the media because I don’t think the media has a pure heart, as I call it. There are very few people have a pure heart when it comes to race. Racism is wrong in any, shape, form — a lot of black people are racist too. I think sometimes when people talk about racism, they say only white people are racist. There are a lot of black people who are racist. I don’t like when it gets out there in the media because I don’t think the media has clean hands.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374232641906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 07:17:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374232892063-12</Id><Topic><Title>Atorney General Holder Attacks Natural Right of Self Defense</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374145583404</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 07:06:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"There is something very wrong with the Kent Raven."

They cannot admit that it really was self defense and that they were wrong. Now they have all the government and media agencies working overtime to find something, anything, any incident in Zimmerman's past that could be stretched as racism. Obama and politicians are now jumping on the Zimmerman bashing bandwagon, to save face. Mainstream media is on a one sided media blitz. The media uses hot button phrases like: " Child with skittles". Well Trayvon was 17+. He was stronger, faster and taller than George. (At 18 years one can join the military and train to kill enemy soldiers.) "Stalked". George followed and report. "Murdered". George was getting his head bashed on the concrete after getting his nose smashed by a sucker punch. it was self defense. Proved in a court of law with evidence not emotion. "Stalked and murdered a child with skittles and ice tea." If the media keeps repeating it long enough, we just might end up believing it. George is not a racist as proved with his community involvement record helping children including black children.</Msg><Username>bdbaca99</Username><Timestamp>1374242577348</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:02:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374242798671-53</Id><Topic><Title>Tom Petty understood human nature when he wrote this</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1374238667763</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 08:57:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i think of this country and FREE FALLING</Msg><Username>hirtuism</Username><Timestamp>1374242798671</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:06:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374242823381-54</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks, Guys</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374239295274</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 09:08:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll have my toes in the water soon... the righty-tighties are doing my job.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374242823381</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:07:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374242833456-55</Id><Title>detroit collapse</Title><Msg>hobama mama is blaming george bush</Msg><Username>hirtuism</Username><Timestamp>1374242833456</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:07:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374243023719-56</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks, Guys</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374239295274</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 09:08:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooz the losers under Obonzo are Blacks needing jobs, US GDP, Detroit, Black kids gunned down in the streets of Dem run cities, Bill of Rights, liberty, privacy rights, American exceptionalism, world respect for the USA, free enterprise, the American dream, citizens being abused by the IRS, citizens being spied on, people looking to get out of poverty, etc. WINNING for you is the transformation of the USA into Cuba.

Trayvon seeing the crazy-assed Zimmerman started walking towards him and upon reaching him asked "why are you follwing me, do you have a problem?" upon which Zimmerman (with his history of agression and 'state-of-mind' at the time) said belligerantly "I don't have a problem" whence he shoved Trayvon...only then did Trayvon drop his candy/drink and hit Zimmerman. By the testimony of witness they rolled around one on top, then the other, until Zimmerman got a hold of his weapon, and grabbed the retreating Trayvon by the shirt with his left hand and fired point blank straight-on into the childs heart.</Msg><Username>repugsareliars</Username><Timestamp>1374245655064</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:54:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374245806102-72</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks, Guys</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374239295274</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 09:08:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Being prejudice against you and your fellow lynch mobsters certainly helps.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1374245806102</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:56:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374245924599-73</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks, Guys</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374239295274</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 09:08:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>chrissie/spart (with good cop ali ID) bumps chrissie/spart</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374245924599</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:58:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374246098855-74</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks, Guys</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374239295274</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 09:08:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody helps more than you, censored.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374246098855</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 11:01:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374246140996-75</Id><Topic><Title>God bless Travon and his family</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1374187645122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:47:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumbos worship dumbos, in this case @no_limit#$%$. folks like travon justify stand your ground and concealed carry laws...zimmerman defended himself against physical assault, end of story</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374246140996</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 11:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374246306500-76</Id><Topic><Title>God bless Travon and his family</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1374187645122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:47:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"end of story" Oh, I don't think so.

According to the complaint, Deen and other managers at her companies ignored Jackson’s attempts to discuss Hiers’ behavior. As evidence that Deen “holds such racist views herself,” the complaint details an incident that occurred when Jackson was in charge of “food and serving arrangements” at Hier’s wedding in 2007. The complaint includes a comment Deen allegedly made when asked by Jackson what type of uniforms the servers should wear at the wedding. “Well what I would really like is a bunch of little( n word ) to wear long-sleeve white shirts, black shorts and black bow ties, you know in the Shirley Temple days, they used to tap dance around,” the lawsuit claims Deen said. “Now that would be a true southern wedding, wouldn’t it? But we can’t do that because the media would be on me about that.” And then this: "Deen admitted this week to using the N-word and wanting to plan a 'plantation-style wedding' with black waiters dressed like slaves." So, who does the "party of personal responsibility" blame? The media for reporting the story and me for posting it! But hey, she still denies being prejudiced.

It's true they have always existed. The real problem is unearthing all the carbon we do in the form of coal, crude oil, and natural gas, then converting it to energy using inefficient methods, releasing much carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere. We've gotten better at keeping some of that stuff out of the air, soil and water, but it's still way too much. It is not part of what people would refer to as the natural carbon cycle.

As Alberta's energy minister Ken Hughes acknowledged, "[I]t is a strategic imperative, it is in Alberta's interest, in Canada's interest, that we get access to tidewater... to diversify away from the single continental market and be part of the global market." Relatively cheap Canadian tar sands crude, which is more than half of the crude oil used in Midwest refineries, and increasingly the source of Western refiners, will get a lot more expensive if the XL pipeline developers have their ways. Their articulated goal for the global market: raising the price per barrel of Canadian tar sand oil by $30, from $70 now charged to the $100 per barrel now commanded by Mexican Maya crude oil in the Gulf. As a businessman, I can understand that profit motive. But what it means for U.S. drivers is higher gasoline prices. When crude prices go up, gasoline prices go up. Why build the Keystone XL if it will hurt the consumer and the environment? As reported this morning in the Des Moines Register, in the Midwest, in particular, the 40 cent per gallon increase at the pump that the report identifies is going to do grave damage to the economy.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374258522273</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:28:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374258678184-155</Id><Topic><Title>Keystone XL Will Benefit Foreign Markets</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374258522273</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:28:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sounds like an obot press release</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374258678184</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:31:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374258705756-156</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Change has been going on since creation. ice formed over the Bering Sea and Indians come over and populated N &amp; S</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1374255492472</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:38:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>let me see, we've been burning gasoline since 1910 approx. some how these people have been able to put fear in the mindless horde.

The tar has to be heated to make it pumpable, which makes the whole prospect very inefficient. The only reasonable way to exploit the resource is to refine the tar right there or burn the tar sands where they are, on site, and use the energy for energy-intensive operations such as aluminum smelting, glass making, fertilizer manufacture on site.

There is no nationwide carbon tax levelled in the United States, although a few states and localities have introduced the tax. Carbon taxes offer a potentially cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.[6] From an economic perspective, carbon taxes are a type of Pigovian tax.[7] They help to address the problem of emitters of greenhouse gases not facing the full (social) costs of their actions. Carbon taxes can be a regressive tax, in that they may directly or indirectly affect low-income groups disproportionately . The regressive impact of carbon taxes could be addressed by using tax revenues to favour low-income groups.[8] However, there are about USD $550 billion in fossil fuel subsidies annually worldwide.[9] A number of countries have implemented carbon taxes or energy taxes that are related to carbon content.[10] Most environmentally related taxes with implications for greenhouse gas emissions in OECD countries are levied on energy products and motor vehicles, rather than on CO 2 emissions directly.[6] Opposition to increased environmental regulation such as carbon taxes often centres on concerns that firms might relocate and/or people might lose their jobs.[10] It has been argued, however, that carbon taxes are more efficient than direct regulation and may even lead to higher employment (see footnotes).[10] you are welcome</Msg><Username>repugsareliars</Username><Timestamp>1374260020276</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:53:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374260117785-166</Id><Title>Republicans Calling President Obama a Racist</Title><Msg>its truly despicable -------------------- Conservatives didn’t even wait for President Obama to finish his deeply personal remarks on Trayvon Martin’s killing and the role of race in America to go ballistic, accusing the president of being a “Racist in Chief” who is “trying to tear our country apart.” On Twitter, Fox News, and elsewhere, many conservatives took a predictably depressing response, arguing that Obama is the true racist for having the courage to speak about race in our country.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374260117785</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:55:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374260206492-167</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Change has been going on since creation. ice formed over the Bering Sea and Indians come over and populated N &amp; S</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1374255492472</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:38:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tell me more about the unstable isotopes of tobacco All tobacco on the earth comes from the heart of a collapsing star that went supernova.</Msg><Username>husseindamuud</Username><Timestamp>1374260206492</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:56:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374260378637-168</Id><Topic><Title>Keystone XL Will Benefit Foreign Markets</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374258522273</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:28:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fool you continue to support the destruction of America</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374260378637</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:59:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374260397983-169</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Change has been going on since creation. ice formed over the Bering Sea and Indians come over and populated N &amp; S</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1374255492472</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:38:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's what i thought i said, approx 4 hundredths of one percent of the atmosphere by volume, composed of a far less than primary variable. course most ~95% is produced by our oceans and decaying biomatter. which means man (and all his terrible machines) contributes approx 5%, or 2 thousandths of a single percent of the atmosphere by volume. you'd think the plants would be happy, too bad aljazeera gore can't invent a rheostat for the sun...the co2 thing is absolutely silly</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374260397983</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:59:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374260410606-170</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Calling President Obama a Racist</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374260117785</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:55:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post.

Most news in the USA regarding ice melt came from GRACE as it had been the data source for most scientific papers. Those papers using inaccurate GRACE data as the primary source for Arctic ice mass balance loss, are still in peer reviewed publications. However there is no coverage of this outside of the science community. All people ever find in US media coverage is that the ice melt is worse than we thought even though that is no longer the truth based on corrected satellite reanalysis. Did you know that the Arctic was free of Summer ice for most of the Early Holocene? I didn't either until I did research and found numerous papers using varied proxy sources that were led to the same conclusion. Have you investigated this or discussed it with any polar scientists? I have and there is no simple answer to your question albucucu. The ice melt in the Arctic is related to many factors other than CO2 with lead IPCC author NASA polar scientist Drew Shindell's (and 40 polar researchers working with him on the IPCC report) latest calculations showing that 2/3 of current ice melt being caused by black carbon and ground level ozone. The latest study out suggests we may not see a 7 foot rise in oceans for 1,000 years. Recent evidence points to Greenland remaining stable in the Eemian even though Arctic temperatures were 14.5 degreesF warmer than today. Also in the last decade Antarctic ice mass balance has been increasing meaning more snow mass is accumulating on the continental surface than is calving into the oceans. Lastly I had contacted the MET Office regarding updated analysis on IPCC model trend divergence in 2012. The MET responded to me that they would update and in 2013 the MET Office lowered their global model temperature forecast and now the IPCC seems to agree..</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1374260652593</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:04:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374260785215-174</Id><Topic><Title>Why the GOP Doesn't Care About Climate Change</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374176120473</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 15:35:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they also forget they while ice melts in the northern hemisphere, ice grows in the southern, dem gov't dependent junk scientists got all kinds of tricks up their sleeves...the lap dogs make it easy</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374260785215</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:06:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374261157529-175</Id><Topic><Title>Why the GOP Doesn't Care About Climate Change</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374176120473</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 15:35:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WE manage to melt the polar caps?

"When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said this could've been my son. Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could've been me 35 years ago," Mr. Obama said in an unexpected appearance in the White House briefing room, where reporters were gathered to question White House spokesman Jay Carney. "When you think about why in the African-American community, at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, it's important to recognize the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and history that doesn't go away." After a Florida jury on Saturday acquitted Zimmerman of murder, Mr. Obama gave a decidedly muted response, noting that the Justice Department was reviewing the case. Some civil rights leaders called for more action from the administration of the nation's first African-American president.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374261489200</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:18:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374261518002-182</Id><Topic><Title>Did Barack's color change when he became a senator?</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374261182404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:13:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>could be the aura, i think about self defense/preservation every time he opens his mouth</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374261518002</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:18:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374261596129-183</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Calling President Obama a Racist</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374260117785</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:55:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course Obama is a racist.

I have been accused many times, by those on the right, of idolizing the President. Of thinking he can do no wrong (of course they do not say it in those exact words...my words are much more general in nature). I guess they are right to a certain extent. I do think very highly of President Obama. I would not go so far as to say he can do no wrong. After all, he has said himself that everyday he makes mistakes...that he is not perfect and jokes as to how his wife Michelle reminds him of that. I feel that I am a good judge of character, and I must say that from what I have seen over the years of his demeanor, his empathy, his patience, his kindness, his determination, his judgement, his integrity, his spirituality, his humility and his deep concern for the American people...all American people, this speech, clearly embodies all these characteristics. Speaking as a world citizen, I felt a closer kinship with Americans after listening to President Obama speak...not from a script, and not from teleprompters Sarah, but from his heart. He spoke not just to African Americans, but to all Americans...and I would further expand that to the global community. Because sadly, racism and bigotry is a human condition. It is in us all whether we realize it or not. Recognizing this fact is a step forward toward making our world a better place to live... a better world for our children and our children's children. You are fortunate to have such a man for your leader. The world is fortunate to have such a leader.

Zimmerman (GZ) made one 911 call, lasting 4:11 minutes, reporting a “suspicious guy” that “appears to be on drugs”, who was “not moving and just staring at the buildings”, answers the 911 operator’s race and clothing questions. I listened to that call. I also found the timeline of events from the trial. If you listen to GZ’s call, the 911 operator asks GZ where the subject was. By 1:30 of 4:11 minutes GZ is standing while he describes Trayvon who is now just staring at GZ and then GZ says that Trayvon was now moving towards him. GZ sees that Trayvon had something in his hands – likely the cell phone. Trayvon runs away. At 2:22, apparently because of the 911 operator’s questions about location, GZ is now trying to find Trayvon; the operator obviously hears that GZ is moving (huffing/puffing in voice) and tells him, “we do not need you to do that”. GZ says, “OK” and stops (huffing/puffing ceases at 2:39). Nothing there about “stay in your vehicle”. GZ was moving for 17 seconds. Trayvon is moving in and out of view – according to GZ. The physical altercation is presumed to have occurred during the “dead time” of Trayvon’s call with Jeantel, 2:19 to 3:18 minutes after the end of GZ’s call. The distance from where Trayvon was located at the time of the encounter and his destination (father’s girlfriend’s place) was less than 0.1 miles (four buildings), or about 1.5 to 2.0 minutes of normal walking pace time. But Trayvon did not run away. Instead he chose to challenge GZ, against the urging of his friend Rachel, then beat GZ on the ground bashing his head against the concrete. Then he got shot, which was heard 55 seconds after the point that Trayvon stopped talking to Jeantel, someone (logically GZ) was heard screaming during those 55 seconds. Anyone that is being beat up for that length of time is likely to formulate enough sense of fear of death that would then rationalize the use of the gun.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1374275639006</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:13:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374275671893-244</Id><Topic><Title>Barack Hussein Admin</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374272300494</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 18:18:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well tell yourself to cut it out</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374275671893</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:14:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374275748755-245</Id><Topic><Title>God bless Travon and his family</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1374187645122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:47:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>too bad the punk began the assault</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374275748755</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:15:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374275771835-246</Id><Topic><Title>Travon-like Fury seen Before...In #$%$ Germany !</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374275163526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:06:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shirley, you're jesting.</Msg><Username>spartaloon</Username><Timestamp>1374275771835</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:16:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374275809546-247</Id><Topic><Title>Barack Hussein Admin</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374272300494</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 18:18:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Follow them.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374275809546</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:16:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374275853339-248</Id><Topic><Title>Travon-like Fury seen Before...In #$%$ Germany !</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374275163526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:06:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>shirley you're spary</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374275853339</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:17:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374276154596-249</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks, Guys</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374239295274</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 09:08:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The progressive movement is awakening, growing, and the enthusiasm is there for explosive growth.

He kept complaining that a man was watching him,” she said, and he described his pursuer as a “creepy #$%$ cracker.” She said she told him he should run — and then the call dropped out. “I called him back. I asked him where he was,” she recounted. He told her that he was nearly back at this father’s fiancée’s house in Sanford. “I said, ‘Keep running!’ He said he lost him,” Jeantel said. A couple of seconds later, he said, ‘Oh, ^%$#! That *(^%$#s behind me!” She said she could hear Martin say, “Why are you following me for?” A “hard-breathing man” responded, “What are you doing around here?” she said. “Then I heard ... a gr#$%$ sound, And I heard Trayvon saying, ‘Get off!

Soft tyranny is an idea first coined by Alexis de Tocqueville in his 1835 work titled Democracy in America.[1] In effect, soft tyranny occurs whenever the social conditions of a particular community hinder any prospect of hope among its members.[2] For Tocqueville, hope is the driving force behind all democratic institutions.[3] As such, whenever this all-encompassing hope is taken away from the people, liberal democracy fails. Examples of this failure can be seen in the Weimar Republic of Germany during the 1930s, in the French Third Republic around 1940 or arguably throughout western democracies since the economic collapse of 2008.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374281975107</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 20:59:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374282385173-287</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty Board Fascist, err Moderator</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373555074326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 11:04:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>won't update topic page with latest greatest, less of course it's one of his</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374282385173</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 21:06:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374283131639-288</Id><Topic><Title>Travon-like Fury seen Before...In #$%$ Germany !</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374275163526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:06:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dem mullahs supported hitler as well, huh sparty. muslims know about slaves and slave trading, huh spart. they've been trading in human flesh since 600 AD, err muhammad...huh sparty before oil they traded slaves, they traded, shipped, and used more than any other nation or organization...some of em actually survived. oil hasn't changed things.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374283131639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 21:18:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374285281601-289</Id><Topic><Title>God bless Travon and his family</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1374187645122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:47:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rebuttal to BBs biased view.

But I listened to Zimmerman's 911 call which was recorded by the authorities. What Jeantel has to say is somewhat speculative since she is depending upon memory. And, to my original point, if you listen to Zimmerman's 911 call, you can tell he is "on the move" for only 17 seconds and ceases upon the admonition of the 911 operator - hardly chasing down Trayvon. And that is what I was pointing out - facts and data. Believe what you want. As you pointed out, the "judgment" will come eventually for Zimmerman, but it will not involve us or even Jeantel as witnesses. The Lord has a pretty good handle on these kind of things.
