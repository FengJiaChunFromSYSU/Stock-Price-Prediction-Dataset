The unions have managed to contribute a great deal towards corruption in Chicago and Illinois and they have been a force in taking us to the threshold of fiscal collapse. I really don't understand why people can support such corrupt organizations and why anyone would be against giving people a choice of not being coerced by corrupt people. I can only assume that such supporters are also stupid evil and corrupt.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355465423329</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 01:10:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355465688556-3</Id><Topic><Title>Susan Rice out of consideration for Secretary of State.</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1355435282668</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 16:48:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These are signs of people who loathe those that they rule over, and view them as useful idiots.

I've done alot of research and they are experiencing the effects of Moore's law which is good news for all Americans. The most exciting thing for me is the breakthrough in the USA whereby we have achieved the ability to print solar cells made of carbon onto thin film. This is a game changer that would give the US the ability to compete with China and India's which have much lower costs than current US solar companies. I can see R&amp;D money going to delelop the nano-stratified carbon design but subsidies given to current solar companies is just corporate welfare and spending tax dollars on technology with a horrible ROI.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355467294850</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 01:41:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355476680488-6</Id><Topic><Title>Phantypants (aka MBField)</Title><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1355433796519</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 16:23:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks Don.

See if you can outrun a bullet travelling 1050 to 1400 feet per second and see how far you get. Gun bans don't work. This occurred in a gun free zone. First off, with gun sales going through the roof, do you really think we are going to allow Obama or anyone to do an across the board ban and confiscation of guns? Criminals won't give them up and millions more of us will automatically become criminals. There will be massive civil disobedience. Ban crazy people, if you can! Stop letting them out of their cells to roam free with the rest of us. Hinkley doesn't deserve to roam around free, but they're thinking about it.

If 27 children were killed by bullets flying from one direction, how many would have been killed by bullets flying from all directions? The only real solution is to ban sale of testosterone-enhancing drugs and start amputating parts of the male anatomy. Short of that, maybe we could STOP SELLING GUNS TO WHACK JOBS.

So how does he explain the fact that incomes are up in RTW states while forced unionism is a proven job killer? Campaigning Monday in Michigan as it stood poised to become the nation's 24th right-to-work state, President Obama spoke the exact opposite of the truth to union workers at a Daimler Detroit Diesel plant in the birthplace of organized labor. "What we shouldn't be doing," he told the small crowd, "is trying to take away your rights to bargain for better wages. We don't want a race to the bottom. We want a race to the top." Yet looking at the hard numbers, becoming a right-to-work state is a direct line to the top. According to Michigan's Mackinac Center, using data taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics, private-sector, inflation-adjusted employee compensation in right-to-work states increased by 12% between 2001 and 2011 compared with just 3% over the same period in forced-unionization states. These good wages came from good jobs. Employment in right-to-work states expanded 2.4% over the same stretch vs. a 3.4% decline in non-right-to-work states. Ironically, Obama is taking credit for jobs created in RTW states. All Politics According to the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, right-to-work states (excluding Indiana, which passed a RTW law in early 2012) "were responsible for 72% of all net household job growth across the U.S. from June 2009 through September 2012." This is why people vote with their feet and move to these states. RTW states experienced large population gains of 15.3% from 2000 to 2010, compared to 5.9% in non-RTW states. Obama did get one thing right, though, when he said the bills that passed both houses of the Michigan legislature "don't have to do with economics. They have everything to do with politics." The president who fought Boeing's expansion in RTW South Carolina knows it's all about his keeping union dues flowing into Democratic coffers and maintaining the plush lifestyles of the union leaders who support him. Freeloading Michigan law will now bar requiring workers to pay money to a third party, namely unions, as a condition of employment. This has given rise to the big lie that workers who refuse to join a union and pay dues will get a "free ride" enjoying the benefits of union representation without contributing to that representation.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355517308259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 15:35:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355517397258-55</Id><Title>Obama's Big Michigan Right-To-Work Lie: Lower Wages</Title><Msg>The president says right-to-work laws mean "the right to work for less money."

The medical plan will no longer cover the family’s in-home care after Saturday (Dec. 22). Since Boeing self funds its employee medical plans, every penny the company does not pay out for medical services is another penny of corporate profit. “This is why we work so hard in negotiations to get details nailed down in the contract,” said Tom McCarty, SPEEA president. “Members shouldn’t have to worry that this could happen to them.” The SPEEA contract expired after being extended to Nov. 25. Talks are scheduled to resume Jan. 9. With members frustrated by Boeing’s push to cut raise pools, shift medical costs onto employees and eliminate the pension for future hires, the union is preparing for a possible strike. Three training sessions have already been held for potential picket captains. A fourth session is scheduled after the New Year. A strike by SPEEA would keep 15,550 engineers and 7,400 technical workers off the job and stop Boeing from delivering aircraft.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1355526096401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 18:01:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355526161010-99</Id><Topic><Title>Now here's a thought...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1355520990585</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 16:36:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is all my fault for encouraging you to think for yourself.

In the event of resistance they are to be shot immediately.” Nov. 10: “Nazis Smash, Loot and Burn Jewish Shops and Temples,” a headline read. “One of the first legal measures issued was an order by Heinrich Himmler, commander of all German police, forbidding Jews to possess any weapons whatever and imposing a penalty of twenty years confinement in a concentration camp upon every Jew found in possession of a weapon hereafter.”4 Thousands of Jews were taken away.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355533251205</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 20:00:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355533548102-116</Id><Topic><Title>"I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do," Obama</Title><Username>greedyoilbastards</Username><Timestamp>1355526679554</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 18:11:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Greedy - I asked you a question earlier in this thread - got an answer?</Msg><Username>oldbuck56</Username><Timestamp>1355533548102</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 20:05:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355533976848-117</Id><Topic><Title>HOORAY for the Second Amendment -- Again!</Title><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1355511843206</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 14:04:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was precisely BECAUSE we had a Charlton Heston that a Gestapo did not arise.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1355533976848</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 20:12:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355534038716-118</Id><Title>Mass Murder Explained by Psychology Today</Title><Msg>There are common motives in single victim murders. For male murderers these includes revenge, power, money and rage. For the female killer, love is usually the motive, whether it involves a child, boyfriend, husband, or an ex. For a single death, the murder is typically commited by someone who knows the victim. For the serial killer, the majority of victims are strangers. Also, the serial killer's motives, which are for multiple reasons, evolve throughout the series of crimes and often relate to a thrill (sexual or otherwise). This is similar to the thrill of the hunt and involves scouting for a victim, planning the attack, the stalk and eventually the killing. The mass murder motive on the other hand is very different. While they have their own perceived reasons for killing these rarely make logical sense. As for demographics, the mass murderer is typically a white male, a loner, has a college degree or some college, from a relatively stable background and from an upper-middle to middle class family. They often aspire to more than they can handle, then form a hatred and blame others if they fail. Also, they are much more likely to suffer from a mental illness, specifically some type of psychosis. The number one predictor of violence by far is alcohol and/or drug abuse. Severe mental illness in and of itself was not a predictor. A 1988 study in the Archives of General Psychiatry found that patients discharged from psychiatric facilities who did not abuse alcohol or illegal drugs had a rate of violence no different than that of their neighbors in the community. However, the study, Violence and Severe Mental Illness: The Effects of Substance Abuse and Nonadherence to Medication, found that when when a mentally ill individual was not medicated and abused either alcohol or drugs, there was a significant increase in serious and violent acts. So clearly, early psychiatric assessments, medication treatment and preventing substance abuse, will go a long way to preventing violence in general. As for gun control, the studies are all over the map. From anecdotal reports to definitive studies, from the NRA to the Brady Campaign, each side uses mass murder to further their cause. I won’t bother to give examples of the numerous reports, studies and opinions. However, the gun laws are relatively unchanged over the last few decades. Over this time period, some states have stricter gun laws while others have become more relaxed. Regardless of how you feel about gun control in general, there is no correlation between gun control strictness and mass murder.

As a patriotic American I understand that we do not live in a world that will ever be perfect. As someone that no longer owns a gun I still understand the need to own a handgun as a means for protection if a terrible situation should ever happen to me and my family. A criminal or criminals breaking into my home with the intention of robbery, rape, and brutal murders is the scariest thought I could ever imagine! God could never help us but a gun in my hand for self protection is the perfect equalizer in all instances. God can't save us but a gun will protect both me and my family from external violence! God Bless our trusty six-shooters! If a life has to be taken I pray it will not be mine but that of the perpetrator of violence!</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1355537676224</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 21:14:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355538225812-125</Id><Topic><Title>“The NRA is the enabler of mass murderers”</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1355531425388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 19:30:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like you RWNJs did with the tragedy in Bengahzi?</Msg><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1355538225812</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 21:23:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355538589420-126</Id><Topic><Title>Now here's a thought...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1355520990585</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 16:36:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I fully support the right for anyone to bear as many single shot muzzle loaders as they can actually carry at one time.

Boeing sez that they will not submit the V-22 because its capabilities exceed the parameters of the Air Force contest. This is the Lie of the century. Boeing sent this junker into Libya to pick up a downed pilot in a safe area as a staged event. Based on that alone they claimed it had proven itself. The craft does not do mountains external loads, water rescues, hot zones. Its only attribute is that it does do photo ops.

Who cares about the source of the information about the gun nut! We must make guns and bullets harder to get than medicine! This gotta stop! No words on Earth can explain the horror the parents of all the dead children that have been gunned down by a gun nut while in kindergarten must now feel! We need more sane gun regulations! Register every gun and have a policeman visit the gun owners home yearly and certify the gun owner as sane and sober etc. Make bullets more documented than prescription medicine. Require a tax stamp for every gun and box of bullets to pay for the new sane regulations.
