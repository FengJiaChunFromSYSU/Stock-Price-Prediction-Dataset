On Tuesday, six-term Sen. Max Baucus announced he will retire at the end of his term in 2014, rather than seek reelection in deep-red Montana. He is the sixth Democrat to announce his retirement this year, increasing the odds of a Republican take-over of the Senate. While Baucus faced a competitive race for reelection, he had amassed a $5 million campaign war-chest and hadn't yet been challenged by a top-tier GOP candidate. Baucus had even broken ranks with his party on gun control, suggesting to many observers that he was preparing for a reelection campaign. The most likely factor in his decision to retire is the looming implementation of ObamaCare. As Chair of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Baucus was a chief architect of Democrats' overhaul of the health care system. Baucus recently rued that ObamaCare is headed for a "huge train wreck."</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1366776691029</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 00:11:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366777483379-2</Id><Topic><Title>Where was Boeing's other hip joint, (AKA the UW) regarding the battery,</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1366771439720</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 22:43:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UW?</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1366777483379</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 00:24:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366777984671-3</Id><Topic><Title>Where is all that Free Healthcre Democrats Promised?</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1366759009337</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 19:16:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is a reasonably good article on the homepage about the insurance exchanges, how they work and about how much they cost. 26,000,000 Americans will be in line for some amount of tax credit for selecting from the exchange.

But threats of new regulations and bans, combined with the overwhelming power of the executive branch when it comes to gun control, are putting at risk the industry’s positive role in the economy. ... Overall, the combined size of the U.S. commercial gun and ammunition market totals around $32 billion in economic impact nationwide. According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), in 2011 alone, industry equipment expenditures hit $5.3 billion. Firearms make up $2.4 billion of that figure, while ammunition for rifles, handguns and shotguns totals $693,249,814. Other accessories like telescopic sights, decoys and game calls, handloading equipment, components, other hunting and shooting equipment, hunting dogs and associated costs make up the rest. Total spending by all hunters tops $24 billion each year. The majority of these items are purchased in sporting goods stores, specialty shops and pro-shops employing thousands. There are nearly 60,000 gun dealers in the U.S. The average salary of a gun industry worker is $140,000 per year, according to First Research. Nearly 100,000 people are employed directly by the industry while another 111,000 are employed indirectly.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1366807486968</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 08:44:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366807826404-16</Id><Title>69 Percent Want a Gun if a Terrorist is on the Run</Title><Msg>The other 31% are panty wearing liberals who wouldn't want to defend themselves or their families. 69 percent of people said they would want a gun if an accused terrorist was running around their neighborhood in an effort to avoid police.

Bill Gertz, a reporter long considered to have some of the best sources in the military/intelligence community, sets out what might well explain these failures: An FBI policy forbidding the linking of Islam and jihad created and enforced by Obama administration political appointees: U.S. officials familiar with the FBI’s counterterrorism training program and its controversial public outreach program to Muslim groups said FBI policy toward Islam—that it should not be used to describe those who seek to wage jihad or holy war against the United States and others they regard as infidels—has prevented both effective counterterrorism investigations and training. The officials said the problem is that most field agents understand the nature of the threat but have been hamstrung by policies imposed by senior FBI leaders who are acting under orders of political appointees in the Obama administration, including Islamic advisers to the White House. The policies have prevented the FBI from conducting aggressive counterterrorism investigations of Islamic radicals or those who are in the process of being radicalized.

State officials confirmed last night that Tsarnaev, slain in a raging gun battle with police last Friday, was receiving benefits along with his wife, Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, and their 3-year-old daughter. The state’s Executive Office of Health and Human Services said those benefits ended in 2012 when the couple stopped meeting income eligibility limits. Russell Tsarnaev’s attorney has claimed Katherine — who had converted to Islam — was working up to 80 hours a week as a home health aide while Tsarnaev stayed at home. In addition, both of Tsarnaev’s parents received benefits, and accused brother bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan were recipients through their parents when they were younger, according to the state.

The report also found that plenty of intelligence presaged the attack, but the White House and State Department — including the secretary at the time, Hillary Rodham Clinton — failed to heed the warnings. In the most damning conclusion, the report said Mr. Obama’s team lied about the attacks afterward, first by blaming mob violence spawned by an anti-Muslim video, and then wrongly saying it had misled the public because it was trying to protect an FBI investigation. “This progress report reveals a fundamental lack of understanding at the highest levels of the State Department as to the dangers presented in Benghazi, Libya, as well as a concerted attempt to insulate the Department of State from blame following the terrorist attacks,” the investigation concluded in its 46-page report. The Sept. 11 attacks on the consulate in Benghazi left four Americans dead, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The report said the White House was responsible for prohibiting the mention of terrorism, and the report said administration officials were trying to shield themselves from criticism that they had been too lax in security. “It is clear that the State Department expressed concerns — and was backed by the White House — that the information be removed to avoid criticism for ignoring the general threat environment in Benghazi,” the report said. The report said blame for lax security extended all the way to Mrs. Clinton.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1366810400614</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 09:33:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366810408596-28</Id><Topic><Title>Easy short</Title><Username>fracas_dan</Username><Timestamp>1366809187611</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 09:13:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I heard the same BS when it was 68,,,,,please short it some more</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1366810408596</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 09:33:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366810494410-29</Id><Topic><Title>Good morning shorts</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1366801361676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 07:02:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>omg !!! 4 bucks up</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1366810494410</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 09:34:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366811166253-30</Id><Title>Obama Admin Had Advance Warning On Electric Car Failure...</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON (AP) — Newly released documents show that the Obama administration was warned as early as 2010 that electric car maker Fisker Automotive Inc. was not meeting milestones set up for a half-billion dollar government loan, nearly a year before U.S. officials froze the loan after questions were raised about the company’s statements. An Energy Department official said in a June 2010 email that Fisker’s bid to draw on the federal loan may be jeopardized for failure to meet goals established by the Energy Department. Despite that warning, Fisker continued to receive money until June 2011, when the DOE halted further funding. The agency did so after Fisker presented new information that called into question whether key milestones — including launch of the company’s signature, $100,000 Karma hybrid — had been achieved, according to a credit report prepared by the Energy Department.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1366811166253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 09:46:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366812015508-31</Id><Topic><Title>Whe do Liberals hate the TEA Party so much?</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1366743222076</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 14:53:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obviously from reading the post of two ignorant LWNJ parrots - rockstar and zosima the TEA Party has far more credibility than these freedom hating dingbats.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1366812015508</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 10:00:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366812025942-32</Id><Title>Forget (board).

Boeing stock is up big on false report, the company lost 600 million last quarter on the 787 grounding.remember Boeing sets the bar low to beat it. all companies do that, this is a nice pop but boeing is not a buy and hold stock. Airbus has beat Boeing for over a decade as the number one player and the stock shows it too, for 3 years Airbus is up 187% but for Boeing shareholders who hold there is nothing there. Boeing went up on stock buyback , Airbus has allocated 15% stock buyback , but will not exercise it until or unless their new jet fails like the 787.airbus follows Boeing and makes a better product on Boeings back, smart of Airbus, let Boeing shareholders spend their money on R and D then slide in and cherry pick the best suppliers and go to China for their assembly, much cheaper than the USA . with Boeing going to Carolina , Airbus is going to Alabama so Airbus watches Boeing and makes better deals that is why the stock price for Airbus is up 127% for 5 years and Boeing is up only 10% after todays pop.

How about Boeing, Boeing, bawn? That doesn't make sense in English, but it sure hits the nail on the head with the once loyal, Washington-state born, bred and based Boeing Company. Every sign points toward Boeing's departure from our state. I never thought I would see this day. When I first visited Seattle for the World's Fair in 1962, Boeing was the gem in the emerald crown, putting out 707's for all the airlines in the world. I watched on TV back home in Connecticut when the massively spectacular Boeing 747 was rolled out of the Everett assembly building. Returning to Washington in 1973, I drove past Boeing Field and knew that Seattle (and Everett and Renton) would never go the way of Detroit and its cars. Boeing just had too much invested in plant, equipment, experience, skilled machinists and engineers, to pull out of town. It was embedded into our economy, our politics, and our culture. It made us proud. It was a great corporate citizen. I didn't foresee that day in 1997 with Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas and McDonnell top brass started to call the shots. Or Boeing farming out production to off-shore sites. Or Boeing moving its headquarters to Chicago. Or Boeing making its home state of Washington bend over backwards in a bidding war to build the 787.</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1366841341213</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 18:09:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366841416816-95</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's terrorist friendly policy has got to be reported.

A Superfund site. Here rocket fuel chemicals were disposed of where ever the laws of gravity took it. Mono-methyl Hydrazine, the primary chemical and low level radiation. Its well established in the ground water. Boeing has covered the area and donated it as a park. how nice. Where previous officials refused the program, there was suddenly acceptance from judges on down, to council members. (wonder how much graft was corruption was paid?) In any case Boeing and chemicals and corruption are a bundled package.</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1366860617830</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 23:30:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
