But that requires believing that your opponent will never use them, no matter what. And the only way to do that, short of removing them from the planet entirely, is for everyone to just agree in advance to never use them and to really mean it. That becomes much harder if the norm is weakened because someone like Assad got away with it. It becomes a bit easier if everyone believes using chemical weapons will cost you a few inbound U.S. cruise missiles. That’s why the Obama administration apparently wants to fire cruise missiles at Syria, even though it won’t end the suffering, end the war or even really hurt Assad that much.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1378077717132</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-01 19:21:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378077760238-30</Id><Topic><Title>Evcerot part 3 last</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1378077717132</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-01 19:21:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I must have become tired of typing "Excerpt"</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1378077760238</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-01 19:22:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378079069991-31</Id><Topic><Title>Kerry on war crimes then . . .</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378076733578</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-01 19:05:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why did I know you would try to rationalize Kerry,s hypocrisy?....let me know when Kerry comes up with the proof Assad gassed his own people</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378079069991</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-01 19:44:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378079586532-32</Id><Title>King Obama Wants To Do Stuff Without Congress Yet,</Title><Msg>All of a sudden congress is needed to help with Syrian situation.
