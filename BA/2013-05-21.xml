" Well, since you brought it up, it was a challenge thrown down by dell.george on 3/7/11, so are you him? I'm shocked! But I did a quick check as of today, dell's (your's??) 10 stocks are up an average of 9.545 percent while BA is up 39.27 percent. So, dell's stocks are up $9545 and BA is up $39,270 for an advantage of $29,725 for BA on a bankroll of $100,000. For a refresher of Dell's postings on 3/7/2011: "every stock I compared with Boeing will beat Boeing going forward" "so when and if you can prove me wrong go for it" " If you do not wone(sic) them ok that is your decisions what is your comeback" "because tomorrow and all the following days I will be comparing BA to my stock picks already listed over the past few days" "I just put my reputation on the line all the stocks I compared with Boeing will beat Boeing going forward" I especially like that last one. So dell eventually spun his posting (several weeks later) that he meant to write that some of those 10 stocks would be shorted, but I'll leave it for the board to decipher if "going forward" means shorting, especially since some of them have actually gone up ove the last 2+ years.</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1369120740152</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 03:19:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369128386248-6</Id><Topic><Title>No Matter How Much You Shake, Kick, and Dance!!!</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369094634580</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 20:03:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound like a g@y not-see.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1369128386248</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 05:26:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369128504875-7</Id><Topic><Title>New poll reveals half of Americans wants Obama impeached</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369012709636</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 21:18:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did both of your brain cells collaborate to come up with that post?</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1369128504875</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 05:28:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369131260003-8</Id><Title>Heard the Aussie's to buy 12 F-18 Growlers</Title><Msg>Plane seems to be needed in the new world of electronic warfare.

It is far more "Kool" and "trendy" to think about celebrity gossp...Preparedness in Oklahoma City might have saved over 90 lives....Why weren't storm shelters built...storm shelters save 100 percent of the people who use them when tornadoes hit. While it is true that you ant take RISK out of the equation of life (even though the gun grabbers will tell you taking guns from law abiding citizens will stop crime) , Investing in a storm shelter, however, requires forethought. It requires long-term planning, and the culture of America has radically shifted away from long-term planning to short-term thinking. This is evident in our national debt spending, national politics, consumer behavior, education system and everything else. Housing companies that build homes in Oklahoma, Kansas, Northern Texas and other “tornado alley” zones don’t even offer storm shelters. Most home buyers don’t want storm shelters because they aren’t long-term thinkers. But consider the facts: If you live in Oklahoma, you have to realize the area is going to be struck by devastating tornados sooner or later. People who buy homes in pine tree forests, similarly, would be insane to believe that forest won’t one day burn up all around them. (All forests burn sooner or later.) People who live in Los Angeles have to be aware they’re living in an earthquake zone, and folks who have homes in Florida must certainly realize they are sooner or later going to get hit with category 5 hurricanes.

A SCYTL company news release boasted that its “electronic pollbook solution recently achieved a significant milestone by eclipsing the 100th implementation in the United States.” “This number continues to grow with many jurisdictions planning to implement electronic pollbook technology ahead of the 2014 election cycle,” continued the release. The electronic pollbook reportedly allows U.S. election officials and poll workers to manage the electoral roll on Election Day in an efficient and convenient manner. Project Vote noted that in 2008, the Florida Department of State commissioned a review of SCYTL’s remote voting software and concluded in part that: •The system is vulnerable to attack from insiders. •In a worst case scenario, the software could lead to 1) voters being unable to cast votes; 2) an election that does not accurately reflect the will of the voters; and 3) possible disclosure of confidential information, such as the votes cast by individual voters. •The system may be subject to attacks that could compromise the integrity of the votes cast. Voting through Google, Apple? As WND reported in May 2012 the company announced the successful implementation of technology that allows ballots to be cast using Google and Apple smart phones and tablet computers. SCYTL unveiled a platform that it says encrypts each individual ballot on a voter’s Google or Apple mobile device before the ballot is then transmitted to an electronic voting system.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369136095846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 07:34:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369137745770-14</Id><Title>The War on terror is meant to go on forever</Title><Msg>Asked at a Senate hearing today how long the war on terrorism will last, Michael Sheehan, the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, answered, 'At least 10 to 20 years.' . . . A spokeswoman, Army Col. Anne Edgecomb, clarified that Sheehan meant the conflict is likely to last 10 to 20 more years from today - atop the 12 years that the conflict has already lasted. Welcome to America's Thirty Years War." That the Obama administration is now repeatedly declaring that the "war on terror" will last at least another decade (or two) is vastly more significant than all three of this week's big media controversies (Benghazi, IRS, and AP/DOJ) combined. The military historian Andrew Bacevich has spent years warning that US policy planners have adopted an explicit doctrine of "endless war". Obama officials, despite repeatedly boasting that they have delivered permanently crippling blows to al-Qaida, are now, as clearly as the English language permits, openly declaring this to be so. It is hard to resist the conclusion that this war has no purpose other than its own eternal perpetuation. This war is not a means to any end but rather is the end in itself. Not only is it the end itself, but it is also its own fuel: it is precisely this endless war - justified in the name of stopping the threat of terrorism - that is the single greatest cause of that threat. In January, former Pentagon general counsel Jeh Johnson delivered a highly-touted speech suggesting that the war on terror will eventually end; he advocated that outcome, arguing: 'War' must be regarded as a finite, extraordinary and unnatural state of affairs. We must not accept the current conflict, and all that it entails, as the 'new normal.'" In response, I wrote that the "war on terror" cannot and will not end on its own for two reasons: (1) it is designed by its very terms to be permanent, incapable of ending, since the war itself ironically ensures that there will never co</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369137745770</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 08:02:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369137864122-15</Id><Topic><Title>The War on terror is meant to go on forever</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369137745770</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 08:02:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>come a time when people stop wanting to bring violence back to the US (the operational definition of "terrorism"), and (2) the nation's most powerful political and economic factions reap a bonanza of benefits from its continuation. Whatever else is true, it is now beyond doubt that ending this war is the last thing on the mind of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner and those who work at the highest levels of his administration. Is there any way they can make that clearer beyond declaring that it will continue for "at least" another 10-20 years? The genius of America's endless war machine is that, learning from the unplesantness of the Vietnam war protests, it has rendered the costs of war largely invisible. That is accomplished by heaping all of the fighting burden on a tiny and mostly economically marginalized faction of the population, by using sterile, mechanized instruments to deliver the violence, and by suppressing any real discussion in establishment media circles of America's innocent victims and the worldwide anti-American rage that generates. Though rarely visible, the costs are nonetheless gargantuan. Just in financial terms, as Americans are told they must sacrifice Social Security and Medicare benefits and place their children in a crumbling educational system, the Pentagon remains the world's largest employer and continues to militarily outspend the rest of the world by a significant margin. The mythology of the Reagan presidency is that he induced the collapse of the Soviet Union by luring it into unsustainable military spending and wars: should there come a point when we think about applying that lesson to ourselves? Then there are the threats to Americans' security.

This heavy-handed business isn’t chilling, it’s just plain cold. It also may well be unconstitutional. In my reading, the First Amendment prohibition against “abridging the freedom . . . of the press” should rule out secretly obtaining two months’ worth of the personal and professional phone records of Associated Press reporters and editors, including calls to and from the main AP phone number at the House press gallery in the Capitol.

These whistleblowers, colleagues of the former diplomats, are currently securing legal counsel because they work in areas not fully protected by the Whistleblower law. According to the diplomats, what these whistleblowers will say will be at least as explosive as what we have already learned about the scandal, including details about what really transpired in Benghazi that are potentially devastating to both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The former diplomats inform PJM the new revelations concentrate in two areas — what Ambassador Chris Stevens was actually doing in Benghazi and the pressure put on General Carter Ham, then in command of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) and therefore responsible for Libya, not to act to protect jeopardized U.S. personnel. Stevens’ mission in Benghazi, they will say, was to buy back Stinger missiles from al-Qaeda groups issued to them by the State Department, not by the CIA. Such a mission would usually be a CIA effort, but the intelligence agency had opposed the idea because of the high risk involved in arming “insurgents” with powerful weapons that endanger civilian aircraft. Hillary Clinton still wanted to proceed because, in part, as one of the diplomats said, she wanted “to overthrow Gaddafi on the cheap.”</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1369141931317</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 09:12:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369142908867-21</Id><Title>JASO up 14% in pre market at 1.6 million shares , how is Boeing doing 3500 shares and zip up</Title><Msg>if you follow my rules the TSLA trade rule previously published for beginners you should know what to do today right. next JASO made me 74% yesterday and is up 15% in premarket at the open that is a gain of 89% so I can sell or watch I have wood in the stock . and while traders make money the Boeing hacks and the trolls develop their gibberish skills go troll, a troll is is someone who posts inflammatory extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community, such as a forum, chat room, or blog, with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369142908867</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 09:28:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369143181603-22</Id><Title>FOX News Still # 1, MSNBC Still has a half dozen viewers</Title><Msg>Related: Fox News Tops 2012 Cable News Network Ratings; MSNBC Up Last week’s total day results were down 17% in viewers and 22% among the demo from the comparable May 14 to May 18 week of last year.

Authorities last week made an agreement not to prosecute a Northwest D.C. man who used his unregistered handgun to kill a pit bull in order to stop it from mauling a child in his neighborhood. As part of the agreement, Benjamin Srigley, 39, was required to pay a $1,000 fine but will not have criminal charges filed against him for the three unregistered firearms and the ammunition that investigators found in his possession, said Ted Gest, a spokesman for the office of the attorney general. “We took it into account that he saved this boy’s life,” Mr. Gest said. Possession of an unregistered firearm or ammunition in the District is punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine, and prosecutors said Mr. Srigley could have faced up to seven criminal charges in the case. “In our recent memory this is a unique charge because of the unusual circumstances of this case,” said Mr. Gest, whose office generally prosecutes low-level crime in the District.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1369150979246</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 11:42:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369152098603-33</Id><Title>IT'S BAD ENOUGH WE GOT WAYNEDICK.FEB....</Title><Msg>What the hell is politics doing in ba boards..can't yahoo do anything?

Remember, we made available to you, if you wanted to go to the Heritage Foundation website the other day earlier this week, they were giving you the report free. The website is Heritage.org. You go there, get the whole thing downloaded, the five-page summary was really pretty much what you needed to read, it was detailed. The summary was just powerful. It talked about $6.3 trillion of net cost. Well, all kinds of people, predictably from the Democrat Party but some of the Republican Party are coming out to discredit the whole thing, discredit the scholarship, the math. One of the criticisms is those guys at Heritage, they analyzed this in a static way. They didn't calculate any of the dynamics. What they mean by that is, oh wait a minute, yeah, some of these new arrivals may have ended up on the welfare rolls, but some of them are paying taxes, too, and that's gonna wash out whatever benefits they get. That's the theory. But that doesn't quite wash. But anyway, that's just what's out there. But anyway, USA Today, a story here by Alan Gomez, one of the authors of a Heritage Foundation report that panned the Senate plan to overhaul immigration argued in his doctoral dissertation that immigrants generally have lower IQs than the native white population of the United States. Uh oh oh... You see now the long knives are out for anybody at Heritage who had anything to do with this. Jason Richwine who received his doctorate in public policy from Harvard in 2009, joined Heritage, it says here, "the conservative Heritage Foundation</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369155455404</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 12:57:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369155718665-67</Id><Topic><Title>Chinook is Boeing’s longest continuously running production program</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1368878651638</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 08:04:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>9/11 was very very good for BA, GE, NOC, LMT, RTN, GD.

Over all, Apple’s tax avoidance efforts shifted at least $74 billion from the reach of the Internal Revenue Service between 2009 and 2012, the investigators said. That cash remains offshore, but Apple, which paid more than $6 billion in taxes in the United States last year on its American operations, could still have to pay federal taxes on it if the company were to return the money to its coffers in the United States. Sen. Rand Paul, who is not the chair or ranking member of this morning's committee, offered an unconventional opening statement for the record.

As you'll recall, the revelation came in the form of IRS official Lois Lerner's response to a question asked at a public Q&amp;A session with the American Bar Association. National Review's Kevin Williamson quickly surmised that the question itself may have been coordinated in advance to give the appearance of an "unplanned," and therefore forthright, public mea culpa. His suspicions were confirmed by acting IRS commissioner Stephen Miller during last week's House hearings. The source of the supposedly impromptu question has since copped to her role in the scheme as well. But what remained unresolved, though, was the issue of who dreamed up the secretive plan.

They warn that unless there are changes, the results could be catastrophic. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) — a 1.3 million-member labor group that twice endorsed Obama for president — is very worried about how the reform law will affect its members’ healthcare plans. Last month, the president of the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers released a statement calling “for repeal or complete reform of the Affordable Care Act.” UNITE HERE, a prominent hotel workers’ union, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters are also pushing for changes. In a new op-ed published in The Hill, UFCW President Joe Hansen homed in on the president’s speech at the 2009 AFL-CIO convention. Obama at the time said union members could keep their insurance under the law, but Hansen writes “that the president’s statement to labor in 2009 is simply not true for millions of workers.” Repeal? I thought it was only those crazy Tea Party reps in the House who wanted repeal? Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is starting to feel the heat feel for her extortion of private companies in order to fund ObamaCare.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1369162390750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 14:53:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369162535672-114</Id><Title>I'm Certainly Glad Christians Preach Tolerance</Title><Msg>Westboro Baptist Church Blames Oklahoma Tornado On Jason Collins' Coming Out A prominent member of the Westboro Baptist Church is drawing a link between the Oklahoma tornado's devastation and a local team's support for openly gay NBA star Jason Collins. Fred Phelps Jr., the son of Westboro Baptist Church minister Fred Phelps, tweeted the following: "OK Thunder's Durant flips God by praising #$%$ Collins. God smashes OK. You do the math." It isn't the first time that an anti-gay pundit has attempted to blame a natural disaster to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. In 2012, chaplain John McTernan linked Hurricane Sandy (and a number of other recent weather-related trends and natural disasters) on LGBT people and President Barack Obama's backing of marriage equality. "God is systematically destroying America," McTernan wrote at the time. "Just look at what has happened this year." McTernan similarly linked Hurricane Isaac with the LGBT community, pointing to the fact that the life-threatening storm coincided with Southern Decadence, New Orleans' "Gay Mardi Gras." "New Orleans is still hosting Southern Decadence with open homosexuality manifesting in the streets of the city," he wrote in a blog. "It could be that God is putting an end to this city and its wickedness."</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369162535672</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 14:55:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369162865781-115</Id><Topic><Title>Profiling Is Great ...

So, dell's stocks are up $9545 and BA is up $39,270 for an advantage of $29,725 for BA on a bankroll of $100,000. For a refresher of Dell's postings on 3/7/2011: "every stock I compared with Boeing will beat Boeing going forward" "so when and if you can prove me wrong go for it" " If you do not wone(sic) them ok that is your decisions what is your comeback" "because tomorrow and all the following days I will be comparing BA to my stock picks already listed over the past few days" "I just put my reputation on the line all the stocks I compared with Boeing will beat Boeing going forward" I especially like that last one. So dell eventually spun his posting (several weeks later) that he meant to write that some of those 10 stocks would be shorted, but I'll leave it for the board to decipher if "going forward" means shorting, especially since some of them have actually gone up over the last 2+ years.</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1369163345620</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 15:09:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369163503167-118</Id><Topic><Title>I'm Certainly Glad Christians Preach Tolerance</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369162535672</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 14:55:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yet liberals demand tolerance from and enact social engineering laws upon people whose moral and religious convictions are being violated.</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1369163503167</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 15:11:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369163600392-119</Id><Title>Fox News says Fred Phelps’ hate group is “left wing”</Title><Msg>When’s the last time you met a gay-hating, Obama-hating (they think he’s literally the anti-Christ), Mus lim-hating, Catholic-hating (conservative Baptists think Catholics worship Satan) evangelical Baptist church that was full of Democrats?

The DDT ban was responsible for the loss of "tens of millions of human lives — mostly children in poor, tropical countries — have been traded for the possibility of slightly improved fertility in raptors (birds). This remains one of the monumental human tragedies of the last century." DDT presents no harm to humans and, when used properly, poses no environmental threat. In 1970, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences wrote: "To only a few chemicals does man owe as great a debt as to DDT. ... In a little more than two decades, DDT has prevented 500 million human deaths, due to malaria, that otherwise would have been inevitable." Prior to the DDT ban, malaria was on the verge of extinction in some countries. The World Health Organization estimates that malaria infects at least 200 million people, of which more than a half-million die, each year. Most malaria victims are African children. People who support the DDT ban are complicit in the deaths of tens of millions of Africans and Southeast Asians. Philanthropist Bill Gates is raising money for millions of mosquito nets, but to keep his environmentalist credentials, the last thing that he'd advocate is DDT use. Remarkably, black congressmen share his vision. Wackoism didn't end with Carson's death. Dr. Paul Ehrlich, Stanford University biologist, in his 1968 best-selling book, "The Population Bomb," predicted major food shortages in the United States and that "in the 1970s ... hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death." Ehrlich saw England in more desperate straits, saying, "If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000." On the first Earth Day, in 1970, Ehrlich warned: "In ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish." Ehrlich continues to be a media and academic favorite. Then there are governmental wacko teachings. In 1914, the U.S. Bureau of Mines predicted our oil reserves would last 10 years. In 1939, the U.S. Department of the Interior revised the estimate, saying that American oil would last 13 years. In 1972, the Club of Rome's report "Limits to Growth" said total world oil reserves totaled 550 billion barrels. With that report in hand, then-President Jimmy Carter said, "We could use up all proven reserves of oil in the entire world by the end of the next decade." He added, "The oil and natural gas we rely on for 75 percent of our energy are running out." As for Carter's running-out-of-oil prediction, a recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and private industry experts estimate that if even half of the oil bound up in the Green River formation in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado is recovered, it would be "equal to the entire world's proven oil reserves." That's an estimated 3 trillion barrels, more than what OPEC has in reserve. Fret not. Carter, like Ehrlich, is still brought before the media for his opinion. Our continued acceptance of environmentalist manipulation, lies and fear-mongering has led Congress to establish deadly public policies in the name of saving energy — such as Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which downsize autos and cause unnecessary highway fatalities. That's on top of the stupid 1970s 55 mph laws. The next time an environmentalist warns us of a pending disaster or that we are running out of something, we ought to ask: When was the last time a prediction of yours was right? Some people are inclined to call these people idiots. That's wrong. They have been successful in their agenda. It's we who are the idiots for listening to them and allowing Congress to let them have their way.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1369164266943</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 15:24:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369164387333-127</Id><Title>Republicans take Oklahoma Hostage !!</Title><Msg>Republican toads demand spending cuts while Americans mourn the devastating tornado in Oklahoma...</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369164387333</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 15:26:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369164713809-128</Id><Topic><Title>Profiling Is Great ...

The president decried "voices" warning "that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner." It's no longer lurking. It's here. Testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee by the outgoing acting IRS commissioner, Steve Miller, as well as numerous statements by individuals claiming they have been harassed and intimidated by IRS agents, reveal a government agency out of control, or more precisely, under the control of political hacks. It's doubtful this was a freelance operation. J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, testified he knew as early as June 2012 that the IRS was targeting conservatives, but did nothing to stop it during the presidential campaign. Who else knew? The delay in tax exemption approval prevented some conservative groups from donating money to the Romney campaign or to groups supporting his candidacy. The IRS even asked one Tea Party group in Richmond to identify all of their financial donors and volunteers. There is a simple way to restrain the IRS so this type of intrusion doesn't happen again: get rid of it. That's what Steve Forbes proposed in his run for president in 1996 and 2000. So did former presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas). Forbes proposed a flat tax of 17 percent and a simple tax code. Individuals could file their tax returns on a post card. "In the late 1800s, when Congress first attempted to impose an income tax, the notion of taxing a citizen's hard work was considered radical," Paul wrote in 2001. "Public outcry ensued; more importantly, the Supreme Court ruled the income tax unconstitutional. Only with passage of the 16th Amendment did Congress gain the ability to tax the productive endeavors of its citizens." And tax it did. And waste it did.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1369165071937</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 15:37:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369165102165-130</Id><Topic><Title>Profiling Is Great ...

Such is life in the United States of America under Barack Obama in 2013. Dr. Anne Hendershott, a Conservative Roman Catholic, sociologist, and author, found that out the hard way. Dr. Hendershott apparently has a problem with the federal government telling Roman Catholics how to practice Roman Catholicism - so she wrote about it. The Blaze reported that after publishing a number of articles critical of Obama, Obamacare in particular, and George Soros, the IRS called her up and demanded to know who was paying her and "what their politics were." Oh, but it gets better. If you're interested in starting a Tea Party, the IRS wants to join! Central Texas 912 President Maria Acosta was instructed to provide login information to their group's website, and the Richmond Tea Party was told to provide webpages "that are accessible only to your members." Yes, you read that correctly. And no, we're not in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union collapsed some years ago. This is something entirely new. This is Hope &amp; Change. In the case of Dr. Hendershott, her brush with our friendly Internal Revenue Agents was upsetting enough that she stopped her critical writings altogether. War on Conservative Women: Mission Accomplished. It's a good thing that Dr. Henderschott's middle name wasn't Tea Party or Constitution or Patriot or she might have been audited twice. It is difficult to overstate just exactly how un-American these IRS activities are - not allegations, mind you, but activities to which the IRS has already admitted. By targeting individual Conservative dissidents, the IRS effectively trampled all of our First Amendment rights - and by targeting Tea Party organizations, the IRS has done nothing short of voter suppression. American Citizens ought to be able to freely associate with one another, organize, and educate their fellow Citizens about our Constitution without having to fill out a single tax form, much less a 90 item questionnaire. If your goal is to prevent people from coalescing around a set of ideas and spreading those ideas during an election cycle, one way to stop them is to saddle them with paperwork and deny them the ability to raise money to get their message out - this is precisely what the IRS did and it amounts to a subversion of the electoral process, plain and simple.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1369166371144</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 15:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369166587310-136</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats: The Party of Baby Killing, Death Panelas and Deadly Decrees</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1369164266943</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 15:24:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ehlich is a moron and I often tweet to him to remind him of what an incompetent idiot he was in his predictions.

And just think - we have very recently, through a tortured version of the democratic process, just conferred even more power upon the IRS. Now this arm of the Executive Branch, a service, mind you, in case you've forgotten, will be lording over our health care as well - and, in a dramatic twist that is as horrifying as it is dumfounding, the person in charge of the IRS division that targeted Obama's political opponents, Sarah Hall Ingram, is now in charge of the IRS division enforcing Obamacare! Now that we've passed Obamacare, we get to find out what's in it. Here's what's in it: don't criticize your government, or you might just be subjected to a lengthy and intrusive questionnaire before you're assigned a doctor. Need Chemotherapy? Give us your email password. Need your hypertension meds? Tell us what books you've been reading. Liberty! The abuses which have recently come to light are exactly the kinds of big government intrusion that the Tea Party tried to warn all of us about, which is exactly why the Obama administration did everything it could, short of murdering Tea Party leaders, to silence it. It didn't work out for them, and now the rest of the country is thankfully catching on - everybody except for Julian Bond, of course, former chairman of the NAACP. When recently asked if the IRS had overstepped its bounds by subjecting Tea Party groups to such scrutiny, he said no, explaining it was "entirely legitimate." When asked if the scandal might revive the Tea Party movement, he responded, "I hope not...they're the Taliban wing of American politics." Got that, Tea Partiers? Julian Bond, alleged Civil Rights leader, is happy to hear the government has, in the words of Our Declaration of Independence, "sent hither swarms of Officers to harass" you. Why? Because Julian Bond is somehow under the impression that when you're not advocating on behalf of limited government, liberty, and fiscal sanity, you're busy mutilating newborn baby girls, hanging homosexuals, and crushing in the heads of young women who wear jeans or want to go to school or disagree with their husbands.

Citing a Tuesday poll from the Washington Post showing that President Obama’s approval on the economy is at 48 percent, up from 44 percent in April, Silver writes: “The economic mood may have been lifted by two highly visible indicators — record-breaking stock prices and rebounding housing prices — along with a series of improved jobs reports.” From the Times: Based on the historical relationship between Mr. Obama’a overall and economic approval ratings in the poll, you’d predict that his overall approval rating would be 53 or 54 percent given an economic approval rating of 48 percent. Instead, it’s 51 percent. So it may be that the talk surrounding Benghazi, the IRS and the Justice Department has negatively affected Mr. Obama’s approval rating by two or three percentage points, but that the economy has lifted his numbers by about the same amount.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369174653098</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 18:17:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369174697083-173</Id><Topic><Title>Hey, Everybody!</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369167578342</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 16:19:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wasn't I "Hooz" Chi Minh?</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369174697083</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 18:18:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369174978939-174</Id><Title>Here come the tornado truthers.

Matters such as this will probably come before the Supreme Court before long. Freedom of religion does not include the right to force your beliefs onto others, which is what they try to do. The first amendment says laws will not be enacted to establish a national religion, nor will a test be given to anyone running for office regarding their religion.

It caused 285 total fatalities and was the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. During the immediate aftermath of this act of Nature, these 2 dimwits were among many who decided to use the disaster as a political platform. They voted against a full FEMA / Army Corp of Engineer reconstruction, and repeatedly delayed votes to fund any for of rescue. The claim that the rescue bill was any more pork laden than anything else that comes out of the sewer that is Washington D.C. was specious at best. Do a search for “Hurricane Sandy Pork” — what comes up are the same wingnut articles repeated over and over in various partisan outlets. Media Matters noted in January that claims of money for “climate change for the EPA” was actually money for wastewater treatment in damaged areas (Fox News’ Bogus Hunt For Pork In Sandy Bill Continues). Even Forbes called foul — they noted that the “pork” came from having to bribe red state Republicans — including Texas — in order to get the package passed over their filibuster” (Pork Holding Up Senate Sandy Relief Bill Funneled Into The Troughs Of GOP Deficit Hawks? You Betcha). The hypocrisy reached a point of such absurdity that the Republican Governor of New Jersey, a Conservative favorite, went postal against the GOP House members as well as these two Oklahoma Senators. Which brings me to the recent tragedy in Oklahoma: Now that the disaster is on the other foot, the Oklahoma Senators/deficit hawks are claiming Tornado aid ‘totally different’ from Hurricane Sandy aid. Want to know how its different? A big chunk of the Sandy emergency package replenished FEMA, which had been underfunded by the usual suspects. The Sandy relief package replenished its coffers. The votes in favor of Sandy Aid ironically funded FEMA, and it is helping with the rescue and clean up efforts in Oklahoma. I would suggest that the entire NY/NJ/CT Congressional Delegation, regardless of party, as well as Governors Christie, Cuomo, and Malloy should demand an apology from Senators Inhofe and Coburn. These two geniuses were voting against funding an agency that is now helping out their electorate.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369177800407</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 19:10:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369178130110-182</Id><Topic><Title>Here come the tornado truthers.

They're a fishing expedition to stop his agenda and find something bigger By Steve Almond It is always disheartening when Bob Woodward shows up on our televisions. As a dashing young investigative reporter at the Washington Post, Woodward was part of an intrepid team whose reporting revealed that President Richard Nixon had personally directed a cover-up of crimes that were paid for by his reelection committee and executed against his political enemies. Watching the Woodward of today pimp his personal brand on cable TV — call it innuendo with gravitas — is something like seeing a former Hall of Famer dispense motivational tips at a business seminar in Topeka. And yet no event is more emblematic of our historical moment than Woodward’s appearance last week on Morning Joe, an MSNBC program devoted to the promotion of overpriced coffee, with a side dish of political hype. Asked about the various “scandals” confronting the Obama administration, Woodward dutifully hit his mark. “I know there have been these comparisons to Watergate,” he told host Joe Scarborough. “I would say not yet, Joe … You’ve got to investigate all of these things.” Perhaps fearing he had come off as too reasonable for the pundit circuit, he then reversed course, averring that the administration’s response to the murder of four Americans by Islamic extremists at the embassy in Benghazi, Libya, might already warrant comparisons with Watergate. “If you read through all these emails, you see that everyone in the government is saying, ‘Oh, let’s not tell the public that terrorists were involved, people connected to al-Qaida. Let’s not tell the public that there were warnings,’” he said. “And I have to go back 40 years to Watergate when Nixon put out his edited transcripts to the conversations, and he personally went through them and said, ‘Oh, let’s not tell this, let’s not show this.’ I would not dismiss Benghazi. It’s a very serious issue.” You got that, viewer? The confused squabbling undertaken by bureaucrats in the foggy hours after a chaotic overseas tragedy is just like a sitting president orchestrating a months-long campaign of deception to hide criminal activities undertaken by his reelection committee. Of course, with or without Woodward’s imprimatur, our media class routinely affixes the suffix “gate” to any controversial story involving President Obama. In the fervent paranoid laboratories of the right-wing media universe, a Marine holding an umbrella for the president so he doesn’t get rained on receives tabloid treatment as Umbrellagate. And thus, naturally, the news that IRS bureaucrats scrutinized the applications of Tea Party groups applying for tax-exempt status as “social welfare organizations” becomes IRSgate. And the administration’s allegedly overzealous efforts to surveil reporters who receive leaked classified information becomes Leakgate. The irony hovering below all this nonsense is that the media is using the wrong historical referent. The “scandals” confronting President Obama are derived almost entirely from the political and media mindset that gave us Whitewater. That is to say, they are minor instances of bureaucratic incompetence and/or executive overreach that are seized upon by hysterical right-wing media and politicians and eventually aggrandized by their craven mainstream brethren into red-alert-Chryon, full-scale Media Narratives. The engine of belief that drives these stories is that, with enough rooting around by reporters and congressional panels and special prosecutors, the president eventually will be implicated in some kind of Major Impropriety. This is what allows otherwise self-respecting journalists to flog stories that are, by all rational standards, partisan boondoggles. Travelgate begets Filegate, which begets Troopergate, which begets … Lewinsky. This is the beauty of the scandal mentality: It’s inherently speculative. And it is thus nourished not by an accretion of increasingly damning facts, as in Watergate, but by a daisy chain of lurid conjecture and tangential inquisitions. To quote the sage, “You’ve got to investigate all these things.” To put it plainly, Watergate was a foxhunt; Whitewater was a fishing trip. The enduring lesson of Whitewater is that fishing trips can serve as an effective means of political opposition, particularly in the absence of a coherent governing agenda. The recent controversies that have dogged Obama will, in all likelihood, amount to very little as legal or moral events. Nonetheless, they are already serving their intended function, as an ad hoc campaign of distraction that has pushed the president’s agenda off the front page and provides congressional Republicans safe cover for opposing his more popular measures, or for simply refusing to perform any meaningful legislative function. Forget gun-control measures. Forget immigration reform. Forget job creation. Forget a grand bargain. And don’t even think about carbon emissions. For the foreseeable future, the front pages will be devoted to Fishing Trips. Of course, back in the 1990s, it was possible for Clinton to get some things done in his second term, even after his impeachment by the House, thanks to his ability to triangulate with Republican leaders. Obama will enjoy no such latitude. Congressional redistricting has left GOP lawmakers with no motive to seek compromise, while the rise of extreme candidates willing to run against moderates in primaries has made them desperate to kowtow to their base. The media landscape has shifted, as well. Politics has become a lucrative and around-the-clock form of entertainment. This and the steady proliferation of corporate-funded conservative media outlets whose sole purpose is to smear the president — what Hillary Clinton once quaintly referred to as “a vast right-wing conspiracy” — has led to massive scandal inflation. Don’t believe me? Consider this thought experiment, particularly in light of how much cultural oxygen has been devoted to the four Americans killed in Benghazi. Imagine that Barack Obama had been president when a terrorist attack masterminded by Osama bin Laden killed more than 3,000 Americans on our soil, and that, just 36 day earlier, he had received a daily briefing from the CIA entitled “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.” Or imagine that Obama launched a military invasion based on faulty intelligence. Or that his administration was found to have secretly approved wiretapping of American citizens. You get the point. This is not to suggest that the Obama administration, and Obama himself, is incapable of generating a scandal of genuine ethical significance. Maybe somewhere beneath his cautious, technocratic exoskeleton beats the diseased heart of a closet Nixon. But I don’t think so. And neither do most Americans. And neither do most of the journalists publicizing these fake scandals. Heck, I don’t think the politicians and pundits leading the charge even think so, deep down. It’s just become a cynical game in which all parties have learned to play their given role. The result has been a widespread regression of our political and civic discourse. We’re no longer able to make basic moral distinctions between crises that actually impact our lives — climate change, resource depletion, income inequality, the corruption of our political system by money — and ginned-up scuttlebutt. Or maybe it would be more accurate to say that we choose not to make those distinctions. Who wants to confront the hard work of democracy anyway, when you can always just hang a sign on the country that reads “Gone Fishin’”?</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369181573355</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 20:12:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369181763080-198</Id><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Msg>"I see, the IRS was using search words to target conservatives, like "TeaParty"or "Patriots."

Once the current Boeing employee retires he and you if your a Boeing employee better learn how to invest in your rollover IRA and your cash account !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369184493975</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 21:01:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369184734589-203</Id><Topic><Title>one month return JRCC 91% Boeing 13.5% which is better ?cnnmoney chart</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369167810199</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 16:23:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>joedokes45 another number so domerrrr45, sparticus99991 you have another avatar, the 7 thumbs down tell you what your saying is total BS I am a stock market investor and I read a stock chart , I do not double down if a stock does not go up I get out you have not read how I trade your making this up . i have posted in the past few dasy how to trade amd,ddd,jrcc,jrcc and when to sell, that should have happened already for at least two of those stocks.

I never said I would take Boeing's CEO opinion over your's even though I would.

After the merger Boeing continued that. Small (and not so small) fortunes were made as long as one did not touch it til retirement. I sold my last Boeing stock several years ago and currently don't own any individual stocks. California properties and mutual funds have done fine the last 35 years, plus a nice McD pension and maximum SS for me and the wife. It sounds like you're doing OK also from what you post.</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1369191808852</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 23:03:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369192539045-212</Id><Topic><Title>The Pukes' Fishing Expedition</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369181573355</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 20:12:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As you and all the libs are so fond of pointing out, the GOP is too weak to go fishing.
