This is this morning in London, Secretary of State John Kerry and the UK foreign minister William Hague had a joint presser. During the presser Kerry said the following about the military strike that Obama wants against Syria. KERRY: (shouting) We're not going to war! We will be able to hold Bashar Assad accountable without, uhh, engaging in troops on the ground or any other prolonged kind of effort in a very limited, very targeted, very short-term effort that degrades his capacity to deliver chemical weapons without assuming responsibility for Syria's civil war. That is exactly what we're talking about doing, unbelievably small, limited kind of effort. Wow, now THAT, is truely hilarious, but not very intimidating . * * * Y.T.

The truth i have not suggested anyone lately buy tsla and was up almost 400% when i stopped recomending it i publically called the short squeeze here on may 3. Eadsy is a better stock than ba and if you are trading 1000 shares then the adr trading 35000 shares is liquid enough and if you were not a rookie critic you would know better than to claim that is small.

It's not like it's been smooth sailing for Obama since his re-election, but let's face it: Drawing a red line, then dithering for months before disclaiming the red line while threatening ("unbelievably small") military reprisals, followed by a failed (maybe-symbolic-maybe-not) vote in Congress would all add up to an unmitigated disaster. And thus, our Secretary of State may have gaffed his way into a possible "solution:" America’s top diplomat suggested in a passing remark that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could avoid a U.S.-led strike if he handed over all his chemical weapons, but the State Department quickly dismissed the comment as more of a “rhetorical argument” than an offer. In a London news conference this morning, Secretary of State John Kerry responded to a question about whether Assad could do anything to avoid war by saying “he could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week. Turn it over, all of it, without delay and allow a full and total accounting.” ... The State Department was forced to clarify the remarks, calling them “rhetorical” and making clear its desire to strike could be tempered by a Syrian offer. Kerry’s point, according to spokeswoman Jen Psaki, “was that this brutal dictator with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts cannot be trusted to turn over chemical weapons.” A State Department spokesman went so far as to walk back Kerry's remark as "hypothetical," and dismissed Russia's eagerness over the proposal as a "stalling tactic." But then... A seemingly offhand suggestion by Secretary of State John Kerry that Syria could avert an American attack by relinquishing its chemical weapons received an almost immediate welcome from Syria, Russia, the United Nations, a key American ally and even some Republicans on Monday as a possible way to avoid a major international military showdown in the Syria crisis. A White House official said the administration was taking a “hard look” at the idea. It looks like the handcuffed Brits are tentatively on board, too. Did Kerry's comments transform themselves from a gaffe into official policy in less than an hour? (See update: Maybe not). Earlier this afternoon, the Senate began debate over an authorization of force resolution that's losing steam on Capitol Hill. A third poll out today details widespread public opposition to a Syria intervention, which has only increased since the administration began its media push in favor of military action. With those political realities as a backdrop, the administration might very well lunge at this opportunity to extricate the president from his self-inflicted "red line" trap. If Assad is willing to at least make a show of turning his chemical weapons over to the "international community" at the behest of his friends in Moscow, the result would amount to a bizarre, serendipitous, and imperfect win-win: Dangerous weapons would (theoretically) be confiscated from the regime, the US could claim that our "pressure" led to this concession, an unwanted intervention would be avoided, and the "red line" conundrum would be essentially resolved. Just this morning, the White House was staring a bruising political defeat in the face. Kerry's screw-up may have provided an off-ramp. All that's left is for Obama to hail this "progress" during his interviews tonight, scrap or totally re-write his Tuesday address, and withdraw the war resolutions from Congress. (The Senate is set to vote on Wednesday). Would Harry Reid -- who invoked Hitler and Satan in arguing in favor of bombing Syria just this afternoon -- be willing to perform a complete about-face to do Obama a solid? One would expect so, but wait. What's this? White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Congress should still vote to authorize a military strike on Syria, claiming the only reason this proposal is on the table is because of the threat of military action. Question: Why would reluctant members of Congress stick their necks out and vote to authorize an unpopular strike when there's a tidy (if illusory) option on the table? Perhaps the new narrative developed too quickly for Carney to keep pace, and he'll be spinning away today's answer at tomorrow's press briefing. Or maybe the administration is still committed to having these votes. Why else would the president be showing up at a GOP luncheon tomorrow afternoon?</Msg><Username>mediocreclassyguy</Username><Timestamp>1378817602569</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 08:53:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378818219018-57</Id><Title>Change: Democrats Suddenly Pro-War, For Some Strange Reason</Title><Msg>According to NBC's whip count, things are looking dicey on Capitol Hill: As of this writing, 27 Senators are solid/lean "no" votes, 23 are committed or lean in favor of intervention, and 49 are undecided. In the House, the picture is bleaker for the administration. Fully 235 members are strong or likely "no's" at the moment, well past the requisite threshold (217) to defeat the resolution. Twenty-six House members support the resolution, or lean that way, with 172 undecided. The president aims to shift the momentum with a speech tomorrow night at 9pm ET. In the interim, however, the White House is botching politics 101, spurning and ignoring potential allies from across the aisle: “I don’t even know who my White House liaison is,” a frustrated Representative Adam Kinzinger, who supports military action in Syria, said on This Week this morning. The Illinois Republican told George Stephanopoulos that his office reached out to the White House to help “round up support” for authorization last week. “I haven’t heard back from the White House yet — I haven’t heard back from anyone,” he said. Kinzinger praised President Obama’s assessment of this situation in Syria, but said the “trust deficit” with Congress will prevent it from passing. Blowing off a young, conservative former fighter pilot as votes slip away? Smooth. Meanwhile, despite more than a week of salesmanship, the public remains unsold on a Syria strike. CNN's latest poll contains some interesting data: (1) Overall, 59 percent of the public opposes Congress authorizing the use of military force, with 39 percent in support. Perhaps most alarming for the White House is that the question wording included all the caveats the president is likely to employ in his major address (no ground troops, limited action, chemical weapons used by Assad against civilians). (2) Every political cohort polled opposes action...except for Democrats, who back the war 56/43 (nearly the exact reverse of the general populace's attitude). Political independents are driving the opposition (29/67 opposed). In a deeply ironic shift, backing an unpopular Middle Eastern war is becoming a litmus test of Obama *support* among Democrats. (3) Even if Congress authorizes the strikes, a majority (43/55) would still oppose them. A massive 71 percent majority would oppose military action if Congress votes down the resolution. The White House has insisted that the president would still have the authority to override Congress and order the bombing anyway, though they've begun to suggest that he won't -- perhaps because of polls like this one. (4) Eight-two percent of Americans believe it's likely or certain that the Assad regime used chemical weapons against civilians. So people are aware of Assad's atrocities, but still don't want to intervene. Why? A mere 26 percent of respondents say American strikes would effectively "achieve significant goals." Seventy-two percent say it won't. Almost as many have determined that an attack on Syria would not serve the US national interest.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassyguy</Username><Timestamp>1378818219018</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 09:03:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378818975054-58</Id><Title>Fish food for a flounder</Title><Msg>Bullwinkle was a RWNJ</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1378818975054</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 09:16:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378819073149-59</Id><Title>Bowing outsouricng success, use Airbus planes for downed and grounded 787's ok then</Title><Msg>Boeing (NYSE:BA) has another case of the bad news bears.

Bush, who alienated all our allies and dragged us into wars of choice in the Mideast? And remember that goofball Mitt Romney, whom Joe Biden a year ago accused of wanting to go to war in Syria? Both of them must be having a big laugh over the way things are going for Obama now. When I wrote last week on our bumbling Syria diplomacy, it seemed that things couldn't possibly go further downhill. Boy, was I wrong. Last week, it seemed our only ally was France. But now the French are having second thoughts. Obama's efforts to get support at the G20 conference came to nothing. Even the pope is undercutting him. Meanwhile, at home, polls show Americans are against a strike, and Obama is facing double-digit defections among Democrats in the Senate. The outlook for passage in the House, meanwhile, looks so bad that a resolution to authorize war may not even make it to a vote. If it's sure to fail, why force members -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- to go on record? You can bet they don't appreciate Obama putting them in this position. The Pentagon isn't happy, and even The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates, a reliable Obama supporter, calls his policy "dumb." Some critics are even comparing the collapse of American influence under Obama to the end of the Soviet Union. Well, that may be an exaggeration -- but Obama promised a "fundamental transformation," after all. At least Hollywood is still behind the president -- or, anyway, is mostly keeping quiet about its opposition because, as old-line Hollywood liberal Ed Asner reports, they "don't want to feel anti-black." So it's come to this -- while George W. Bush was savaged for "bombing brown people," now if you're against bombing brown people you're "anti-black."</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1378822351723</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 10:12:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378822426609-75</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is a laughing stock</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1378822351723</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 10:12:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As I said, if I were George W. Bush or Romney, I'd be sorely tempted to laugh, because Obama's chickens are coming home to roost. Obama was elected after he and his party sowed distrust of U.S. military endeavors, mocked "intelligence estimates" about "weapons of mass destruction," and suggested that anything the United States did in the region was probably somehow a scheme to benefit oil companies. Now Obama and his administration are shocked to find that when they go on about intelligence estimates and weapons of mass destruction, people don't take them seriously. Likewise, Obama has repeatedly shown his disdain for Congress and his willingness to act without congressional approval in all sorts of areas, from ObamaCare implementation to gun control. So it's not surprising that members of Congress seem to be a bit . . . distant now that Obama suddenly wants them to bail him out of his unfortunate "red line" remark. But I'd bet that Bush and Romney aren't actually laughing. That's because they're both serious men who understand international politics and who care for the future of the country. They no doubt understand that, as fun as it is to watch a political opponent twist in the wind due to his own ineptitude, the price will ultimately be paid not by Obama, but by the people of America. Our diplomacy is a joke, our president is a laughing stock, our enemies are emboldened, and we've still got over three years of this to go. Nothing funny there at all, alas.

A total of 13 passengers—including nine Chinese, three Thais and one Zimbabwean—were injured during evacuation. Sparks were seen near the right landing gear after the jet carrying 288 passengers and 14 crew members landed at 11:20 p.m. local time, Thai Airways said, with passengers evacuated via emergency slides. The landing occurred over clear and calm weather, according to weather reports at the time.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1378825979894</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 11:12:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378826049866-91</Id><Title>War is Canceled - doomers Disappointed</Title><Msg>tsk tsk - such a disappointment - no war for the military-complex and no Armageddon for the doomers</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1378826049866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 11:14:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378826070311-92</Id><Topic><Title>If Obama Would Explain why He and Hillary lied About Benghazi it might Help</Title><Username>mediocreclassyguy</Username><Timestamp>1378752981400</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 14:56:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, the biggest lie was that is was a protest over some film.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1378826070311</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 11:14:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378826153867-93</Id><Topic><Title>Thai air A330 landng gear failure</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1378825979894</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 11:12:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It happens to the best of us.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1378826153867</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 11:15:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378826192493-94</Id><Topic><Title>Can Anyone Believe Anything the Obama Administration Puts Out?</Title><Username>mediocreclassyguy</Username><Timestamp>1378761166102</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 17:12:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When you said, "Only a total idiot or a liberal could believe anything the O regime says."

Registering for the draft was mandatory, and the odds were high you would get called. Savvy people took ROTC to help insure getting a better job in the military, but officers and enlisted men alike could pretty much count on getting a stint in the Nam. There was very little chance a draftee would go anywhere but there. You could opt out like Mohammad Ali did, and serve in jail, or skip the country, but mostly people hoped they were doing the right thing by serving their country. Eventually, everyone came to their own conclusions about that. Many people's conclusions were different from each other's, and many people's minds changed over the years.

The fundamentals with Steve jobs then, were strong and it was a buying opportunity as they move from one average to another both long and short can make money now do your research . all sparti can do is fake it with his calls like igz ,a stock symbol that is actually only a tool symbol for working the software problems on the average. that is how far off reality ,sparti is BTW you act just like sparti, or are u sparti. cbx?</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1378836356241</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 14:05:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378836651570-154</Id><Title>august dividend</Title><Msg>anyone have info on when august ,2013 dividends were paid/mailed?</Msg><Username>cad007_37821</Username><Timestamp>1378836651570</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 14:10:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378836790803-155</Id><Topic><Title>News flash 20 minutes ago, news story said, Boeing to be removed from the Dow Jones as discussed on TV today</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1378834720501</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 13:38:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More backtracking by elon.

Hope is unnecessary if you have the ability to make something a certainty, so if we "make certain that it does not become a stalling tactic" we don't need hope. The problem is that we can't "make certain that it does not become a stalling tactic" because now that Obonzo has agreed to adopt the Russian solution, the process is out of our hands and could last a years with Assad employing all the same delay tactics that Saddam used on the UN. In the meantime Obonzo will be told to refrain from further aid to the rebels which will make certain that Assad remains in power and make certain that Obonzo and the USA looks weak. Mission accomplished for Assad.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1378839974903</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 15:06:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378840008814-174</Id><Topic><Title>War is Canceled - doomers Disappointed</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1378826049866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 11:14:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bumper and his ilk would rather see the whole country go up in flames than prosper under ANY democratic president.

Maintenance workers replaced a part on the plane late Sunday and the 787 was returned to service on Monday afternoon, Mr. Sandaker-Nielsen said. He could not identify the component. Boeing had delivered the plane to the airline in late June. Norwegian Air Shuttle had grounded its other 787 on Sept. 2 after a cockpit display indicated a problem with the plane’s brakes. The plane had been scheduled to fly from Stockholm to Bangkok and then on to New York. Maintenance crews inspected the aircraft at the Stockholm airport over the course of three days, Mr. Sandaker-Nielsen said, but found no problems. That plane, which has been delivered in mid-August, went back into service on Friday. “We are very happy with the way the aircraft is performing,” Mr. Sandaker-Nielsen said.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1378860846097</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 20:54:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378861002849-247</Id><Title>A Putin Obama Comparison</Title><Msg>Both Men were elected under highly suspicious circumstances.
