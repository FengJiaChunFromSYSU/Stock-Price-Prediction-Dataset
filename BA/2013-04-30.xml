It was conceived in super-secrecy on Jekyll Island, Georgia in 1910. Jekyll Island was a private island owned by very wealthy people, mostly bankers and industrialists. Seven of these wealthy bankers met there, developed the idea, and over the next three years brought it to fruition. The propaganda behind it was much as we see today from progressives. Words take on different meanings; deception; misinformation; “the ends justify the means.” In theory is was advertised as a way to break up the “Money Trusts;” various entities who had money and clout. Today’s term for these people is “corporate millionaires and billionaires.” Problem is, like today, the “money trusts” were the very people who were pushing the concept. They distract the people with what’s happening in the right hand so they don’t see what the left hand is doing. Obama bashes the millionaires and billionaires in public while taking millions from them in private. The same was true back in 1910-13 era. The secrecy of the Jekyll Island event reminds me of the Bilderburg Group and the Council of Foreign Relations group today</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367319024826</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 06:50:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367322345636-11</Id><Title>BA to 120</Title><Msg>then a split</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1367322345636</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 07:45:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367322575629-12</Id><Title>P8A contract</Title><Msg>From Motely fool: Monday defense contract issued Boeing (NYSE: BA ) , which was awarded $21.4 million as a modification to a previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract to upgrade the Training System Support Center to prepare it for Low Rate Initial Production Lot III of the new Boeing P-8A Poseidon subhunting aircraft.

The survey questions were based on the Boston Marathon bombing coverage of both networks. Newsbusters has the details: During the poll, which was based on interviews of 1,000 adults last Friday and Saturday, the bad news for CNN began when people were asked how believable the news was from that channel during the Boston bombings. The biggest response was 35 percent stating “I don't watch CNN.” As a result, 38 percent of the respondents said the channel was “very” or “somewhat” believable, and 21 percent said it was “not very” or “not at all believable.” Also, MSNBC had no reason to smile since the poll indicated that 42 percent of the people polled “don't watch” the channel. In addition, the liberal channel fared poorly in the “very” or “somewhat” believable category with 35 percent. However, the survey brought good news for the Fox News Channel, which had a 50 percent rating in the categories of “very” and “somewhat” believable even though 28 percent of those polled said they don't watch the cable news outlet, which is far less than its competitors. During the week of the Boston Marathon bombings, Fox News topped all cable in ratings, further verifying the polling above.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1367328061649</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 09:21:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367328470610-22</Id><Title>Black and Hispanic Families have Lost the Most Wealth Under Obama...</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON — Millions of Americans suffered a loss of wealth during the recession and the sluggish recovery that followed.

But on another comparison , since tesla was founded in 2003 the company stock, if you want lithium batteries on your product is much better investment . up 160% for 2 years up 99% compared to BA in the 18 to 30% areas depending upon where Boeing hacks like sparti wants to start his low low entry price on Boeing from instead of going from today and back with cnn money chart or yahoo charts. for 6 months while Boeing has gone up 30% which is less than Airbus , tesla is up 95% . So as usual and par for the coarse if your a Boeing hack your not making the money you could be making. YTD Tesla is up 55% also today notice the money the airlines who flew the 787 are out in revenue that will come out of Boeing shareholders stock value and yesterday Boeing stock value going forward

I understand why Americans are susceptible to those that choose to create division among them and I also understand why Barry chooses to take advantage of promoting division among Americans. Further to the point of Reich dismissing the growing anti-growth faction in the Dem ranks, I recommend that you and hooz do a little research into philosopher Paschal Bruckner's new book 'The Fanaticism of the Apocalypse: Save the Earth, Punish Human Beings' for better perspective of why Bob Reich is being obtuse about how many folks on his side don't want growth unless it involves an economy run on hemp. Bruckner can fill you in on the historical evidence of how the anti-growth left has adopted the fanaticism of using fear and apocalyptic threats to shape modern global societies' fear of growth and how Progressives are the anti-Humanists among us who shut down progress and development and want us all to return to a life like that of the Amish.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367336780573</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 11:46:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367337346927-56</Id><Topic><Title>Slow growth creates debt, not the other way around</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367283075415</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:51:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>unlimited gov't, inclusive of the those looters n moochers fostered (like yourself) creates slow growth and debt</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367337346927</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 11:55:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367337483209-57</Id><Topic><Title>Why are Feminine Men so Afraid of Individual Liberty and Responsibility</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1367325544846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 08:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To answer this you would first need to answer why and how they were feminized.

At least four career officials at the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency have retained lawyers or are in the process of doing so, as they prepare to provide sensitive information about the Benghazi attacks to Congress, Fox News has learned. Victoria Toensing, a former Justice Department official and Republican counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee, is now representing one of the State Department employees. She told Fox News her client and some of the others, who consider themselves whistle-blowers, have been threatened by unnamed Obama administration officials. “I'm not talking generally, I'm talking specifically about Benghazi – that people have been threatened,” Toensing said in an interview Monday. “And not just the State Department. People have been threatened at the CIA.” “It's frightening, and they're doing some very despicable threats to people,” she said. “Not ‘we're going to kill you,’ or not ‘we're going to prosecute you tomorrow,’ but they're taking career people and making them well aware that their careers will be over [if they cooperate with congressional investigators].” Whistleblower retaliation is status quo for the Obama administration. This is the same thing that happened in the Fast and Furious scandal. Careers of whistleblowers were ruined and their lives were deliberately negatively changed. Back in October, Kerry Picket wrote about the Obama administration's use of the Espionage Act to silence whistleblowers, which they would justify in the Benghazi case due to national security being at the center of the controversy. In light of Americans who are demanding answers from the Obama administration on why four Americans were denied help for military assistance when the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi was under attack, there is little chance that any whistle-blower with first hand information will step forward as long as President Barack Obama is still in office. Republicans are demanding the administration turnover material, including video, that explain what happened in Benghazi, but the President is more likely to cite executive privilege and use the hammer of his Justice Department to keep anybody who knows anything quiet. Bloomberg News reported on October 17 that Attorney General Eric Holder “prosecuted more government officials for alleged leaks under the World War I-era Espionage Act than all his predecessors combined, including law-and-order Republicans John Mitchell, Edwin Meese and John Ashcroft.” The Espionage Act, bans unlawful disclosure of national security information to individuals not authorized to get it. The act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1917 and has been used to prosecute double agents like Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen. But of course, the administration is only interested in punishing whistleblowers exposing corruption and lies. However, when leaks to the press benefit the administration, prosecutions from the Justice Department are absent. For example, AG Holder was not prosecuting anyone over who leaked information about the killing of Oasma bin Laden. The Justice Department has yet to charge anyone over leaking information regarding the U.S. involvement in cyberattacks on Iran as well as an al Qaida plan to blow up a U.S. bound airplane. In fact, the Justice Department ended up appointing one of two attorneys to the cyberattacks investigation who was an Obama donor. As a reminder, retaliation against whistleblowers is illegal and against the Whistleblower Protection Act which was reinforced last year.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1367342314981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 13:18:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367342382700-87</Id><Topic><Title>Why are Feminine Men so Afraid of Individual Liberty and Responsibility</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1367325544846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 08:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"...why it would be important to you if you were not a homoerotic/homophobic clown who thinks he can tell by looking (or in this case reading).

To suggest that response was humor is the real comedy no doubt. @ emotions I'm trained and skilled in observing emotions and most humans are deeply flawed and lack the ability to understand and control emotions. When I watch a movie for instance I watch for ways that the director emotionally manipulates the audience. Such manipulations were known and developed in Hollywood by a group that referred to those they tricked as "the school of the sub-genius mind". Hollywood used the lack of emotional unawareness to play on fear and conspiracy themes like fear of nuclear power. Most people are untrained and inattentive. They are easily manipulated as they have allowed themselves to become slaves to their emotions.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367342382700</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 13:19:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367342729689-88</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi whistleblowers have been threatened by the Obama administration according to their attorneys</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1367342314981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 13:18:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can bet liberals nor the media will have much interest in finding out the truth.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis announced last week they would be changing the guidelines with which they calculate the Gross Domestic Product, more familiarly known as the GDP, the standard by which the size and growth of the economy is measured. The change comes after more than five years of economic stagnation that, despite frequent claims of a strengthening recovery, have seen high unemployment and extremely slight growth in the size of the economy. GDP is calculated by adding up the total amount of private consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. The new changes, which will include definitional changes to expand what is counted in GDP, are expected to add 3 percent to the GDP report, while not changing the actual output of the economy. The agency claims the changes in calculation “more accurately portray the evolving U.S. economy and to provide for consistent comparisons with data for the economies of other nations.” Outspoken investment broker and financial commentator Peter Schiff describes the change as “propaganda” in his radio show. “That’s what the government does. Whenever they don’t like the results, they change the methodology for calculating those results,” Schiff says in a new SchiffRadio report. “Now it doesn’t mean that the economy is actually any bigger, but it means they can pretend it’s bigger,” he added.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1367349824834</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 15:23:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367350133345-109</Id><Topic><Title>Tesla compared to Boeing if you got to have lithium</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367332936980</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 10:42:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wayne - who still won't admit his 55 low point on BA was "crapola" and doesn't know when markets "close early".

A National Transportation Safety Board investigation, for example, could reveal a cause for the two battery meltdowns many months from now, putting Boeing's fix and its analysis of the problem under renewed scrutiny, according to people familiar with the investigation. The NTSB also is likely to recommend changes in regulatory procedures after the review. While not binding, the NTSB suggestions could raise the bar for aircraft designs that Boeing and rival Airbus are now developing. EADS' (EAD.PA) Airbus already has dropped lithium-ion batteries from its forthcoming A350 plane on fears that regulators could delay its entry into service next year. At the same time, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is conducting a separate review of the design, manufacturing and production of the 787, which is the first commercial jetliner to extensively use both lightweight carbon composite construction and powerful electrical systems with lithium-ion batteries. Launched after a string of smaller mishaps culminated in the battery fire on January 7, this sort of FAA review normally would be dealt with quietly, said Hans Weber, an aviation consultant at TECOP International, who been an adviser to the FAA for 20 years. Now that the battery has drawn attention, however, "everybody is holding their breath," Weber said. "If anything happens, it will be publicized and the response will be a lot of resources will be focusing on the 787." Boeing declined to comment on the reviews, other than to say it is cooperating with regulators. The FAA has declined to give details, but expects to release an update in the summer. Lawmakers who oversee aviation are trying to schedule hearings on what Boeing and the FAA learned in the 787 crisis,</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367351107314</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 15:45:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367351471820-115</Id><Topic><Title>Why are Feminine Men so Afraid of Individual Liberty and Responsibility</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1367325544846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 08:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why?

The tape offers little proof as to the Tasrnaev brother’s guilt, but it follows a number of other intriguing caveats which some have offered as evidence that the suspects were framed and had no actual involvement in the bombings. - A Facebook post attributed to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev although not authenticated reads, “This will be the last message before the police get me. I never done it. They set me up. Father please forgive me. I am sorry it has come to this.” - The suspects’ mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva continues to insist that her sons are innocent, telling the Associated Press, “It’s all lies and hypocrisy.” - Tsarnaeva also claims that the FBI “were controlling his every step,” referring to Tamerlan Tasrnaev, and that both the FBI and the CIA were following the brothers since 2011. - The aunt of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, claims that the footage which emerged of police arresting a naked uninjured man was her nephew, contradicting the official narrative that Tsarnaev was critically injured in a shootout and suggesting he may have been killed while in custody. - Eyewitnesses to the shootout contradict claims by authorities that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ran over his own brother in a car, stating instead that he was run over by police. - Despite numerous images of other suspects with large black backpacks at the scene of the bombings, the FBI insisted that these photos not be deemed credible and that the Tasrnaev brothers were the only possible culprits.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367379265619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 23:34:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
