Check the Boeing site bio of delaney from st louis to mac dac to boeing to 737 etc. remember the screwup when Boeing spent BUCU bucks on the NG 737 wing to get a less than 2 % inoprovement and delayed the trial and installation of the aeropartners winglets. IT was the McDummy aero mensas running that fiasco. Now I dont know if delaney was involved directly in that - but he does appear to come across as arrogant in line with CEO post it and as few GE rejects. Now shanahan may have been on B-2 - I dont know for sure - cuz of the way the program was structured until 1990 or so. I was on that program and somewhat involved in data management and shop issues . ;-PP I'm sure the Boeing Bio will tell all AS to Ray conner- he is captive of the chicago mob - but I had good dealIngs with him on the 777 program in 93-95 when he was a shop manager.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1347942384886</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 00:26:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347942985854-2</Id><Title>Boeing down almost 5% year to date Apple up 22% in 3 months , which stock should you own?</Title><Msg>On Friday, both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 ended at highs not seen since December 2007. But Boeing stock price went down last week 2.21% and Boeing is down for the year to date 4.86 as of today now with the additional loss of 1.91% loss Boeing shareholders you now have a loss for the year to date of 4.68% and that is in the highest stock market run up as of last Friday, since 2007 five years ago! Compare this to a good stock like Apple shares rose in extended after-market trading to touch $700 per share for the first time. They have gained nearly 22 percent in the past 3-1/2 months in the build-up to the launch of the iPhone 5. I have been comparing BA to APPL don’t you Boeing shareholders wish you had made 22% on your Boeing stock? If you had that 70 dollar stock would be 85 dollars today, but Boeing has not hit 84 dollars once since the top Boeing employee James was hired in 2005 that is seven years ago, not once! Think about that in just 3 and a half months you could have gained another 22 % on Apple stock . and it another three and a half months it will be up another 22% so year to date now apple is up 72.79% and when I started comparing apple to Boeing not long ago you could have switched to a apple and made a lot of money , and you still can just get rid of your Boeing stock. Is Boeing poised to go lower , you bet yah, the GE jet engines are problematic, the workers will be striking, can’t make any money fixing those issues while apple is selling their new phones like hotcakes. Apple Inc booked orders for over two million iPhone 5 models in the first 24 hours, reflecting a higher-than-expected demand for the consumer device giant's new smartphone and setting it up for a strong holiday quarter.

Boeing has no money to run the company now, 2 billion over budget on the747, 20-30 billion over budget on the 787, fixed cost on a lowball 767 tanker,777x on hold , no money to develop, the 737Max going to be late and over budget and the 737 killer from china will be selling like hotcakes by 2015, underfunded union IAM pensions 2 billion owed, and the 787 most likely will suffer a crash fail like the Comet a jet not ready for its time, Boeing got started on that failure, now China will step on in and Boeing is out in 5 more years Boeing will be bankrupt, skunked.agin, if you dont think so tell that to the same mangers that are running Boeing now , ever heard of MD they went bankrupt doing exactly what is occuring at Boeing outsourcing ! Better get some apple you just missed 22% gain in 3.5 months if BA could do that your 70 dollar BA stock woudl be 85 now , it has never been 85 since James took over 7 years ago. I will remind you of this in another 3.5 months when apple is up another 22% and /Boeing is down another 5% you just need to learn what is going on and how to make money in good stocks like apple and stay away from failures to deliver on time, and overbudget over cost products like the 747 and the 787 and the too old to compete 737 and the no profit 767 tanker real simple really just buy apple and sit back and relax already stop fighting it !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347944462713</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 01:01:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347959221599-4</Id><Title>LOL, Does Rmoney hate half the US population?!</Title><Msg>Hey, I love it when Myth Rmoney doesn''t lie for a change.

Fully 1/3 of federal taxes collected are in the form of payroll taxes. 82% of Americans pay either payroll taxes or income taxes or both. The rest, mostly the elderly or the poor, pay only sales taxes. In Romney Ryan's world, however, it is Mitt Romney who would pay nothing. Under Ryan's plan, Romney would have paid less than 1% in taxes on his $21.6 million in income. There is a reason more tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy aren't resonating with the public as a way to create jobs. It is a discredited policy that merely increases income inequality. When tax rates were raised in the 1990s, it resulted in budget surpluses, a record post-war expansion and an unemployment rate of less than 4%. When tax rates were cut in the 2000s, it resulted in a doubling of the national debt, anemic growth that ultimately failed and an unemployment rate of 10%. Romney Ryan will not balance the budget, because tax cuts are greater than spending cuts. It will decimate the safety net for the poor, sick and aged. It will hollow investment in research, education, infrastructure and health care. It chiefly benefits Romney Ryan and their super-pac sponsors. The voting public is keenly aware of this, much to Romney Ryan's chagrin.</Msg><Username>agent0977</Username><Timestamp>1347968784831</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 07:46:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>16</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347972243791-13</Id><Title>The Youth Vote is Selling It's Liberty</Title><Msg>I know it's cool to vote for someone who promises so much but delivers almost nothing but cool rhetoric.

Now sources are saying that, despite initial claims by the Obama administration, there weren’t any “spontaneous” protests outside of the US embassy in Benghazi. In other words, there was no outcry over a movie, as the administration would like you to believe. It means that the attack and subsequent killing of four Americans, including the US ambassador, was planned in advance and the whole anti-Islamic movie bit was a excuse, not a reason. It also means Obama was a sleep at the wheel dreaming about Beyonce while Americans were being killed. Obama is totally incompetent to be in charge of our security.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1347972784847</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 08:53:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347973096708-15</Id><Title>Arlington is full of Patriots who Gave their Lives.....</Title><Msg>......so Americans could live in liberty.

Around the country every four years, private citizens and most business owners scrape together 25% or more of their income and send it off to the IRS. So how is it that giant multinationals, purportedly taxed at around 35%, manage to pay close to nothing—or, in GE’s case this year, nothing—in taxes? For example, between 2007-09, the country’s top five companies (by market capitalization) and Myth Rmoney, have paid little or no taxes. Luckily for them, tax returns, due to the type and amount of information they require, don’t actually give the IRS much headway on figuring out which activities are legitimate, and which are shadowy. With more than 50,000 tax rules, corporate accountants have space to be creative. They do, saving their employers billions of dollars.

A study from the Congressional Research Service -- the non-partisan research office for Congress -- shows that "there is little evidence over the past 65 years that tax cuts for the highest earners are associated with savings, investment or productivity growth." In fact, the study found that higher tax rates for the wealthy are statistically associated with higher levels of growth. The finding is likely to fuel to the already bitter political fight over taxing the rich, with President Obama and the Democrats calling for higher taxes on the wealthy to reduce the deficit and fund spending.

Umm, okay. Fracking fluids contain chemicals and additives that these guys keep secret, but what's known is already a laundry list of known carcinogenics. To understand what they're doing, here's The Fracking Song to explain it: Fracking is a form of natural gas drilling An alternative to oil cause the oil kept spilling Bringing jobs to small towns so everybody’s willing People turn on their lights and the drillers make a killing Water goes into the pipe, the pipe into the ground The pressure creates fissures 7,000 feet down The cracks release the gas that powers your town That well is fracked….. Yeah totally fracked But there’s more in the water than just H2O Toxic chemicals help to make the fluid flow With names like benzene and formaldehyde You better keep ‘em far away from the water supply The drillers say the fissures are a mile below The groundwater pumped into American homes But don’t tell it to the residents of Sublette Wy-O That water’s fracked…. We’re talking Benzene… What the frack is going on with all this fracking going on I think we need some facts to come to light I know we want our energy but nothing ever comes for free I think my water’s on fire tonight So it all goes back to 2005 Bush said gas drillers didn’t have to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act, before too long It was “frack, baby, frack” until the break of dawn. With the EPA out it was up to the states But they didn’t have the money to investigate Sick people couldn’t prove fracking was to blame All the while water wells were going up in flames</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1347982257249</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:30:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347982762441-42</Id><Topic><Title>COULD WE POSSIBLY WANT A MUSLIM PRESIDENT</Title><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1347982130979</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:28:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mormons and Muslims share much in their religion! "Modern Mohammedanism has its Mecca at Salt Lake... Clearly the Koran was Joseph Smith's model, so closely followed as to exclude even the poor pretension of originality in his foul 'revelations', "The student of Mormonism will be struck with the similarity of experience and claims of Joseph Smith and Mohammed" 1. The followers of Muhammad and Joseph Smith both killed innocent "infidel" on the same date of 9/11. On September 11, 1857, Mormon militia massacred about 140 men, women and children under the authority of Brigham Young. However 17 very young children were spared and adopted into Mormon families. They were in fact sold to the highest Mormon family bidder and resold and traded many times afterwords. This event is called "The Mountain Meadows" massacre. Mormon leaders engaged in a deliberate rewriting of history to deny they were behind the murders. On September 11, 2001 Muhammad's followers, using the Koran as a guide, sent two airplanes into the World Trade Center killing 3000 innocent men, women and children. 2. Both were visited by an angel. Joseph Smith was visited by the angel "Moroni" and Muhammad by Gabriel. 3.Both were given visions. Both were told that no true religion existed on the earth. In the published account of his life, Joseph Smith related that he became very disturbed when he was a youth because of the "strife among the different denominations," and this "cry and tumult" led him to ask God "which of all the sects were right — and which I should join." He was told that he must "join none of them, for they were all wrong... that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt..." (Pearl of Great Price, Joseph Smith 2:8-19) N. J. Dawood says that Mohammed was also concerned with the fact that the Jews and Christians had "divided themselves into schismatic sects." In the scriptures given by Mohammed, we read: "Yet the Sects are divided concerning Jesus.... Truly, the unbelievers are in the grossest error." (The Koran, translated by N. J. Dawood, Surah 19, p. 34) In Surah 30, page 190, this warning appears: "Do not split up your religion into sects, each exulting in its own beliefs." In Surah 3, page 398, we read: "The only true faith in Allah's sight is Islam. Those to whom the Scriptures [i.e., Jews and Christians] were given disagreed among themselves through jealousy only after knowledge had been given them." Both were to restore the long lost faith as the one true religion. Islam makes claim that Adam and Abraham were Muslims, a claim that is as ridiculous as it is undocumented from either history or archaeology. Mormons make the unsubstantiated claim that the church in the first century were Mormon. Both wrote a book inspired by God. Both claimed to be illiterate or uneducated and used this as proof the book was inspired. "How could an illiterate man write the Koran or the Book of Mormon?" Joseph Smith is claimed to have only grade three education. Both claimed the Bible was lost, altered, corrupted and unreliable. Both claimed their holy book was the most correct and perfect book on earth. Both claimed that their new "Bible" was based upon a record stored in heaven. With Islam, it is the "mother book" that resides in heaven with God. With Mormonism, it is the golden Nephi plates that the angel Moroni took back to heaven. Both claim that the version we have in our hands today are identical to what the prophet revealed and that parts are not lost, altered and corrupted. Of course the proof that these claims are invalid is found in two books. The Mormon claim is proven false by a book called "3913 Changes to Book of Mormon" by Sandra Tanner. The Islamic claim is proven false by a book (In Arabic language) called, "Making Easy the Readings of What Has Been Sent Down" by Muhammad Fahd Khaaruun. Both books show that the copy of the book of Mormon and the Koran used today is different from what was originally used when each religion was started. Both claimed to be a final prophet of God. Both claimed they were persecuted because of their pure faith. Both were polygamists who had many wives.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1347982762441</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:39:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347982928033-43</Id><Topic><Title>Study: Tax Cuts for the Rich Don't Spur Growth</Title><Username>republicanfascists</Username><Timestamp>1347980147538</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 10:55:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK LETS ASK!

Libyan officials and eyewitnesses have described the nature of the attack as clearly pre-planned, and US Senators briefed on the matter have drawn similar conclusions. The president has fielded precisely zero questions on this matter (one wonders if he's eager to respond to inquiries about how often he does or does not read the intelligence memos about which he's rarely briefed). He has outsourced the whole Q&amp;A annoyance to various underlings, including UN Ambassador Susan Rice -- who ironically once admitted that her boss was "not ready" for a proverbial 3 am phone call on a pressing international crisis. Appearing on Sunday's Meet the Press, Rice claimed that two of the four American diplomatic staff murdered in Benghazi were security personnel; evidence, she said, that the diplomatic outpost was not unprotected.

Now, the mediocre class not only is delusional about about it's greatness it has turned to attacking and denigrating success. If mediocrity is our greatest attribute it's no wonder 3rd world countries have begun to eat our lunch economically and hold our debt over our head. High achievers like myself will buy the assets of the mediocre class for pennies on the dollars once they get hungry.

Is the White House manipulating the currency? ===================================== The White House promise that it could release oil from strategic reserves if prices get too high is keeping a lid on crude prices, already under pressure from slower global growth. In what appears to be a calculated move to keep oil prices under control, the White House Tuesday reiterated its comment that “all options are on the table” when it comes to the oil market, including a Strategic Petroleum Reserve release. U.S. oil prices [CLCV1 95.50 -1.12 (-1.16%) ] were trading just under $96 Tuesday afternoon, and Brent crude [LCOCV1 112.01 -1.78 (-1.56%) ], the international benchmark, was down about a percent, just below $113 per barrel. (Read More: Get Oil and Natural Gas Prices Here) Oil was already trading lower, ahead of the Tuesday comment, in follow through to Monday’s sharp and sudden drop in crude futures. Just before 2 p.m. Monday, West Texas Intermediate crude futures plunged from above $98 to 94.83 per barrel, with little in the way of explanation. Traders pointed to rumors about a pending SPR release, and the volatility from the expiration of options, as well as a “fat finger” trade. But none of those explained the rebalancing in oil that rippled across other markets, and appears to have started in the bond market. And the CME Group issued a statement saying it is "unaware of any technical issues" regarding the crude price drop. WTI had risen above $100 for the first time since May last week after the Fed announced its latest round of quantitative easing. In this program, the Fed is buying mortgage-backed securities. The market was betting last week that the new QE3, like past programs, would fuel a risk rally and send commodities, and inflation, higher. (Read More: Fed’s ‘QE-Infinity’ Will Push Gold Up to $2,400—Pro) But some of those expectations appear to have been pared back. The Fed news also coincided with an outbreak last week of unrest in the Middle East which was also supportive of prices. David Lutz of Stifel Nicholas said he believes the sell-off in oil and other commodities Monday was preceded by a big inflation bet taken off the table.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347999060994</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 16:11:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347999258226-109</Id><Topic><Title>How the White House Is Keeping a Lid on Oil Prices</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347999060994</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 16:11:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe we should give the oil companies billions more in tax subsidies? and if the White house can keep oil prices down I say that`s a good thing, very imaginative and unrealistic though.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1347999258226</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 16:14:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348000082977-110</Id><Title>Willard Mittford's Myth</Title><Msg>61 percent of them work but don’t earn enough to owe income tax. 17 percent are students (who will pay plenty of taxes once they’re out of school), military families, people with disabilities and people who have lost their jobs—including victims of outsourcers like, well, Willard Mittford Romney. 22 percent are elderly. The fact that they're not paid enough or are active duty military or are too old or disabled—maybe suffering from black lung or other diseases acquired on the job—does not mean they don’t contribute to America’s tax revenues. In fact, the poorest one-fifth of U.S. households pay a grinding 17.4 percent of their income in various federal, state and local taxes. By the way, Willard Mittford, it's actually 46 percent, and people in southern red states—you know, where those "right to work" for less laws you like keep wages low—are disproportionately likely to pay no income taxes. Also, many major corporations that are sitting on trillions of dollars in cash are paying little to no federal taxes. Many millionaires and billionaires pay no taxes.</Msg><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1348000082977</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 16:28:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348000383500-111</Id><Title>Occutards Represent the Left Well</Title><Msg>There are the government educated unemployed elites that were unemployed a year ago and are still unemployed a year later and wanting government handout because they don't have any marketable skills.

According to Pew, the Census Bureau showed that the median income for American households in 2009 – the official end of the Great Recession – was $52,195 (in 2011 dollars), while the median income dipped to $50,054 last year, falling 4.1 percent over two years. “The decrease in household income from 2009 to 2011 almost exactly equaled the decrease in income in the two years of the recession,” the Pew report stated. “During the Great Recession, the median U.S. household income (in 2011 dollars) dropped from $54,489 in 2007 to $52,195 in 2009, a loss of 4.2 percent. By this yardstick, the recovery from the Great Recession is bypassing the nation’s households.” Way to go Obama and Democrats!</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1348012599016</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 19:56:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348013030027-141</Id><Topic><Title>Half the population on welfare and want thier free Healthcare Obama wins.
