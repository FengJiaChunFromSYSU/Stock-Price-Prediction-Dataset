The prisoners, seven in all, were captured Syrian soldiers. Five were trussed, their backs marked with red welts. They kept their faces pressed to the dirt as the rebels’ commander recited a bitter revolutionary verse. “For fifty years, they are companions to corruption,” he said. “We swear to the Lord of the Throne, that this is our oath: We will take revenge.” The moment the poem ended, the commander, known as “the Uncle,” fired a bullet into the back of the first prisoner’s head. His gunmen followed suit, promptly killing all the men at their feet. This scene, documented in a video smuggled out of Syria a few days ago by a former rebel who grew disgusted by the killings, offers a dark insight into how many rebels have adopted some of the same brutal and ruthless tactics as the regime they are trying to overthrow. As the United States debates whether to support the Obama administration’s proposal that Syrian forces should be attacked for using chemical weapons against civilians, this video, shot in April, joins a growing body of evidence of an increasingly criminal environment populated by gangs of highwaymen, kidnappers and killers. The video also offers a reminder of the foreign policy puzzle the United States faces in finding rebel allies as some members of Congress, including Senator John McCain, press for more robust military support for the opposition.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1378386325338</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 09:05:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378387451461-18</Id><Topic><Title>John Kerry Exposes Rand Paul as a Fraud While Obliterating Him During Syria Hearing</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1378333938849</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-04 18:32:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And when things go bad, remember who it is that blames the USA for the world's problems....OBAMA!</Msg><Username>doublehaul32</Username><Timestamp>1378387451461</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 09:24:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378387853709-19</Id><Topic><Title>I see NeoCon McCain was playing Poker</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378386270483</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 09:04:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>McCain is right on one big account...if you go to war you go to win, not a token gesture that accomplishes nothing, but a symbolic attack.

Colin Powell wrote in his autobiography: “War should be the politics of last resort. And when we go to war, we should have a purpose that our people understand and support.” I believe that he had it right. America should only go to war to win. War should occur only when America is attacked, when it is threatened or when American interests are attacked or threatened. I don’t think the situation in Syria passes that test. Even the State Department argues that “there’s no military solution here that’s good for the Syrian people, and that the best path forward is a political solution.” The U.S. should not fight a war to save face. I will not vote to send young men and women to sacrifice life and limb for stalemate. I will not vote to send our nation’s best and brightest to fight for anything less than victory. If American interests are at stake, then our goal should not be stalemate.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1378390081031</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 10:08:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378390221105-26</Id><Topic><Title>What is the warrenty on a 787 and how much do they charge for parts.</Title><Username>snaps4u2</Username><Timestamp>1378389085703</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 09:51:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>answer- depends on contract- as to parts, many many companies do make parts for airplanes.

Not surprisingly, the rebels have ties to al Qaeda. The rebels launched the assault on the ancient Christian village of Maaloula _ which is on a UNESCO list of tentative world heritage sites _ on Wednesday after an al-Nusra fighter blew himself up at a regime checkpoint at the entrance to the mountain village. The village, about 40 miles (60 kilometers) northeast of Damascus, is home to about 2,000 residents, some of whom still speak a version of Aramaic, the ancient language of biblical times believed to have been spoken by Jesus. Heavy clashes between President Bashar Assad's troops and Nusra Front fighters persisted in surrounding mountains Thursday, according to the Observatory, which collects information from a network of anti-regime activists. Speaking by phone from a convent in the village, a nun told The Associated Press that the rebels left a mountaintop hotel Thursday after capturing it a day earlier. The nun said the frightened residents expect the Islamic militants to return to the Safir hotel and resume shelling of the community below. "It's their home now," the nun said. She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Al Qaeda led rebel force groups have also reportedly vowed to continue their attacks on Christians as soon as the United States "liberates" the country from it's President Bashir al-Assad. Yesterday Republican Senator John McCain inserted an amendment into a resolution approving military force in Syria with a goal of shifting the power on the battle field from the Assad regime and to rebel forces.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1378391655918</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 10:34:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378392006273-30</Id><Topic><Title>Why Did Obama Appoint a Known Communist to His Administration?</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1378316088748</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-04 13:34:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>econquack you dont know a communist from a presbyterian in the first place- you are so GD dumb you think Socialists are Communists- you were born with the inability to think for your self and still parrot old obsolete cold war irrationalities.

Some of the planes may be supplied by lessors, meaning not all 130 jets may be booked as new orders.</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1378395266729</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 11:34:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378395298204-36</Id><Topic><Title>Barack's Presidential Library</Title><Username>censored53</Username><Timestamp>1378393196473</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 10:59:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just getting a rise out of you Hooz...actually it looks like Obama jut might have been born in Hawaii...but he committed fraud anyway since his Birth Cert and multiple IDs are bogus ...remember Frank Marshall Davis is the father.

After spending most of his life in liberal educational institutions he knew the kind of people those institutions were turning out and that they would also respond to such empty rhetoric and sloganeering. Thus, Hope and Change would sell with out anyone asking what he was hoping for or what he was wanted to change the country to.

As a performer, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and powerful vocals over a four-octave range.[4][5][6] As a songwriter, Mercury composed many hits for Queen, including "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Killer Queen", "Somebody to Love", "Don't Stop Me Now", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", and "We Are the Champions". In addition to his work with Queen, he led a solo career, and also occasionally served as a producer and guest musician (piano or vocals) for other artists. He died of bronchopneumonia brought on by AIDS on 24 November 1991, only one day after publicly acknowledging that he had the disease. Mercury was a Parsi born in Zanzibar and grew up there and in India until his mid-teens. He has been referred to as "Britain's first Asian rock star".[7] In 2002, Mercury was placed at number 58 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, in 2006, Time Asia named him one of the most influential Asian heroes of the past 60 years,[8] and he continues to be voted one of the greatest singers in the history of popular music. In 2005, a poll organised by Blender and MTV2 saw Mercury voted the greatest male singer of all time.[9] In 2008, Rolling Stone editors ranked him number 18 on their list of the 100 greatest singers of all time.[6] In 2009, a Classic Rock poll saw him voted the greatest rock singer of all time.[10]Allmusic has characterised Mercury as "one of rock's greatest all-time entertainers", who possessed "one of the greatest voices in all of music".[11]</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1378400512439</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 13:01:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378400515630-61</Id><Topic><Title>Why Did Obama Appoint a Known Communist to His Administration?</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1378316088748</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-04 13:34:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And my favorite leftist communist supporting father.....they have the Fox News reporter being thrown out, and approached using fowl language by Van Jones...have it on video tape..</Msg><Username>doublehaul32</Username><Timestamp>1378400515630</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 13:01:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378401192191-62</Id><Topic><Title>Why Did Obama Appoint a Known Communist to His Administration?</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1378316088748</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-04 13:34:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We definitely know now that you are a sorry communist supporter.

I can't speak for all conservatives, but I would offer that there are two things that concern me: 1) the Obama record of interventions gone wrong: Egypt and Libya; and 2) the "clear" uncertainty that any action - from none to boots on the ground - could lead to a catastrophe. Today, Russia has upped the ante by threatening elevated support for Syria - if we go alone without UN support. Of course, it is cynical on their part, since they have veto power on any UN vote. Another scenario is we wind up bringing down Assad without too much chaos - but then al Qaeda takes over. It should be clear that we cannot simply blow up the chemical weapons - without dispersing the toxic agents and causing more unintended, perhaps massive, deaths. If we bring down Assad, or cause him to be "weakened", does that ensure the safe containment of the chemical weapons - without "boots on the ground"? Is this a world issue or is this a Syria internal issue? The "world" should have pressed Syria, years ago, to get rid of the weapons - like Gaddafi did. The President has a difficult decision to make for two reasons: 1) there is very little likelihood that he will be able to design an "action" that achieves the intended result; and 2) the American people are apparently resolute - like at 90% - that they do not want the President to perform any military action against Syria at this time. Your quote of "All that evil needs to succeed is for good men to do nothing" is interesting because action and inaction will both find a success path for evil.

It is true that both debt and the control of currency is one of the most effective means of enslaving an entire population without their knowledge. Continually chasing financial freedom with no ability to pay off debt and save for the future ensures that a sizeable majority of the population will not have the means, time, or energy to resist the totalitarian methods imposed upon them. Likewise, it is true that by controlling a nation’s currency, one essentially controls the nation. Governments who are beholden to third parties and private banks for their money are not governments at all – they are receiverships existing solely at the pleasure of the controlling oligarchy. As Mayer Amschel Rothschild once stated, “Give me control of a nation’s money supply and I care not who makes its laws.” Thus, when one takes a look at the worldwide banking system and, in particular, the amount of countries with government-owned, non-Rothschild affiliated central banks, one easily sees a monopolistic system coming into view. In addition, when one takes a closer look at those countries with government-owned central banks, independent of Rothschild and major financier control, it becomes even clearer that maintaining a government-mandated structure of currency and central banking places a nation on a very dangerous list. After the beginning of the New Century, which truly began in 2001, nations maintaining some modicum of independence from the Rothschild private central banking cartel have been dealt with in short and brutal fashion.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1378405734170</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 14:28:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378405877509-71</Id><Topic><Title>'Planned layoffs' soar 34% in August....Way to go Obama and Democrats!</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1378398015745</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 12:20:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>poordumbtard......are you one of the economic illiterates that thinks labor is not a commodity like corn, beans, gasoline or capital?

Kerry did serve up at least one strong assertion, however. In regard to reports that the president is prepared to ship heavier weapons to Syrian rebels, Kerry said that concerns about radicals dominating the opposition (as we saw in Libya, with eventual deadly consequences) are unfounded and "not true:" “I just don’t agree that a majority are al Qaeda and the bad guys. That’s not true. There are about 70,000 to 100,000 oppositionists … Maybe 15 percent to 25 percent might be in one group or another who are what we would deem to be bad guys. There is a real moderate opposition that exists. General Idriss is running the military arm of that,” Kerry continued, referring to General Salim Idriss, head of the rebel Free Syrian Army. Reuters, a veritable wrecking-ball against White House claims of late, fact-checks Kerry's assertion -- which I've been calling attention to since the words left his mouth. His assurances are debatable at best: Secretary of State John Kerry’s public assertions that moderate Syrian opposition groups are growing in influence appear to be at odds with estimates by U.S. and European intelligence sources and nongovernmental experts, who say Islamic extremists remain by far the fiercest and best-organized rebel elements. … U.S. and allied intelligence sources and private experts on the Syrian conflict suggest that assessment is optimistic. While the radical Islamists among the rebels may not be numerically superior to more moderate fighters, they say, Islamist groups like the al Qaeda-aligned Nusra Front are better organized, armed and trained. Again, as background, see the following: (1) A June piece about Islamist radicals co-opting and aggressively disarming their moderate counterparts, (2)Foreign Policy's new report that the Free Syrian Army -- on whom Kerry hangs his hat -- being torn asunder, and (3) The Wall Street Journalcolumn from last week arguing that the moderates really are a quasi-reliable and relatively (ideologically) benign fighting force. The Journal essay was accompanied by a map, approximating the author's assessment of which Syrian elements control swaths of territory within the war-torn nation:</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1378406283106</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 14:38:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378406303201-74</Id><Topic><Title>The reason for military intervention in Syria</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1378405734170</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 14:28:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not to mention Russia.

Speaking to his human rights council Wednesday, Putin said, "This was very unpleasant and surprising for me.

Bob. I have not heard anyone proposing that we wipe out the chemical weapons with military action -- only that we register a loud (and explosive) complaint about their use. The use of chemical weapons is after like a run on a bank -- anyone will use them if they think their enemy can/will. So it seems important to Obama and many of the other voices supporting U.S. counter-action that we reinforce the notion that use of chemical weapons will draw a "swift" and terrifying response. I do not know where the 188 other signatories to the chem weapons ban are, and I don't know why the U.S. has to take on the role of worldwide policeman (as I've stated repeatedly in the past, for those fond of bandying around the "h" word.) I also strongly dissent from your question 1 that other foreign involvements by Obama have so surely "gone wrong." Watch "Charlie Wilson's War" again and listed to Philip Seymour (sp?)Hoffman's speech about the zen master responding with "We'll see." For another, ALL of what you call Obama's screw-ups would fit in a thimble compared to the tanker truckload of Bush's invasion of Iraq. How did you feel about that one? "Let's kill them for Christ" ? It cost us more than 4,000 dead, a generation of VA health care costs, and more off-the-books money than we'll ever know (It also loaded the dice for this particular roll -- proving that the Boxarox#$%$ admin did LASTING damage to this nation from which we might never recover.) As for the cheap shots of children trying to insinuate themselves into this discussion by grownups, I think my grasp of history is as good as theirs. I know, for example, that getting involved in other nation's civil wars. even with the best and even humanitarian reasons, is how the Vietnam War started.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1378411694427</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 16:08:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378411810138-89</Id><Topic><Title>You Know You Are A Neocon If...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1378398610768</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 12:30:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Neocons will be back in power shortly, ...liberals, and liberal [policy will guarantee that happens.

In 1820, the Missouri Compromise had helped save the United States from splitting along sectional lines by defining where slavery could exist in the territory gained in the Louisiana Purchase. Specifically, slavery could exist south of the 36°30'N line of latitude, and no further west than Missouri. The territory claimed by Texas extended further north and west than the Missouri Compromise lines (well into present-day New Mexico and Colorado). In another compromise designed to overcome objections to annexation, the 1845 joint resolution that admitted Texas to the Union provided that Texas could be divided into as many as five states. Any states north or west of the Missouri Compromise lines would be free; in the others, a popular vote would determine whether slavery could exist. The power to create new states could be exercised only by Congress, with the consent of the affected state legislatures. Congress had a long precedent to follow in the creation of new states from territorial acquisitions. For example, the Northwest Territory eventually became ten different states, and the Louisiana Purchase eventually led to the creation of thirteen new states. In 1850, Southerners wanted to exercise the provision to create another slave state from Texas to balance the admission of California as a free state. In one of the provisions of the Compromise of 1850, Texas was instead given a payout of $10 million to give up its northern and western claims. A few years later, the Kansas-Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise and made the issue of the boundaries a moot point. Although in theory Texas could still be divided into multiple states, any possibility of carving additional states from Texas ended when the Civil War settled the question of slavery once and for all.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378434144336</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 22:22:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378434626566-147</Id><Topic><Title>Egyptian Media Portray Obama as Satan</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1378415616941</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 17:13:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If anything could make Obama more popular at home, that would be it.
