The founders rightly saw government as an eternal threat against freedom and justice, knowing that all governments inevitably grow out of control like a cancer tumor, always seeking more and more power until they kill the host. The answer to this destructive pattern of dangerous government throughout human history was to place limits on government powerand stake out fundamental rights and freedoms that can never be infringed. That’s the Bill of Rights, the original ten amendments to the Constitution. The Bill of Rights says the government can never ban your free speech, take away your firearms, search your house or your person without a warrant, quarter soldiers in your home without permission, force you to testify against yourself, throw you in prison without a fair trial and so on. Nearly every scholar, when it comes down to it, agrees these are fundamental human rights and civil liberties. Today’s federal government believes the Bill of Rights is optional But today’s government, under both the Bush and Obama administrations, believes it has the power and the right to violate the Bill of Rights when it wants to. Sen. Feinstein, President Obama and Vice President Biden specifically believe the Bill of Rights is only a suggestion, not the law of the land, and so they can selectively ignore it when they want to. The problem with this philosophy is that if the Second Amendment can be selectively ignored, then so can the First Amendment. Anyone who supports government gun control restrictions — all of which are illegal under the Constitution — must also support the power of the government to ban selected books and websites which do not agree with the White House view of the world. If Obama can have a “kill list” of Americans to assassinate, which he does, then he must also have the power of a “web site kill list” of which websites to seize or take offline. Guns first, then books and websites This is not an article about the merits of private firearms ownership, by the way; it’s an article about what happens next, if the guns are taken away. If we lose our Second Amendment rights, it’s only a matter of time before Obama says something like, “Websites that criticize the government are dangerous and we are going to seize them and shut them down.” A d v e r t i s e m e n t What’s to stop them from doing so? Nothing! The U.S. government has already seized and shut down thousands of websites it claims are involved in “piracy,” shutting them down with no due process, no trial, no jury and not even a search warrant. The government simply invokes some power it has never been granted, then uses that false power to seize entire servers full of websites. This action is blatantly illegal, unconstitutional and tyrannical. Those who argue in favor of gun control are, in essence, arguing that government has no limits, meaning that government can decide when and where the Bill of Rights applies. This question was brilliantly asked by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz — a rising star of liberty in the Congress — who leveled the question at Sen. Feinstein, a wicked dictatorial creature of darkness who literally worships enslavement and tyranny. Sen. Cruz asked Feinstein whether she believed the government had the power to selectively ban books it didn’t like, to which Feinstein arrogantly answered that she didn’t “need to be lectured” like a schoolgirl. And yet apparently she does, because she fails to misunderstand the entire meaning of the Bill of Rights. She does not understand the words, “shall not be infringed,” even though they are written in plain English. Like all other tyrants, Feinstein accepts no limits to her government power, and she plans to expand that power by force, if necessary, to dominate and enslave the people she claims to serve.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363527333106</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 09:35:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363527340520-12</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Raven: Did you google "uss liberty veterans association" like I asked you ?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363494722637</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 00:32:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have no idea that the several web sites names you list are those of sailors from the USS Liberty.

Who has won the debate?...liberals have won appealing to the emotional side of ignorant voters.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1363542842996</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 13:54:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363545655414-31</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Raven: Did you google "uss liberty veterans association" like I asked you ?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363494722637</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 00:32:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Skept for some strange reason whenever you brought up this subject before you never told us about this uncle of yours.

Boeing needs to conduct only one test flight with the proposed fix on ZA272 (LN 86, SP-LRC). ZA005 (LN 5, N787FT) will conduct ground tests of the fix. Both aircraft are in the process of being retrofitted with the battery fix. Boeing has told me that it takes about 4 to 5 days to remove the old lithium ion battery set up and install the new battery assembly for both the main and APU battery. Boeing has declined to reveal how many ground and flight test hours will be needed to finish testing though Ron Hinderberger, Boeing Vice President, 787-8 Engineering says the current plan calls for only one test flight of the upgrade system on ZA272. The total ground and flight tests should be no more than a couple of weeks though the FAA can mandate additional testing. It is the FAA who will the final say in this matter. Boeing is pretty confident of the fix because of the testing and work performed in their integrated systems labs but many of these test will have to be re-performed under the oversight of the FAA. Boeing said that about 1/3 of the required FAA testing is already completed. Once the FAA has given it's sign off then Boeing will act aggressively to get the fix installed on the 50 787s that currently in customer hands. I would expect that there will be multiple Boeing teams at different locations working concurrently to do the retrofit which, as mentioned earlier, will take 4 to 5 days per airplane.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1363551101340</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 16:11:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363551778372-42</Id><Topic><Title>If Gun Control pass's.....EXPECT FREE SPEECH CONTROL !!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363527333106</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 09:35:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey jerkoff who do you think makes the decisions anyway- have you ever tried voting to send some one to congress??? who did you vote for Donald Duck? jeeeeeeeeeeez</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1363551778372</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 16:22:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363552004009-43</Id><Title>If Strong Gun Control pass's.....EXPECT VASTLY REDUCED GUN DEATHS</Title><Msg>Why do you think they have 10% of the number of gun deaths in Europe and Japan.

The first time the LIBERTY was able to send a message alerting U.S. forces of the attack was at 1409B. At this point the USS SARATOGA, which received the message, was 400 miles to the west. The commanding officer of SARATOGA immediately ordered the launch of aircraft; 15 minutes later at 1424B twelve aircraft were airborne. A minute later, Rear Admiral Geis, Commander Task Force 60 (commanding the task force consisting of the SARATOGA and USS AMERICA (CV-66) battle groups in the Mediterranean,) ordered the SARATOGA flight recalled. Then either COMSIXTHFLT or CTF 60, it isn’t clear which, ordered a rescue flight be sent in 90 minutes, or at approximately 1550B. At 1550B both carriers launched aircraft, but again Rear Admiral Geis ordered the aircraft recalled.34 The first rescue flight was canceled on direct orders by radio from Secretary of Defense McNamara, who ordered a 90-minute delay before any further flights. When the second flight took off at 1550[B] (having waited 90 minutes as ordered) Geis notified McNamara, who again ordered the recall of the flights. Any officer who doubts the wisdom of an order he has received has the prerogative to ask that the order be confirmed by a yet-higher officer, and Geis availed himself of that right. Since he was questioning the order of the Secretary of Defense, the only man superior to the Secretary was the President. President Johnson himself came on the radio and ordered Geis to recall the flights because ‘we are not going to embarrass an ally.’35 The second flights returned to the carriers decks minutes later, after the recall by the President at 1552B.++ AU/ACSC/109/1999-04 AIR COMMAND AND STAFF COLLEGE AIR UNIVERSITY ATTACK ON THE USS LIBERTY REALPOLITIK GONE HAYWIRE by Richard D.

Both the Israeli and U.S. governments conducted inquiries and issued reports that concluded the attack was a mistake due to Israeli confusion about the ship's identity,[2] though others, including survivors of the attack, have rejected these conclusions and maintain that the attack was deliberate.[6] In May 1968, the Israeli government paid US$3,323,500 (US$22.2 million in 2013) as full payment to the families of the 34 men killed in the attack. In March 1969, Israel paid a further $3,566,457 in compensation to the men who had been wounded. On 18 December 1980, it agreed to pay $6 million as settlement for the final U.S. bill of $17,132,709 for material damage to the Liberty itself plus 13 years' interest.[7]"</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363564590513</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 19:56:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363564657077-63</Id><Topic><Title>why do black men leave thier families behind and then fill up our prisons, don't they know right from wrong</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1363466157973</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 16:35:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I saw a lot of the videos.

"Aboard the Liberty, 34 U.S. sailors were dead and 171 seriously wounded. Years later, two Navy veterans gave me details of the verbal exchange when President Johnson ordered the callback. Radioman Tony Hart, serving at a U.S. radio relay station in Morocco, listened intently to the entire conversation between President Johnson and Secretary McNamara in the White House and Admiral Geis at sea. This is what Hart recalls Secretary McNamara said to Geis, “Get those planes back on deck.” Geis replied, “But the Liberty is under attack and needs help.” McNamara shouted, “Get those goddam planes back on deck.” Aghast at the order, Geis, “Mr. Secretary, I wish to appeal that order to higher authority.” McNamara said, “I already have the president’s authority to call the planes back. He is right here.” Hart recalls Johnson then came on the phone and said to Geis, “I don’t care if the ship goes down, I’m not going to war with an ally over a couple of sailors.” The stunned admiral said, “Aye, aye, sir.” Until his death, the admiral agonized over what, despite the presidential order, he might have done to help the Liberty crew." _____________________________________________________________________ So the source is two navy veterans relaying the exchange between Admiral Geis and Macnamara and LBJ.
