As political refugees they were entitled to settlement assistance from day one. (Section 8 Housing, public healthcare, f ood stamps etc.) Then their stellar older son impregnates and marries the daughter of a doctor, and this new little Muslim family receives 18 months of government assistance. They only came off welfare after the naive young wife starts working 70 hours a week while husband Tamerlan stays home and builds bombs and plans to kill and injure the very Americans who have paid for his pathetic existence for the past 12 plus years. A Breakdown of your and my investment into the Tsarnaev Family: Section 8 housing Free public healthcare Food stamps and other EFT transfer payments Federal Pell Grants for both sons and most likely their daughters as well. (That is $5200.00 per year for each son or daughter who attended a college.) City of Cambridge also awarded a $2500 per year scholarship to the younger son. Younger son also reportedly was receiving state college scholarship. What did we receive for our investment: � Older son was arrested for domestic battery on a former girlfriend. � The mother was arrested last year for shoplifting $1600 in merchandise from a Lord &amp; Taylor store. Mother is facing immediate arrest for failure to appear regarding this matter. � Then of course we know that the two sons combined to kill four people (3 Americans &amp; a Chinese exchange student), severely injure 100 plus other people, carjacked another victim and only let him live when they found out that he was not an American citizen. � Now we have the two pathetic parents who have returned to Russia and are claiming that their poor sons are innocent and are being framed by the same American government that allowed for their pathetic existence the past 12 plus</Msg><Username>panthers_108</Username><Timestamp>1367814344981</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 00:25:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367814594672-2</Id><Topic><Title>domerrrrr45 read my user comments on mismangeent the dual role of CEO and BOD chairman</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367811007417</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 23:30:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Waynedick ur comments are useless to me ...they are bunch of junk! by the way get ready for a triple digit stock....soooooon!

Phil C's single major mistake was to buy the bankrupt MD, a outsource business plan company. Nothing good came of the MD purchase, the joint strike fighter was lost and that was the single most important reason MD was purchased . Phil made a huge second mistake, Phil allowed MD management to stay with Boeing as part of the deal This move, after Phil was shown the door, lead to Phil's MD replacement Harry S., and the rest is history. When Harry was fired and the CFO was fired too then the weak yes men on the BOD did not have the experience to find a replacement as they were not qualified . They were political appointments. So it got worse Lewis Platt, a man with zero aerospace experience was hired to find a window dresser for cover for the real power of the new MD BOD members with large shares of stock. James M. . A man who has zero air frame experience and was told to leave GE by Jack Welch James M. got the job to be a yes man for MD. Now any person who owns Boeing stock is enabling a BOD and CEO Chairman named James M. who has no clue what to do. This BOD is just like the WPPSS BOD it was supposedly a widows and orphans stock to buy and went bankrupt for the same reasons as Boeing will fail. The WPPSS had farmers on the BOD no nuclear professional. And WPPSS hanford tried to build 5 different types of nuclear power plants without getting one done right. Now the outsourcing business plan that has proven not to work at MD and on the 787 is being applied tot he 737 max. BOEING IS DOING THE SAME THING Boeing will be bankrupt in 10 years or a niche player and James has already gone on record as stating Chian will be a major player so Boeing is number two now .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367817590971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 01:19:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367818759551-6</Id><Topic><Title>why no person should own Boeing stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367817590971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 01:19:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't own BA and I don't support McNerney.

In Brewer v. Williams (1977) the court ruled that once an adversary proceeding has begun against a defendant, he has a right to legal representation when the government interrogates him. It is unclear if the suspect was given his Miranda rights notification. Dzhokar Tsarnaev had asked several times for a lawyer, but that request was ignored because he was being interrogated under the public safety exemption to the Miranda rule. Obama’s DOJ has unilaterally expanded the exception far beyond what the Supreme Court has established.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367838281101</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 07:04:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367839030203-12</Id><Title>Israeli Jet Strike Near Damascus Sends Fireball Over City</Title><Msg>Syria threatened retaliation against Israel after an aerial strike on the outskirts of Damascus caused explosions that rocked the capital, increasing the risk of a wider regional conflict. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-05/syria-says-israelis-jets-strike-sending-fireball-over-damascus.html</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1367839030203</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 07:17:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367840341181-13</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing revenues declined YOY by 24.5% so that is how I know the 24% stock price increase was stock buy back</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367809749655</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 23:09:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shut up already!!! your wrong on BA ,admit it.The more you bash it the more it goes up...LOL</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1367840341181</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 07:39:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367842083583-14</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing revenues declined YOY by 24.5% so that is how I know the 24% stock price increase was stock buy back</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367809749655</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 23:09:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its obvious my friend...waynedick is a total idiot...cant even tell us his agenda...he probably was let go by boeing and now revenge time in his stupid mind !</Msg><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1367842083583</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 08:08:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367845045297-15</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing revenues declined YOY by 24.5% so that is how I know the 24% stock price increase was stock buy back</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367809749655</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 23:09:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is how you know?

It seems, under this wonderful system, that interest on loans would become illegal, Sharia would take precedence over the U.S. Constitution, and Christians and other religious minorities would become “dhimmi” or protected minorities who would only have to pay a 10% tax for the privilege of living in a society under Islamic Law. Hizb-ut-tahrir is an Islamic organization that claims to be non-violent, and seeks to convert the world through intellectual discussions. Evidently, the long history of the misery caused in the world by religious fanatics, and religious governments, is to be cleared up and forgotten with a little intellectual “chewing the fat”. However, the Danish Government didn’t see anything intellectual about it when it arrested one of this group’s leaders six years ago for passing out literature calling on Muslims to carry out the Koranic exhortation to kill Jews wherever they see them, or when it indicted the group three years ago for calling for the murder of Danish government officials. Such “intellectual persuasion” was viewed by the Danes as it should be: inciting to riot and murder, and which should be punished as if it had been successful in its nefarious aims. Whoever incites others to murder based on race or religion should be tried and punished as if he had committed first-degree murder. Interestingly enough, when the conference began, men and women were forced to sit in separate sections, and when someone challenged this set-up, they were told that it was to prevent men and women from “acting like animals”.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367848672870</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:57:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367848713881-26</Id><Topic><Title>What Do Liberals And Terrorists Have In Common ?</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1367749340905</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 06:22:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apparently, these objective Islamic intellectuals didn’t trust themselves enough to not turn into raving rapists if they happened to co-mingle the sexes. It’s good to know we’ll have such well-controlled people in charge of the Islamic Republic of America, when they take over. Of course, the fundamental premise of the conference, that Capitalism has created the current crisis crimping cash-and-carry commercial custom, is a humbug, because, on the contrary, the current crisis has been caused by big-government Socialism reaching into, and destroying, almost every facet of Capitalism that used to exist in the late 19th century in America. Socialism, based on the religious prescriptions of the three major Western religions, has been married to the falsities of Keynesian economics, to create a witches brew of FDR-LBJ Socialism that has finally poisoned the patient. America will never emerge from this depressionary inflation until it adopts the sane, sound, and true principles of Austrian economics and radical free-market Capitalism. And groups like Hizb-ut-tahrir, and its growing influence in American metropolises, are only further obstacles in American Capitalist’s and Libertarian’s attempt to retake America for the system it was before the FED, Wilson, and FDR-LBJ welfarism.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367848713881</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:58:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367848734267-27</Id><Topic><Title>What Do Liberals And Terrorists Have In Common ?</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1367749340905</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 06:22:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The horsescat that organized religion has piled into the world never seems to stop coming, and it’s a shame that so much human energy must be wasted in cleaning up the stink it creates. In America, thanks to Jefferson’s wisdom, and the Christian radicals who fled authoritarian England so they could worship in peace, and were even so radical as to tolerate and sometime even welcome Jews into their new lifestyle, a life-style so radical in its intellectual foundations that it had never been seen in Europe, though it was later to be stained by the contradictions of slavery and the treatment of the Indians in a land that purported to champion Individual Liberty and Rights — in America, such a piling finally came to a stop, with the effective separation of Church and State under Wisechief Jefferson’s Revolutionary Constitution. But groups like Hizb, and the Bush-Obama expansions of “faith-based initiatives” programs which should be repealed by Congress immediately, and for which both Bush and Obama should have been impeached, are the bane of true Capitalists and Libertarians both in America and the world over. If you don’t like free-market Capitalism and the Constitution, there’s a vast Islamic world out there, where you won’t have to be paid interest on your savings, in which you can live.

Your messed up, if you support Hart-Smith you should be on Boeing's case all the time . Your like a person who will not stand up when something is wrong, like the supporters of Great Brition during our fight for independence or a #$%$ supporter in WWII who would sit by and watch terrible things happen to your fellow man, any person who does not own Boeing stock is ok, but now get off the porch and start speaking the truth about Boeing s failrues and why,. It is not squwaks that caused a 4 year delay on the 787 and it is nothing like the 777 that argument is false, the 777 was 100% engineered by Boeing and the plane was not grounded and worked from day one and is a big success , not the 787 4 years late 30 billion over budget , gounded, a public relations nightmare. the only reason Boeing is still in business is the heritage income from the 737 and the 777 and military gravey everthing since then that MD chicago has touched has turned to crapola the 747 is 2 billion over cost 2 years late and not selling as promissed you know me and you know I said that</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367849014027</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:03:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367849075072-31</Id><Topic><Title>why no person should own Boeing stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367817590971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 01:19:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Blah blah blah..more bs from your useless braincells waynedick!</Msg><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1367849075072</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:04:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367849106956-32</Id><Topic><Title>What Do Liberals And Terrorists Have In Common ?</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1367749340905</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 06:22:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there is no such thing as an Islamic intellectual just as there is no such thing as a conservative intellectual-----------members of these groups are abysmally st000000000pid</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367849106956</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:05:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367849148330-33</Id><Topic><Title>What Do Liberals And Terrorists Have In Common ?</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1367749340905</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 06:22:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are so full of sh.t I the readers can smell you across the internet</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367849148330</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:05:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367849242865-34</Id><Topic><Title>why no person should own Boeing stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367817590971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 01:19:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>domerrrr45 that is the sound tonight that comes when i think of you when I visit the can tonight , blaaa b laaa blaaa</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367849242865</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:07:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367849246821-35</Id><Topic><Title>why no person should own Boeing stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367817590971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 01:19:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dell George is a failed person- he proved it by getting fired from his urinal cleanup tech job over at Renton</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367849246821</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:07:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367849370859-36</Id><Topic><Title>why no person should own Boeing stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367817590971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 01:19:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More like your braincells squeaking !

Nice of you to forget it, I knwo you read me your a Boeing Hack here all the time. I swing trade, for most stocks it is better to make money all the time on swing trades. When you are laughing at me, think about the 185% you missed on Airbus in five years while Boeing went up almost zero. and is now up 20% mainly on the fake stock buyback in the past 3 months, well good for you freeveritas you better put the recent Boeing money you made in the bank. Freeveritas , if that is your usual and customary stock trade? You wait for 5 years for a failure 787 Md outsource grounding to get a manipulated stock gain. you going to hope for another 73 7MAX outsourcing grounding then for another 20 per cent gain? Freeveritas, good luck with that then. Freeveritas , once more, check out my user comment on the week gains this week is another start over and make more money. As long as the government pumps the stock market and you watch the right stocks you can make 5 to 25 percent every week or so . It only took you 5 years to make 25% on Boeing and miss 185% on Airbus so keep laughing it is good for the spirit. I am so happy you can have a sense of humor at times like this for you. Keep up the good cheer you need it.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1367852165649</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:56:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367852204320-66</Id><Topic><Title>Al Gore claims that he averted a civil war in 2000</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367758102232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 08:48:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well fat one- you can make that zero undetected terrorist attacks in 77 years under Democrats till the idiot President Bush came along- and that counts</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367852204320</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:56:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367852271250-67</Id><Topic><Title>Al Gore claims that he averted a civil war in 2000</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367758102232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 08:48:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Father Zosima, thank you, for your reply.

Leaders in Washington knew the Benghazi massacre was a terrorist operation "almost immediately," and officials on the ground suspected as much "from the get-go." The administration misleadingly denied and downplayed the terrorist connection for weeks. (2) A special ops officer with detailed knowledge of the US response to the attacks says Washington could have ordered a rescue/intervention mission to save American lives, but did not, for reasons that remain unclear. (3) Lawyers for potential whistle-blowers within the government say their clients have been intimidated into silence by the administration. These attorneys also allege that the government has been uncooperative in granting them security clearances, which they say are necessary to facilitate adequate legal representation. (4) Nearly eight months after the fact, and as political scrutiny is again ratcheting up, the FBI has finally released photos of several Benghazi suspects. No arrests have been made in connection to the deadly terrorist attack so far. (5) Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's signature appeared on a memo denying requests for increased security assets in Benghazi. Amb. Chris Stevens and his predecessor in Tripoli both asked for enhanced protection due to the increasingly dangerous climate on the ground. (6) The identities of three Benghazi whistle-blowers/witnesses who will testify this week have now been revealed.

The old expression, "once burned, twice a fool" applies. Under Bush, though just in office for a little over eight months, an attack occurred greater than Pearl Harbor. Having said that, no other attack then occurred while he was in office. Now, when Obama gets into office, what does he do? Apologizes to the Muslim world for our behavior, declares that there is no more "war on terror", promises to shut down Gitmo, says that blatant terrorists acts are "workplace violence" incidents, undermines Israel's security by driving out the leadership of nearby states and turning them into Islamic extremist states, fails to come to the rescue to Americans under attack in Benghazi and lies to the American public about it. Tells Mexico that their violence is our fault. Shall I go on? The terrorists don't have to sneak into our country, they and their chief sympathizer apparently have taken up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1367860391729</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:13:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367861507893-95</Id><Title>Clinton sought end-run around counterterrorism bureau on night of Benghazi attack</Title><Msg>On the night of Sept. 11, as the Obama administration scrambled to respond to the Benghazi terror attacks, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and a key aide effectively tried to cut the department's own counterterrorism bureau out of the chain of reporting and decision-making, according to a "whistle-blower" witness from that bureau who will soon testify to the charge before Congress, Fox News has learned. That witness is Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for operations in the agency’s counterterrorism bureau. Sources tell Fox News Thompson will level the allegation against Clinton during testimony on Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. Fox News has also learned that another official from the counterterrorism bureau -- independently of Thompson -- voiced the same complaint about Clinton and Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy to trusted national security colleagues back in October. Extremists linked to Al Qaeda stormed the U.S. Consulate and a nearby annex on Sept. 11, in a heavily armed and well-coordinated eight-hour assault that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans. Thompson considers himself a whistle-blower whose account was suppressed by the official investigative panel that Clinton convened to review the episode, the Accountability Review Board (ARB). Thompson's lawyer, Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney, has further alleged that his client has been subjected to threats and intimidation by as-yet-unnamed superiors at State, in advance of his cooperation with Congress. Sources close to the congressional investigation who have been briefed on what Thompson will testify tell Fox News the veteran counterterrorism official concluded on Sept. 11 that Clinton and Kennedy tried to cut the counterterrorism bureau out of the loop as they and other Obama administration officials weighed how to respond</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367861507893</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:31:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367861968182-96</Id><Title>Why did Obama Pick Susan Rice to Lie for Hillary Instead of Letting Hillary</Title><Msg>....lie herself about Benghazi when Hillary was a much more accomplished liar and much more experienced at lying than was Susan Rice.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367861968182</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:39:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367862339423-97</Id><Topic><Title>Why did Obama Pick Susan Rice to Lie for Hillary Instead of Letting Hillary</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367861968182</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:39:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Benghazi is totally unraveling for the democrats.

He's the career State Department official whose "jaw hit the floor" when Susan Rice went the 'Full Ginsburg' to spread bogus talking points in the immediate wake of the 9/11 Benghazi attacks. If you thought exposing and debunking the administration's initial dishonest spin was the biggest bombshell Hicks was preparing to drop on Wednesday, you'd be wrong. CBS News reports: The deputy of slain U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens has told congressional investigators that a team of Special Forces prepared to fly from Tripoli to Benghazi during the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks was forbidden from doing so by U.S. Special Operations Command South Africa. The account from Gregory Hicks is in stark contrast to assertions from the Obama administration, which insisted that nobody was ever told to stand down and that all available resources were utilized. Hicks gave private testimony to congressional investigators last month in advance of his upcoming appearance at a congressional hearing Wednesday. According to excerpts released Monday, Hicks told investigators that SOCAFRICA commander Lt. Col. Gibson and his team were on their way to board a C-130 from Tripoli for Benghazi prior to an attack on a second U.S. compound "when [Col. Gibson] got a phone call from SOCAFRICA which said, 'you can't go now, you don't have the authority to go now.' And so they missed the flight ... They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it." No assistance arrived from the U.S. military outside of Libya during the hours that Americans were under attack or trapped inside compounds by hostile forces armed with rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and AK-47 rifles. Hicks told congressional investigators that if the U.S. had quickly sent a military aircraft over Benghazi, it might have saved American lives. The U.S. Souda Bay Naval Base is an hour's flight from Libya.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367873926930</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 16:58:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367874291304-126</Id><Title>Hillary and Obama let American Heroes Twist in the Wind and be Killed</Title><Msg>This explosive testimony -- which will play out under the bright lights later this week -- corroborates earlier allegations that support teams were repeatedly instructed to get ready, then to stand down, throughout the eight-hour slaughter. The Obama administration has claimed they deployed "all available resources" during the attack, an account that does not align with several pieces of countervailing evidence: (1) We've just learned from another whistle-blower (Mark Thompson) that Secretary Clinton actively cut the State Department's counter-terrorism bureau out of the loop during the terrorist attack. (Why?) CBS News reported last November that the Obama administration also didn't convene the inter-agency Counter-terrorism Security Group (CSG) during the raid. Gen. Dempsey has asserted that the State Department never requested any military assistance from DoD that night. Might that have been because Clinton and the White House were already committed to a political posture of downplaying the terrorism angle? (2) A separate unnamed whistle-blower says an elite US task force training in Croatia could have arrived prior to the latter stages of the siege, during which Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were murdered. (Remember, Doherty and Woods responded to the consulate attack on their own initiative). (3) The US had unmanned predator drones hovering overhead throughout much of the attack. One Democratic Senator couldn't or wouldn't say whether those drones were armed. (4) CBS News, in late October: The Pentagon says it did move a team of special operators from central Europe to the large Naval Air Station in Sigonella, Italy, but gave no other details. Sigonella is just an hour's flight from Libya. Other nearby bases include Aviano and Souda Bay. Military sources tell CBS News that resources at the three bases include fighter jets and Specter AC-130 gunships, which the sources say can be extremely effective in flying in and buzzing a crowd to disperse it..."You find a way to make this happen," Berntsen says. "There isn't a plan for every single engagement. Sometimes you have to be able to make adjustments. They made zero adjustments in this. They stood and they watched and our people died."</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367874291304</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 17:04:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367875174438-127</Id><Title>More Holes in the Administration's Benghazi Account</Title><Msg>Then there is today's aforementioned revelation from Hicks. Taken together, this information points to a scenario in which the Washington-based chain of command declined to exercise several contingencies that could have saved American lives. Let's recall what Gen. Dempsey told Sen. Lindsey Graham in Congressional testimony two months ago: GRAHAM: My question is, did anybody leave any base anywhere to go to the aid of the people who were under attack in Benghazi, Libya before the attack ended. DEMPSEY: No, because the attack ended before we could get off the ground. Hicks will reportedly also tell Congress that special forces reinforcements were urgently needed in Benghazi, in light of the US diplomatic mission's "bare minimum" security capacity. That threadbare security presence is a scandal in and of itself; terrorists had launched escalating attacks one numerous Western targets in Benghazi in the weeks and months leading up to September 11, including two attempts against the US consulate. Four gravestones offer a clear justification for Amb. Stevens' numerous requests for more resources; far less apparent are the reasons why those petitions were summarily denied. I'll leave you with White House spokesman Jay Carney ducking questions on these new developments earlier today: Shorter Carney: Take your beef up with the Pentagon (who is the Commander-in-Chief, again -- and isn't embassy/consulate security within the Secretary of State's purview?), and kindly refer to our internal investigation (which is now being investigated by an Inspector General for ignoring evidence from whistle-blowers like the men coming forward this week).</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367875174438</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 17:19:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367876695472-128</Id><Topic><Title>Is there Anyone on the Board that Doesn't know I'm a DFC</Title><Username>commiechrisgenna</Username><Timestamp>1367854601278</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 11:36:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you a DFC?</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1367876695472</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 17:44:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367876739112-129</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty and Floyd seem to be jealous of my DFC</Title><Username>commiechrisgenna</Username><Timestamp>1367854710664</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 11:38:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your DFC?

A CNN/TIME poll shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans aren’t interested in sacrificing rights to combat terrorism.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367883076228</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 19:31:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367884751955-144</Id><Topic><Title>More Holes in the Administration's Benghazi Account</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367875174438</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 17:19:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's hope the leftist media now begins to turn on Obama now knowing Obama's total negligence in the Benghazi murders.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1367884751955</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 19:59:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367884893654-145</Id><Title>benghazi pre3dator drone pilot observed attack on embassy</Title><Msg>video files were directed to various agencies all over world- LIVE - plus tapes may be available His name and duties were part of unclassified report - but NOONE has ever asked him he KNEW from the get go - there was NO demonstration He could see who was armed- who wasn't, etc Info S/B avail under FOIA- but no one ever asked !!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1367884893654</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 20:01:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367885074245-146</Id><Title>Benghazi Bingers!</Title><Msg>When birth cert questions, higher ed questions, Marxism charges, attacks on drone attacks, not wearing a flag lapel pin, charges of killing off Seal Team members, and accusations of martial law in Boston just won't cut it, the next fistful of spaghetti to be thrown against the wall ...</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1367885074245</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 20:04:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367885327432-147</Id><Title>Republicans Defeat Obama and Democrat on Golf Course</Title><Msg>Obama, an avid golfer with a respectable 17 handicap, rarely takes politics to the greens, preferring instead to golf with friends and staffers far out of the sight of the reporters who travel with him. But he has been trying harder in his second term with a schmooze offensive, reaching out to members of Congress whom he has blamed for thwarting proposals he believes would improve the economy. "Most of the talk centered on the round of golf and not the latest round of legislative negotiations in Congress," a White House official said. Playing the south course at the Andrews military base in suburban Washington, Obama paired up with Democrat Mark Udall of Colorado, the top-ranked golfer in Congress as measured by Golf Digest in 2011. The magazine estimated Udall's handicap at 2. But the match was won by the Republicans. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia shot a hole-in-one on the par 3 11th hole. Chambliss, whose handicap is 7.4, was joined by Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has a 2.1 handicap.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367885327432</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 20:08:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367885420087-148</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary, Hillary Wherefore art thou Hillary?</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367863285805</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 14:01:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You really don't have enough to be mad about, do you?</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1367885420087</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 20:10:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367885651740-149</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi Bingers!</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1367885074245</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 20:04:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is a great chance that Faux Noise has been braying about this and their followers are obediently performing their trained seal echo chamber response.

Home gardeners who grow their own plants from non-regulated seeds would be considered criminals under this law. The draft text of the law, which has already been amended several times due to a huge backlash from gardeners, is viewable here. “This law will immediately stop the professional development of vegetable varieties for home gardeners, organic growers, and small-scale market farmers,” said Ben Gabel, vegetable breeder and director of The Real Seed Catalogue. “Home gardeners have really different needs – for example they grow by hand, not machine, and can’t or don’t want to use such powerful chemical sprays. There’s no way to register the varieties suitable for home use as they don’t meet the strict criteria of the Plant Variety Agency, which is only concerned about approving the sort of seed used by industrial farmers.” Virtually all plants, vegetable seeds and gardeners to eventually be registered by government All governments are, of course, infatuated with the idea of registering everybody and everything. Under Title IV of the proposed EU law: Title IV Registration of varieties in national and Union registers The varieties, in order to be made available on the market throughout the Union, shall be included in a national register or in the Union register via direct application procedure to the CVPO. Gardeners must also pay fees to the EU bureaucracy for the registration of their seeds.
