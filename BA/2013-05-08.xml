Somehow dumb idiot #$%$ think that is a straw in Obama#$%$. Economy 101 debt will have to be paid back someday, in this case when the US has a president willing to consider the next one or two generations. All this Obama can think about is tomorrow or this last election. Its like black men and their families, to hell with them. We obviously have a dead beat president.

Haldeman discussed using the CIA to slow down the FBI investigation. It was the cover-up, as history records, that eventually brought about Nixon’s resignation in disgrace. Now, Congress is investigating an alleged cover-up of the terrorist attack Sept. 11, 2012, on the U.S. foreign service facility in Benghazi, Libya, amid predictions from prominent voices that the scandal will bring down the Obama administration. Former Arkansas governor and onetime presidential candidate Mike Huckabee made the bold prediction this week, ahead of a House hearing Wednesday that will feature witnesses of the attack. “I believe that before it’s all over, this president will not fill out his full term,” he said. “I know that puts me on a limb. But this is not minor. It wasn’t minor when Richard Nixon lied to the American people and worked with those in his administration to cover up what really happened in Watergate. “But, I remind you – as bad as Watergate was, because it broke the trust between the president and the people, no one died. This is more serious because four Americans did in fact die.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368011565670</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 07:12:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368011681903-40</Id><Topic><Title>Why do do RWNJ' fear new DOW territory</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1368006750048</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 05:52:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seen a few, was ok, but prefer many other bands.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1368011681903</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 07:14:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368011974948-41</Id><Topic><Title>Bengazi ...what happenned was criminal one witness after anotehr coming forward</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368011565670</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 07:12:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Kent Raven thinks Occam's Razor applies to all scenarios.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1368011974948</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 07:19:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368012306960-42</Id><Topic><Title>Bengazi ...what happenned was criminal one witness after anotehr coming forward</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368011565670</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 07:12:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What happened in Bengazi is a crime pure and simple ...and if this were the America I grew up in impeachment proceedings would have begun YESTERDAY...you know Obama has at least a half a dozen ways to get impeached, yet the somabyatch gets away ....

Politically, it is the system of laissez-faire (freedom). Legally it is a system of objective laws (rule of law as opposed to rule of man). Economically, when such freedom is applied to the sphere of production its’ result is the free-market. Government Regulated or Crony Capitalism are terms describing a capitalist society as being based on the close relationships between businessmen and the state. Instead of success being determined by a free market and the rule of law, the success of a business is dependent on the favoritism that is shown to it by the ruling government in the form of tax breaks, government grants and other incentives. Government Regulated (Crony) Capitalism is a capitalist economy in which success in business depends on close relationships between business people and government officials. It may be exhibited by favoritism in the distribution of legal permits, government grants, special tax breaks, or other forms of dirigisme.[1] Crony capitalism is believed to arise when political cronyism spills over into the business world; self-serving friendships and family ties between businessmen and the government influence the economy and society to the extent that it corrupts public-serving economic and political ideals.</Msg><Username>commiechrisgenna</Username><Timestamp>1368016924366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 08:42:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368017012225-48</Id><Topic><Title>Bengazi ...what happenned was criminal one witness after anotehr coming forward</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368011565670</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 07:12:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Perhaps Nixon was set up?

As the White House grapples with a growing backlash over its Libya lies and lapses, President Obama's apologists are gearing up for battle. Put on your hip-waders. Grab those tar buckets. Get ready for Operation Smear Benghazi Whistleblowers. Capitol Hill hearings this Wednesday on the deadly 9/11 consulate attack by jihadists will feature three compelling witnesses, all State Department veterans: Gregory N. Hicks, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya and highest-ranking U.S. diplomat in the country at the time of the Benghazi jihad attacks; Mark I. Thompson, a former Marine who now serves as deputy coordinator for operations in the agency's Counterterrorism Bureau; and Eric Nordstrom, a diplomatic security officer who was the top security officer in Libya. Nordstrom first testified last fall about how State Department brass spurned his requests for increased security at the compound. Hicks and Thompson are coming forward publicly for the first time this week with more damning evidence contradicting Team Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's claims about the administration's response the night of the attack and in the ensuing months of cover-ups. According to the House Oversight Committee, Hicks reportedly will refute Team Obama's claims that nobody was told to stand down and that all military resources available were used in the rescue efforts. As Special Forces prepared to fly from Tripoli to Benghazi to save lives during the attacks, Hicks says the team received a phone call from the U.S. Special Operations Command Africa telling them "you can't go" and that the decision was "purely political." The State Department press office already has accused Victoria Toensing, attorney for one of the Benghazi whistleblowers, of "lying" about administration pressure on her clients. Left-wing operatives funded by billionaire George Soros have taken to Twitter to mock reports of fear and intimidation among the new witnesses.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368021115637</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:51:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368022083167-57</Id><Topic><Title>Operation Smear Benghazi Whistleblowers Already Underway</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368021115637</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:51:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The problem here is democrats know Benghazi isn't going to go away because of the 4 senseless deaths caused by Obama's and Hillary's negligence.

(The Borowitz Report)—Former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford’s stunning upset in a special congressional election on Tuesday served as an inspiration to liars across the state and beyond, prominent members of the lying community said tonight. “In America, liars are always made to feel bad about ourselves, as if what we’re doing is wrong,” said Harland Dorrinson, fifty-seven, a liar from suburban Charleston. “Mark Sanford’s victory tonight is a victory for the lying lifestyle.” Carol Foyler, thirty-six, a liar from Myrtle Beach, echoed those sentiments: “For the millions of dishonest children across America, tonight Mark Sanford has given them hope that someday, they can be somebody.” At his victory rally in Charleston, the former governor acknowledged the liars in the audience and said that his victory sent an important message: “Every lie, no matter how big or small, has value.” “As your Governor, I abused your trust. And as God is my witness, as your congressman, I will abuse it again,” he said, to thunderous applause. Mr. Sanford, who had been behind in the polls in the waning weeks of the race, owed much of his last-minute surge to the support of the lying community, exit polls showed. According to those exit polls, Mr. Sanford held a three-to-one lead among voters who described themselves as liars, cheaters, or sleazebags.

By David Weige During the drive to one of Barack Obama’s final campaign stops, navigating the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, I found a dozen or so protesters standing where the media might see them. They held up handmade posters, demanding more questions and answers about the Sept. 11 attack on America’s consulate in Benghazi. One sign simply named the four Americans killed that day, in letters too big to miss. The others assigned blame: Obama Said “Stand Down” Ask About Benghazi Tell the Truth Obama Media at the time—conservative media, especially—were reporting every possible turn, twist, and revelation about the attacks. The “stand down” theory originated in an October 26 Fox News EXCLUSIVE (capital letters in the original), which reported that the CIA “chain of command” had “told the CIA operators twice to ‘stand down’ rather than help” besieged Americans. A complementary theory, advanced by the father of the murdered Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, suggested that the White House had a “live feed” of the attack and sat shiva, doing nothing. Another theory, universally shared: The White House, led by people like UN Ambassador Susan Rice, was engaged in a massive cover-up. This anger and panic added impetus to a study of the Benghazi killings, conducted by the State Department’s Accountability Review Board. The grimmest tales, the fodder for outrage and fulmination, were debunked. In fact, the problems at Benghazi started months before the attack, not in a fit of on-the-spot cowardice. Advertisement According to the report, the incident began around 9:42 p.m., after the day’s work was over. (To simplify matters, I’ve converted the military time in the report to standard time.) There were seven Americans at the consulate, which consisted of several buildings, and they were guarded by four members of the February 17 Martyr’s Brigade. “Guarded” is a lose term. A regional security officer saw, via a security camera, that “dozens of individuals” were marching through the compound’s main gate. The guards had fled; a police car, which was supposed to be outside, was gone. The official account continues: Just prior to receiving the TDY RSO’s distress call shortly after [9:42] local, the head of Annex security heard multiple explosions coming from the north in the direction of the SMC. The Annex security head immediately began to organize his team’s departure and notified his superiors, who began to contact local security elements to request support. The Annex response team departed its compound in two vehicles at approximately [10:05] local. The Oct. 26 Fox News report doesn’t read this way. “Former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods was part of a small team who was at the CIA annex about a mile from the U.S. consulate where Ambassador Chris Stevens and his team came under attack,” reported Fox’s Jennifer Griffin. “When he and others heard the shots fired, they informed their higher-ups at the annex to tell them what they were hearing and requested permission to go to the consulate and help out. They were told to ‘stand down,’ according to sources familiar with the exchange. Soon after, they were again told to ‘stand down.’ ” The “stand down” line resonated. On this year’s presidential campaign trail, Sen. John McCain said he was hearing from “veterans all over the world” about how the commander-in-chief had left men behind. “Four brave Americans lost their lives, and they didn’t have to!” said McCain at an Oct. 30 Ohio rally for Mitt Romney. “Beginning, during, and ending that terrible period in Benghazi, the United States president was AWOL.” This made it sound like Obama, atop the chain of command, allowed yellow-bellied bureaucrats to let men die. That’s not backed up by the report. At 9:50 p.m., the main American embassy in Tripoli was talking to Stevens, who said the consulate was under attack “before the call was cut off.” The Americans scrambled to send a security team from Tripoli to Benghazi. In the intervening hours, Stevens was killed, pronounced dead at around 2 a.m. “by apparent smoke inhalation.” Three hours later, the security team arrived, and “less than fifteen minutes later, the Annex came under mortar and RPG attack, with five mortar rounds impacting close together in under 90 seconds. Three rounds hit the roof of an Annex building, killing security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.” They weren’t denied help. The help came too late. That doesn’t alter the tragedy, but it alters the context. Back to the death of Stevens—the murder committed by “smoke inhalation.” The report describes the start of the clash as a rampaging mob of “armed intruders” who “used filled fuel cans that were stored next to new, uninstalled generators at the February 17 living quarters near the C1 entrance to burn that building,” and “lit on fire vehicles that were parked nearby.” Stevens had been requesting more security, but on the ground, that day, things were quiet until the mob arrived. As Erik Wemple points out, this contradicts the other damaging accusation from the scandal known as “Benghazi-gate.” The Obama administration’s first fumbling attempts to explain the killings put them in the context of “protests” against a viral anti-Muhammad movie. On Sept. 16, UN Ambassador Susan Rice probably talked her way out of a promotion by sticking to talking points on the event and saying a “spontaneous” protest was hijacked by an armed “clusters of extremists.” McCain and other critics scoffed at the gullibility on display. “Most people don’t bring rocket-propelled grenades and heavy weapons to a demonstration,” said McCain on CBS News, speaking immediately after Rice. The truth lay in between the talking points and the snark. The mob that crashed the consulate was attacking diplomats. But they were able to kill our ambassador, and sow confusion, by setting fires. The heavy weapons came later. So far, three State Department officials have fallen on their swords in response to this report. That was what investigators asked for, basically, blaming the circumstances in Benghazi on “senior State Department officials” who “demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability.” They failed to provide security before Sept. 11. On Tuesday, describing the video he’d been able to watch of the attack, Sen. Bob Corker told reporters that the compound was so wanly protected that “you or I could have walked right in.” That doesn’t suggest a real-time campaign of cowardice. It doesn’t suggest a cover-up, either. It suggests that the neglected budget for embassy security needs a harder look in 2013.

Instead, some four years later, those plots are turning on the Party.... Freedom Works gloated recently after a humiliated Speaker Boehner and Eric Cantor had to pull a Republican “healthcare” (defund ObamaCare) bill for lack of support. It’s civil war, on top of fractured leadership with a side of gleeful outside groups prodding on the dysfunction for their own purposes. But it’s worse than that. We saw much of that last session. This session is even worse, as their foiled plots did nothing but drive them further into camps of now divided extremism. The gerrymandered districts they carved out with their 2010 win are only furthering the extremism, as the feverish electorate within their congressional districts drives them deeper into their chosen camp of Republican extremism. Things are so bad within the party that the House is in a perpetual state of “stalemate” according to Politico. Even House leadership are having “trouble staying on the same page”. This results in them being unable to pass anything of any import, and instead trying to fill up their time with “frivolous” (according to Nancy Pelosi) activities like taking two days to pass legislation to extend the government’s helium reserves. For this reason, voters should not expect much in the way of legislation, unless it’s something Boehner can get passed with the help of Democrats. It might be fair to start referring to Boehner as the Democratic Minority Leader if this keeps up. Without Pelosi assisting him from the wings, Boehner would be doomed right now.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368040518733</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:15:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368041862197-132</Id><Topic><Title>Plots Against Obama Have Morphed into Republican Self-Destruction</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368040518733</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:15:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What plots?

Hicks, who was on the ground in Libya on September 11, 2012, said Clinton called him around 2 a.m. from Washington to ask "what was going on." Hicks responded by saying the consulate was under attack. He never told her about a protest outside the consulate because there wasn't one. "The only report that our mission made through every channel was that this was an attack," Hicks said. "No protest." In his recollection of events the night of September 11, 2012, Hicks stated that U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens called him and said, "We are under attack," just before he was brutally murdered and dragged through the streets. Again, no mention of a protest. "The video was not instigative of anything that was going on in Libya," Hicks said. "We saw no demonstrations related to the video anywhere in Libya." Hicks also noted that Twitter feeds were being monitored and showed Ansar al-Sharia took credit for the terrorist attack and had control of the hospital where Ambassador Stevens was taken. Despite knowing Benghazi was a terrorist attack from the very beginning, after all she was briefed by Hicks who was on the ground, Clinton shamelessly stood in front of the flag draped caskets of dead Americans and blamed a YouTube video anyway. Watch starting at the 6 minute mark. "We've seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing to do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that, because it is senseless and totally unacceptable."</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368044256792</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 16:17:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368044721797-143</Id><Title>Real Bengazi story: US Op to arm Alqaeda</Title><Msg>During an interview with CNBC’s Larry Kudlow, radio talk show host John Baxter said the resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus had nothing to do with an extramarital affair with his biographer, reserve Army officer Paula Broadwell, but was related to U.S. policy in the Middle East, ongoing “color revolutions” in the region, and specifically the operation underway to arm al-Qaeda in Syria and overthrow the al-Assad regime. “Benghazi is not about Libya, Benghazi is about the policy of the Obama administration to involve the United States without clarity to the American people, not only in Libya but throughout the whole of the Arab world now in turmoil,” Baxter told Kudlow. “Benghazi is about the NSC directing an operation that is perhaps shadowy, perhaps a presidential finding, perhaps doesn’t, that takes arms and men and puts them into Syria in the guise of the Free Syria Army.” Retired Lt. General William Boykin said in January that Stevens was in Benghazi as part of an effort to arm al-Qaeda, what the corporate media calls the rebels.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368044721797</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 16:25:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368046268942-144</Id><Topic><Title>Republican charges of a cover-up are pure fiction.</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368030250708</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 12:24:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sure are doing lot's of "projecting" around here..............</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1368046268942</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 16:51:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368046551813-145</Id><Title>First Degree for Jodi Arias</Title><Msg>She's gonna get the needle.....Justice for Jodi not Mercy.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368046551813</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 16:55:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368046992105-146</Id><Topic><Title>The Cancer of Government Regulated Crony Capitalism</Title><Username>commiechrisgenna</Username><Timestamp>1368016924366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 08:42:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only regulations free markets need is against fraud and non compliance of contract.

The NTSB said the it doesn't reflect any unusual urgency or shift in the investigation. " Still, the hiring of a contractor to closely examine both tested and untested cells provides further detail about an investigation that has drawn worldwide attention since the entire fleet of 50 Boeing planes was grounded on January 16, after a second battery overheated on a flight in Japan. The NTSB has published hundreds of pages of findings about the Boston fire, and conducted two rounds of hearings last month. It is expected recommend changes to the Federal Aviation Administration when it concludes the investigation, likely by the end of the year. Boeing said it is fully supporting the NTSB investigation and working with customers to install a redesigned battery system and return Dreamliners to passenger service. BUT NOT REPLACING LITHIUM BATTERIES WITH NICAD WHICH AR PROVEN SAFE The NTSB said that as part of its investigation, it also plans to perform "tear-down examinations" of the 787 batteries. After the two incidents, Boeing added more safeguards, BUT DID NOT CHANGE OUT LITHIUM TO NICAD LIKE AIRBUS IS DOING FOR THEIR 787 BEATER NEW PLANE HUMM ---- The FAA approved the changes last month, lifting the ban on flights that lasted more than three months and cost airlines and MAKE THAT BOEING SHAREHOLDERS WHO WILL BE PAYING FOR THAT FAILURE OVER TIME millions of dollars.

Backed by business, the bill is part of an effort by budget-slashing Republicans to project a kinder and gentler image, particularly with women and working families. On a nearly party-line vote of 223-204, the House approved the measure and sent it to the Senate where President Barack Obama's majority Democrats appear certain to kill it. The bill would permit workers in the private sector, like those now in the public sector, to swap overtime pay for compensatory time off. They would get 1-1/2 hours time off for each hour of overtime, based on a standard 40-hour work week. "There is no reason in the world for anyone to object to this bill," said House Republican leader Eric Cantor, a leading force behind the legislation. Republican Representative Martha Roby, chief sponsor of the measure, said: "Our message to the American people is this: We want to get Washington out of the way of how you use your time." "I'm a mom," Roby said. "This (bill) is about helping working moms and dads. This is about the ability to spend time at home. This could change lives." Critics - including the AFL-CIO, the nation's biggest federation of unions, and the National Partnership for Women and Families - complain that despite Republican claims to the contrary the measure lacks adequate enforcement. Opponents say employers could pressure workers to take time off, not overtime pay, effectively shrinking their paychecks. The White House, in a veto threat on Monday, wrote: "This legislation undermines the existing right to hard-earned overtime pay ... while misrepresenting itself as a workplace flexibility measure." Republicans rejected such complaints. They noted that the bill mandates that time off in lieu of overtime pay would be voluntary and would guard against coercion by employers. AMENDS 1938 LAW Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House, said labor laws need to be updated to reflect the changing times. She said the bill would amend the 1938 "Fair Labor Standards Act to allow private sector employers to provide time off instead of overtime compensation if that's what the employee prefers." Cantor has pushed for "workplace flexibility" as he tries to rebrand his party after last year's elections, which saw Republicans take a drubbing. While not wavering from conservative principles, such as opposition to tax hikes, Cantor expressed a new willingness to help the needy and working families. On Wednesday, Cantor sought to rally support for the bill, declaring: "This act will help parents all across America." Democrats disagreed. One by one, House Democratic women stood on the chamber's floor to denounce Republicans for bringing up the bill days before Sunday's Mother's Day. "More work, less pay for working mom. No way to say happy Mother's Day," said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Democrats predicted that the bill, like a number of similar ones in recent years, would not become law. "Everybody on this floor knows that," said Representative Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the House. "But we are wasting our time on it." "We ought to be working on creating jobs and restoring fiscal discipline," Hoyer said. "Not a partisan rollback of workers' rights, but a bipartisan compromise to help put more Americans to work."</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368053115268</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 18:45:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368053310903-170</Id><Topic><Title>NY dim c maloney er baloney gets ** in wringer</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368052688054</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 18:38:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She reminded me of Jar Jar Binks both in looks and intelligence.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368053310903</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 18:48:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368053760427-171</Id><Topic><Title>Air China to buy 100 Airbus Aircraft</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1368024410736</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 10:46:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Air China, by far, keeps the filthiest plans I've eve n flown on.

Throughout the presidential election last year, if he was talked about at all, it was mostly in the context of how poisonous his divisive shtick has become to the Republican Party. That’s a far cry from the early 1990s, when the radio host changed the face of modern discourse with his ability to break down the country’s salient liberal-conservative divide into the most puerile of terms. Now, Limbaugh is feuding with Cumulus Media Inc. (NASDAQ:CMLS) — the company that broadcasts his radio program on 40 stations in 36 markets — over who is to blame for an ongoing decline in advertising revenue. Lew Dickey, Cumulus Media’s chief officer, has been pointing the finger at Limbaugh, and in particular a grassroots advertising boycott that erupted in early 2012, following the infamous Sandra Fluke controversy. Limbaugh, in case you’d forgotten, called Fluke a #$%$” and a “prostitute” after the Georgetown University student spoke out in support of insurance mandates for contraceptives. He later apologized – profusely so – but the damage was done. People were fed up, and they took to the Internet and social media to send a message to Limbaugh’s advertisers that they won’t support any business that supports Limbaugh’s brand of radio rabble-rousing. Jittery over the response, advertisers began to bolt. Some never came back, including Geico, Sears, John Deere, Netflix, Capitol One and hundreds of others. It has been 14 months since the controversy first began, and the boycott continues. Under the hashtag #StopRush, Twitter users signal out Rush-friendly businesses — Dairy Queen, the Home Depot, Golfsmith — telling them enough is enough, and in some cases hitting them where it hurts: Hey @dairyqueen Are you still advertising on Limbaugh? I won’t buy blizzards until you stop supporting hate radio #StopRush — Daniel Beerthuis (@DanielBeerthuis) May 7, 2013 IBTimes reached out to some of those advertisers for comment. Only the Home Depot responded. In an email, spokesman Stephen Holmes said the company does not advertise on Limbaugh’s program, or any opinion show. “It’s been our policy not to sponsor opinion shows, which would include Rush or any others, for that matter,” Holmes said. “An ad might run occasionally during a news break, but those are programming errors that occur at local stations from time to time.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368055171270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 19:19:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368055204819-178</Id><Topic><Title>Is Rush Finished?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368055171270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 19:19:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And what’s been the result of this yearlong scourge of the companies responsible for Rush’s livelihood? It’s been working. That free-market system that conservatives are so fond of touting is operating with machinelike precision — or at least that’s one way to look at Cumulus Media’s first-quarter results released on Tuesday. Adjusted Ebitda fell 22.1 percent from the same period last year, while net revenue fell 1.3 percent to $232.9 million due in part to “general lower advertising spending in some of our markets,” according to the company’s statement. During a conference call with analysts, Dickey was asked if the decline can be attributed directly to the StopRush campaign. According to Daily Kos, his only response was to say that it was a “tough go of it in the last year and that the facts are indisputable.” He had a similar take in August when he reported that the company’s top three radio stations had lost $5.5 million in advertising revenue, which he attributed in part to the boycott. One of the basic tenets of the free-market system is that the market participants choose what gets produced and from the looks of things, they’re not choosing Limbaugh. Not that Limbaugh himself sees it that way. On his radio show, he’s made it clear that he believes “media buyers at advertising agencies are young women fresh out of college, liberal feminists who hate conservatism.” And according to the New York Daily News, he’s absolutely fed up with taking the blame for Cumulus’ advertising woes. On Sunday, Politico’s Dylan Byers reported that Limbaugh is even considering severing ties with Cumulus when his contract expires at the end of this year. That would put Limbaugh’s show in potential limbo for Cumulus’s network of radio stations. The show could get picked up by competitors or Limbaugh could go the Howard Stern/satellite radio route, as Mediabistro’s Alex Weprin theorized on Monday. But even if that were the case, it wouldn’t bode well for the host’s declining influence. When Stern made the transition to satellite, he was left with a fraction of his former audience. And while he’s publicly stated that he’s happier without the FCC-imposed restraints of terrestrial radio, his recent judging gig on “America’s Got Talent” is proof enough that he missed the spotlight. Could a similar path be in the cards for Limbaugh? Imagine him sharing a panel with Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey on “American Idol.” It would certainly get people talking.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368055204819</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 19:20:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368055522466-179</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans defy White House veto threat, pass workplace law</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368053115268</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 18:45:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why is that always the case?

Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is reportedly in talks to settle a lawsuit over allegations that members of her 2012 presidential campaign staff stole an email list from a staffer in Iowa. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports that Bachmann went to Des Moines earlier this week to meet with lawyers for Barb Heki, the woman behind the lawsuit, who alleges that senior Bachmann staffers stole the contact list for a network of Iowa home-schoolers. From the Star-Tribune: The campaign has previously called the use of the list “inadvertent,” a view that Heki and campaign whistleblower Peter Waldron, a Florida pastor, have disputed publicly. Campaign officials eventually negotiated a $2,000 payment to rent the list from the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators (NICHE). Heki said she was blamed for misappropriating the database and was removed from the nonprofit’s board. One of the counts in her suit alleges libel and slander. Former State Sen. Kent Sorenson, who chaired Bachmann’s campaign in Iowa, has been accused of stealing the list, and is also being investigated for possibly accepting improper payments for his work on the campaign.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368055634761</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 19:27:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368056174704-181</Id><Topic><Title>Is Rush Finished?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368055171270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 19:19:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is Rushco near the end of his $400,000,000 dollar contract?

Zombie Industries has a line of 15 “zombie” targets, including one woman because, as the website says, “To discriminate against Women by not having them represented in our product selection would be just plain sexist.” The website features a promotional video showing several men “busting up a zombie chick.” Towards the end, the camera zooms up on a man holding a handgun to the prone mannequin’s head.

Now, as far as validating what has been previously alleged, the information is profound: 1) that air force aircraft were only three hours away in Italy (the attack lasted for nine hours); 2) that the Libyan government was basically useless and complicit; 3) that the ground folks made it very clear to Hilliary Clinton and the White House that this was an "attack" and not a youtube protest; 4) that the military (in place in Libya) was “ordered” to "stand down" and not support evacuation; and 5) that the ambassador's body was taken over by al Qaeda/terrorists. And we all know that Obama was more concerned with primping for his political pimping the next day in Las Vegas. So, if you were looking for the basis for articles of impeachment, they are there. Obama, Clinton, Rice, and Carney all willingly and purposely lied to the American public. Perhaps, the people need to tell Hilliary &amp; Co. "what difference does it make” by showing them the door.

With my other post, the adders will have enough to hiss at for the evening. So I will engage you, and much to Chris' chagrin, I will quote for the Bible: "The LORD detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy." (Proverbs 12:22) The American public needs to decide whether or not honesty is of value. What I don't get is that Obama &amp;Co. did not have to lie about anything. Despite his success in taking Osama down, the fact is, and EVERYONE with any sense knew at the time, that al Qaeda was alive and well. They could have played the Benghazi attack out as a terrorist attack, which it was, and they would still be in office today, and that would have been the end of that. Many people love the guy - for who knows what reason. However, his first response is instead to concoct a lie. So if he lies about that (something that he really might not have been able to alter as far as an end result) what else does he, has he, or will he lie about? Liars do not wake up one morning and lie once - it is part of a continuing habit.
