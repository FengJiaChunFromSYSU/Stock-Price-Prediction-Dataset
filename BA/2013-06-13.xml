Lion Air has long been one of Boeing's most loyal customers. Boeing is getting killed on the orders. Huge orders in the works. This Airbus CEO has a brain. That's why Boeing moved to Chicago, running the business on who you know, not on merit. Investors know that, Airbus has added huge value for investors. Boeing managers got eggs in the face.

President Obama, we are tired of your empty platitudes. You speak with a forked tongue, showing us with deeds the exact opposite of your words. You have no credibility left and your Attorney General is viewed with the respect level of Baghdad Bob. Congress' "consent" to these crimes is absolutely NO EXCUSE for you personally, Barack Obama. YOU promised this nation the exact opposite of what you have delivered. Instead of ending the horrible legacy of the Bush years, you've expanded and enshrined that legacy across the board. Instead of being the most transparent administration, you have become Nixonian in your secrecy and vendettas against the truth-tellers, shredding the Constitution as it pleases you in their persecution. This is now a mortal test of our Constitution and the future of this Nation. Government clearly refuses to reign itself in and abide by that Constitution. The true state of our situation is that now corporate interests control our increasingly authoritarian government that rules by might and popular opinion, and not the rule of law. Just like Germany a few decades back. I am not calling Obama "Hitler", but what happens after Obama? The freedoms earned and enjoyed in this country cannot be left open to interpretation by various political personalities as they cycle through office, or it is quickly doomed.

Boeing is asking carriers for patience until the decade’s end, when its so-called 777X with new wing and engines will be ready. For those BHT trolls remember, the famous James McNerney words that he said the , the customer would wait for the Boeing company to get around tot he 737Max ,just as soon as the MD , er I mean the fake Boeing company executive , James McNerney claimed it was his opinion that the customers carriers would wait for the 737max. Immediately two prior all Boeing carriers switched to Airbus and over 1000 Airbus planes were ordered on that statement. Well as usual Boeing executives have not learned their lesson. What flies in the corporate board romm as an opinion, in the real world catches fire like a lithium batter on failure! Now due to the 4 year late and 30 billion dollar outsourced 787, the company has not been able to get the job done on time for the 777x so Airbus is in the drivers seat and on schedule to make their new plane ready to take more market share away from Boeing . It is no wonder that Boeing has been number 2 for 11 years and Airbus stock is up 173% for 5 years while Boeing stock holders have only made 36%.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371111410929</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 04:16:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371112226014-33</Id><Title>Airbus and Boeing the air show facts</Title><Msg>Airbus moved ahead of Boeing on orders for newly introduced narrow-body planes two years ago with its A320neo, which dominated the last Paris expo and prompted Boeing to redesign its 737 to also add more fuel-efficient engines. Now Airbus is banking on an A350 made largely of lighter composite materials to add wide-body sales. Airbus left Paris two years ago with 418 firm orders worth $44 billion at list prices, 16 times the value of Boeing’s 23 contracts. “A modified aircraft can never compete with a clean-sheet design,” Leahy said in an interview. “It won’t have a chance , the 777X, against the all-new A350.” Just like each year the new winged stretch 747 looses market share to the A380, the 777x is doomed to lose market share. Airbus is #$%$ to Boeing what Japan did to England on motocycles. The Triumph and BSA and Royal Enfield were great bikes in their day but the English management just made slight improvements while Sochiro Honda first copied then improved and constantly made clean sheet new improved motorcycles and now Japan dominated the motorcycle business . Airbus is now dominating Boeing and has for 11 years the stock price tell the story this year Airbus stock is up 46% to Boeing up 34% ytd.

The fear: Government-subsidized premiums will disappear at the end of the year under a provision in the health care law that nudges aides and lawmakers onto the government health care exchanges, which could make their benefits exorbitantly expensive. Democratic and Republican leaders are taking the issue seriously, but first they need more specifics from the Office of Personnel Management on how the new rule should take effect — a decision that Capitol Hill sources expect by fall, at the latest. The administration has clammed up in advance of a ruling, sources on both sides of the aisle said. If the issue isn’t resolved, and massive numbers of lawmakers and aides bolt, many on Capitol Hill fear it could lead to a brain drain just as Congress tackles a slew of weighty issues — like fights over the Tax Code and immigration reform. The problem is far more acute in the House, where lawmakers and aides are generally younger and less wealthy. Sources said several aides have already given lawmakers notice that they’ll be leaving over concerns about Obamacare. Republican and Democratic lawmakers said the chatter about retiring now, to remain on the current health care plan, is constant.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371127138640</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 08:38:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371127514217-43</Id><Title>Obama ‘Strongly Objects’ to Religious Liberty Amendment</Title><Msg>The Obama Administration “strongly objects” to a proposed amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act on Wednesday that would have protected the religious rights of soldiers – including evangelical Christian service members who are facing growing hostility towards their religion. The amendment was authored by Rep. John Fleming, R-La. It would have “required the Armed Forces to accommodate ‘actions and speech’ reflecting the conscience, moral, principles or religious beliefs of the member.” The Obama Administration said the amendment would have a “significant adverse effect on good order, discipline, morale, and mission accomplishment.” “With its statement, the White House is now endorsing military reprimands of members who keep a Bible on their desk or express a religious belief,” Fleming told Fox News. “This administration is aggressively hostile towards religious beliefs that it deems to be politically incorrect.” Fleming introduced the amendment after a series of high-profile incidents involving attacks on religious liberty within the military- including an Air Force officer who was told to remove a Bible from his desk because it might give the impression he was endorsing a religion. He said there are other reports of Christian service members and chaplains being punished for their faith. The Air Force censored a video created by a chaplain because it include the word “God.” The Air Force feared the word might offend Muslims and atheists. A service member received a “severe and possibly career-ending reprimand” for expressing his faith’s religious position about homosexuality in a personal religious blog. A senior military official at Fort Campbell sent out a lengthy email officially instructing officers to recognize “the religious right in America” as a “domestic hate group” akin to the KKK and Neo-Nazis because of its opposition to homosexual behavior. A chaplain was relieved of his command over a military chapel because, consistent with DOMA’s definition of marriage, he could not allow same-sex weddings to take place in the chapel. Last month Coast Guard Rear Admiral William Lee told a National Day of Prayer audience that religious liberty was being threatened by Pentagon lawyers and service members are being told to hide their faith in Christ.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371127514217</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 08:45:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371128288349-44</Id><Title>REPORT: Obama's Snooping Excludes Mosques, Missed Boston Bombers...</Title><Msg>Homeland Insecurity: The White House assures that tracking our every phone call and keystroke is to stop terrorists, and yet it won't snoop in mosques, where the terrorists are. That's right, the government's sweeping surveillance of our most private communications excludes the jihad factories where homegrown terrorists are radicalized. Since October 2011, mosques have been off-limits to FBI agents. No more surveillance or undercover string operations without high-level approval from a special oversight body at the Justice Department dubbed the Sensitive Operations Review Committee. Who makes up this body, and how do they decide requests? Nobody knows; the names of the chairman, members and staff are kept secret. We do know the panel was set up under pressure from Islamist groups who complained about FBI stings at mosques. Just months before the panel's formation, the Council on American-Islamic Relations teamed up with the ACLU to sue the FBI for allegedly violating the civil rights of Muslims in Los Angeles by hiring an undercover agent to infiltrate and monitor mosques there. Before mosques were excluded from the otherwise wide domestic spy net the administration has cast, the FBI launched dozens of successful sting operations against homegrown jihadists — inside mosques — and disrupted dozens of plots against the homeland. If only they were allowed to continue, perhaps the many victims of the Boston Marathon bombings would not have lost their lives and limbs. The FBI never canvassed Boston mosques until four days after the April 15 attacks, and it did not check out the radical Boston mosque where the Muslim bombers worshipped.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371128288349</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 08:58:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371128509996-45</Id><Title>PATRIOT Act Author: Obama's NSA Reassurances 'A Bunch of Bunk'...</Title><Msg>Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, who introduced the PATRIOT Act on the House floor in 2001, has declared that lawmakers’ and the executive branch’s excuses about recent revelations of NSA activity are “a bunch of bunk.” In an interview on Laura Ingraham’s radio show Wednesday morning, the Republican congressman from Wisconsin reiterated his concerns that the administration and the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court have gone far beyond what the PATRIOT Act intended. Specifically, he said that Section 215 of the act “was originally drafted to prevent data mining” on the scale that’s occurred. Sensenbrenner, the current chairman on the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, suggested that the secret nature of the FISA court has prevented appropriate congressional oversight over the NSA’s activities. When asked whether he agreed with those in Washington calling leaker Edward Snowden a traitor, Sensenbrenner responded, “No, I don’t agree,” and said that he would not have known the extent of abuse by the FISA court and the NSA without Snowden’s disclosures. The congressman has earlier said he believes the PATRIOT Act needs to be amended to protect Americans’ privacy.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371128509996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 09:01:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371129917491-46</Id><Topic><Title>Progressive Liberals Silent on NSA Violations !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371059259575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 13:47:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a minor offense</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371129917491</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 09:25:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371130293987-47</Id><Title>Showden is no Patriot !</Title><Msg>he's an attention ho - taunting other spooks !</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371130293987</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 09:31:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371130575199-48</Id><Topic><Title>jjovaz claims he is for the union now/ a two faced hypocrit/ here is his april 11 2013 accusation of Union sabotoge</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371108700592</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 03:31:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wayne you are unstable and probably in need of meds!

(AP) — Over the last two months, hundreds of protesters have walked out of North Carolina's capitol in handcuffs to show their opposition to policies by the GOP-controlled Legislature. While a broader coalition of supporters is building around the "Moral Mondays" started by the state chapter of the NAACP, the inspiration behind the protests is a throwback to the biblical message of civil rights leaders fighting segregation in the Jim Crow era. They argue that cutting benefit programs and cutting tax breaks for low- and middle-income families violates Jesus Christ's teaching to care for those with the least. It's running into another school of Christian thought followed by many Southern conservatives: The best way to help the poor is through private charity, providing jobs and promoting self-reliance, rather than government programs. The NAACP, and other groups that are joining them in larger numbers, oppose a range of Republican policies, from refusing to expand Medicaid to about 500,000 more people to restricting eligibility for the state's pre-kindergarten program. Republicans, who control both chambers of the Legislature for the first time in more than a century, have also cut unemployment benefits and abolished the earned-income tax credit, which serves low to middle-income people. State bishops and church leaders from five major Christian denominations issued a statement supporting the NAACP's actions ahead of a clergy-led protest on Monday. Robert Daniels, senior pastor at St. John's Missionary Baptist Church in Durham, said Monday that he chose to get arrested to let legislators know that disproportionately hurting the poor wouldn't go unnoticed by voters or God. "I want them to know that justice will win," he said. "God will show his hand that he's for the poor. It's only a matter of time."</Msg><Username>tcmoiba</Username><Timestamp>1371138631027</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 11:50:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371138739579-81</Id><Topic><Title>'We should all be more like black Muslims'</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371075459304</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 18:17:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cosby just said that, although he is a Christian, we can learn from all faiths.

I gave him the idea for Fox News. I told him to hire Roger Ailes. That’s why this is such a shock.” A frequent dining companion of the Murdochs, Satan said he “didn’t have a clue that they were having problems.” “I’ve had dozens of dinners with them in the Hamptons,” he said. “Did they bicker? No more than other couples. But they seemed to be on the same page about all the important things, like creating corrupt media monopolies and buying politicians. I thought they were for keeps.” Adding that he “cares deeply about his friends,” Satan said the news about the Murdochs had hit him especially hard: “I was just starting to get over the Putins.” The Prince of Darkness said he first got word of the Murdoch divorce about an hour before the official announcement: “My banker at Goldman Sachs called and told me to sell my News Corp. stock right away.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371152250936</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:37:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371152392130-138</Id><Title>Obama's Economic Policies Hur Black People Most</Title><Msg>The unemployment for Black when Obama took office 9.1%.

Thune's amendment backs up the 2006 Secure Fence Act (which Landrieu voted for) requiring 700 miles of double layer fence along the southwest border with Mexico, of which only 36 miles have been completed. I’m going to speak about this amendment for just a minute, but I’ld like to respond to Senator Thune, and I wish that we could get a vote on his amendment as well as this one because I would like to strongly vote and strongly express objection to this amendment. And I’d like to comments for a minute. I chair the Homeland Security Appropriations Committee that is actually building the fence. The money to build it comes though my Committee, so I’ve actually gone down to look at the fence that we’re trying to build. It was shocking to me and would be shocking to everyone in America if they would see it. That no matter if you build a single fence or a double fence with space in between, how easy it is for people to be very ingenious about getting over it or under it. So I would be voting against Senator Thune’s amendment because I’m, not going to waste taxpayer money on a dumb fence and that ‘s what his amendment would be. We need to build a smart fence. And a fence is not just a physical structure which could be built out of a variety of different materials with or without barbed wire on the top. A smart fence which is what Senator McCain and I want to build – since he’s from Arizona, I think he knows more about this than the Senator from South Dakota, who only has a border with Canada that is quite different. Yesterday, Sens. Dean Heller and Harry Reid pushed an amendment classifying Nevada as a border state.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371153047355</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:50:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371153320894-140</Id><Title>"Practicing Catholic" Nancy Pelosi Calls Late Term Abortion "Sacred Ground"</Title><Msg>Her real religion is money and power.......innocent babies be damned.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371153320894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:55:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371153644197-141</Id><Title>Ben Carson: white liberals are the “most racist people there are.”</Title><Msg>On his radio show last night, Mark Levin had on newfound conservative “hero” Dr. Ben Carson to discuss all the lashings he’s received from the “left-wing media” over his views on gay marriage and religion.

Most black poverty is found in female-headed households, but the poverty rate among black married couples has been in single digits since 1994 and stands today at 7 percent. Today’s black illegitimacy rate is 72 percent, but in the 1940s, it hovered around 14 percent. Less than 50 percent of black students graduate from high school, and most of those who do graduate have a level of academic proficiency far below that of their white counterparts. Black men make up almost 40 percent of the prison population. Here are my several two-part questions: Is having babies without the benefit of marriage a bad decision, and is doing so likely to affect income? Are dropping out of school and participating in criminal activity bad decisions, and are they likely to have an effect on income? Finally, do people have free will and the capacity to make decisions, or is their behavior a result of instincts over which they have no control? As a black person, I’m glad that the message taught to so many of today’s black youths wasn’t taught back in the 1930s, '40s and '50s, when the civil rights struggle was getting into gear.

In 2002 Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. founder Richard Branson unveiled the first big Airbus A340 jetliner at a glitzy spectacle, with supermodel Claudia Schiffer on hand to draw attention to the $200 million plane. Last fall, however, Virgin sent the huge jetliner back to Airbus, with its metallic silver-and-purple exterior repainted generic white. Now, Airbus is negotiating to sell the plane to a Maltese leasing company for less than $20 million, a steep markdown, according to people close to the talks. Virgin isn't alone in ditching its big A340s. Leading airlines from Canada to China have unloaded the massive planes after just a few years of use, and new takers have been few. The four-engine intercontinental jets cost too much to operate, the airlines say. "Unfortunately," says Akbar Al Baker, chief executive of Qatar Airways, the A340 isn't an old car "that you can just throw away." He said a deal to shed the four A340s that Qatar owns collapsed because the potential customer wanted extra cash to take the planes. Plunging A340 values are hitting major European banks that finance many Airbus sales. More than 10 European banks are pressing Airbus to compensate them for losses on A340 deals or do more to find homes for unwanted aircraft, according to people close to the talks</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1371154562443</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 16:16:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371154777630-147</Id><Title>Lets Examine Two Segments of the black population</Title><Msg>Though I grow weary of pointing it out, let's do it again. Let's examine some numbers readily available from the Census Bureau's 2004 Current Population Survey and ask some questions. There's one segment of the black population that suffers only a 9.9 percent poverty rate, and only 13.7 percent of its under-5-year-olds are poor. There's another segment that suffers a 39.5 percent poverty rate, and 58.1 percent of its under-5-year-olds are poor. Among whites, one segment suffers a 6 percent poverty rate, and only 9.9 percent of its under-5-year-olds are poor. The other segment suffers a 26.4 percent poverty rate, and 52 percent of its under-5-year-olds are poor. What do you think distinguishes the high and low poverty populations among blacks? Would you buy an explanation that it's because white people practice discrimination against one segment of the black population and not the other or one segment had a history of slavery and not the other? You'd have to be a lunatic to buy such an explanation. The only distinction between both the black and white populations is marriage -- lower poverty in married-couple families. In 1960, only 28 percent of black females ages 15 to 44 were never married and illegitimacy among blacks was 22 percent. Today, the never-married rate is 56 percent and illegitimacy stands at 70 percent. If today's black family structure were what it was in 1960, the overall black poverty rate would be in or near single digits. The weakening of the black family structure, and its devastating consequences, have nothing to do with the history of slavery or racial discrimination. Dr. Charles Murray, an American Enterprise Institute scholar, argues in an article titled "Rediscovering the Underclass" in the Institute's On the Issues series (October 2005) that self-destructive behavior has become the hallmark of the underclass. He says that unemployment in the underclass is not caused by the lack of jobs but by the inability to get up every morning and go to work. In 1954, the percentage of black males, age 20 to 24, not looking for work was nine percent. In 1999, it rose to 30 percent, and that was at a time when employers were beating the bushes for employees. Murray adds that "the statistical reality is that people who get into the American job market and stay there seldom remain poor unless they do something self-destructive. I share Murray's sentiment expressed at the beginning of his article where he says, "Watching the courage of ordinary low-income people as they deal with the aftermath of Katrina and Rita, it is hard to decide which politicians are more contemptible -- Democrats who are rediscovering poverty and blaming it on George W. Bush, or Republicans who are rediscovering poverty and claiming that the government can fix it." Since President Johnson's War on Poverty, controlling for inflation, the nation has spent $9 trillion on about 80 anti-poverty programs. To put that figure in perspective, last year's U.S. GDP was $11 trillion; $9 trillion exceeds the GDP of any nation except the U.S. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita uncovered the result of the War on Poverty -- dependency and self-destructive behavior. Guess what the president and politicians from both parties are asking the American people to do? If you said, "Enact programs that will sustain and enhance dependency," go to the head of the class.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371154777630</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 16:19:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371155714197-148</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 in 4 black Children live in 2 Parent Homes</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371151829713</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:30:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Single parent homes headed by a white female are on the rise.

Alas, the Hannity appearance and the Beck interview were both scrubbed. Simon Brown in our Communications Department took the initial call from Hannity’s people. They said Hannity wanted to talk about a New Jersey teacher who was allegedly fired for handing a student a Bible, a track team disqualified after one of its runners publicly praised God and a supposed anti-Christian “bigot” who had been hired to advise the Pentagon on religious freedom issues. These tales were offered up as evidence of a “war on Christianity.” Are they? Nope. It’s just more of that spin that lurches into lies. I knew about the “fired teacher” story from an earlier interview I did with Fox News. He was a substitute social studies teacher – and a member of the Gideons, a group that often tries to distribute Bibles to kids in public schools. Allegedly, a student asked him about the phrase “The last shall be first and the first last.” The teacher said it was from the Bible. If he had left it at that, there would have been no problem, but he then gave the student a copy of the Bible to take home. The school system decided not to have him back. The teacher is now in court claiming religious discrimination. The school says he clearly violated a district policy that forbids school employees from distributing any religious materials. Employees are assumed to know personnel policies, and this fellow just chose not to comply. Employees don’t make the rules for government agencies. Teachers aren’t supposed to supplant parental decisions about religious instruction by giving kids religious material.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371160110286</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 17:48:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371160348976-169</Id><Topic><Title>Debunking The 'War On Christianity'</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371160110286</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 17:48:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Next up, the disqualified athlete. A relay runner on a high school track team from Columbus, Texas, made some type of gesture after crossing the finish line. As a result, his team was disqualified. Initial reports were that the student, Derrick Hayes, had raised his arm to give thanks to God – but the gesture might have been something else. The University Interscholastic League, which sponsored the meet, investigated and reported that it found “no evidence to suggest that the disqualification took place as a result of the student-athlete expressing religious beliefs. The basis for the disqualification was due to the student-athlete be­having disrespectfully, in the opinion of the local meet referee.” Hayes’ parents later issued a statement that read in part, “After discussing this with our son, we have come to the conclusion that his religious rights were not violated.” Finally, my friend Mikey Weinstein of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation has been much in the news lately because of claims that he is serving as an adviser to the Defense Department on religious discrimination. He’s not. He merely had a one-time meeting with some Pentagon officials. The headline of an article by Jay Sekulow’s American Center for Law and Justice read: Who Would Describe Christians In the Military as ‘Monsters Who Terrorize’? Jay’s answer: Mr. Weinstein. Weinstein did use the word “monsters” in an op-ed that ran on Huffington Post. But he was hardly characterizing all Christians in the military that way.

Scott “Ultrasound” will never be president</Title><Msg>Gov. Scott “Ultrasound” will never be president The governor’s 2016 hopes will be dashed by his signing Wisconsin’s mandatory ultrasound bill By Joan Walsh It’s not that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is any kind of moderate. But while polarizing, headline-chasing, right-wing senators like Ted “Abolish the IRS” Cruz and Rand “I was against drones before I was for them” Paul seem to be trying to consolidate their position as Tea Party candidate for 2016, Walker has mostly gone about his business in Wisconsin (with a little trip across the border to Iowa to keep his own 2016 chatter alive). In April, Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball named him the front-runner, and Real Clear Politics’ Sean Trende agreed. “Scott Walker is more of a blank check who can kind of modulate himself a little bit for whatever the national and party’s mood happens to be for 2015,” Trende told the Daily Caller. But if Walker goes ahead, as promised, and signs a bill mandating an ultrasound before a woman can have an abortion, he can kiss his 2016 hopes goodbye. It will be impossible for Gov. Ultrasound to “modulate himself” once he’s associated with the most notorious piece of legislation to brand his party as anti-women in 2012. (Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell signed a slightly softened version of it into law last March.) “I don’t have any problem with ultrasound,” Walker said Tuesday. “I think most people think ultrasounds are just fine.” Actually, I think most people recoil physically at the idea of transvaginal ultrasounds, which the Wisconsin bill would require for anyone getting a first-trimester abortion, meaning many women. The bill would also close one of Wisconsin’s few remaining abortion clinics. It’s not that Walker isn’t already far to the right, and terrible on women’s issues in particular. He’s signed several bills restricting abortion, and pushed through the defunding of Planned Parenthood, forcing the closure of at least four women’s health clinics in his state. Last year he signed legislation repealing Wisconsin’s equal pay for women law. But the mandatory ultrasound bill is the kind of creepy provocation that would out Walker as the far-right culture warrior that he is, and make it impossible for him to “modulate himself” and be elected president. Of course, it could help him win a GOP primary. Walker’s foray into Iowa provides an interesting window into his appeal as a national candidate. He was invited to address state Republicans by Gov. Terry Branstad, who is kind of a moderate in the modern-day GOP, though not by any other standard. But Walker was also praised by Branstad’s ultra-right primary opponent Bob Vander Plaats. “Gov. Walker has a lot going for him and he’d be a very appealing candidate in a state like Iowa for the caucuses,” Vander Plaats told the Iowa Republican website. “Not only is he right on a lot of issues, he’s been very bold and courageous on his leadership on a lot of those issues. And being a neighbor to Iowa doesn’t guarantee you success but it certainly doesn’t hurt.” Signing an ultrasound bill is the kind of thing that would endear him to a conservative kingmaker like Vander Plaats, in Iowa and elsewhere. Walker already has strong conservative appeal because of declaring war on public sector workers in 2010 and surviving their attempt at recalling him. The strongly “pro-business” governor has presided over a state that’s gone from 11th in the nation in job creation to 44th, and still he’s working hard to further cut taxes. He’s kind of a petty little guy, too, only today rescinding his appointment of a student regent after he learned the young man had signed a petition for his recall. The fracas over Wisconsin’s ultrasound bill is already making national news. If you haven’t seen it, watch this clip of GOP state Senate president Mike Ellis, presiding in Jim Jones-style sunglasses as well as late-stage Jim Jones-style rage (he screams, shouts, snarls and breaks his gavel). Ellis’ histrionics would seem to have been unnecessary; Republicans had the votes to pass the bill. And that GOP legislative meltdown came on the day that Rep. Trent Franks channeled the tragic Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin while defending a federal ban on abortion after 20 weeks. Arguing against exceptions in the case of rape (that’s how Akin got in trouble), Franks told his colleagues, “the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy is very low.” Now, granted, Franks’ phrasing didn’t have the same zing as Akin insisting that in cases of “legitimate rape … the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.” But he’s making essentially the same point. How’s that rebranding going, Reince Priebus? Clearly, signing the ultrasound bill will put Walker in the mainstream of his party’s conservative base. But if he signs it, it’ll have his name on it in November 2016, not just during primary season. Gov. Scott Ultrasound will never be president.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371162615247</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 18:30:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371163077372-180</Id><Topic><Title>Progressive Liberals Silent on NSA Violations !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371059259575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 13:47:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am here, after a time out to fix my gas BBQ/ Thank you all for your participation.

Trent Franks, R-Ariz., that the rate of pregnancy resulting from rape is “very low,” saying that Franks’ remark shows an “alarming disregard for women.” Franks made the comments in a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, during the debate on his bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks at the national level. Franks was voicing his objections to an amendment that would create an exception for rape or incest. “Before, when my friends on the left side of the aisle here tried to make rape and incest the subject — because, you know, the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low,” he said. The Huffington Post reports: Carney says the White House issues takes “great issue” with the comments. And he says the remarks have shone attention on the bill in a way “Republicans wish the public would forget.” Several recent court decisions have struck down similar state laws, and the GOP-backed bill has little future in the Democratic-led Senate. Since Franks made his remark, Republican Massachusetts senatorial candidate Gabriel Gomez has sharply criticized him as well. “I have no idea what goes into the mind of a moron like that,” Gomez said. “These kinds of comments only come from a moron and they shouldn’t be tolerated one bit.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371164086433</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 18:54:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371164287371-184</Id><Topic><Title>airbus</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1371154562443</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 16:16:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tribal knowledge can't be beat.</Msg><Username>stillinshock</Username><Timestamp>1371164287371</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 18:58:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371164330823-185</Id><Title>Grow up, Libertarians!</Title><Msg>Grow up, Libertarians! Your philosophy is superficial, juvenile nonsense. Here's what you should focus on instead By Michael Lind Since I published my Salon essay, “The Question Libertarians Just Can’t Answer,” true believers in the libertarian cult have been struggling to answer the simple but devastating question I asked: If libertarianism is such a good idea, why aren’t there any libertarian countries? Writing in Reason, Ronald Bailey cites the spread of particular liberties since the eighteenth century as evidence that the entire world is becoming libertarian. But he ignores the fact that the welfare state and business regulation have grown up together with democracy and civil liberties. The citizens of democracies prefer to vote themselves generous social insurance benefits. They also insist on using government to police business firms while benefiting from a market economy. Most of Bailey’s examples assume that this or that trend of which he approves will continue forever. For example, he points out that cross-border migrants now constitute one in 33 people (putting it this way makes it sound more impressive than “no more than 3 percent of the human race”). He doesn’t mention that even this surprisingly small amount of global migration has produced anti-immigrant backlashes in most developed countries, including the U.S., where comprehensive immigration reform may fail once again. Writing in The Economist, a libertarian-leaning magazine, Will Wilkinson tries to answer my question in a different way: One doesn’t have to be fond of libertarianism to imagine perfectly sound answers. When I was a libertarian, I might have said that there are no libertarian countries because too few people have been persuaded to become libertarians, just as at one point in our history too few men had been persuaded to support women’s suffrage. When enough have been persuaded, it will be tried. Wilkinson is confusing policies and systems. In my essay, I took care to distinguish the two. I pointed out that particular useful policies favored by libertarians can be adopted by modern countries, without fundamentally altering the dominant mixed-economy model that blends markets, government and the nonprofit sector in a compound that will always be too “statist” for libertarians. American progressives in the tradition of the two Roosevelts have never been doctrinaire “statists” or “socialists” and have no objection to promoting markets, where that serves the public interest. A progressive can favor privatizing the Post Office and expanding Social Security at the same time. Or vice versa (progressive arguments against Social Security privatization are based on its practical problems). I recently co-authored a proposal to use vouchers for eldercare in the U.S., without thereby becoming any less a sinister statist enemy of human freedom, from the perspective of the libertarian cult. You never find similar pragmatism among libertarians. They are always against any public option and always for a real or imagined private option. Libertarianism is dogmatic, not experimental. Any maverick libertarian who suggested a deviation from orthodoxy — say, expanding Medicaid, on efficiency grounds — would be expelled from the cult as a “statist” heretic. Bailey and Wilkinson accuse me of discouraging potentially useful social experimentation. But it’s not an experiment if you know the result in advance. Libertarians, like utopian socialists and utopian anarchists, think they already know the desirable end state of human social evolution, even if they are content to move toward that utopia incrementally. Most liberals would approve of the philosopher Karl Popper’s distinction between “piecemeal social engineering” and “utopian social engineering,” symbolized by the lethal attempts of Jacobins, fascists and communists to remake whole societies from scratch on the basis of this or that theory. In The Open Society and Its Enemies, Popper wrote that “the piecemeal engineer will adopt the method of searching for, and fighting against, the greatest and most urgent evil of society, rather than searching for, and fighting for, its greatest ultimate good.” In some cases, fighting urgent evils requires the expansion of particular liberties, like abolishing slavery and segregation and securing the right to vote. In other cases, it requires limiting particular liberties, like the freedom of employers to buy and sell slaves, use child labor or pollute the environment. Libertarianism poses as a comprehensive public philosophy promoting the “greatest ultimate good” of individual freedom, not just a list of particular policies, like private toll roads instead of public highways or vouchers for schools. So it is not enough for libertarians to point to discrete measures that have been adopted by systems based on other principles, like social democratic progressivism or conservative welfare capitalism. Libertarianism as a system will be hard to take seriously until there are at least a few functioning, systematically libertarian countries in the world. Maybe at some point in the future some country will take the plunge and unilaterally adopt the gold standard, replace police and soldiers with private contractors, abolish all taxation except for a flat, regressive consumption tax, eliminate all public safety net programs, eliminate most or all environmental and occupational regulations, allow foreigners to move in and out of its territory without registration or regulation, and so on. And maybe that regime will even endure for a while, instead of quickly collapsing or suffering rejection by voters with buyer’s remorse. Meanwhile, in today’s world, the focus of the political mainstream — moderate conservatives and centrists, along with progressives — is on modifying the inherited model of the twentieth century mixed economy, to adapt it to the changed circumstances of the twenty-first century. While there are substantial costs and benefits at stake, the reforms that are at issue are essentially incremental — cut Social Security or boost it, slightly increase or slightly lower legal immigration, increase progressive income taxation or add a federal consumption tax like a value-added tax to the mix. And what exactly does the libertarian movement contribute to contemporary American debate? Here are a few of the ideas that the rest of us, from center-left to center-right, are supposed to treat with respectful attention: calls for a return to the gold standard; the abolition of the Federal Reserve; the abolition of the Internal Revenue Service; and the replacement of all taxes by a single regressive flat tax that would fall on low-income workers while slashing taxation of the rich. My critic in The Economist, Will Wilkinson, writes: The ideal of anti-theoretical experimentalism leads me to a preference for policies that promote the sort of cosmopolitan pluralism in which cultural synthesis and invention thrives. It leads me to favour decentralised authority over monumental central administration. It leads me to suspect that it would be better if America were twelve separate countries, or had 200 states. It leads me to think seasteads are a great idea. Ron Paul, who merely wants to abolish the Federal Reserve, looks like a boring centrist, compared to Will Wilkinson, who thinks it might be worthwhile to abolish the United States, subdividing it into a dozen separate countries. (My Southern ancestors who supported the Confederacy would have been satisfied with two). And the seasteads that Wilkinson favors? A few years back, libertarian guru Milton Friedman’s grandson Patri Friedman argued that, because they are too unpopular ever to win political power in contemporary democratic nation-states, libertarians should migrate to abandoned oil derricks offshore to create the stateless libertarian community (if that is not a contradiction in terms). Friedman has now abandoned the seastead project, in favor of promoting autonomous “charter cities” to promote free markets and the rule of law in poor countries on the model of Hong Kong (an undemocratic British colony before it became an undemocratic satrapy of China’s communist dictatorship). Honduras has revised its laws to accommodate such autonomous zones. According to Details: One potential model is something Friedman calls Appletopia: A corporation, such as Apple, “starts a country as a business. The more desirable the country, the more valuable the real estate,” Friedman says. Let us hope Appletopia is a kinder, gentler place than Apple’s Foxconn supplier company town in China, where netting had to be placed around dormitories to catch unfree workers seeking to escape from serfdom to multinational corporations by committing suicide. But let me close on a conciliatory note. While libertarianism as a philosophy is superficial, juvenile nonsense, particular libertarian proposals are sometimes worthwhile on their merits. The seastead and charter cities movements are examples. If libertarians want to move to converted offshore oil platforms or multinational-owned company towns in the jungles of Central America, I for one will wish them well.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371164330823</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 18:58:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371164773199-186</Id><Topic><Title>Democrat Calls Border Fence "Dumb" While Claiming South Dakota is a Border State</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371153047355</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:50:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I didn't call anyone names.

Like, this is a little kid with candy walking around the street.” “Listen, Trayvon Martin would be alive today, okay, if he didn’t, alright, have a street attitude,” the former NYPD detective insisted. “That’s the bottom line.” “‘Street attitude’ is a very broad thing and is something that actually can be used — and I’m not saying this to you personally — but something that can be used as something racist,” Holder pointed out. “Like calling a kid a thug.” “That’s insane,” Houck laughed. Following a break, the Fox News host noted that “we live in a society right now that’s extremely focused on being politically correct.” “Personally, I think people who use the word ‘thug’ or believe that the word ‘thug’ is a racist [word] is racist themselves,” Houck opined. “You know, because I call somebody a thug, I’m a racist?

If costs rise beyond an agreed upon level, hospitals may become responsible for reimbursing the government. If they cut the cost of care while maintaining quality, hospitals share in the savings. The government expects the savings may be as much as $1.9 billion from 2012 to 2015. Early indications suggest they are starting to add up. “We’re providing better care because we’re keeping people out of the hospital,” Kenneth Davis, president of Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, said in a telephone interview. Mt. Sinai has reduced emergency room visits by 54 percent among high-risk patients. Similarly, New Jersey’s Hackensack University Medical Center saved about $16 million last year on care of about 11,000 Medicare patients who are part of the hospital’s accountable-care program. And at Coastal Carolina Health Care in New Bern, North Carolina, monthly emergency room visits dropped to 340 in February from 521 in April 2012. Growing Evidence Less than 10 percent of Medicare’s 51 million beneficiaries are treated by accountable-care groups, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And the federal government has not yet weighed in with data to support the growing evidence that these new groups are saving money or improving health care. Still, broader indicators suggest that changes spurred by the law, including formation of the accountable-care groups, are improving the health system, said Jonathan Blum, deputy director of the Medicare agency. The proportion of Medicare patients who were readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of a discharge fell by one percentage point last year to about 18 percent, the first significant decline in five years. And the growth of national health-care spending per person in the U.S. dropped to about 3 percent a year in 2009 and has remained at that level, half the pace that health costs grew in 2007. “There is something fundamentally changing in health care,” Blum said in a telephone interview. “Hospital admissions are being better managed and are being reduced.” ‘A Watershed’ The ACO program works by offering hospitals two options of incentives. Hospitals can take on risk immediately, in which case they get 60 percent of any savings -- and potentially face losses -- or they can forgo taking on risk in the first three years and decide after that whether they want to continue the program. In that case, they get a 50 percent portion of the savings during the first three years. “I think it is a watershed,” said Bruce Merlin Fried, a partner at the law firm Dentons in Washington who serves as general counsel to the National Association of Accountable Care Organizations. “There’s no going back.” At hospitals and physician practices who have signed on, individual patients like Gerald Medlin, 69, are seeing a higher level of service and better care. When Medlin’s health began failing in January, his daughter, Beth Medlin-Jackson, found herself in a bind. Her dad, suffering from kidney failure, respiratory illness and dementia, lives by himself in New Bern, North Carolina. She lives in San Diego. Eyes and Ears Medlin’s physicians at Coastal Carolina Health Care, a participant in the accountable care program, assigned Debbie Sutton to take charge of him. Sutton’s job, which exists only because of the health law, is to manage care for patients considered at high risk of hospitalization. She made sure Medlin’s hospital doctors and his primary-care physician were coordinating care, that Medlin kept up with his prescription medicines and that his daughter was in the loop. “She’s kind of the eyes and ears on the ground there,” Medlin-Jackson said in a phone interview. Hackensack University Medical Center, meanwhile, has been hiring nurses to identify high-risk patients. Those patients are now instructed to call their nurses directly when they feel ill, instead of their doctors’ offices. That’s because physicians’ offices often recommend that such patients make unnecessary visits to the emergency room, where they are likely to be admitted to the hospital, said Peter Gross, chairman of the HackensackAlliance ACO’s board of managers. High Rate “We have a very high admission rate at the ER, about 40 percent, which is probably too high,” he said in a phone interview. Mount Sinai Hospital in New York employed a multimillion-dollar supercomputer called “Minerva,” originally built three years ago for genomic studies, to mine patients’ medical claims data and identify those at highest risk to be admitted to the hospital, said Davis, the hospital’s president. A dozen care coordinators hired starting last year by the hospital work with patients identified by Minerva to make sure they fill prescriptions, take their drugs and make it to doctors’ appointments. The coordinators also help patients take steps to monitor their conditions, such as weighing themselves daily if they suffer from congestive heart failure, a condition for which weight gain is an indicator of increasing severity. ‘Right Foods’ The powerful computer system is a key to success. Programmers developed an algorithm to identify patients at the highest risk of being admitted to the hospital, Davis said. The supercomputer, built with parts from Dell Inc (DELL). and Data Direct Networks, contains hundreds of terabytes of memory. Minerva applies that computational power to consider indicators including patients’ life-threatening health conditions, their age, medications they use, where they live and whether they live alone, Davis said. “We do this for impoverished communities with frayed social networks,” Davis said. “Are they buying and eating the right foods, taking their medicines?” Accountable care is not a new idea. It was tried with limited success in the 1990s as part of the drive to cut costs through Health Maintenance Organizations, closed networks of doctors and hospitals managed by insurers. This time, advocates, say, there’s a greater chance of success. Davis said that earlier coordinated-care efforts often failed because they were largely run by insurance companies, and the programs weren’t perceived to be in the best interests of patients. ‘Adversarial Situation’ “It was an adversarial situation from Day 1,” he said. “There was no sense that decisions were being made in the patient’s best interest rather than in the interest of saving money.” Under the U.S. health reform law, Medicare’s accountable-care program requires hospitals and doctors to show they are improving or maintaining the quality of their care before they are paid any bonuses, Blum said. More powerful technology will also help. And unlike in the ’90s, today’s programs are backed by a new law, providing “some surety that the agency will have a commitment to the program,” Blum said. Still, critics say health providers aren’t likely to do any better today than 20 years ago. ‘Expensive’ Work “This stuff is expensive to do. It’s very people-intensive,” said Lawton Robert Burns, the chairman of the Health Management Department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “The handful of programs that work -- and they’re just a handful -- you have to get nurses and other people like that in front of the patient, not through electronic means, working with the patient, coaching, hovering. That’s what it takes and it’s very costly.” There also have been no scientific studies showing whether cost savings reported by hospitals and doctors are attributable to the new programs or some other reasons, Burns said. “It could be a temporary fluctuation. It could be random,” he said. “They don’t know, but they’ll take credit for it.” At Coastal Carolina, care manager Sutton insists it’s different this time. The physician group of about 50 doctors signed on with the Obama administration more than a year ago to become an accountable-care organization and hired care managers, including Sutton in July. With degrees in business and nursing, she focuses on the sickest and costliest of Coastal Carolina’s patients. “We’re kind of a missing piece of the puzzle,” Sutton said in a phone interview. Each day, she meets or calls some of the 85 patients under her watch, making sure they make doctors’ appointments, take medications and stay out of the hospital unless necessary. “Being a business person, I like people being accountable to me,” she said. “I make the patients accountable to me. It works.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371165819336</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 19:23:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371166664600-192</Id><Topic><Title>so yesterday day trade TSLA up 5% today ACAD day trade now up 5% that is 10% in two days, Boeing not so good</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371139002052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 11:56:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OOOH THE FIRED EMPLOYEE OF BOEING!</Msg><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1371166664600</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 19:37:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371166709803-193</Id><Topic><Title>so yesterday day trade TSLA up 5% today ACAD day trade now up 5% that is 10% in two days, Boeing not so good</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371139002052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 11:56:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does this have something to do with those hilarious "prophesies of Spartaloonkoodoofus?"</Msg><Username>iamtheonetruespaz666</Username><Timestamp>1371166709803</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 19:38:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371166735221-194</Id><Topic><Title>Debunking The 'War On Christianity'</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371160110286</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 17:48:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371166735221</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 19:38:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371166747657-195</Id><Topic><Title>combining both Pilots concerns on flying a 787 lithium battery and battery experts 787 opinion , result the stock price</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371095260275</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 23:47:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG!</Msg><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1371166747657</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 19:39:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371166799077-196</Id><Topic><Title>Murdoch Divorce Stuns Satan</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371152250936</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:37:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This unexpected event must have cut into Satan's time with Breitbart.</Msg><Username>iamtheonetruespaz666</Username><Timestamp>1371166799077</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 19:39:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371167399745-197</Id><Topic><Title>so yesterday day trade TSLA up 5% today ACAD day trade now up 5% that is 10% in two days, Boeing not so good</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371139002052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 11:56:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many "sparts" on this board.

Yes, there are some people that are feeling like they don’t want to get on it. We know that Boeing style MD management has the opinion that passenger safety is second to profit by the actions of Boeing .The fix with FAA going along, first to grant a special exemption to use the lithium battery, and now without a finding of the cause of the fire , to allow a already sketchy lithium battery to be used . Boeing is of the opinion that they will take the risk with passenger safety. After all , history tells us that the DC-10 actually killed people and still went on to be success. So what are a few passenger deaths on the 787 to Boeing management. The dual standard , Boeing studies the lithium battery in the Cessna and recommended that Cessna switch to NiCad, but now Boeing needs to put a unsolved fire on the 787 with a lithium battery into a box and let the 787 go flying. Cost over passenger safety. As one frequent flyer said "I fly between continents several times per year and have done so for the last decade and I will NEVER set foot on a Dreamliner" As Boeing management said , "sometimes we don't know what we don't know about why the lithium battery fires up. The solution, so instead of changing to a safe NiCad battery like Airbus did , Boeing now has a heavier box and lithium battery total weight than the NiCad safe solution. Go figure . You can not carry lithium batteries in the cargo bay of any plane and yet the FAA, who sleeps with Boeing, is allowing these same dangerous batteries a second time to go flying with passengers a second time after the unsolved cause of the fires . Never get on a 787.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371175497225</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 22:04:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371175511699-228</Id><Topic><Title>Fox News Sinks To A New Low</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371165549722</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 19:19:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now we know what the Klan meeting subject was as sdmiller4747 is repeating said subject matter.</Msg><Username>jumbojetskl</Username><Timestamp>1371175511699</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 22:05:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371175657618-229</Id><Topic><Title>jjovaz claims he is for the union now/ a two faced hypocrit/ here is his april 11 2013 accusation of Union sabotoge</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371108700592</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 03:31:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>freevertiss you need to take your meds and go to bed you need quiet time .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371175657618</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 22:07:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371175825885-230</Id><Topic><Title>so yesterday day trade TSLA up 5% today ACAD day trade now up 5% that is 10% in two days, Boeing not so good</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371139002052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 11:56:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spartacus99991 you must be a old lawyer hired by boeing to muddle the facts then, math Aribus up 165% in 5 years Boeing up about 36 % Airbus bettered Boeing , it is the math math spartacus9991 don't worry counselor I will keep you employed</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371175825885</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 22:10:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371176138368-231</Id><Topic><Title>so yesterday day trade TSLA up 5% today ACAD day trade now up 5% that is 10% in two days, Boeing not so good</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371139002052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 11:56:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spartacus9991 since you must be the old lawyer you are twisting the facts to meet your faulty logic , AS LONG AS YOU ARGUE WITH OURSELF YOUR OK that is your weak attempt to somehow make investors think Boeing is better than Airbus.
