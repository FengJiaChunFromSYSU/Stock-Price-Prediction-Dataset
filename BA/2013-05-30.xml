I posted on May 3 that TSLA was a buy and then made several more user comments that the Boeing trolls were missing a huge money making opportunity on TSLA as it went from $55 to $110 so your argument that I have some kind of pattern of after the fact is total BS on your part. I am not going to make you rich by doing your trades for you, that is my skill and you will not get it unless I decide to share. I am making sure neutral readers of the Boeing message board on a regular basis understand that you hacks are making claims that mean nothing . you want investors to be in Boeing at 100% forever . I want investors to realize that Boeing is a crazy stock to own and to trade . the stock made most of its gains in the last 5 years while the 787 was grounded that is a fake rally based 100% on Boeing using shareholder money. There was no good news driving the stock up. Next since you want Boeing to be held forever. I routinely point out that Airbus is the number one airplane manufacturer and has been number one for 11 years . I routinely give a comparison of what holding Airbus stock is like, compared to Boeing. I do this because you hacks want every investor to be in Boeing. I like to point out why that is a bad idea. Here it is , for 5 years Airbus is up per CNN money stock chart 151% and up 2.73% today compared to Boeing up only 20% for 5 years and down 1.02% today. the idea of trading Boeing over Airbus is ridiculous and both compared to what I suggested on May 3 is not competitive 16 days 100% gain on TSLA is far better than five year at 1515 for Airbus or 20 % for Boeing . I accept that as a pattern because it is a fact and the pattern is if you have to invest in a airframe manufacturing company then at least go with a company that is on time and on budget with the new 787 killer plane Airbus . In conclusion yes you are a 100% Boeing hack and in any pretense too.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369890793205</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 01:13:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369890989776-3</Id><Topic><Title>clsn, so I told you I was working another short squeeze like TSLA today I took it gained 35% hows your BA doing ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369857196424</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:53:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1515 should be 151% and make that you have 8 thumbs down now I voted against you too.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369890989776</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 01:16:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369892308391-4</Id><Title>Boeing CEO trolls Airbus this guy should be kicked out like Jack Welch showed him the GE door</Title><Msg>Boeings' CEO in public went a little nuts . he started ranking the number one airplane maker about their new jet before it is launched. The airbus plane is on time and on budget. This juvenile display of bad character by a CEO should result in his termination. The Boeing CEO should remember that Airbus said nothing bad about the 787 when Boeing was having problems instead Airbus hoped the 787 would be a success as what works for Boeing makes the entire airplane industry better. . In return this arrogant jerk leader of Boeing is ranking the competitors plane. This t will only enrage and make the Airbus worker more determined to beat Boeing. It is like telling another team your going to beat them bad before the game the Boeing CEO was a baseball player, I am sure his coach told him never to get into a bragging match with a competitor, at least until you are done with the match and professionally you should never be a boor. Airbus is now angry at Boeing way to go Boeing CEO you have fired up the bear. Boeing CEO accused Airbus on not having the guts to make an al new airplane ? Wow how lame all the Airbus planes are mainly all new ans made way after the 747 and the 737 and the 767 so what a lame argument from the Boeing CEO anyway. Airbus is not having a gut problem they are going with a plane they believe will take market share away from the 787 and the 777. If not then they will build a better jet plane that is all the new Airbus plane is designed to do.

Singapore Airlines has said that they intend to purchase 30 787-10s contingent on formal launch of the airplane by Boeing. SIA expects deliveries of the -10 to start in 2018-2019. They already have orders for 20 787-9 that will go to their low cost subsidiary Scoot. I expect Boeing to formally launch the variant at the Paris Air Show next month and I also expect that the launch announcement will include launch orders from at least 2 if not more customers. One of these customers would most likely be IAG (British Airways) who exercised 18 787 options. Even though IAG didn't announce the version they will buy, it is widely expected to be the 787-10.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1369918152144</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 08:49:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369920137445-17</Id><Topic><Title>Hows that Benghazi scandal thing working for you GOP Toads</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368718896588</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:41:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love it !!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369920137445</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 09:22:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369921250617-18</Id><Topic><Title>Hows that Benghazi scandal thing working for you GOP Toads</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1368718896588</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:41:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, workin out great.

There is still no evidence that climate change is making tornadoes worse of more frequent and in fact a recent article by Brad Plumer at the Washington post indicates that severe tornadoes have seen a slight decrease since 1950. John Kerry got 3 pinocchios from the Washington Post for his comments on climate change. You would think Kerry would actually know the facts but he doesn't. Polar ice extent is currently higher than 1986 Based on University of Illinois Cryosphere data. CO2 Sensitivity has been found to be too high and a growing number of mainstream climate scienists are declaring IPCC estimates as untenable. Total precipitable water has decreased in the last 10 years which is the opposite of what climate scientists had predicted. Through all of this the US is still theonly developed country lowering CO2 emissions as we continue to such down coal plants while all other countries are building new coal plants. The US now contributes 16% (and shrinking) of global CO2 emissions compared to China which is at 28% and increasing by 1.4 Gt/yr. Polls show climate change concerns are at their lowest levels since 2007 which I find amazing given all the media attention that climate change has gotten and Americans are against a climate tax. I doubt any Dem expecting a close race in 2014 wants to jump on board the bandwagon promoting another tax increase on taxpayers. Obonzo dropped the ball in his first term and abandoned the climate change issue and now that he is a lame duck he is pretending to care because it no longer can hurt him politically.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369928567511</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 11:42:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369928831744-51</Id><Title>72,600,000: Record Number on Medicaid</Title><Msg>stimulating...guess who gets to pay for their pay more for less bureaucrat administered commiecare premiums are expected to increase by anywhere from 100 to 400 percent</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1369928831744</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 11:47:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369928944817-52</Id><Topic><Title>How Come Dims Don't Talk Much About Glow-Ball Warming Anymore ?</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1369881109294</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 22:31:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sparty worships aljazeera gore</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1369928944817</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 11:49:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369929206734-53</Id><Title>Good Government, Military, and Evil Socialism</Title><Msg>There are many on this board and I do mean many that don’t know the difference. Governments produce nothing of themselves and can only give their citizens that which it first takes from them. Good governments provide a civilized system for people to address grievances in a peaceful non violent manner. As Thomas Paine said, “Government in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in it’s worst state, an intolerable one.” Our military and police forces are agencies where we hire people to carry out our right to protect our property, lives and our liberty. We have a 2nd amendment to make sure government does not have a monopoly on force. Voluntary socialism is good. Individuals, churches, charities, fraternities, clubs and other organizations voluntarily helping those they deem needing help is civilization at it’s best. Voluntary socialism does not benefit one person by harming the rights and property of another. Forced socialism is evil. Government mandated or forced socialism takes by force or threat of force what one person has earned and redistributes it to benefit people who didn’t earn it. It is simply a form of thievery and evil.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1369929206734</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 11:53:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369929210517-54</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing CEO trolls Airbus this guy should be kicked out like Jack Welch showed him the GE door</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369892308391</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 01:38:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumer 3 times feb really ? . dumber before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self esteem, please make sure you are not simply a awad.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369929210517</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 11:53:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369929374695-55</Id><Topic><Title>How Come Dims Don't Talk Much About Glow-Ball Warming Anymore ?</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1369881109294</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 22:31:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My comments on ice, sensitivity TPW, etc. are the opposite of what Gore is espousing.

Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.” This unambiguous, clearly-stated pledge was demonstrably false when it was first uttered and has remained so to this day. The latest piece of evidence, via the Associated Press (headline: "Like Your Healthcare Policy? You May Be Losing It"): Many people who buy their own health insurance could get surprises in the mail this fall: cancellation notices because their current policies aren't up to the basic standards of President Barack Obama's health care law. They, and some small businesses, will have to find replacement plans — and that has some state insurance officials worried about consumer confusion. Also, it doesn't seem to square with one of the president's best known promises about his health care overhaul: "If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan." ... The Obama administration did not respond directly to questions about the potential fallout from cancellation notices ... For the most part, state insurance commissioners are giving insurers the option of canceling existing plans or changing them to comply with new federal requirements. "Canceling" and "changing" do not equal "keeping," which was the promise. The CBO estimated last year that up to 20 million Americans could lose their current coverage under Obamacare. Other projections peg the number at 35 million, or more. With the media focused on the administration's myriad scandals, the president is gearing up for yet another public relations tour on behalf of the law that he never sold to the public, despite delivering dozens of speeches. His new plan? More speeches, natch, plus plenty of taxpayer-funded propaganda. If your presidency were sagging beneath the weight of scandal, and your top legislative accomplishment remained enduringly unpopular with the public, to whom would you turn for help? If your instant reply was "Nancy Pelosi," you're in luck. Have fun with this, Democrats: A document circulated to House Democrats by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi — and obtained by BuzzFeed — offers some details of the timing of the health-care plan: Rates and details of plans will become public in September for the 34 states that haven’t put together their own plans. The goals, Pelosi writes in a “dear colleague” letter that begins the document, are “to educate our constituents about the new law, help to implement it, and strengthen the hands of those who have worked for this historic reform.” Pelosi's guide to finally selling Obamacare runs 78 pages long, which sounds a bit unwieldy until you remember what they're trying to summarize (while editing out all the bad news). But don't panic, Democrats. Follow your super-popular leader's game plan, and everything should be fine.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1369929581647</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 11:59:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369929664779-57</Id><Title>IRS unfairly target TeaParty Criminals !</Title><Msg>TeaParty; although we're primarily political groups that really don’t qualify for 501(c)(4) status... we think the IRS is being unfair !!!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369929664779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 12:01:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369929700455-58</Id><Topic><Title>How Come Dims Don't Talk Much About Glow-Ball Warming Anymore ?</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1369881109294</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 22:31:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't bother with the troll chemical ali infesto.

Where do you get the idea that "Polar ice extent is currently higher than 1986 Based on University of Illinois Cryosphere data"? According to a very prominent chart at the ui cryosphere website, last summer's minimum icepack was less than half of the minimum icewpack in 1986. The only way you can claim the ice is greater than in 1986 is to compare current late-spring levels with 1986's late-summer levels---a VERY DISHONEST COMPARISON.

How would I fix that? First of all I would get this corrupt government out of the way and let businesses create more jobs so people could pay for their own medical care. I would get the government completely out of the healthcare industry. Then for those who just couldn't pay for needed medical care I would let it be provided voluntarily by benevolent individuals, churches, charities, fraternities, clubs and other organizations and give them tax credits (not deductions) equal to cost of care provided excluding any an all administrative and management fees not directly elated to the care given.. Then I would encourage more cash pay only clinics and surgery centers. Example: A thyroidectomy cost in excess of $40,000 at a normal hospital. At the Surgery Center of Oklahoma the same surgery cost $6,160. The Surgery Center of Oklahoma only accepts cash. Then I would encourage everyone to have a HSA and very high deductible insurance. In other words, I would let the free market work because we know it works best and I would eliminate all forced socialized healthcare because we know forced socialism does not work well.

Are you just bored or a BHT/ Your posts have not changed the facts nor the stock price over time . Your delivery lists are gibberish they added no insight ! . Boeing, over time has lost market share to Airbus, the number one airplane company is now Airbus . Foulmouther your advertisement for Boeing excludes the fact that for 11 years in a row Airbus has been the number 1 airplane manufacturing company.. The stock price and dividends for Airbus are much better over time than Boeing. The real news today is the, on time and on budget , new Airbus plane is about to start testing without a lithium battery. The problem for Boeing, over time is Boeing wants to be a innovator and yet gives the innovative duty to the cheapest outsourcing contractors (read hart-smith) in the world, with no experience. Boeing wants to be the Lockheed skunk works with shareholder money , wrong! the skunkworks style business plan was based upon unlimited government funding not shareholder dollars to develop the all experimental all composite 787 with a lithium battery .Boeing has lost sight of the fact that a publically traded company has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders to be responsible with their investment dollars. Boeing stock price is up a pathetic 21% for 5 years . Airbus stock price is up 146% in 5 years and YTD Airbus stock price is up 44% Boeing up 33% Now lets see how Airbus does with their new plane delivery that is the next test will it be on time and on budget , if so then watch Airbus stock price take off.

SCHMIDT - New York Times WASHINGTON — President Obama plans to nominate James B. Comey, a former hedge fund executive who served as a senior Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, to replace Robert S. Mueller III as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to two people with knowledge of the selection. By choosing Mr. Comey, a Republican, Mr. Obama made a strong statement about bipartisanship at a time when he faces renewed criticism from Republicans in Congress and has had difficulty winning confirmation of some important nominees. At the same time, Mr. Comey’s role in one of the most dramatic episodes of the Bush administration — in which he refused to acquiesce to White House aides and reauthorize a program for eavesdropping without warrants when he was serving as acting attorney general — should make him an acceptable choice to Democrats. ********************************************************************************* This should make for some really interesting Senate confirmation hearings. Unless of course there is a filibuster. Naaaaw....the GOP would NEVER do that to one of their own, would they?

Dionne, Jr. Maybe Bob Dole has more clout in the Republican Party than we think. He suggested on Sunday that the party put up a “closed for repairs” sign for the rest of the year. Then along comes Michele Bachmann declaring on Wednesday that she won’t seek re-election. On the surface, Republicans will be happy that they won’t have to answer for her exquisitely inflammatory statements anymore. Democrats will be disappointed to lose a face that launched thousands of contributions their way. You might say her departure is a small repair for the GOP’s image. In fact, Bachmannism is far from finished. The Minnesota right-winger deserves to be memorialized with an “ism” because she perfected a tactic well-suited to the current media environment: continually toss out outlandish, baseless charges, and, eventually, some of them will enter the mainstream media—if, at first, only in the form of “coverage” of what conservative radio shows, websites or Fox News are talking about. You don’t have to bat 1.000 or even .350 in this game. Get just a handful of your accusations and strange takes on reality into the political bloodstream and you’ve won. Bachmann’s method is now common currency. And here’s the beautiful thing: even as the regular media does some of your work for you, you lambaste the very same media. This only creates more pressure on them to cover you. Advertisement “I fully anticipate the mainstream liberal media to put a detrimental spin on my decision not to seek a fifth term,” she said in her eight-minute, 40-second video announcing her decision not to run. She practically invited reporters to do just that by insisting her decision did not stem from the danger she might lose re-election or because of an investigation into the finances of her 2012 presidential campaign. Is citing her denials a form of “detrimental spin?” Her video provided choice examples of the Bachmann method and the extent to which it is now being emulated by others. She denounced “this administration’s outrageous lack of action in Benghazi, Libya, and the subsequent political cover-up, which resulted in the deaths of four honorable, dedicated public servants.” Note the clever construction of that sentence. It implies that it’s the administration’s “political cover-up” that led to the killings in Benghazi. It’s hard not to conclude that she’s saying those deaths were all about President Obama’s political needs. “I’ve also called out this administration and the Treasury Department,” she added, “for allowing and perhaps even for encouraging partisan, selective enforcement against American citizens based upon their political beliefs that aren’t in line with those of the administration.” At best, in the Bachmann formulation, Team Obama was “allowing” this political persecution to go on, which implies that the White House was fully informed of what was happening in that Cincinnati IRS office, for which there is no evidence. But she didn’t stop there: again with no evidence, she just alleges that the administration might be guilty of “perhaps even ... encouraging” the harassment of its opponents. But hey, it’s Obama, so you can suspect anything. After all, as Bachmann once said, “most Americans are wild about America, and they are very concerned to have a president who doesn’t share those values.” My nominee for the ultimate in Bachmannism was her slander against the program encouraging citizens to serve the nation and each other. Opposing a bill to expand AmeriCorps, she warned that “there are provisions for what I would call re-education camps for young people, where young people have to go and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward and then they have to go to work in some of these politically correct forums.” Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge is just around the corner. Bachmann’s retirement should foster some soul-searching about the nature of our political discourse and how easy it is for falsehood and innuendo to get treated as just one more element in the conversation—no more or less legitimate than any other. This is the very sort of relativism (“my ‘truth’ is as good as your ‘truth’”) that sound conservatives condemn. It ends in nihilism. Bob Dole, one of those sound conservatives and a revered party warhorse, wanted his party to shut down for a while so it could “spend that time going over ideas and positive agendas.” Bachmannism substitutes accusations for ideas and paranoia for an agenda. Alas, there’s little reason to think it will leave the stage with her.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369958843899</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 20:07:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369959531077-195</Id><Title>Huge Majority Says Economy Should Trump Congressional Investigations</Title><Msg>An overwhelming majority of Americans said that the economy and unemployment should take precedence over the Congressional investigations into the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups, the Justice Department's subpoena of Associated Press phone records and last year's deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, according to a new poll from Quinnipiac University released Thursday.
