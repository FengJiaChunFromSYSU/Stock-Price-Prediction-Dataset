About 76,000 flights take off each day in the US alone---so your arguement does not hold water. Yes, there are alot less 787's flying--but the learning curve is real, and those who now it understand----couple of hundred units go through a steep learning curve like anything else--except this is complicated by thousands of parts and processes.

As the New York Times reports: The last time President Obama paid a visit here, as a candidate in 2008, he was cheered on by 200,000 Germans eager to see the back of George W. Bush and, as one member of that crowd recalled Tuesday, “full of wholly unrealistic expectations of what kind of miracles Obama could work.” When he arrived here on Tuesday evening ahead of a full day of talks — capped by a speech at the Brandenburg Gate — the reception was far more restrained. Almost five years later, Germans have undergone “a brutal sobering up” with regard to Mr. Obama, said Ralf #$%$, who heads the board of the Heinrich Böll Foundation, a nonprofit political organization in Berlin. It is, he said, as overdone as the euphoria of 2008, but also a bit alarming.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371649803610</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:50:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371649984277-50</Id><Title>REAL AMERICAN DON'T FEAR FREEDOM</Title><Msg>The fear of freedom is reserved for Democrats and other statists.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371649984277</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:53:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371650217845-51</Id><Title>Guess Who's Getting $70 Million in Bonuses?</Title><Msg>Despite being under heavy scrutiny from both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill and all over the country for inappropriately targeting conservative groups, IRS employees are about to receive $70 million in bonuses. The Internal Revenue Service is about to pay $70 million in employee bonuses despite an Obama administration directive to cancel discretionary bonuses because of automatic spending cuts enacted this year, according to a GOP senator. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa says his office has learned that the IRS is executing an agreement with the employees' union on Wednesday to pay the bonuses. Grassley says the bonuses should be canceled under an April directive from the White House budget office. The directive was written by Danny Werfel, a former budget official who has since been appointed acting IRS commissioner. "The IRS always claims to be short on resources," Grassley said. "But it appears to have $70 million for union bonuses. And it appears to be making an extra effort to give the bonuses despite opportunities to renegotiate with the union and federal instruction to cease discretionary bonuses during sequestration." And how is this even possible? Through unions and government bureaucracy. Office of Management and Budget "guidance directs that agencies should not pay discretionary monetary awards at this time, unless legally required," IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said in a statement. "IRS is under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement, which specifies the terms by which awards are paid to bargaining-unit employees." Eldridge, however, would not say whether the IRS believes it is contractually obligated to pay the bonuses. "In accordance with OMB guidance, the IRS is actively engaged with NTEU on these matters in recognition of our current budgetary constraints," Eldridge said. The National Treasury Employees Union did not respond to requests for comment.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371650217845</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:56:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371650613224-52</Id><Topic><Title>REAL AMERICAN DON'T FEAR FREEDOM</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371649984277</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:53:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>f'n idiot !</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371650613224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:03:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371650708479-53</Id><Title>Obama is Failing Our Veterans</Title><Msg>Picture a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who, returning home to Georgia after being wounded in Afghanistan, sits down at the kitchen table to fill out a benefits claim to send to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He’s not expecting a lot of money, but it will help his family get by while he makes the transition to the civilian workforce now that he’s completed his service to his country. How long do you think that Marine veteran will have to wait to get an answer on his claims benefit? Two weeks? Thirty days? Sixty days? Ninety? Not even close. If he lives in the Atlanta area, he will wait an average of 337 days—about 11 months—while the VA decides his claim. And in fact, it may be much longer. Atlanta veterans filing a first claim may wait as long as 473 days, or well over one year. That’s according to a recent report from the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR), which has been tireless in chronicling the ways in which our government is failing the men and women who have served in uniform. CIR has provided heroic in-depth coverage of the bureaucratic dysfunction at the VA, where hundreds of thousands of veterans are in limbo waiting for their pending claims to be processed. Enough is enough. It’s time for President Obama to take charge of the deteriorating situation at the VA by removing the current leadership, specifically VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, and installing new executive leadership to lead an organizational turnaround at the department. In spite of the president’s repeated vows to fix the backlog, the situation has grown worse over the last four years. When Obama took office in 2009, there were 12,5000 veterans who had waited more than a year for their claims to be resolved. Today, that number has grown to nearly 245,000—a 2,000 percent increase in four years.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371650708479</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:05:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371650803712-54</Id><Topic><Title>REAL AMERICAN DON'T FEAR FREEDOM</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371649984277</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:53:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey ......stick.man......great name calling.......got any real skills?</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371650803712</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:06:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371650968956-55</Id><Topic><Title>REAL AMERICAN DON'T FEAR FREEDOM</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371649984277</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:53:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More correctly, democrats, or the leftists running the democrat party, strrke fear in the uninformed populus regarding freedom.

Politico reports: The House Tuesday passed a bill that would ban most abortions nationwide after 20 weeks. The most far-reaching abortion legislation in the House in a decade, it was passed 228-196 mostly along party lines. The vote is largely symbolic: The bill will be dead on arrival in the Senate. And the White House has already threatened to veto the“fetal pain” legislation, which is based on the controversial assertion that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of development. But Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), the bill’s sponsor, didn’t find that discouraging. He pointed to the last time Congress passed a bill of this scope, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. That bill fell short and faced court battles before it finally became law. “I think if you hearken back to partial-birth abortion … everybody said you know, it’s not constitutional, it can’t pass, it can’t go anywhere, and it took time to do that and it even had to succeed a presidential veto. But it eventually did,” Franks said. Meanwhile, the Pro-Life Susan B. Anthony List released the following statement: “Congress has taken an important first step toward making sure we stop abortionists like Kermit Gosnell and his horrific abortion clinic and procedures. The House listened to the overwhelming majority of Americans, men and women, who instinctively recoil at the dehumanizing and degrading practice of late-term abortion,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, President of the SBA List. “This pro-woman, pro-science, Constitutional bill deserves an immediate vote in the U.S. Senate. It’s simple: children capable of experiencing unimaginable pain from abortion must be protected across the country. “The big abortion industry cannot defend late-term abortions. Americans are disturbed by the callous nature of this practice, the disgusting clinic conditions in Pennsylvania, Delaware and other states, the 330,000 abortions Planned Parenthood of America performs every year as it receives half a billion in taxpayer dollars, and the repeated harm women experience as a result of their exploitation. Women and the unborn deserve better than abortion, and making late-term abortions illegal is a simple step in that direction. Votes have consequences. Congress should take note we're pulling together our 2014 target list tonight.” For what it’s worth, according to a recent Gallup poll, 80 percent of Americans believe third trimester abortions should be illegal.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371651306501</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:15:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371651678027-57</Id><Topic><Title>Freedom can be a dangerous thing !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371649393916</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:43:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like the freedom to buy or not to buy medical insurance but Democrats don't want Americans to have that freedom.

Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, was speaking on a day that saw strong orders for Boeing's Dreamliner range, as well as the launch of a newer model of the range, the 787-10, a stretched version of the aircraft. Air Lease Corporation purchased 33 airplanes on Tuesday, ordering three 787-9s and 30 787-10s. GE Capital Aviation Services, International Airlines Group, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines have also all opted for the Dreamliner. For Tinseth, Boeing has forced Airbus into a corner it cannot escape when it comes to the wide body market. "They're trying to address this really broad market with one family of three types (A350)" he told CNBC. "We've been doing really well with the 787 and the 777. We have just extended our 787 line; were going to improve on the 777; we're going to have airplanes bigger than theirs and smaller than theirs. "We're going to have direct competition across each of their products. We've got them boxed and bracketed. We have a greater opportunity because we can address more of the market. So I don't see how they grow their share." Boeing believes its 787s can easily compete with Airbus' A350 when it comes to less seat numbers, and its 777 range can attack Airbus regarding higher seat figures.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1371651739363</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:22:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371651808789-59</Id><Topic><Title>BREAKING: Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act Passes House, 228-196</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371651306501</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:15:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't believe in abortion. but, still can not force my views on the mother.

The recall blemishes a clean public record for the Model S, which received a near-perfect score from the influential Consumer Reports magazine.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1371652224913</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:30:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371652535638-64</Id><Topic><Title>Freedom can be a dangerous thing !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371649393916</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:43:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and you don't give a dam about the people who cant get insurance because of preexisting conditions do you scmbaag</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1371652535638</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:35:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371652608777-65</Id><Topic><Title>Freedom can be a dangerous thing !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371649393916</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:43:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dopey joe you know less about freedom than my peekapoos- get your keepers to explain it to you--</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1371652608777</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:36:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371653162273-66</Id><Topic><Title>Freedom can be a dangerous thing !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371649393916</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:43:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Democrats don't care about the 40 million people who are losing their insurance and a substantial portion of their wages because employers are cutting their hours below 30 hours a week to keep from having to buy unaffordable insurance mandated by Obamacare.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1371653162273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:46:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371653368049-67</Id><Topic><Title>BREAKING: Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act Passes House, 228-196</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371651306501</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:15:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>late term abortions??? abortion at 24 weeks is not late term you lying RWNJ sas kisser-- we are going to be teaching you lifers something about abortion before this is over</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1371653368049</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:49:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371653579403-68</Id><Title>Why are Democrats so Stingy?</Title><Msg>If the minimum wage helps lift poor people out of poverty why won't Democrats raise it to a decent level like $50 an hour or at least equal to the highest paid union wage?

AKA, father_Zosima, Did you discuss the "Engin" issue with Paul Allen first ? . Why is a "moron" responsible for reporting that a 787 plane had to be diverted, that is an emergency landing not like a normal condition, . this is a standard FAA requirement and is a major news story. Especially since the 787 has only 100 planes to fly compared to airbus planes flying in the multiple thousands and no oil filter issue.. In fact the 787 is 4 years late , grounded for 4 months, and 30 billion dollars over expected cost. With 4 extra years to test and get it right, a oil filter or indicator light issue should have been solved by now . Father -whsteffanms, the only "moron" around here is the person who thinks a safety of flight issue on a 787, is something to cover up and that would be father -whsteffanms as usual. Father as a self proclaimed barker for Boeing, nothing could go wrong. with Boeing right and Airbus stock being 117% better gain than Boeing over 3 years is also just a "moron" report too for you to consider.

Marsha Blackburn happily stepped up and took over the House GOP’s post-20 week abortion ban from Trent Franks this week, after Franks made his ignorant comments about the bill not needing an exception for rape victims, because “the incidence of pregnancy from rape is very low.” Franks certainly didn’t help the party with its post Todd Akin outreach to women voters. con't Blackburn would seem to be an odd choice to help Republicans improve their popularity with women. On “Meet the Press” just two weeks ago she made headlines by insisting women “don’t want” equal pay laws (she of course voted against the Lilly Ledbetter fair pay act.) Now she’s insisting that the House GOP’s anti-abortion bill is meant to help women, too. While it now includes an exception for victims of rape and incest, it will only apply to women who have reported those crimes to police, when a majority of survivors do not. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, Blackburn tried to explain to an incredulous Craig Melvin that the measure is designed to help women, because it will “rid our society of these perpetrators who carry out these crimes, many times repeatedly.” “How are you fighting rape with an abortion bill?” Melvin asked, and Blackburn gave the new all-purpose GOP answer about abortion: “Something, something, something…Kermit Gosnell.” Republicans are using the hideous Gosnell case to revive their anti-abortion crusade with a pro-women twist. Blackburn threw all kinds of bogus statistics and junk science at Melvin, who fought back by noting that the American Medical Association and other major physicians’ groups have weighed in and denied the claim that fetuses can feel pain before roughly 24 weeks, the same age at which they are usually considered viable. Blackburn acted like she didn’t hear him, continuing to blithely insist, “This is one of those issues where science is on our side, public opinion is on our side.”</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371663965242</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 13:46:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371664218053-110</Id><Topic><Title>Tom O"Brien on Boeing stock price today and the Boeing advertisement show</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371599640278</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 19:54:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TSLA this Moring in an hour day trade, it is easy if you are a stock trader, 102 to 106.52 in just a little over an hour, a traders paradise.

Bollinger was the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that upheld the University of Michigan Law School's racial admissions policy. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, said the U.S. Constitution "does not prohibit the Law School's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body." But what are the educational benefits of a diverse student body? Intellectuals argue that diversity is necessary for academic excellence, but what's the evidence? For example, Japan is a nation bereft of diversity in any activity. Close to 99 percent of its population is of one race. Whose students do you think have higher academic achievement -- theirs or ours? According to the 2009 Program for International Student Assessment, the academic performance of U.S. high-school students in reading, math and science pales in comparison with their diversity-starved counterparts in Japan. Should companies be treated equally? According to a Wall Street Journal op-ed (9/7/2009) by Manhattan Institute's energy expert Robert Bryce, Exxon Mobil pleaded guilty in federal court to killing 85 birds that had come into contact with its pollutants. The company paid $600,000 in fines and fees. A recent Associated Press story (5/14/2013) reported that "more than 573,000 birds are killed by the country's wind farms each year, including 83,000 hunting birds such as hawks, falcons and eagles, according to an estimate published in March in the peer-reviewed Wildlife Society Bulletin." The Obama administration has never fined or prosecuted windmill farms, sometimes called bird Cuisinarts, for killing eagles and other protected bird species. In fact, AP reports that the Obama administration has shielded the industry from liability and has helped keep the scope of the deaths secret. It's interesting that The Associated Press chose to report the story only after the news about its reporters being secretly investigated. That caused the Obama administration to fall a bit out of favor with them. But what the heck, the 14th Amendment's requirement of "equal protection" before the law for everybody can be cast aside in the name of diversity, so why can't it be cast aside in the name of saving the planet? There are politically favored industries just as there are politically favored groups.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371664914814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:01:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371664983693-116</Id><Topic><Title>Why are Democrats so Stingy?</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1371653579403</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:52:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You`re a product of your screwed up imagination. when you hear those little men starting talking that`s when you need to worry.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1371664983693</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:03:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371665199125-117</Id><Title>according to Matthews, sun ruined Belin speech</Title><Msg>Thats what I mean, just everyone trying to keep BO down.</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1371665199125</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:06:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371665515971-118</Id><Topic><Title>What's the difference between a progressive, a Democrat, a liberal and a racist?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371664914814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:01:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's the difference between a progressive, a liberal and a racist?

Griffith's "Birth of a Nation" movie, glorifying the KKK, that he invited various dignitaries to the White House to view it with him. During one private screening, President Wilson exclaimed: "It's like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true." When President Wilson introduced racial segregation to the civil service, the NAACP and the National Independent Political League protested.

Wealthy donors give people like Sowell the financial freedom to rail against entitlement programs and rewrite history, particularly the Great Depression. Consequently, they are not bound by prickly things like facts or editors or journalistic ethics.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1371668840360</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 15:07:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371670477441-126</Id><Topic><Title>according to Matthews, sun ruined Belin speech</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1371665199125</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:06:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is a "Belin speech"?</Msg><Username>norivit</Username><Timestamp>1371670477441</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 15:34:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371670820349-127</Id><Topic><Title>the truth about TWA flight 800 No2</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1371617834753</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 00:57:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of the witnesses, commenting on the investigation, said "The agenda was that this was an accident--make it so."

It's Already Happening, Poll Finds</Title><Msg>Small business owners' fear of the effect of the new health-care reform law on their bottom line is prompting many to hold off on hiring and even to shed jobs in some cases, a recent poll found. "We were startled because we know that employers were concerned about the Affordable Care Act and the effects it would have on their business, but we didn't realize the extent they were concerned, or that the businesses were being proactive to make sure the effects of the ACA actually were minimized," said attorney Steven Friedman of Littler Mendelson. His firm, which specializes in employment law, commissioned the Gallup poll. "If the small businesses' fears are reasonable, then it could mean that the small business sector grows slower than what economic conditions otherwise would indicate. And small businesses have been a growth engine in the economy," Friedman told CNBC. Forty-one percent of the businesses surveyed have frozen hiring because of the health-care law known as Obamacare. And almost one-fifth—19 percent— answered "yes" when asked if they had "reduced the number of employees you have in your business as a specific result of the Affordable Care Act." The poll was taken by 603 owners whose businesses have under $20 million in annual sales. Another 38 percent of the small business owners said they "have pulled back on their plans to grow their business" because of Obamacare. Those are "some pretty startling answers," Friedman said. "To think that [nearly] 20 percent of small businesses have already reduced the numbers they have in their business because they're concerned about the medical coverage is significant, and a bit troubling," Friedman said.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371674726433</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 16:45:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371675131986-150</Id><Topic><Title>Will Obamacare Hurt Jobs?

"Friedman said that Littler Mendelson, which recently created a health-care reform consulting group, had heard small business clients talk about their fear that the rules and other effects of the ACA will lead to higher costs. The poll supported that anecdotal data with the finding that 48 percent of owners think the law will be bad for their bottom line. Just 9 percent of the small employers surveyed agreed that Obamacare would be "good for your business," while another 39 percent saw "no impact." The prevalent pessimism tracks other answers in the poll, which showed that 55 percent of small business owners believe that the ACA will lead to higher health-care costs. By contrast, about 5 percent said the law would lead to lower costs. And more than half—52 percent—said they expected a reduction in the quality of health care under Obamacare, while just 13 percent expected an improvement. "I can't say that the fears appear overstated, because the potential for big problems seems rather large," Friedman said about law's implementation. "We don't know until 2014 and beyond what the impact of the ACA will be on businesses," he said. "There is tremendous fear that the premiums will be much higher, for small businesses especially. At this point we can't look a client straight in the eye and say, 'Don't worry about it. Everything will be fine.'

Any list of errors is unflattering, but President George W Bush's catalogue of mistakes is particularly impressive. Some Neo-Con’s may argue that some entries here, such as not signing Kyoto, belong in a best moments list. Others even the president has admitted were #$%$-ups. By Nick Greene in Washington 4:02PM GMT 13 Jan 2009 1) No WMDs Mr Bush built his entire case for war on the claim that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. However, he chose to ignore conflicting evidence and forever undermined not only his presidency, but the reputation of US intelligence agencies and his country in much of the world. 2) "Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job" Mr Bush could not control the weather, but he had control in naming the director of FEMA, the agency in charge of disaster mitigation. His appointee, Mike Brown, was woefully underprepared and failed to facilitate proper aid to the stranded victims of Hurricane Katrina. Despite his tragic miscues, Mr Bush famously told his pall "Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job." 3) No Post-War Plan for Iraq The outgoing president achieved his goal of ousting Saddam Hussein but had little planned for a destabilised post-Saddam Iraq. After six years, thousands of military casualties, an untold amount of Iraqi civilian deaths, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, the war is still not over. 4) Permitting Torture By stating that the Geneva Convention did not apply to "enemy combatants," Mr Bush paved the way for waterboarding, attack dogs, and other draconian interrogation tactics that will forever be associated with his presidency.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1371686148011</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 19:55:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371686256167-182</Id><Title>The future of RepubliCon leaderlessship Con't.</Title><Msg>5) Ignoring Pre-9/11 Terror Memo Just weeks before 9/11, while spending a holiday at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, Mr Bush received a memo from the CIA entitled, "Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US". While the President cannot respond to every single threat presented to the country, the timing and nature of this particular warning will forever blight his legacy. 6) "Mission Accomplished" Mr Bush's bombastic declaration of victory in Iraq while aboard an aircraft carrier in May 2003 was premature to say the least: the vast majority of war casualties have occurred since the unfurling of the "mission accomplished" banner. He has admitted this was one of his biggest mistakes. 7) Entering Iraq without a UN mandate. After months of deliberation, the UN Security Council could not come to an agreement over the proposed invasion of Iraq. Mr Bush impatiently led a "coalition of the willing" into the country and his decision is still considered by the UN to be illegal. 8) Insisting there was a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Mr Bush aimed to strengthen his case for war by linking the perpetrators of 9/11 to Saddam Hussein. As of today there is little to no evidence supporting his claim. 9) Failing to capture Osama bin Laden After 9/11, Mr Bush's primary goal was to capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. More than seven years have passed and the only evidence of Bin Laden is a series of grainy video tapes taunting Mr Bush and the United States. 10) Abandoning the Kyoto Protocol In 2001, Mr Bush refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty that requires participating countries to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. He cited its effect on the economy, but the auto industry is already on the brink and global climate change is a real problem. Even merely as a sign of intent, his signature would have been helpful.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1371686256167</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 19:57:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371686312381-183</Id><Title>The future of RepubliCon leaderlessship Con't.</Title><Msg>10) Abandoning the Kyoto Protocol In 2001, Mr Bush refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty that requires participating countries to lower their greenhouse gas emissions.

Even merely as a sign of intent, his signature would have been helpful. 11) Refusing to let Katrina ruin his holiday Hurricane Katrina hit towards the end of a long summer holiday for Mr Bush. His immediate response was not to view the damage personally, but at five miles high through the window of Air Force One on his way back to Washington. 12) Underestimating the cost of the war Like a contractor's ever-inflating estimates of a home renovation, Mr Bush's original $50-$60 billion price tag on the Iraq war sounds like a steal now. The current cost is closer to $600 billion. 13) Lack of body armour for US troops Due to the budget constraints of an expensive war, many US troops lacked proper armour for the challenges in Iraq. There have been reports of families turning to eBay to purchase protective gear for their sons and daughters stationed in the Middle East. 14) Failure to include Louisiana's coastal parishes in state of emergency plan On August 27, 2005, two days before Hurricane Katrina hit, President Bush declared a state of emergency for parts of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Not included on that list were the coastal areas of Louisiana that included New Orleans, the city hit hardest by Katrina. 15) Tax cuts for the wealthy Believing wealthy Americans would take their fortunes to tax shelters, Mr Bush granted large tax cuts to keep their cash in the US. Critics contend it disproved the trickle down theory, as the economy headed into recession.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1371686312381</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 19:58:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371686408190-184</Id><Title>The future of RepubliCon leaderlessship Con't.</Title><Msg>16) Losing focus on Afghanistan The early campaign in Afghanistan was relatively successful. Rather than continuing the effort there however, Mr Bush quickly switched focus to Iraq. Many, including President-Elect Barack Obama, believe that a greater presence in Afghanistan would be more effective in the war on terror. 17) Limiting stem cell research One of President Bush's earliest decisions was to restrict the research of embryonic stem cells. These types of studies have shown tremendous results in lab rats (such as reversing the course of Parkinson's in the rodents). Humans will have to wait for his policy to be annulled before seeing any benefits. 18) Appointment and backing of Alberto Gonzales Mr Bush appointed an old Texan friend Alberto Gonzales as his Attorney General after the resignation of John Ashcroft. Widely criticised as a sycophantic foil to "Dubya", Mr Gonzales oversaw questionable US attorney dismissals and the NSA's warrantless wiretapping before eventually resigning. Along with Mike Brown, Alberto Gonzales is an example of Mr Bush's perceived penchant for surrounding himself with "yes men" rather than qualified individuals 19) Awarding lucrative Iraq reconstruction contracts to Halliburton Halliburton, Vice President #$%$ Cheney's old employer, received a large reconstruction contract in Iraq shortly after the onset of the war. Rumours of it not having to bid are unfounded, but claims of a conflict of interest remain. In addition, their exportation of the country's oil has been a largely unsuccessful endeavour. 20) Warrantless Wiretapping Shortly after 9/11, President Bush authorised the warrantless wiretapping of certain telephone calls for the sake of national security. Eavesdropping would often top most Presidents' list of reprehensible acts but Mr Bush, supported by Congress, contended that it helped keep America safe I ask you, when has a person with any respect had the only shoes a person has ever owned thrown away at them?</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1371686408190</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 20:00:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371688128895-185</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Continue War on Women</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371663965242</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 13:46:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How can minorities break the chains of entitlement slavery when democrats keep pushing for more entitlements?

For exactly 365 days in the mid-1970s, the plane belonged to the Imperial Iranian Air Force. No connection has been established between that fact and the fiery midair explosion that knocked the plane out of the sky last week, killing all 230 on board. But it was during the jet's 12-month stint in the Iranian military that another TWA 747 owned by Iran was destroyed near Madrid in a midair explosion much like the one that destroyed Flight 800 off Long Island last week. It was the only other time a 747 has burst into flames in midair. No cause was determined in the Madrid crash, but officials believe that either an unusual blast of wind tore the left wing off or a stray electrical spark from a fuel-system pump, perhaps triggered by lightning, ignited jet fuel fumes inside the left wing. As a result, the Federal Aviation Administration in 1976 ordered 747 wings checked for fuel leaks, and Boeing subsequently took steps to make the fuel system safer. But it's not known whether those safeguards were taken on the 747 that burst into flames off Long Island. At the time, the plane was exempt from civil-aviation rules and directives because it was in military service. Boeing spokesman Doug Webb said he could not say whether the fuel-system upgrades were made once the jet was repurchased by TWA in December 1976. The jet had been continuously operated by TWA since then, according to a records review conducted for The Times by Kolbenschlag Aviation Services of Falls City, Ore. TWA spokesman Don Morrison said he could not say specifically why the Long Island jet was sold to Iran and repurchased but said the transaction occurred during a time when airlines were adjusting the size of their fleets in reaction to market conditions.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371695664696</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 22:34:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371695919261-195</Id><Topic><Title>the truth about TWA flight 800 No2</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1371617834753</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 00:57:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the above was from seattle times in 1996 - as is the following Federal aviation and Boeing service records contain extensive documentation about where the wing and belly tanks on 747s are susceptible to leaks that can cause fire. NTSB Vice Chairman Robert Francis, who is heading the investigation into the crash of TWA Flight 800, has declined to compare how much credence investigators are giving to the bomb vs. leaky fuel theories. ut investigators have been piecing together the section of the plane they believe will provide them with the most clues on what caused the belly and right wing tanks to rupture and burn, a sequence that most likely began about a half a minute after things began to go wrong shortly after it departed New York's John F. Kennedy Airport bound for Paris. The center section, between rows 17 and 28, is where the blast is believed to have originated, a source said. Those seats are near where the central fuel tank is located and where the wings are attached to the plane. An explosive device precisely placed in the passenger cabin above the belly tank or in a cavity adjoining the belly or wing tank would punch a crippling hole in the airplane's most vulnerable, volatile area. Another way things could have gotten started is if fuel or fuel vapors leaking from the belly or wing tanks accidentally ignited in an adjacent cavity. It may have been a two-staged event," said Mike Hynes, an independent crash investigator from Frederick, Okla. "You could've had a malfunction of some kind . . . followed by a big splash of fuel going off." Federal avaiation and Boeing service records on the 747 show several ways that the wing and belly tanks on 747s are susceptible to leaks that can cause fire.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371695919261</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 22:38:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371695983678-196</Id><Topic><Title>the truth about TWA flight 800 No2</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1371617834753</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 00:57:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Federal avaiation and Boeing service records on the 747 show several ways that the wing and belly tanks on 747s are susceptible to leaks that can cause fire. -- Fuel and fuel vapors can seep past each of the thousands of fasteners used to form the front wall of the belly tank. To account for this design characteristic, Boeing applied a rubber-like sealant, called CAT-A-LAC, on the heads of each fastener. As an extra measure of protection against leaks, Boeing also called for application of the sealant on the other end of all the fasteners. But in 1989 Boeing sent a service document to 747 operators warning that "the secondary fuel barrier may not have been properly applied to some areas . . . An inspection of an airplane in production revealed that the back side of fasteners and brackets may not have been coated as these areas were shielded from the spray. This coating is required to prevent fuel or fuel vapors from entering the cargo and passenger compartments in the event of a failure of a primary fuel seal or a crack in the center section structure." In 1991, the FAA gave airlines 30 months to inspect for this production oversight and apply the secondary barrier. TWA officials have said that the Flight 800 jet complied with this and other federal directives. -- Another FAA directive, last updated in 1994, instructs 747 operators to repeatedly inspect hundreds of fasteners in a 10 foot length of the wing tanks above each of the inboard engines - an area in close proximity to the fractured and scorched parts of Flight 800's right wing. Fastener holes on jets with more than 13,000 flights are prone to begin cracking and leaking near the inboard engines and into cavities where electrical pumps and wiring are housed.

Fastener holes on jets with more than 13,000 flights are prone to begin cracking and leaking near the inboard engines and into cavities where electrical pumps and wiring are housed. -- Most recently, an airline discovered that when electrical insulation on a 747's fuel pump failed (the plane was on the ground at the time), electricity burned a hole in the pump's case, letting fuel leak and then igniting it. On Aug. 7, in a move officials said was not related to Flight 800, the FAA proposed a directive requiring regular testing and possible replacement of 747 fuel pumps. Following a 90-day comment period, the FAA will decide whether to issue the order. An extensive account of how a small fire or explosion near the 747's fuel system during flight can escalate in disaster was detailed in the late 1970s when the safety board concluded a 30-month investigation into the 1976 fire and explosion of an Iranian air force 747-100 near Madrid. In that case, investigators believe lightning struck a wing, causing a fuel sensor to emit an electrical spark that ignited fuel vapors inside the wing.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371696007091</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 22:40:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371699763768-198</Id><Topic><Title>the truth about TWA flight 800 No2</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1371617834753</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 00:57:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My point is not to generate an evidence-free hypothesis, but only to demonstrate a situation by which both sides would want to cover up an act of revenge.
