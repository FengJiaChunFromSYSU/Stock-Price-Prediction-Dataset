The batteries are at the center of ongoing investigations into the safety of the Dreamliner, after two fires on different aircraft last month. Boeing's statement came after Airbus announced this morning it will not use lithium-ion batteries in its new A350 XWB passenger jet, a Dreamliner competitor, as it had planned. Instead, it will use more proven nickel cadmium batteries, hoping to avoid mandated changes that could result from investigations into the Dreamliner fires, so it will keep to its delivery schedule. The change will not affect how the aircraft operates, a spokesperson said. Boeing has already warned airlines it will likely miss deliveries of the Dreamliner, but it is standing by the new technology. The especially powerful batteries allow the aircraft to be lighter and more fuel efficient, a key selling point. Here's Boeing's statement: Boeing is confident in the safety and reliability of lithium-ion batteries. Our years of experience and deep expertise confirm that, like other technologies, when the appropriate battery, system and airplane protections are in place, lithium-ion batteries deliver significant benefits. We are deeply involved with the appropriate investigation authorities in developing a full understanding of two recent battery events on 787s and are working tirelessly to create the solutions that will allow the 787 fleet to return to full flight status. There's nothing we've learned in the investigations that would lead us to a different decision regarding lithium-ion batteries.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360992589325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 00:29:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360992882111-2</Id><Title>Manufacturing Acceptance of Murdering Anyone without Trial</Title><Msg>No matter what you think about the Christopher Dorner case, this video / audio clip should be listened to: 1:00 “we’re going to go forward with the plan with the burn” 1:14 “like we talked about” 1:27: “burners deployed, we have a fire” “copy 7, burners deployed, we have a fire” RPG round? 2:27 “Guys be ready on the #4 side, we have a fire out front, might come out the back” Eliminating any possible chance for further publicity and exposure, the “burn” most likely destroyed Dorner and other additional evidence he might have had. We’ll have to wait and see if this will be “spun” by the media into being “necessary” and “essential for safety” or “accidental” or whatever. Clearly it was intentional. There are already many Americans who think this was necessary. They’re willing to trash the rights of anyone who has become targetted or deemed “guilty” without a trial. This is a very bad sign for America, because it means that we not only have no rule of law, but that the People do not want the rule of law either. For the record, this is the same tactic used on Osama Bin Laden, the alleged “mastermind” of 9/11. He was “convicted” without trial. No evidence of his guilt or crime has ever been shown. He was not even on the FBI most wanted list (ever). It was the same tactic used on David Koresh and 73 others. Koresh could have easily been arrested on his weekly trips into town, but the tactics chosen were to assault the compound where many other innocent people lived, including dozens of children. All died. While we are all rightly concerned about NDAA and the so-called “authority” to assassinate Americans taken by the President, the practice of assassinating Americans has already been well underway for many years. It is always claimed as “justified”. All they’re doing now is trying to legitimize it and implant this practice into the minds of Americans as being “ok”. Millions of Americans ARE ok with this. It’s one of the reason I’ve stopped writing. America is being overtaken by people who are dangerously deluded, abandoning all notions of law, restrictions, common sense and the need to adhere to our Constitutional rights. They’d rather just let the government and it’s agents handle all of that. Whatever they say, goes. And if it means assassinating trouble-makers, so be it. I’m making no apologies for Dorner. I’m pointing out that murder is murder, and even murderers are supposed to get their day in court. Law enforcement does not have the right to commit murder, period. There is no discussion about this. For all of you that think this is “ok”, God help you. One day it will be your turn as you stare down the barrel of your judge, jury and executioner who has taken it upon his or herself to arbitrarily decide if you should live or die. That is EXACTLY what is at the heart of these crimes. Abdicating the rule of law, the requirement of evidence and the day in court is a terrifying precedent, already long established. The NDAA is just icing on the cake.</Msg><Username>generaljackripper</Username><Timestamp>1360992882111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 00:34:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360992996300-3</Id><Topic><Title>It will fly in the Boardroom ,the lithium batteries stay, but 787 grounded group think 4 years late 33 billion so far</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360992589325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 00:29:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>riiiight ....There's nothing we've learned in the investigations that would lead us to a different decision regarding lithium-ion batteries...

African Americans didn't choose the president based on skill set and ability to run the country. That's clear because the recession ended in June of 2009 and Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery since WW2, and has been blowing taxpayer dough faster than a welfare queen at a gambling boat, so we know it isn't his executive skill set that attracts Blacks. Chris Rock was honest in telling us that Blacks have an emotional need for a "boss" and a "dad" as they don't posess the mirror neurons that have been developed by other Americans who are independent and understand that the president is an "employee" of "We The People" and it is his honor to serve us the greatest nation on the planet. Blacks are like the kids who never leave home because they can't care for themselves and need dad to take care of them and they see Obama being that dad. The Republicans are like that dad that teaches you to provide for yourself and wants you out of his house and on your own sooner rather than later. Blacks apparently don't like that kind of dad.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1361025731363</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 09:42:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361027868305-20</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1360890547211</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 20:09:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you mention the NDAA and indefininte detention of Americans without trial you're a racist...if you mention Drones that can now kill Americans you're insane...if you mention Trillions in debt ging to cronies on Wallstreet youre a conspracy theorist.....There is a Stockholm syndrome style Cult member abrogation of critical thinking ... its not just Hooz and/or Genna and a few others on this board...its many millions of Americans...Posting on this board has been an education on the depths of depravity of our fellow Americans....(if thats what you want to call them).</Msg><Username>generaljackripper</Username><Timestamp>1361027868305</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 10:17:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361028915339-21</Id><Topic><Title>Why Do Democrats Get 90%+ of the African-American Votes?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1360963111034</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 16:18:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cause they're Low information and/or Racists?

My view is that Blacks might feel that way because they are still dependent on government as their "Boss" and "Dad" and are comfortable with that type of relationship with their government. I pointed out that Obama works for the people and the people are his "Boss" and we already have dads. But Chris Rock is honest in describing the mindset of Blacks IMO. The Dems are like the parents who won't tell their kids the truth about their own lack of effort and failure. They have lied to Blacks and pretend to care about them but caring isn't enough and it isn't working and the drifting away from traditional values of America is destroying the Black community. #$%$ the Progressive race card playing PC nonsense and start placing responsibility where it belongs, at the feet of the black community. ___________________________________________ Dumb as a Doorknob: Academic Performance of Blacks Continues to Decline It appears that over the past decades, from as far back as slavery and Jim Crow and right up until the civil rights and black power movements, the esteem in which education is held in the African American community diminished significantly. It was Malcolm X who said, “Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.” In general terms, academic prowess and proficiency is on the decline for America regardless of ethnic persuasion, with the exception of Asian Americans. In fact we may be producing the stupidest generation in American history and present statistics suggest that U.S. high school students are basically incompetent in the areas of math, science, history, economics and geography. According to a survey conducted by the National Geographic Society, only 37 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 can find Iraq on a world map and 50 percent of Americans cannot locate the state of New York on a map. Moreover, only 43 percent of all U.S. high school students knew that the Civil War was fought sometime between 1850 and 1900. Today, American 15-year-olds do not even rank in the top half of all advanced nations when it comes to math or science literacy based on a report published by the National Center for Education Statistics. Although the aforementioned is for all Americans, statistics for African Americans is even worse. A new study released by Seattle Public Schools revealed that African American students whose primary language is English, perform significantly worse in math and reading than black African immigrant students who speak another language at home. Findings of the Seattle study indicate that only 36 percent of black students who speak English at home passed their grade’s math test, while 47 percent of Somali-speaking students passed. Other black ethnic groups did even better. In reading, 56 percent of black students who speak English passed, while 67 percent of Somali-speaking students passed with other black ethnic groups scoring higher again. However, still in concert black students scored lower than the district average of 78 percent for reading. As it stands presently, the African American community is moving farther and further away from the traditions and values that maintained our collective integrity — specifically the value and importance we attributed to reading and education. Today about 41 percent of African American males graduate from high school in the United States according to the Schott Foundation for Public Education and just 22 percent of African American males who began at a four-year college graduated within six years according to the National Student Clearinghouse/Study by Consortium on Chicago School Research at the University of Chicago. Maybe this is why 69 percent of African American children in America cannot read at grade level in the 4th grade, compared with 29 percent among White children. Up until Brown vs. Board of Education, it was discriminatory practices like segregation that kept Africa Americans poorly educated, now it is ourselves. Until we realize that more education is part of the answer, we will always be confronted with social and economic inequity. -torrance stephens</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1361038855951</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 13:20:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361039361772-38</Id><Topic><Title>"We are Socialists, we are enemies of the capitalistic economic system for exploitation of the economically weak…"</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1361032466355</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 11:34:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One National Socialist defending another.</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1361039361772</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 13:29:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361040154441-39</Id><Topic><Title>Confirmed: Obama Made No Calls, Took No Action During Benghazi Attack</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1360970744668</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 18:25:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You guys with your throw-spaghetti-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks tactics are genuinely amusing.

(AP) - Washington transportation officials are making adjustments to three ferries to stop them from tilting to one side when the boats are empty. Assistant Transportation Secretary David Moseley says the listing doesn't create a long-term problem for the vessels but the agency is making the simple fix to respond to concerns brought by customers, crew members and lawmakers. The Daily Herald reports that the work involves adding tons of ballast on each vessel. Moseley says it will cost $300,000 and be completed by the end of June. The adjustments will be made the Chetzemoka, Salish and Kennewick ferries. The boats are designed to lean when there are no vehicles because not all the weight is evenly distributed. But citizens and others worried it could cause future maintenance problems. ==== Wonder if they ever heard of ballast tanks _ oh- takes energy to pump water inn or out and some smarts to load approx evenly ?? So- we add a few tens of thousands of pounds of ballast to carry back and forth for the next 40 years - fuel consumed is generally a function of weight. Sailboats in commercial service usually dumped ballast on one leg or the other or picke up what was needed to keep an even keel- or nearly so.

On Saturday 15 February 2003, more than a million of us – students, toddlers, Christians, Muslims, nuns, Telegraph readers – gathered in Hyde Park for the biggest public demonstration in British history. “Not in my name,” we chanted, as a series of speakers – from Charles Kennedy to Jesse Jackson – lined up to denounce the impending invasion of Iraq. In Glasgow, a sombre yet defiant prime minister delivered a speech to Labour Party activists. Responding to the march in London, Tony Blair declaimed: “The moral case against war has a moral answer: it is the moral case for removing Saddam.” He continued, “It is not the reason we act. That must be according to the United Nations mandate on weapons of mass destruction. But it is the reason, frankly, why if we do have to act, we should do so with a clear conscience.” Whether or not Blair’s conscience remains “clear” is, as he once pointed out, between him and God. But a decade on from the debate about dodgy dossiers, WMDs, 45-minute warnings and various clauses and subclauses of UN Resolution 1441, those of us who marched against the war stand vindicated. We were right; the hawks were wrong. It isn’t the size of our demonstration that those of us against the war should be proud of, it is our judgement. Our arguments and predictions turned out to be correct and those of our belligerent opponents were discredited. Remember the rhetoric? There was “no doubt” that the invaders would “find the clearest possible evidence of Saddam’s weap­ons of mass destruction” (Blair) as well as evidence of how Iraq had “provided training in these weapons [of mass destruction] to al-Qaeda” (Colin Powell); the foreign troops would be “greeted as liberators” #$%$ Cheney); “the establishment of a free Iraq at the heart of the Middle East” would be “a watershed event in the global democratic revolution” (George W Bush). It was a farrago of lies and half-truths, of delusion and doublethink. Aside from the viewers of Fox News, most people are now aware that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, no ties between secular Saddam and Islamist Osama. The fall of the Ba’athist dictatorship failed to usher in a democratic or human-rights revolution. Every argument advanced by the hawks proved to be utterly false. The Iraq war was a strategic disaster – or, as the Tory minister Kenneth Clarke put it in a recent BBC radio discussion, “the most disas­trous foreign policy decision of my lifetime . . . worse than Suez”. The invasion and occupation of the country undermined the moral standing of the western powers; empowered Iran and its proxies; heightened the threat from al-Qaeda at home and abroad; and sent a clear signal to “rogue” regimes that the best (the only?) means of deterring a pre-emptive, US-led attack was to acquire weapons of mass destruction (see Korea, North). There may have been a strong moral case for toppling the tyrant and liberating the Iraqi people – but there was a much stronger moral case against doing so. Brutal and vicious as Saddam’s reign had been, a “humanitarian intervention” could not just be justified in March 2003, given the complete absence of an ongoing or imminent mass slaughter of Iraqis. Some of us warned that the cost of action, in blood and treasure, would far outweigh the cost of inaction. And so it came to pass. The greatest weapon of mass destruction turned out to be the invasion itself. Over the past ten years, Iraqis have witnessed the physical, social and economic destruction of their country – the aerial demolition of schools, homes and hospitals; the siege of cities such as Fallujah; US-led massacres at Haditha, Mahmudiyah and Balad; the biggest refugee crisis in the Middle East since the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948. Between 2003 and 2006, according to a peer-reviewed study in the Lancet medical journal, 601,000 more people died in Iraq as a result of violence – that is, bombed, burned, stabbed, shot and tortured to death – than would have died had the invasion not happened. Proportionately, that is the equivalent of 1.2 million Britons, or six million Americans, being killed over the same period. In a typically defensive (and deceptive) passage in his memoirs, Blair described the Lancet report as “extensively challenged” and said its figures were “charged with being inaccurate and misleading”. Sir Roy Anderson, the then chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence, told ministers in an internal memo that its methods were “close to ‘best practice’” and the study design was “robust”. Presumably, denialism is how hawks sleep at night. They dispute the studies that have uncovered the human cost of the war – whether it be the civilian casualties across the country, or the torture and abuse inside Iraq’s prisons (which a UN investigator described in 2006 as “worse than it has been in the times of Saddam Hussein”), or the fivefold increase in birth defects and fourfold increase in cancers in and around Fallujah. Or they try to blame the violence and turmoil in Iraq exclusively on terrorists, “jihadists” and “Islamofascists”. Few would dispute that most of the killings in Iraq have been carried out by the sadistic monsters who fight for al-Qaeda and its affiliates. But to focus only on the crimes of AQI (or “al-Qaeda in Iraq”) represents a gross moral evasion. First, according to the Lancet survey, 31 per cent of the excess deaths in Iraq can be attributed to coalition forces – about 186,000 people between 2003 and 2006. Second, most studies show that only a minority of Iraqi insurgents were card-carrying members of AQI. The insurgency kicked off in Fallujah on 28 April 2003 as a nationalist campaign, long before the arrival of foreign jihadists but only after US troops opened fire on, and killed, 17 unarmed Iraqi protesters. Third, there were no jihadists operating in Iraq before our Mesopotamian misadventure; Iraq had no history of suicide bombings. Between 2003 and 2008, however, 1,100 suicide bombers blew themselves up inside the country. The war made Iraq, in the approving words of the US general Ricardo Sanchez, “a terrorist mag­net . . . a target of opportunity”. The Iraq invasion turned out to be the best recruiting sergeant that Muslim extremists could ever have prayed for, radicalising thousands of young men from the Middle East to the Midlands. Listen to the verdict of the former head of MI5, Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller: “Whatever the merits of putting an end to Saddam Hussein, the war was also a distraction from the pursuit of al-Qaeda. It increased the terrorist threat . . . [and] spurred some British Muslims to turn to terror.” Ultimately, say some hawks, such arguments are irrelevant. Didn’t Iraqis welcome the removal of Saddam? Despite the bloodshed, isn’t their nation better off as a result of the war? Not quite. “Let me clear it up for any moron with lingering doubts,” wrote the Iraqi blogger known by the pseudonym Riverbend on her blog Baghdad Burning in February 2007. “It’s worse. It’s over. You lost... You lost every sane, red-blooded Iraqi when the Abu Ghraib pictures came out... You lost when you brought murderers, looters, gangsters and militia heads to power...” In September 2011, a Zogby poll found that 42 per cent of Iraqis thought they were “worse off” as a result of the Anglo-American invasion of their country, compared to only 30 per cent of Iraqis who said “better off”. An earlier poll, conducted for the BBC in November 2005, found a slim majority of Iraqis (50.3 per cent) saying the Iraq war was “somewhat” or “absolutely” wrong. Should we be surprised? The post-Saddam government, observes the noted Iraqi novelist and activist Haifa Zangana, is “consumed by sectarian, ethnic division, but above all by corruption”. The Human Rights Watch 2012 report shows how the rights of the Iraqi people are “violated with impunity” by their new rulers. In his book Iraq: from War to a New Authoritarianism, Toby Dodge of the London School of Economics documents how the war has produced an Iraqi system of government not so different from the one it replaced. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Dodge argues, is leading his country towards “an incredibly destructive dictatorship”. The establishment of a liberal democracy on the banks of the Tigris remains a neocon pipe dream. So, Saddam is gone – but at what cost?
