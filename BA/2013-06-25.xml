This is good. Soon we might see his real name in AvWeek. Maybe even a Collier's Trophy is in his future. " I know how to jump the evolution of airplane technology. It is odd that no aerospace of big shot has figured it out. There are two very great aerospace guys in the eastern Washington and Northern Idaho area. I will patent the idea first. I might share when I visit them. I know Forrest Bird , he is a innovator that could help me get it going . Burt Rutan is in Coeur-d-Alene Idaho I go there just about every day". Wayne, 6/24/13 and a little later today he posted: "I know Boeing management and know the problems and probably will sell an invention soon that will be a giant step forward in aerospace technology, not the baby steps of lighter weight planes that is so lame." Wayne 6/24/2013 This from a guy who thinks the A350 is 25 percent more fuel efficient than the 787.</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1372132936142</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 00:02:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372132952597-2</Id><Topic><Title>Muchelle said someone gong to have to give up thier piece of the pie.

The fact is, for as long as I can remember my motivation for getting up every day has been so that you would not have to bury me. As things have continued to get worse, it has become clear that this alone is not a sufficient reason to carry on. The fact is, I am not getting better, I am not going to get better, and I will most certainly deteriorate further as time goes on. From a logical standpoint, it is better to simply end things quickly and let any repercussions from that play out in the short term than to drag things out into the long term. You will perhaps be sad for a time, but over time you will forget and begin to carry on. Far better that than to inflict my growing misery upon you for years and decades to come, dragging you down with me. It is because I love you that I can not do this to you. You will come to see that it is a far better thing as one day after another passes during which you do not have to worry about me or even give me a second thought. You will find that your world is better without me in it. I really have been trying to hang on, for more than a decade now. Each day has been a testament to the extent to which I cared, suffering unspeakable horror as quietly as possible so that you could feel as though I was still here for you. In truth, I was nothing more than a prop, filling space so that my absence would not be noted. In truth, I have already been absent for a long, long time. My body has become nothing but a cage, a source of pain and constant problems. The illness I have has caused me pain that not even the strongest medicines could dull, and there is no cure. All day, every day a screaming agony in every nerve ending in my body. It is nothing short of torture. My mind is a wasteland, filled with visions of incredible horror, unceasing depression, and crippling anxiety, even with all of the medications the doctors dare give. Simple things that everyone else takes for granted are nearly impossible for me. I can not laugh or cry. I can barely leave the house. I derive no pleasure from any activity. Everything simply comes down to passing time until I can sleep again. Now, to sleep forever seems to be the most merciful thing. You must not blame yourself. The simple truth is this: During my first deployment, I was made to participate in things, the enormity of which is hard to describe. War crimes, crimes against humanity. Though I did not participate willingly, and made what I thought was my best effort to stop these events, there are some things that a person simply can not come back from. I take some pride in that, actually, as to move on in life after being part of such a thing would be the mark of a sociopath in my mind. These things go far beyond what most are even aware of. To force me to do these things and then participate in the ensuing coverup is more than any government has the right to demand. Then, the same government has turned around and abandoned me. They offer no help, and actively block the pursuit of gaining outside help via their corrupt agents at the DEA. Any blame rests with them. Beyond that, there are the host of physical illnesses that have struck me down again and again, for which they also offer no help. There might be some progress by now if they had not spent nearly twenty years denying the illness that I and so many others were exposed to. Further complicating matters is the repeated and severe brain injuries to which I was subjected, which they also seem to be expending no effort into understanding. What is known is that each of these should have been cause enough for immediate medical attention, which was not rendered. Lastly, the DEA enters the picture again as they have now managed to create such a culture of fear in the medical community that doctors are too scared to even take the necessary steps to control the symptoms. All under the guise of a completely manufactured “overprescribing epidemic,” which stands in stark relief to all of the legitimate research, which shows the opposite to be true. Perhaps, with the right medication at the right doses, I could have bought a couple of decent years, but even that is too much to ask from a regime built upon the idea that suffering is noble and relief is just for the weak. However, when the challenges facing a person are already so great that all but the weakest would give up, these extra factors are enough to push a person over the edge. Is it any wonder then that the latest figures show 22 veterans killing themselves each day? That is more veterans than children killed at Sandy Hook, every single day. Where are the huge policy initiatives? Why isn’t the president standing with those families at the state of the union? Perhaps because we were not killed by a single lunatic, but rather by his own system of dehumanization, neglect, and indifference. It leaves us to where all we have to look forward to is constant pain, misery, poverty, and dishonor. I assure you that, when the numbers do finally drop, it will merely be because those who were pushed the farthest are all already dead. And for what? Bush’s religious lunacy? Cheney’s ever growing fortune and that of his corporate friends? Is this what we destroy lives for? Since then, I have tried everything to fill the void. I tried to move into a position of greater power and influence to try and right some of the wrongs. I deployed again, where I put a huge emphasis on saving lives. The fact of the matter, though, is that any new lives saved do not replace those who were murdered. It is an exercise in futility. Then, I pursued replacing destruction with creation. For a time this provided a distraction, but it could not last. The fact is that any kind of ordinary life is an insult to those who died at my hand. How can I possibly go around like everyone else while the widows and orphans I created continue to struggle? If they could see me sitting here in suburbia, in my comfortable home working on some music project they would be outraged, and rightfully so. I thought perhaps I could make some headway with this film project, maybe even directly appealing to those I had wronged and exposing a greater truth, but that is also now being taken away from me. I fear that, just as with everything else that requires the involvement of people who can not understand by virtue of never having been there, it is going to fall apart as careers get in the way. The last thought that has occurred to me is one of some kind of final mission. It is true that I have found that I am capable of finding some kind of reprieve by doing things that are worthwhile on the scale of life and death. While it is a nice thought to consider doing some good with my skills, experience, and killer instinct, the truth is that it isn’t realistic. First, there are the logistics of financing and equipping my own operation, then there is the near certainty of a grisly death, international incidents, and being branded a terrorist in the media that would follow. What is really stopping me, though, is that I simply am too sick to be effective in the field anymore. That, too, has been taken from me. Thus, I am left with basically nothing. Too trapped in a war to be at peace, too damaged to be at war. Abandoned by those who would take the easy route, and a liability to those who stick it out—and thus deserve better. So you see, not only am I better off dead, but the world is better without me in it. This is what brought me to my actual final mission. Not suicide, but a mercy killing. I know how to kill, and I know how to do it so that there is no pain whatsoever. It was quick, and I did not suffer. And above all, now I am free. I feel no more pain. I have no more nightmares or flashbacks or hallucinations. I am no longer constantly depressed or afraid or worried I am free.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1372157690056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 06:54:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372159749475-37</Id><Title>Boeing market maker has reported 3 times in five days that he has a order imbalance-he is warning market on close traders</Title><Msg>When a NYSE posts a block order imbalance, that is the Boeing market maker publically reporting mandatorily as required by NYSE regulations, if you want to sell your Boeing stock there are not enough buyers of Boeing at that price. , in the last 5 days , this has occurred at least 3 times at substantial blocks . like 2% so the market maker is advising any seller at the close within 15 minutes of the close, that if you try to sell your Boeing stock , he must take the order but it will come from the market makers own stocks.

Writing for the conservative 5-4 majority, Chief Justice John Roberts, who has a long history of trying to undermine this law, struck down Section 4 of the act. This part of the law determines which states and counties must adhere to strict guidelines governing any change to their voting laws. (The point of this provision is to prevent regions that have a history of fiddling with voting laws to discriminate against certain groups from trying such stunts again.) As proof of the nation's racial progress, Roberts cited elevated voter registration figures among black voters (setting aside the main issue of whether black voters have the same access to the voting booth once they're registered) and the fact that civil rights battlegrounds such as Philadelphia, Miss., and Selma, Ala., currently have black mayors. In the Court's view the Voting Rights Act has accomplished its mission of squashing racism: Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically. Largely because of the Voting Rights Act, "[v]oter turnout and registration rates" in covered jurisdictions "now approach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels." Northwest Austin, supra, at 202. The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years. Yet the Act has not eased [its] restrictions or narrowed the scope of [the formula that determines which parts of the country that are covered]. Instead those extraordinary and unprecedented features have been reauthorized as if nothing has changed, and they have grown even stronger.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372176856048</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 12:14:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372176859554-116</Id><Topic><Title>John Teresa Heinz Kerry Unhinged</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372166607692</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 09:23:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>chrissie aligns with liars and betrayors against truth tellers whenever his dumb ideology is threatened</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372176859554</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 12:14:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372176918811-117</Id><Topic><Title>Conservatives Declare Voting Rights UnConstitutional</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372176856048</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 12:14:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>correction: conservatives declare federally mandated discrimination unconstitutional</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372176918811</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 12:15:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372177059431-118</Id><Topic><Title>Conservatives Declare Voting Rights UnConstitutional</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372176856048</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 12:14:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spazticus, yahoo board fascist, doesn't like my response, accordingly he won't post the reply on the topic page</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372177059431</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 12:17:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372177104090-119</Id><Topic><Title>Bongo 52 got the Kent Raven's panties in a.....</Title><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1372016270853</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 15:37:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My, aren't you the discerning one.

"Question: What has caused the explosive growth of federal spending faster than the economy? Answer: look for the line in this chart that has risen the most over that period. The BIG CULPRIT (rising red line) is SOCIAL SPENDING, which grew 17 times faster than the economy - - to a new high - - more than eating up the long-term decline of defense spending ratios shown by the black line in the chart. The full report (link below) shows once the social spending ratio rose above 5% of national income in the late 1960s, citizen trust in government plummeted to half prior levels - - and inflation-adjusted median family incomes stagnated for all families and fell for single wage-earner families. Note social spending (red line) stopped rising in the early 1980s as if it hit a brick wall, and then fell - - and other data show trust in government surged, only to fall back later as social spending ratios again climbed. This is a powerful finding that deserves more attention. (the full report contains a link to a special report and chart on citizen trust polling data). National security was the prime reason our founding forefathers formed a federal government. The declining black trend line is defense spending, which in 2001 had dropped to 3.7% of the economy's national income, below where it started - following a 5-decade downward slope. The black defense line for 2003-10 increased to 6% of national income as shown in the graphic. This multi-decade declining defense ratio camouflaged a new direction for government - - surging social programs and spending.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372181181723</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 13:26:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372181442851-139</Id><Title>American Arrogance</Title><Msg>The display of arrogance by some American officials is telling.

Many Americans think 19 cents on defense for every 81 cents on non-defense costs is a reasonable way to spend each tax dollar. But the figures are wrong.

In a 5-4 ruling, the court declared unconstitutional a provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act that determines which states and localities must get Washington’s approval for proposed election changes. President Barack Obama, the nation’s first black chief executive, issued a statement saying he was ‘‘deeply disappointed’’ with the ruling. The decision effectively puts an end to the advance approval requirement that has been used, mainly in the South, to open up polling places to minority voters in the nearly half century since it was first enacted in 1965, unless Congress can come up with a new formula that Chief Justice John Roberts said meets ‘‘current conditions’’ in the United States. . . .</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1372186580831</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 14:56:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372186746969-159</Id><Topic><Title>What Happened When the Government Spent Most of the Money Earned in the USSR</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1372185774358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 14:42:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly, his point is proving that he is an idiot as evidenced by his postings.

"This was strong medicine, but Congress determined it was needed to address entrenched racial discrimination in voting," he wrote. "But history did not end in 1965." The formula still used to identify states subject to preclearance involved past voting practices. In 1965 and through several subsequent reauthorizations, Congress identified states and localities that required voters to pass such obstacles as literacy or character tests, and had less than 50% voter registration or turnout in the 1964, 1968 and 1972 federal elections. In 1965, the chief justice wrote, the formula made sense. In Mississippi, for instance, 69.9% of whites were registered to vote, compared to 6.7% of blacks. In 2004, by contrast, black registration in Mississippi actually exceeded that of whites, 76.1% compared to 72.3%. He observed that Philadelphia, Miss., where civil-rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were murdered in 1964, and Selma, Ala., where "Bloody Sunday" saw police beat voting-rights marchers in 1965, both have African-American mayors. While the Voting Rights Act was "immensely successful at redressing racial discrimination and integrating the voting process," it had done so by undermining "the integrity, dignity, and residual sovereignty of the States," Chief Justice Roberts wrote. "States must beseech the Federal Government for permission to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact and execute on their own," he said. Moreover, he said, in a 2009 case, the court had signaled its grave doubts over the preclearance provisions. "Congress could have updated the coverage formula at that time, but did not do so.

It always did belong to China. Then there was the Chinese opportunity to copy all that Snowden had in his possession: 4 laptops. Easy to do, probably done, so let him go. Then, with the savvy assistance of the wiki underground, an itinerary that includes all contrarian governments such as Russia, and why Cuba? and then to Ecuador. Russia has to play their hand carefully. They probably want to give the guy back to us, but they have to make it look like they had to, or else no other dissidents will go there to tell them what they know.

Study finds "Southerners are more likely than Northerners to use prejudice in making political decisions." By Seth Masket The New York Times recently ran a story describing the Savannah, Georgia, defenders of Paula Deen. Deen, of course, is the recently disgraced television chef who was fired by the Food Network due to her admissions of casually using racial slurs and planning an antebellum plantation-themed wedding for her brother. The Times’ story is laden with quotes from a number of white Southern patrons of Deen’s restaurant offering defenses of their region and some barbs for their Northern critics. For example, “Everybody in the South over 60 used the N-word at some time or the other in the past.” “I don’t understand why some people can use [the N-word] and others can’t.” “We have lived with each other and loved each other here for a long time. Sometimes I think there is more prejudice in the North than there is in the South.” So what’s the story? Few would question that the South was home to some of the world’s most virulent white racism just a few decades ago, but similarly, few would doubt that the region has made tremendous strides to overcome that legacy. Is there still more prejudice in the South than in the North? Political scientists and pollsters used to have an easier time identifying bigots in surveys; Americans were once very upfront about their discomfort, distrust, and even hatred toward people of other races. Over the past half century or so, though, a social desirability effect has become apparent. Even if a person fundamentally dislikes members of another race, he knows not to say this publicly, or even in response to a private survey. It’s simply not part of the acceptable parlance any more. But that doesn’t mean racial animus has disappeared. Political psychologists instead look for evidence of “symbolic” racism. These are instances of individuals using code words that tend to indicate racial animus without being overtly racist themselves. For example, a white person might complain about immigrants, welfare queens, food stamp recipients—populations that are disproportionately racial minorities and portrayed as unjustly taking something from other Americans—but still deny that they have any problem with non-whites. (For a rich example of this, see Newt Gingrich’s exchange with Juan Williams during the 2012 Republican presidential primary debates.) Oh, and if you’re complaining that you aren’t allowed to use the N-word while other people get to? You just might be a symbolic racist. So here’s an example of a question along these lines from the 2008 American National Election Studies, asking whether African Americans should be “working their way up” without “special favors.” Only the white respondents are included in the tally: Symbolic racism, South vs. Nonsouth There’s about a 10-point difference there, with Southern whites more likely to agree with the question than non-Southern whites. We see the same sort of pattern when we look at questions about interracial marriage, whether blacks should “push themselves where they’re not wanted,” or whether the law should support homeowners who choose not to sell their house to blacks. Southern whites are consistently more likely to choose the symbolically racist answer than non-Southern whites are. In a thorough review of these sorts of questions and how they vary by geography,Nicholas Valentino and David Sears (via John Sides) concluded the following: General Social Survey and National Election Studies data from the 1970s to the present indicate that whites residing in the old Confederacy continue to display more racial antagonism and ideological conservatism than non-Southern whites. Racial conservatism has become linked more closely to presidential voting and party identification over time in the white South, while its impact has remained constant elsewhere. This stronger association between racial antagonism and partisanship in the South compared to other regions cannot be explained by regional differences in nonracial ideology or nonracial policy preferences, or by the effects of those variables on partisanship. In other words, it’s not just that there’s more prejudice in the South; Southerners are more likely than Northerners to use that prejudice in making political decisions. This, of course, is not to suggest that the North is free of prejudice or that the South is peopled solely by bigots. And it is not to disparage the considerable racial progress the South has made since the era of segregated schools and violent repression of the vote, which happened within the lifetime of many of its residents.

Joan Walsh No good deed goes unpunished, I like to say. In striking down a key enforcement provision of the Voting Rights Act, Chief Justice John Roberts noted that African-American voter turnout in 2012 either exceeded or essentially matched white turnout in five of six Southern states governed by the act’s tough and controversial Section 5. Ironically, as anyone paying attention knows, that turnout surge was driven by anger over a wave of GOP efforts to suppress black votes in those and other states – and it was helped along by Section 5, which requires states with a history of voting rights suppression to pre-clear any voting changes with the Justice Department (Justice struck down 21 such proposals since 2006). Still, despite new voter identification laws, restrictions on early voting and Sunday voting and other barriers, African-Americans voted at unprecedented rates in 2012 – and that helped give Roberts an excuse to strike down a section key to enforcing the law. Of course, 2012 turnout wasn’t Roberts’ real excuse: He has been advocating for limiting the scope and power of the Voting Rights Act since he worked for Ronald Reagan’s Justice Department 30 years ago. In 2009, the last time the court considered Section 5, Roberts asked the government attorney defending it: “Congress can impose this disparate treatment forever because of the history in the South?” Now we know the answer: They cannot. But Roberts’ majority opinion is slick: Surprising many civil rights advocates, it didn’t strike down Section 5, Instead, it struck down Section 4, which established the formula that determined which areas were governed by Section 5. So pre-clearance of voting rights changes is still constitutional – but right now no jurisdiction is subject to it. Clever. John Roberts the politician, not the ideologue, wrote the majority decision (it’s the same guy who ruled that Obamacare was constitutional, while striking down its Medicaid expansion mandates). Roberts praised the results achieved by the Voting Rights Act, citing rising African-American voter participation across the South and concluding, “There is no doubt these improvements are in large part because of the VRA.” And while Antonin Scalia joined Roberts’ majority opinion, the chief justice didn’t partake of his colleague’s rhetoric of racial grievance. In February’s oral arguments, Scalia complained that voting rights had become “a minority entitlement” subject to unconstitutional favoritism by politicians scamming votes. “I don’t think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act,” Scalia mused. “And I am fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless — unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution … They are going to lose votes if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act. Even the name of it is wonderful: The Voting Rights Act. Who is going to vote against that in the future?” The Roberts opinion, by contrast, didn’t find anything except Section 4 unconstitutional – and left it to Congress to come up with a new formula under Section 4 to theoretically continue with Section 5 enforcement. Where Scalia suggested Congress couldn’t be trusted with voting rights decisions, Roberts’ decision sends the question back to Congress to come up with formulas and procedures that reflect the racial voting patterns of 2013. The problem with Roberts’ reasoning is this: Congress has had many chances to weaken, change, adapt or kill the Voting Rights Act, and they’ve reauthorized and strengthened it four times since 1965 – in 1970, 1975, 1982 and 2006, when it passed 98-0 in the Senate, almost unanimously in the House and was signed by President Bush. (That vote extended it for another 25 years.) In her dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned the majority’s disrespect for the law – and for Congress: In the Court’s view, the very success of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act demands its dormancy. Congress was of another mind. Recognizing that large progress has been made, Congress determined, based on a voluminous record, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extirpated. The question this case presents is who decides whether, as currently operative, Section 5 remains justifiable, this Court, or a Congress charged with the obligation to enforce the post-Civil War Amendments ‘by appropriate legislation.’ With overwhelming support in both Houses, Congress concluded that, for two prime reasons, Section 5 should continue in force, unabated. First, continuance would facilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far made; and second, continuance would guard against backsliding. Those assessments were well within Congress’ province to make and should elicit this Court’s unstinting approbation. There’s no quibbling over the impact of the Court’s decision today. “What the Supreme Court did was to put a dagger in the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,” a visibly shaken Rep. John Lewis told ABC News. “This act helped liberate not just a people but a nation.” The civil rights hero is pessimistic that Congress will be able to agree on new jurisdictions and enforcement measures to put teeth back in the act. “In 2006, we had the ability and capacity to come together in bipartisan fashion to renew the Voting Rights Act of 1965,” Lewis said. “I’m not so sure whether we have the will to do what we must do and should do.” I wrote about this after oral arguments on the case: It is certainly true that some states that aren’t covered by Section 5 are imposing new voter restrictions: harsh ID laws in Pennsylvania, a cutback in early voting in Ohio and Wisconsin, and an end to the Sunday before Election Day voting hours that the black community had claimed for a last “Souls to the Polls” push in Wisconsin and other places. That doesn’t mean the covered states have stopped looking for ways to limit voting rights, but in a better world, Congress might well extend Section 5 to cover more states. But this isn’t that world. Despite Johnson’s strong leadership, the 1965 Voting Rights Act passed with a higher percent of Republicans supporting it than Democrats, given that segregationist Democrats ran the South. But since then, the parties have to an extent traded sides. It’s true, and praiseworthy, that in 2006 Republicans supported the act’s reauthorization. But after President Obama was elected with record-breaking turnout by black and Latino voters in 2008, at least 38 states have tried to place new restrictions on voting, whether by increasing requirements to register or by limiting the number of days and locations where people can vote. Every single one of those laws, whether proposed or enacted, was sponsored by a Republican. Sadly, just since 2006, voting rights protection has become a partisan issue. On one level, I find myself thinking along similar lines as Antonin Scalia – that it’s hard to trust politicians with voting rights decisions — although my political reasoning is exactly the opposite of his. The paradox at the heart of voting rights protection is this: the elected officials charged with protecting those rights via legislation and other means may well be invested in curbing them instead. That paradox was best viewed in the Jim Crow South, but it’s been apparent going back to Richard Daley’s Chicago and Republican Gov. Tom Corbett’s Pennsylvania and Scott Walker’s Wisconsin. The current partisan battle over immigration reform is in part a voting rights skirmish; since conservatives like Ann Coulter believe Latinos are irretrievably Democrats, they don’t know why Republican leaders would want to give citizenship and voting rights to 11 million new Democrats. It’s also sad to realize that the same tyrannical minority that has devoted itself to blocking the majority’s will on immigration reform, gun control, tax reform, jobs and climate change is also unlikely to do the right thing on voting rights protection. And yet, that’s the truth. That’s why a lot of progressive groups have been arguing that we need a new civil rights mobilization to expand voting rights protection, which can in the long term lead to turning out, or turning around, that intransigent GOP minority. At Netroots Nation I moderated a great panel on what that movement might look like – it would change Senate rules, overturn or counteract Citizens United as well as push for broader voter empowerment. The NAACP’s Ben Jealous told the audience that no matter what their No. 1 issue is – women’s rights, labor rights, the environment, jobs – their No. 2 issue must be voting rights. Today’s decision proved him right. Civil rights leaders are talking about making the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington a dramatic voter empowerment event, and that would be great. Early Tuesday John Lewis tweeted that this SCOTUS decision came down on the 49th anniversary of the day three civil rights volunteers disappeared in Mississippi – James Chaney, Mickey Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were reported missing by their Freedom Summer allies the night of June 25, 1964; they were found murdered days later. The killings helped galvanize public will behind the Voting Rights Act. I’m not sure what will galvanize a new movement for voting rights, but it’s got to take off today.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372202493593</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 19:21:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372205594822-214</Id><Topic><Title>It's Funny to See so Many Democrats Defending Communism on here.</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1372191319525</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 16:15:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good post while they send their kids to Private Schools.

Jon Stewart practically disowned the president. After a long string of failures, it looked like Issa had finally found something real, even if he was a bit overeager in hyping it. How wrong we were. Now it’s clear Issa played us this whole time, thanks to new documents that show the IRS also targeted “progressive” and “Occupy” groups, in addition to Tea Party ones. And if it targeted groups on both sides, it wasn’t really singling anyone out (the only group actually denied tax-exempt status was a progressive one, after all) and the whole scandal falls apart. It’s not that there were no warning signs. In his zeal to implicate the White House, Issa jumped to conclusions unsupported by evidence. Then he selectively disclosed parts of transcripts that supported his narrative, and threw a fit when Democrats wanted to release the rest, which revealed that the IRS official in charge of the program was a conservative Republican. The whole scandal seemed to be falling apart, and now we know for sure. Did Issa know the IRS targeted progressive groups too? Why didn’t the inspector general’s report mention this critical bit of data? Russell George, Treasury’s IG, told lawmakers that the “inspector general launches audits on topics requested by lawmakers. The targeting audit requested by House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa specifically requested a review of IRS actions related to conservative groups,” Politico reported yesterday. So it seems this entire scandal exists because Issa skewed the outcome of the IG report by asking to keep it narrowly focused on conservative groups, then trumped up its findings’ charges and tried to keep exculpatory evidence out of the public eye. If this were court, the case would not only be thrown out, but Issa would be scolded for prosecutorial misconduct. Of course, we probably should have seen this coming from Issa, who has been at best an unimpressive House GOP scandal czar, and at worst, an effective conspiracy theory huckster bolstered by the weight of his lofty office. Even some fellow Republicans have spoken up. “I really am concerned that it could tip this into the political realm rather than a true detailed investigation to get the facts out,” Rep. Charles Boustany, a senior Ways and Means Republican who chairs the panel’s Oversight subcommittee, said of Issa’s propensity to blab about any new details he finds while investigating. Or take this Republican on Issa’s committee: “Our committee, unfortunately does have a reputation for jumping to the end result.” That Republican, it turns out, was Issa himself, explaining in 2011 why he was backing off on the Fast and Furious scandal. That habit, along with his colorful personal history of car thefts and accusations of insurance scams, got Issa in trouble even before he took the helm of the Oversight committee. In 2010 he called Obama “one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times.” He later apologized, telling CNN, “Do I think the president is personally corrupt? No. I should never have implied that.” Four days after the 2010 election, Issa declared he would hold seven hearings a week on everything from WikiLeaks to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to the FDA, to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. None of those went anywhere and the hearings have slowed to a trickle. And some of his investigations have been downright ridiculous, like when he asked the Department of Justice to investigate ACORN more than a year after it ceased to exist, or when he said Joe Sestak’s Senate campaign was “Obama’s Watergate.” Do you even remember Sestak’s name, let alone the “scandal”? Issa’s biggest successes — and also failures — have been when dramatically overplaying his hand. Solyndra, Fast and Furious, Benghazi and now the IRS all followed the same format. In every case, instead of conducting a sober investigation, Issa picked a conclusion (the White House was involved!) and then desperately tried to find evidence to support it. In all cases, he came up way short. But while other scandals fizzled out after months, the IRS controversy’s collapse has been more dramatic. Just a month ago, it was dominating news coverage. Last week, it was reviving the zombie Tea Party. Now, it’s a flaming ruin. At some point, this has to weigh on Issa’s credibility. James O’Keefe may have more scalps than Issa, who has so far failed to land any body blows on the Obama administration, but both have been caught in one distortion and exaggeration after another. There was no singling out of Tea Party groups and it’s hard to imagine Issa didn’t know this earlier. As Dartmouth professor Brendan Nyhan has said, it takes two to scandal. Issa can’t do it alone. He needs credulous media coverage to make his work ginning up controversy successful. The media has spent almost two months on a story that has proved to be essentially a fiction. How many important stories didn’t get covered because we were debating something that never happened? How many times does Issa have to cry wolf before the mainstream media will realize he has no credibility left.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372207229040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 20:40:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372207395140-222</Id><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Msg>Five justices, all Republican appointees, today provide solid evidence they live on another planet -- one without voter suppression.
