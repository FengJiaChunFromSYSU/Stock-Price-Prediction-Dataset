Bill Clinton will make a motion on the floor to unseat Obama and replace him with Hillary. Biden will be moot. That is the reason that Pelosi was trying a couple months ago to convince the "super delegates" (who are by definition "uncommitted" delegates that are Democrat congress persons) to "stay home and work on your own campaigns", saying further, "we already know who is the nominee for President". What malarkey! Pelosi knows full well what is going on. The sparks are going to fly in September. Get the fire engines ready! And, hold on to your seats.

Interesting how a phrase becomes fact- with 99.9 percent of those who use it are clueless. The bridge goes across a channel between Ketchican and an island. On the island is an significant size airport, and the channel is about a 1/4 mile wide The bridge has to be very high to accomodate large cruise ships, which provide a major source of income. Prior to the airport- the closest landing place was on annette island about 80 -90 miles away. To get to ketchican - one had to take an old pby and land in the channel - or - by boat. The island had few inhabitants - thus it became a place large enough to handle jet aircraft.. And even so - one has to take a boat from the island to get to ketchican. ketchicdan is built on a mountainside, and has a total of about 20m miles of roads on one side. Tourism, fishing, lumber, and mining are or were the only reasons for the town. Lumber and mining were essentially closed down a few decades ago - That leaves mostly tourism. Kethican is also an island. So the bridge was to be a major boost for the area . . . Been there- done that- 1964, 2004, and 2009</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1345180434000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 01:13:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345181538000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan's Hypocrisy</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_86</Username><Timestamp>1345154406000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:00:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please, Don.

Biden’s ‘good friend,’ donor receives $20M federal loan to open foreign luxury car dealership in Ukraine Published: 12:05 AM 08/17/2012 By Christopher Bedford Bio | Archive | Email Christopher Bedford Follow Christopher Bedford Get Christopher Bedford Feed John Hynansky, CEO and owner of Winner Automotive Group (Photo: Winner's Circle blog) In late July, John Hynansky — a longtime friend of Vice President Joe Biden, and a major donor to Biden’s campaigns as well as President Barack Obama’s — was awarded a $20 million taxpayer loan to build a foreign-car dealership in Ukraine. According to a public summary document, the loan, from the federal government’s Overseas Private Investment Corporation, is for “[u]p to $20.0 million,” and is designed to “expand Winner Import Ukraine’s automobile business, [and] construct and operate ‘Winner Autocity,’ which will have two new, state-of-the-art dealership facilities for Porsche and Land Rover/Jaguar automobiles.” Porsche is a German-made luxury and sports car, and Jaguar Land Rover is a British luxury and sports car company owned by an Indian subsidiary. Under “U.S. Economic Impact,” the summary document says, “This project will have a positive developmental impact on the host country, Ukraine. The project will generate a significant number of new local jobs. Running a dealership for premium automobile brands requires a highly trained sales force, mechanics, accountants, communications and advertising specialists, IT specialists, service personnel, warehouse managers, and customer relations specialists.” Along with his family, Hynansky and his family also own car dealerships in Pennsylvania and Biden’s home state of Delaware. Since at least 1999, Hynansky and his family have been regular donors to Biden’s campaigns, and, later, Obama’s. John Hynansky has donated 7,690 to a combination of Biden’s Senate campaigns and failed presidential campaign; Michael Hynansky donated $7,690; Alexandra Hynansky donated $7,280; Deanne Hynansky donated $4,645; and Susan Hynansky donated $1,000 — coming to a total family donation of $28,715. During Obama’s 2008 run for president, John Hynansky gave $30,800 to the Obama Victory Fund; Alexandra Hynansky gave $2,550; and Deanne Hynansky gave $2,000 — totaling 35,350 to that campaign. Ads by Google Understandably, during a speech during a diplomatic trip to Ukraine in 2009, Biden described John Hynansky as “my very good friend, John Hynansky, a very prominent businessman from Delaware. … I had breakfast with him the other day.

Not by a long shot</Title><Msg>Dirtiest campaign of all time? Not by a long shot By DOUG THOMPSON - Capitol Hill Blue August 16, 2012 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr: One way to settle political differences At some point in every Presidential campaign, someone starts wringing their hands and declares the political rhetoric “toxic” and concludes that this is “the dirtiest campaign in history.” Which, of course, is a crock. Politics is a dirty business. It thrives on mud, slander, attacks and innuendo. But this doesn’t stop the pundits from crying about the heated campaign rhetoric between incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney. Says Chuck Todd of MSNBC: You thought last week was bad? Just when you thought last week’s third-grade insults were as low as the campaign could go here, here we go again, the campaign has gotten even uglier, It’s not faux outrage, it’s real outrage. Over the last 24 hours, the attacks from both sides have reached a new level of vitriol. Really Chuck? Did you skip history in college? Here at Capitol Hill Blue we’ve found many campaigns a lot dirtier — and sometimes even fatal. John Adams running for President against Thomas Jefferson, called his opponent “the father of the mulatto race.” During another debate, Jefferson brought up questions of Adam’s sexual leanings. Said Adams: “That, sir, is a topic that gentlemen do not discuss.” Replied Jefferson: “Sir, if we had gentlemen in government, we would have no place for politics.” Mudslinging is not limited to Presidential politics. In his book, “Mudslingers: The Twenty-Five Dirtiest Political Campaigns of All Time,” author Kevin Swint retells this legendary campaign where the opponent of Florida Sen. Claude Pepper had this to say: Are you aware that Claude Pepper is known all over Washington as a shameless extrovert? Not only that, but this man is reliably reported to practice nepotism with his sister-in-law, he has a brother who is a known homo sapien, and he has a sister who was once a thespian in wicked New York. Worst of all, it is an established fact that Mr. Pepper, before his marriage habitually practiced celibacy. Pepper lost the election to George Smathers in 1950. Voters told reporters that they weren’t quiet sure words like “extrovert” and “nepotism” and “thespian” meant but they were sure they were connected to bad, immoral or illegal activities. Smathers proved you can’t lose an election by underestimating the intelligence of the average American voter — a political truism that controls the campaign system even more today.

WHEN APPLE IS COMPARED TO BOEING FOR MAXIMUM TIME 15 YEARS IT HAS MADE 19322% MORE THAN THE BOEING SHAREHOLDERS DID NOT MAKE AND APPLE DOES A DIVIDEND NOW TOO. so for the Boeing messengers of spam and bashing the Boeing , friends brothers and inlaws , that would be falmouthharbor,uniposter76,trader1553,mrsstock and the impersonators dellgeorgesr and fred.jamessr. all your spam bumbing and bashing does not change the fact that apple is up to a all time high today and in the past 17 days is up over 12% while boeing is down 2% and if you had purchased apple at any time in the last 15 years you would be rich now not a poor basher and Boeing spammer</Msg><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1345220037000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 12:13:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345221142000-38</Id><Topic><Title>Romney says his money is in a blind trust.</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1345213724000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:28:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Blind my a$$.

Please leave the Boeing message Board is all you have is plane orders that mean nothing , you need to point out boeing dug a hole when they spent 34 billion to develop teh 787 and only made under 6% net profit on each one delivered so you need to look up a time chart to cover the other 94% of the cost of 34 billion , that will never break even and the 747 is 2 billion out and the 737 is done the max will cost billions to develop so no profit then,and the 757 is dead, the 767 is fixed cost the 2 billion pensions underfunded your orders are like reporting on communism, it does not matter in a artificial economy boeing can never make money, as the small profit of under 6% will never cover over time teh huge loss to devlop, the original Union SPEEA and IAM figure offered to develop a 787 was 5 billion, like the 777 which was made by SPEEA and IAM on budget and on time , it would have been a game changer for Boeing since outsourced it is a nightmare for Boeing shareholders this compay will go out of business in the next 20 years except for military. no more commericial china and canada and japan-airbus will be the only ones left your pumping a dead stock 65 to 75 range bound with brief moves to 55 and 80 nothing like 8 to 646 for apple</Msg><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1345224590000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 13:29:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345224667000-70</Id><Topic><Title>Romney says his money is in a blind trust.</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1345213724000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:28:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ask Obama where his money is not us you right wing nut case that thinks it is to his advantage to protect the rights of the rich instead of wanting all American's to prosper.

Of what possible relevance are the grades that Barack Obama got at Occidental, Columbia, or Harvard Law School to judging his time in office and whether he deserves to be re-elected? What would it reveal about his Presidency that we don’t know? To ask the same question about Romney, what possible relevance to evaluating whether he’d be a good President his grades at Brigham Young University and Harvard (where Romney simultaneously obtained a J.D. and an M.B.A.) could possibly be. It’s been 37 years since Mitt Romney finished his college education, and 20 years since Obama finished his, as James Joyner asked back in 2008, isn’t there a statute of limitations on the use of college achievements as evidence of achievement? If there’s not, there should be. The common response to the points I’m raising here usually boils down to mentioning the fact that The New Yorker managed to get its hands on George W. Bush’s Yale transcripts during the 2000 campaign. They didn’t get them from the Bush campaign and, technically, whoever released them was violating Federal laws regarding the privacy of education records. Several months later, The Washington Post managed to get its hands on Al Gore’s education records, again without the consent of the campaign and in apparent violation of Federal law. Supposedly, these transcripts were meant to show that Bush was a lackluster student in college, although what we actually saw was that Bush’s grades weren’t all that different than Gore’s and roughly equivalent to John Kerry’s, who authorized the release of his transcripts after the 2004 Election. Ever since then, there’s always been a contingent of people in the media and the pundit class who argue that candidates for President should release their grades. I’ve never been quite sure what the purpose of this other than the hope that there might be something in there that would embarress the candidate. The fact that there’s not likely to be anything in there relevant to the election doesn’t seem to matter. In the particular case of Barack Obama, the demand for college transcripts is often pushed by the same people who have spent the last four years demanding to see his birth certificate, often making the erroneous claim that Obama was registered as a foreign student when he was in college, or that there is some admission in the college records that would prove he isn’t eligible to be President. For the non-birthers, the demands for transcripts is often linked to the equally erroneous belief that he wasn’t properly vetted in 2008. As I noted earlier this month, that’s a ridiculous idea: Barack Obama has been President of the United States for nearly four years now, and he’s been on the national scene as either a candidate for President or as President since 2007. The idea that we have no idea who the man is, or that he hasn’t been “vetted” is simply an absurd fantasy that partisans are using in what looks for all the world like a desperate effort to find something, anything that they can use against him in the upcoming election. http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/no-we-dont-need-to-see-the-presidents-college-transcripts-or-romneys-either/</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1345236325000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:45:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345236459000-154</Id><Topic><Title>If Romney wants to show that he can boost the economy ...</Title><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1345235558000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:32:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Birthers like imacomm don't give a *#(% about the transcript.

Rugaber-Associated Press Friday, August 17, 2012 WASHINGTON (AP) — Unemployment rates rose in 44 U.S. states in July, the most states to show a monthly increase in more than three years and a reflection of weak hiring nationwide. The Labor Department said Friday that unemployment rates fell in only two states and were unchanged in four. Unemployment rates rose in nine states that are considered battlegrounds in the presidential election. That trend, if it continued, could pose a threat to President Barack Obama’s re-election bid in less than three months. Nationwide, hiring improved in July after three months of tepid job gains. But the national unemployment rate ticked up to 8.3 percent from 8.2 percent. Monthly job gains have averaged 150,000 this year. That’s barely enough to accommodate population growth. As a result, the unemployment rate is the same as when the year began.

Voters not diverse enough so election cancelled? Pathetic! Georgia high school choruses reportedly not diverse enough to perform with Atlanta orchestra Published August 17, 2012 Two high school choruses will reportedly not perform with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra this year because their groups are not racially-diverse enough. WSBTV.com reports that the Walton and Lassiter High School choruses in Cobb County will not get a chance to perform with Atlanta’s professional this fall as a result of the determination. "This year, the schools were informed by symphony officials that their choruses are not diverse enough, and that the symphony would be inviting a third, more diverse chorus," Cobb County Schools spokesman Jay Dillon told the website. Local residents told the website the decision reeked of discrimination. "I think it's sad," said Marietta resident Shar Nicholson. "I think if they have the talent and the desire they should be given the opportunity." Atlanta Symphony Orchestra President Stanley Romanstein said the stages of the performing group should “reflect the diversity” of Atlanta, but not everyone in Cobb County agrees. "It's not necessarily fair to the students at all," said Vashon Ramsey. "They should be allowed to perform regardless." Romanstein said he told the chorus directors about the decision two years ago and said they understood at the time. "There are at least 12 very talented high school choirs in Atlanta," Romanstein said. "We gave Lassiter and Walton choirs an opportunity to perform for four consecutive years, and they were marvelous. We think it's time to give other Atlanta high school choirs, who are very skilled and deserving, their chance to perform with the ASO as well." Lassiter and Walton were offered to bring a smaller portion of their choruses to perform, but declined. "Because the full choruses would not be able to perform with the symphony, both Lassiter and Walton have declined to participate this year," Dillon said. Instead, the chorus at Grady High School has been invited to perform, WSBTV.com reports.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345240258000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 17:50:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>24</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345240566000-172</Id><Title>Obama's Campaign Trying to Censor the Press</Title><Msg>to hide the number two idiot as the one as already been exposed! Biden handlers keep close tabs on vice president's comments, coverage Published August 17, 2012 White House stands by VP Biden News quiz: Vice presidential gaffes Vice President Biden's handlers appear to be going to new lengths to keep their boss' antics and open-to-interpretation quips from spiraling out of control in the 24-hour news cycle. The close attention to the vice president's style and coverage comes after Biden set off a round of campaign crossfire over his comment that Republicans want to put people "back in chains." Pressed anew on whether President Obama might consider dropping his No. 2 in favor of, say, Hillary Clinton, the White House is standing by the vice president. Press Secretary Jay Carney said that decision was made "a long, long time ago" -- which could explain why media coverage of Biden has been so tightly regulated lately, as aides try to prevent an off-the-cuff moment from dominating the day. Fox News was told that during the vice president's last campaign swing through Virginia, the one that included the infamous "chains" remark, Biden's office tried to edit pool reports that a small group of journalists put together for the rest of the media. On two occasions, Biden's office tried to massage some of the information that was in these reports before they were emailed to a wider group of White House reporters. Democrats who spoke to Fox News tried to downplay the claim and suggest it didn't happen. But it tracks with other examples of a cautious approach to publicizing Biden, whose predilection for going off-script with asides, sometimes endearing and sometimes disastrous, is well-known. On the White House website, for example, transcripts of Biden's remarks are largely absent. The White House has not posted a Biden speech -- though he's given plenty -- since mid-June. The White House also reportedly prohibited reporters from writing about a recent Biden conference call until the call was over. A White House spokesman told Politico last month that the Biden quotes were embargoed until the end of the call to allow "journalists to hear the entirety of the vice president's remarks and get the benefit of having their questions answered -- before trying to condense a 30-minute conference call about a 20-page NEC report into ... 140 characters." Biden and the rest of the White House appear to have weathered the latest media and campaign storm over a Biden gaffe. The "chains" comments provoked bipartisan concerns that the vice president, appearing before a largely black audience, was employing racial politics on the stump. It fed scathing criticism from both Mitt Romney and running mate Paul Ryan and prompted suggestions from Sarah Palin and others that Biden be dropped from the Democratic ticket. But Obama, in an interview, brushed off the suggestion. And Carney said unequivocally Thursday that Biden is on for 2012. Asked whether the Obama-Biden ticket will stand, Carney said, "Yes -- and that was settled a long, long time ago."</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345240566000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 17:56:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345241396000-173</Id><Title>Absurd Liberals making Fools of Themselves...</Title><Msg>Liberals have Forgotten the meaning of TRUTH, but the American people have NOT! No wonder the lying Obama Campaign is sinking in the polls, eh? The 2012 campaign hits the heights of absurdity By Dan Gainor Published August 17, 2012 Aug. 15, 2012: President Obama speaks at a campaign event at the Alliant Energy Amphitheater in Dubuque, Iowa. (AP) Politics is about ups and downs. In one week, the left and the media dove into the gutter to cover for Vice President Biden’s race baiting and climbed to the heights of absurdity claiming “anger” was racist. The left better hope the Fantastic Four’s Reed Richards is on their side because Mister Fantastic is the only one who can twist and stretch as much as they are doing to that nearly forgotten word: “truth.” Biden’s “chained” comment was bad enough – a blatant ploy to terrify African-Americans into voting. As the AP put it, Tuesday the vice president told an “audience in southern Virginia that included hundreds of black voters that Republican Mitt Romney wanted to put them "back in chains" by deregulating Wall Street.” In the aftermath watching liberals like Salon’s Joan Walshand CNN’s Roland Martin defend Biden’s gutter politics was astonishing. Walsh, who is also an MSNBC political analyst, called the comment “colorful and quotable” and whined “white people have been ‘chained’ and ‘shackled’ too.” Martin became obsessed with the math in the roomful of people Biden address that was reportedly about half black. Like many in the media, math is hard for Roland. Fifty percent of a room is about four times the percentage of the African-American population in the U.S. (13.1 percent according to the Census.) Biden was clearly stoking their fears. Then came MSNBC’s own co-host of “The Cycle,” Toure. Like Walsh, the loonier he is, the more his status at NBC’s crazy sister network improves. Toure complained about Romney’s criticism of Obama and that since “he says anger twice,” it’s racist. Then things got even more heated and Toure went on to say, “I know it’s a heavy thing, I don’t say it lightly, but this is niggerization. ‘You are not one of us, you are like the scary black man who we’ve been trained to fear.’ And the idea of locating anger around Obama just doesn’t fit with who he is and who he trained himself to be going back to high school, training himself to be ‘no-drama Obama.’ They are talking to people who are trained to hate him, who want to hate him so this how we turn out the base to work against him.” To put this in context, this is far from the most ridiculous thing Toure has ever said. He’s like a mental patient’s Howard Beale – he’s not mad as hell, he’s crazy as hell. And thanks to MSNBC, all the world knows it. (OK, not all the world. Just the few of us that watch MSNBC.) Toure is an honest-to-goodness, Van-Jonesian 9/11 Truther. He thinks Romney “went to the NAACP's National Convention planning to get booed,” and that people who didn’t like disco were “homophobic, and to a certain extent racist.” So claiming “niggerization” is par for the course or you could say, a Toure de force. I’d say that it’s all enough to make one angry – at the absurdity of the election discourse and much more. And it’s only August.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345241396000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:09:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345241889000-174</Id><Topic><Title>Absurd Liberals making Fools of Themselves...</Title><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345241396000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:09:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We think it will be you Libs that will need counseling and drug intervention soon after November!
