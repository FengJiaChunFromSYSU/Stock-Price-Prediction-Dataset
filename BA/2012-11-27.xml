The grocery-store owner is doing just that., who owns and manages two grocery stores in Bemidji, Minnesota, and one in Wahpeton, North Dakota, is retiring at age 70. Instead of selling his stores to the highest bidder, though, he will transfer ownership to the stores' 400 or so employees.

The program to transfer ownership from the retiring owner to the employees.. .

Is it possible that is because we failed to vote for, as Jamie Foxx and others have blasphemed, God's so-called competition? If Obama were a real Christian, he would speak out against such commentary and repudiate it. It is simply unconscienable. King Herod also declared himself to be God and he was immediately eaten up by worms. "On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.” Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died."

Perhaps Obama IS the problem. So far, these past four years, he has definitely not been the solution. And, by the way, what difference does it make by labeling Jamie Foxx an "individual" - when he happens to enjoy massive public exposure? His blasphemy is all over the internet, so you can include world-wide exposure. Hopefully, Obama will see the better light and soon denounce the comments.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1354040648627</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 13:24:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354040698569-26</Id><Topic><Title>Every single one of my Posts got deleted</Title><Username>spartacus8463</Username><Timestamp>1354021011326</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 07:56:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Were they your normal goofy predictions?

Now, I wholeheartedly agree with having to recycle these bulbs but pleeeeeeeeeeease don't tell me at no cost. Of course my favorites are when my Governor tells me some state program/service is not going to cost us anything because it is being funded by a Federal grant or when my county executive tells a project isn't going to cost us anything because it is going to be funded by Federal and State grants or my mayor tell me a local project/service isn't going to cost us anything because it is going to be funded by federal, state and county grants.

Vincent Grandil, a partner in the Paris law firm Altexis, which caters to rich French citizens, is increasingly being asked by his clients if now would be a good time to flee France for countries with lower tax rates: We’re getting a lot of calls from high earners who are asking whether they should get out of France. Even young, dynamic people pulling in 200,000 euros [$250,000] are wondering whether to remain in a country where making money is not considered a good thing. When Francois Hollande was running for president earlier this year he made certain that his countrymen’s disdain for the wealthy was reflected in his platform if he were elected. Among measures to cut back on electricity generated by nuclear power in favor of much more expensive and less reliable renewable energy sources and hiring another 150,000 people onto the public payrolls was his plan to “tax the rich”: Incomes above 1 million euros a year would be taxed at 75 percent instead of the current 41 percent. As president of France, Hollande is now working hard to get that measure passed by the Socialist controlled houses of parliament in September even though it isn’t expected to raise any significant amount of revenue. Sophie Pedder, the Paris bureau chief for The Economist, was interviewed on National Public Radio the day of Hollande’s election victory, and was asked why he was pushing for this tax increase that would affect such a tiny percentage of French citizens. Pedder responded: Well, it's quite interesting because he's been very clear that he doesn't expect to raise almost any revenue at all from the tax rate. He says what he wants to do is impose a sort of morality on high earners and on what he calls indecent wages. So he's really trying to kind of curb, I suppose, excess, and make sure that big bosses, big bankers, and those who are going to be in this sort of an earning bracket will reward themselves with the sort of salaries that people don't find outrageous. And that's what he's after. It's not about revenue. How many people, out of a total population of 65 million would be affected by this tax increase? Pedder answered: Probably no more than about 3,000 French households will be affected by this.… That’s an absolutely tiny fraction.… So once you start looking at numbers like that, you realize how this is very much a symbolic gesture. And do the French support the idea? Said Pedder: I think it's been incredibly popular. And if I look back over this campaign, I think that it really marked the moment when he sort of touched French hearts about what he was really trying to do. There were polls that were taken immediately after his announcement, which suggested that the majority of the French thought it was a good idea. So he's not going against the sort of popular mood at all, far from it. Grandil agrees — the French are different: French people have an uncomfortable relationship with money. Here, someone who is a self-made man, creating jobs and ending up as a millionaire, is viewed with suspicion. This is big cultural difference between France and the United States. Some have already left the country for places that don’t punish wealth so severely. In fact, almost anywhere would be a better choice. The United Kingdom’s top tax bracket is 45 percent, Sweden’s is 57 percent, and Belgium’s is 55 percent. A realtor in Brussels thinks Hollande’s proposal is crazy but is enjoying the increase in business as a result. Jean Dekerchove, manager of Immobilier Le Lion, a high-end agency, says that calls since May have picked up considerably: It is a ridiculous proposal, but it’s great for us. It’s a huge loss for France because people and businesses come to Belgium [which shares its western border with France] and bring their wealth with them. But we’re thrilled because they create jobs, they buy houses and spend money — and it’s our economy that profits. Some have already left. Laetitia Casta, a wealthy French model (and a Victoria's Secret Angel) moved to London while Alain Ducasse, a French chef, became a naturalized citizen of Monaco to take advantage of that principality’s very low tax rates. French singer and actor Johnny Hallyday (nicknamed “the biggest rock star you’ve never heard of”) moved to Gstaad, Switzerland, to escape the high taxes of France. Hollande’s proposal is dampening enthusiasm for others to move to France as well. When Pedder was asked about that, she said there is “already … evidence that international companies [in France] that are looking to recruit … foreign senior executives into Paris … are beginning to hear … a bit of apprehension.” That apprehension is justified. According to the latest index from the Heritage Foundation that ranks countries on the basis of their economic freedom, France comes in at a dismal 63.2, making it the 67th freest country in their 2012 Index. And while France was just beginning to recover from a recession that followed the Great Recession in the United States, the Bank of France is predicting that it will go into recession again this fall. But Hollande doesn’t seem to care. His Labour Minister, Michel Sapin, announced in early June plans to fine companies that are thinking of laying off workers severely enough “to make layoffs so expensive for companies that it’s not worth it.” This of course will ensure that any companies planning to lay off some of their employees will do so immediately before any such mandate goes into effect, as well as ensuring that those too valuable to fire can be moved overseas. Such a mandate will also ensure that any company thinking of hiring new people will give such a decision very careful thought: once hired, never fired! Hollande must be given credit on at least one point: as a Socialist he thinks that capitalism is evil and must be killed. As president he is now implementing all the plans necessary to do so.

They may be trying to measure up to Boeing standards. Here at Boeing HR aka Inhumane Resources. There has been a few decent HR types over the years, but darn few. Most will cut your throat in a nano second. Well actuallly its their job, its expected of them. They often keep some hotties in the front line. That way when an employee is needing help from the union, well those hotties will wiggle their stuff a little and that BR or union steward will forget all about what you was there for. When you talk to a BR about some help they will ask what hottie er ah HR rep you are dealing with, when you tell them they will get a far away look in their eyes, you will know there isn't going to be any help there. Does Aurora have a union.

The Frech President is admitting up front that taxing the rich will do nothing to help the economy so unlike the idiots on this board who think taxing the rich more will improve the economy, the French people are under no such self-delusion. They know that the tax hikes will only affect 3,000 French citizens out of 65 million. It seems to me this is nothing more than symbolic vengance to tap into French emotionalism, in this case hate, in order to misdirect the French from the fact that they have allowed their country to fail. The rich are a temporary scapegoat for terrible policies and very poor leadership. GDP of .2% GDP in 2012 and projected GDP of .3% in 2013 is pathetic. The French could have elected a jackass as president and still have gotten .2% growth.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1354055744057</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 17:35:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354057468765-42</Id><Title>Are Drug Dealers Paying Their Fair Share?</Title><Msg>The single largest marketplace for illegal drugs continues to be the United States. Although the market has decreased dramatically since its heyday in the mid-80's, close to thirteen million Americans still think nothing about occasionally buying a gram of cocaine, a few hits of ecstasy or a quarter ounce of weed to party with their friends on the weekends. A hard core group (see the chart) estimated at between 5 and 6 million have more serious drug habits, and may spend $100-$500 dollars a week on purchasing their drugs. These two groups - hard core users and casual users - spend approximately $60 billion dollars a year, according to U.S. government estimates. Imagine a typical weekend in New York City. Experts estimate that at least one percent of the population - 80,000 plus - spends $200 on illicit drugs. That alone would amount to $16 million dollars a week or $832 million a year. And that's just New York. Frontline/PBS Obama has made high wage earners who pay their fair share of taxes the enemy and blaming them for his poor economic choices while drug lords prosper and pay no taxes. You will be less of an enemy to Obama Dems as a drug dealer than as a tax paying entrepreneur. Does anyone else see a problem here? Drug money is wealth that is leaving the USA.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1354057468765</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 18:04:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354058072437-43</Id><Topic><Title>Paying your fair share</Title><Username>doublehaul32</Username><Timestamp>1354047501384</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 15:18:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, you are not right. Did I not say in the post and I quote, "Now, I wholeheartedly agree with having to recycle these (flourescent) bulbs....."? Personally, I think flourescent bulbs should be banned because they are an environmental hazard which I also mentioned in my post. It is beyond me why the gov't was trying to make them our required lighting. Further, I don't particularly like the light the emit either. Now, not trying to be rude but please reread my post. Either you had some preconcieved misconception or you lack in reading comprehension skills. Still, the point of the post is that the recycling of the bulbs is going to be a cost. It is going to be added into the price of the bulb when you by them. While your lawmakers may tell you that it isn't going to cost you anything the producers of the bulbs, who will be paying the recycling costs, are indeed passing that cost onto the consumer. Make no mistake about it.</Msg><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1354058072437</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 18:14:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354058624711-44</Id><Topic><Title>Are Drug Dealers Paying Their Fair Share?</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1354057468765</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 18:04:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jay Inslee, Governor-elect, is going to be the new dealerman here in Washington state.</Msg><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1354058624711</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 18:23:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354059544457-45</Id><Topic><Title>Paying your fair share</Title><Username>doublehaul32</Username><Timestamp>1354047501384</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 15:18:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The funniest aspect for me is that you have greenies recycling swirly bulbs at Best Buy and other stores tauting their green credentials for recycling swirly bulbs and then selling greenies IPads, IPhones and IPods that contain components that required massive amounts of toxic poisons as waste products during their manufacturing.
