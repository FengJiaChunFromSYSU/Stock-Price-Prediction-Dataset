But is a bad corporate citizen, because then Boeing without a real excuse, moved some 787 production to Carolina in violation of the terms of taxpayer agreement with Boeing to assemble all the 787 in Everett, unless there was a business need. The move was made at a time when the failure of management, by not contracting with good contractors caused a 3 year delay in parts production. So there was zero need to move, no strike with the assemblers happened the IAM accepted the contract and it was done seamlessly. The plane is late because the outsourced parts were not make right or on time in fact 3 years late and counting to get the failed 787 out the factory door and still not working as promised. Since the CEO of Boeing is not an engineer, or has any experience with airframe production, he should have stayed out of production management, he should have gone with what the engineers told him to do with the outsourcing and the testing of the 787, he ignored the in house experts. The Boeing CEO went with the bankrupt and failed MD business model, exporting contracting and going with a unproven technology almost 100% composite skin material. Outsourcing and made a huge mistake. The 787 besides being 3 years late and 30 billion over budget has no performance improvement over aluminum. It does not fly faster and the idea that it might last longer is a guess, not proven. No composite passenger plane has lasted 50 years because none has been built, but aluminum planes like the B-52 have been around for a very long time and still work. The Boeing CEO broke a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholder when he allowed the MD business model to build an experimental plane the 787 and may eventually cause the Boeing Company to go bankrupt. This plane is a disaster, should never have been built. Now the stock market knows Boeing cannot control production and therefore it does not matter how many planes it builds, the control is now in the contractor’s hands. Boeing is a Dow Jones composite stock for the year to date shareholders have a 1.83% gain with Boeing stock ,( Boeing is in the bottom 10 DJ stocks in gain, for all of 2012) compared to the overall average of the Dow at 5.19%, S and P average is 11.52%, the 22 better Dow Jones stocks are more like this one , Bank of America, symbol BAC is up . 104%, other aerospace companies like noc Northrup up 14%, . So the stock traders fear Boeing as Boeing contractors control the production now , if their parts are built wrong and not in time then the great IAM assemblers cannot bail Boeing</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1356930845280</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 00:14:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356931001538-2</Id><Topic><Title>Dive Dive Dive 45 degree angle</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1356928756924</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 23:39:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I remain postive 01 - 01 45 DEGREE beep</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1356931001538</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 00:16:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356931220535-3</Id><Topic><Title>!Boeing Management is good at getting concessions and taxpayer breaks</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1356930845280</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 00:14:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and the bad news is ???</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1356931220535</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 00:20:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356932007454-4</Id><Topic><Title>Teachers of fish - bulky blob</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1356906030268</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 17:20:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>God almighty reveal yourself to my chidren as they seem lost -john the apostle</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1356932007454</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 00:33:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356933973160-5</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Make War on Retirees</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1356903360785</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 16:36:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am very proud of the last sentence in my previous post.

"I'd be scared of a return to the bad old days," said Aboulafia. "If there's anybody helping the Airbus A350 now, it's Boeing." Airbus' Leahy says Boeing won't be able to match his A350-1000 until around 2022. "It'll take them that long to come up with technology that'll be competitive," The outlook for Boeing is clouded only by persistent industry worries over the company's strategy for the future. Is the Airbus A320neo narrow body jet already eclipsing Boeing's 737 MAX, years before either jet flies? With a shrinking order book for its new 747-8, will Boeing have to cut or stop production of the 747? Will Boeing's Executives in Chicago make sure that the engineers and technical workers strike early in the new year and shut down production?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1356938041403</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 02:14:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356949332988-8</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Make War on Retirees</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1356903360785</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 16:36:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The cliff is figment of your imagination and you're living in some shadow world by yourself.

Their payroll taxes are going to go up, their income taxes are going to go up, and approximately 28 million households are going to be hit with a huge, unexpected AMT tax bill on their 2012 earnings. So happy New Year middle class! You are about to be ripped to shreds. In addition to the tax increases that I just mentioned, approximately two million unemployed Americans will instantly lose their extended unemployment benefits when 2013 begins, and new Obamacare tax hikes which will cost American taxpayers about a trillion dollars over the next decade will start to go into effect. If Congress is not able to come to some sort of a deal, all middle class families in America will be sending thousands more dollars to Uncle Sam next year than they were previously. And considering the fact that the middle class is already steadily shrinkingand that the U.S. economy is already in an advanced state of decline, that is not good news. You would think that both major political parties would want to do something to keep the middle class from being hit with this kind of tax sledgehammer. Unfortunately, at this point it appears that our “leaders” in Washington D.C. are incapable of getting anything done. So get ready for much smaller paychecks and much larger tax bills. What is coming is not going to be pleasant. So what happened? Weren’t the tax increases only supposed to be for the wealthy? Well, that is what the politicians always promise, but it is always the middle class that ends up getting hit the hardest. In this day and age, the big corporations and the ultra-wealthy are absolute masters at avoiding taxes. For example, Facebook paid approximately $4.64 million in taxes on their entire foreign profits of $1.344 billion for 2011. That comes out to a tax rate of about 0.3 percent. Overall, the global elite have approximately 18 trillion dollarsparked in offshore tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. Keep in mind that U.S. GDP for 2011 was only slightly above 15 trillion dollars. So the global elite have an amount of money parked in offshore banks that is substantially larger than the total value of all goods and services produced in the United States each year. According to one estimate, a third of all the wealth in the entire world is stationed in offshore banks. Our politicians are playing checkers and the global elite are playing chess when it comes to taxes. Our current system of taxation is irreversibly broken and should be entirely thrown out and replaced with something else. And of course under our current system those that are poor don’t pay much in taxes because they are just trying to survive. So who always ends up getting the painful end of the hammer? The middle class does, and that really stinks.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356963942376</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 09:25:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356964247902-19</Id><Topic><Title>When is Obama going to guest host on The View?</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1356950014556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 05:33:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice to know you care about LeBron</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1356964247902</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 09:30:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356964574861-20</Id><Topic><Title>*****IMAGINE*****</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356878544054</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 09:42:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most of the Information I illiceted and transmitted is easily demonstratable and provable.

Morally speaking, is having an abortion really just like picking a scab? 2. If abortion is not murder because the fetus is not a person then why make it “safe, legal, and rare”? 3. Do you have a similar desire to make scab-picking “safe, legal, and rare”? 4. If a woman were raped and got pregnant, which one would you kill a) The baby, b) the rapist, or c) both? 5. Are you comfortable with the fact that “a” is the only answer you may choose according to (the present interpretation of) the Constitution? 6. Abortion advocates frequently focus on the size of the fetus. Why is that relevant? 7. Do tall people have more rights than short people? 8. Do men have superior rights relative to women given that men are, on average, larger than women? 9. Is fetal lack of self-awareness a justification for abortion? 10. Is murder permissible when the victim is sleeping and hence unaware of the surrounding environment? 11. Does the fact that there are many miscarriages really lend credence to the argument that abortion is justified? 12. Does the high infant mortality rate in Third World nations justify infanticide in Third World nations? 13. Does the spontaneous termination of life by nature justify the intentional termination of life by man? 14. Are human beings inherently more valuable than other animals such as dogs? 15. What gives human beings more value than dogs? 16. Should a woman abort a baby because it may be expensive and time-consuming to raise a child to adulthood? 17. Should a woman be able to kill a puppy because it may be expensive and time consuming to feed and care for a dog? 18. A person can be held criminally responsible for killing a dog. Should a dog be held criminally responsible for killing a cat? 19. Why do we expect better behavior from humans than from dogs? 20. Is it morally permissible for a woman to have an abortion if she has pets? In other words, is it wrong to decline to care for her baby while providing care for animals? 21. Which one of these is not like the others?: a) Adult, b) toddler, c) unborn baby, d) dog. 22. Does secular humanism assume that humans are inherently different from other life forms? If not, why is it called humanism? 23. Is secular humanism a form of species-ism? 24. Can a thoroughly materialistic (or Darwinist or secular humanist) worldview explain how or why anything has value or a right to life? 25. During the 2008 election cycle, pro-choice candidate John Edwards said that everyone has a right to a college education. When does the right to a college education begin? 26. Is the right to an education necessary for the development of one’s full human potential? 27. Does not the right to full development only extend to those not yet fully developed? 28. What is the difference between a natural right and a legal right? 29. Should religious leaders interject their religiously-based opposition to the death penalty in debates over public policy? 30. Should religious leaders interject their religiously-based opposition to abortion in debates over public policy? If you answered “no” to this question and “yes” to the previous question please explain your inconsistency. 31. Does the “right to choose” come from man or from God? 32. If man grants rights can he also take them away? 33. It has been said (by three Supreme Court Justices) that “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.” Does that mean a woman can define a baby’s rights out of existence because a woman is more powerful than a baby? 34. Or does that mean a man can define a woman’s rights out of existence because, in a patriarchal society, a man is more powerful than a woman? 35. Rights often confer power. Should power also confer rights?

From the EU times.- A new Foreign Military Intelligence (GRU) report circulating in the Kremlin today is saying that United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton [photo 2nd right] was injured, and a top US Navy Seal Commander killed when their C-12 Huron military passenger and transport aircraft crash landed nearly 3 weeks ago in the Iranian city of Ahvaz near the Iraqi border. Iranian intelligence agents quoted in this GRU report confirm that the C-12 Huron aircraft is still in their possession in Ahvaz, but will only admit that the plane was “forced to land because of technical problems”. The US Navy Seal member reported killed in this bizarre incident, this report says, was indentified as Commander Job W. Price [photo 3rd right] who as a leader of this highly specialized American Special Forces unit protects high-ranking diplomats traveling in Middle Eastern and Asian combat zones. Curiously, US media reports on Commander Price’s death say it being investigated as a possible suicide as he died from what the American Defense Department describes as “a non-combat related injury”. Equally as curious, US media reports state that Secretary Clinton will return to work next week after her having suffered what they describe as a “nasty bout with stomach flu” and a “concussion” which have kept her missing from public view the past three weeks. This GRU report, however, states that US military flight logs recorded by Russian air and space forces confirm that Commander Price, and other members of US Navy Seal Team 4, left their base in Urozgan Province, Afghanistan on a flight to US Naval Support Activity Bahrain where they met up with Secretary Clinton and all of them transferred to the C-12 Huron that began a flight path to Baghdad, Iraq. Within minutes of leaving Bahrain airspace, this report says, the C-12 Huron carrying Secretary Clinton and her US Navy Seal protectors, “without notice,” deviated from their assigned flight path heading, instead, directly towards Iran’s Ahwaz International Airport where, coincidentally, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had previously landed on an “unscheduled” visit. Important to note, GRU analysts say in this report, was that when the C-12 Huron entered into Iranian airspace neither American nor Iran air force units responded clearly indicating that this secret mission was sanctioned. Upon the C-12 Huron landing at Ahwaz, however, this report says it encountered “extreme turbulence” causing it to leave the runway where its main landing gear then collapsed causing it to crash. Within seconds of the C-12 Huron crashing, this report continues, Iranian emergency and security personal responded freeing the victims, including Secretary Clinton who was reportedly unconscious and “bleeding profusely.” After emergency aid was given, GRU agents stationed in Iran state that another US military flight was dispatched from Bahrain to Ahwaz which evacuated all of those wounded and killed in the crash including Secretary Clinton.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1356971775986</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 11:36:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356974169330-35</Id><Title>C-17 contract 895M</Title><Msg>Boeing Co. landed an $895 million U.S. Air Force contract issued by the Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the Dayton Business Journal reports.

This is another banner year for Rahm Emanuel’s tightly controlled non-gun “paradise.” Breitbart recently reported that Chicago’s own stats show that 440 school age children were shot in 2012 in Chicago’s paradise. Breitbart’s Awr Hawkins writes: These numbers are well above those for the 2011-2012 school year, in which 319 Chicago students were wounded and another 24 were killed. And yet, it has long been reported that the school where Rahm’s children attend to their education has an armed security guard. Additionally, his children also have an armed escort to get them to and from school, just like those Hollywood celebrities who clamor for gun control while they enjoy full-time, armed bodyguards. And yet, the citizen gun control puppets continue to lap up the “wisdom” of their Masters and spew their hyper-emotional pleas to be controlled and enslaved. Oh – and what appeared in the Chicago Tribune just a few days ago? An article by Laura Washington, written in the usual Oprahified manner, stating that gun control would be the best present ever for those of us who lack Chicago’s glorious standards for paradise. In fact, Miss Laura openly calls for totalitarian decrees on the part of the Napoleonic branch of government: Obama can do more. He can issue executive orders that will bypass the congressional sausage makers. He can deploy his White House bully pulpit to back similar state and local efforts. If we don’t take action for the little angels of Sandy Hook, now, America will be forever haunted by the demons of gun violence. In addition, Miss Laura also states that: During the 2012 campaign, he avoided confrontations on gun control. When Obama was asked about gun control at a presidential debate, he punted. He was terrified of the People of the Gun, particularly in election swing states like Pennsylvania and Virginia. People of the Gun? How cutesy. Actually, Obama and Rahm Emanuel both quickly realized, upon Obamanual’s first election, that they could not win the federal battle for gun control because so many states of free and law-abiding peoples are still heroically immersed in a gun culture, unlike their murder city. Like all of us, politicians pick their battles, and after Obamanual realized this battle could not be won, Emanuel separated from Obama and took his schemes back to the city that gave us both of these megalomaniac buffoons. Sorry Chicago, better that you have Rahm all to yourselves rather than the rest of us. Chicago, feel free to revel in your gun control authoritarianism and ignore your city’s violence, murder, bloodshed, and perpetual terror, but you aren’t going to import your political enslavement and perverted twist of logic to the rest of us anytime soon</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356978242915</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 13:24:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356978441470-44</Id><Topic><Title>On Thursday, Feinstein will introduce her dream bill to disarm the American people</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356971461736</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 11:31:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What part of "being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." don't you understand ?

Boeing won't silence its doubters on the 787 program until the company meets its production goal of 10 787s per month, which is targeted for the end of 2013. That's a key milestone on the program's path to being profitable. David E. Strauss, an aerospace analyst at UBS Financial Services, said in a note to investors this month that his analysis indicates Dreamliner production "costs are not declining rapidly enough for (Boeing) to come close to its target for break-even 787 cash flow by early 2015." Most analysts suggest not until 2021 for the 787 in fact the cost is 116k out of the shareholder’s pocket for each 787 delivered due to late fees, excessive delay and costs. In October, Boeing CEO Jim McNerney indicated that the yet-to-be-launched 777X may not enter commercial service until after 2020, despite pressure from key 777 customers for a refreshed 777 before the end of the decade. Analysts have differing opinions on the urgency of a 777X plan. Backpedaling on either the 787-10 or the 777X could be a "bad self-inflicted wound" to Boeing, analyst Richard Aboulafia, with the Teal Group, All of Boeing's plans for 2013 could be for naught if the jetmaker doesn't reach a deal with the SPEEA union Next year "could be the year that SPEEA goes on strike," Hamilton said Boeing Executives are talking tuff to these valued employee’s , not smart at 250 million cost per each day of a strike .Stock value for all of 2012 Boeing shareholders made 2% not counting the dividend. while the Dow Jones made 6.34%, Northrup(NOC) made 14.5% and better Dow stocks like Bank of America are up 108% for the year .
