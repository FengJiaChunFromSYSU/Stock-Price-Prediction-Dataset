But making a cell safer through additives reduces performance, experts said. The difficulties of lithium-ion batteries have prompted some experts to rework older technologies or leap ahead to more advanced batteries in hopes of finding a safer, less costly solution for modern uses. Boeing rival Airbus has dropped lithium-ion batteries from its forthcoming A350 jet, saying it wants let the technology mature and avoid any risk of delaying the jet's development. Better technology is needed to predict if a battery cell will experience an internal short due to a manufacturing defect, Daniel Doughty, president of Battery Safety Consulting, told the NTSB forum. He added new methods were also needed to prevent a cell fire from spreading to other cells in the battery pack. The widespread use of lithium-ion batteries has also placed pressure on regulators to develop new ways to safely ship them. "We all know lithium batteries are hazardous materials," said Janet McLaughlin, deputy director of the Federal Aviation Administration's hazardous materials safety programs.</Msg><Username>analyticanalysis</Username><Timestamp>1365767383305</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 07:49:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365767762708-16</Id><Title>FAA DEPUTY Director, JANET McLAUGHLIN SAYS: ""We all know LITHIUM BATTERIES ARE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS"</Title><Msg>The two-day NTSB meeting that began on Thursday is aimed at helping the safety agency gauge the risk of lithium-ion batteries as their use in planes and vehicles expands.

There is currently no agreement on how best to test for internal shorts in cells, Laurie Florence, principal engineer at UL LLC, the testing organization formerly known as Underwriters Laboratories Inc., said at the forum. To ensure the 787 batteries were safe, Boeing punctured a cell with a nail to simulate a short-circuit. The battery didn’t catch fire in Boeing’s tests. A nail test doesn’t accurately replicate a short, Florence said. The FAA has recorded 33 cases of batteries brought aboard commercial planes by passengers or as cargo catching fire since 2009. Of those cases, 26, or 79 percent, involved lithium-based batteries, according to the agency. Safety Incidents Since 2006, three cargo jets have been destroyed in fires where lithium batteries were present, according to the safety board. Those cells were being shipped and weren’t part of the aircraft. The United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization on Jan. 1 imposed new rules on air shipments of lithium batteries.NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said after Thursday's session that the risks had to be addressed. "I think with lithium-ion batteries, the genie is out of the bottle," Hersman said. so using lithium batteries with a containment vessel is putting the flying public at a risk, airbus changed from lithium to nicad for passenger safety on their new beater o f the 787 plane due out next year. for the record Boeing managment and Boeing Hacks for long term hold Boeing gas gained you just a pathetic return of 7% in fives years Airbus EADSY has made Airbus shareholders 112% in the same 5 years or about what the only person in boeing has gained the CEO of Boeing has made over 100% in his wage retirement and benefits for failure on the 787 it cost too much, is 4 years late,decertified</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365799284880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 16:41:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365801997993-59</Id><Topic><Title>NTSB hearing is turning up the heat on the FAA</Title><Username>wearesoscrewed</Username><Timestamp>1365776642281</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 10:24:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lithium Batteries Can Be Safe for Planes, Experts Say - Bloomberg, Alan Levin article google it.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1365801997993</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 17:26:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365806339813-60</Id><Topic><Title>Facts Gun Control Nut Don't Want you to Know</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1365704599311</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 14:23:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wish me luck!

My friend Rob Sisson of ConservAmerica can't take it any more. He actually served as mayor of his small city. He drew some ideas from Agenda 21 to lower city costs and cut taxes. Let me now pass the microphone over to Rob for the rest: Have we entered some parallel universe where saving tax dollars and conserving natural resources has become a UN plot against American liberties? Apparently so. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush signed the U.S. onto a non-binding United Nations agreement called Agenda 21. The agreement is hardly more than a list of ways that local communities can better conserve natural resources. The general header for such practices is "sustainability." During my tenure as mayor of Sturgis (MI), a city of about 12,000 people, we implemented several sustainable practices that resulted in substantial savings to taxpayers. A green roof on a new public works building minimized heating and cooling costs in the building, reduced storm water runoff, and lowered long term maintenance expenses. When a neighborhood was annexed, we utilized rain gardens in lieu of costly curb and gutter to manage storm water, saving taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Hardly controversial, you'd think.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1365811609181</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 20:06:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365812602739-70</Id><Topic><Title>Not much activity in BA</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1365789156808</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 13:52:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BA closed at 88.89, uo %.36.

It is the blueprint for depopulation and total control, under the banner of saving the environment. It is like the head of a beast that has thousands of tentacles, originating from the United Nations. The 3 primary tools that are used are: Man-made global warming Water shortages Endangered Species Act We all want clean air, water, land and food, but phony environmentalism is designed to create fear in order to implement the policies of tyranny. For example, the Globalists used global warming fear mongering in order to usher in the Cap &amp; Trade and carbon tax schemes without debate. The Globalists use governments and other major groups (NGOs - Non-Governmental Organizations) to force their policies. When you understand Agenda 21 Sustainable Development, you can recognize it in your neighborhood. Because the collectivists' battle to take control is from 'Global to Local', you can affect the world by taking action locally when you understand the rules and tools they use.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365817449898</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 21:44:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365817530769-82</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan's Freudian Slip: 'We are Not Going to Give Up on Destroying the Health Care System'</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1365813595537</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 20:39:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are premiums going to double under Obamacare ?

(AP) — Eight days after allegedly being sexually battered while passed out at a party, and then humiliated by online photos of the assault, 15-year-old Audrie Pott posted on Facebook that her life was ruined, "worst day ever," and hanged herself. For the next eight months, her family struggled to figure out what happened to their soccer loving, artistic, horse crazy daughter, whose gentle smile, long dark hair and shining eyes did not bely a struggling soul. And then on Thursday, seven months after the tragedy, a Northern California sheriff's office arrested three 16-year-old boys on charges of sexual battery." . . . Y.T.
