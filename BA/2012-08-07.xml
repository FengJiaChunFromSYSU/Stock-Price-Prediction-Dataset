With new suspicions emerging that he has been less than honest about his taxes, even fellow Republicans are having their doubts about him. Lee Sheppard, a columnist with the industry paper Tax Notes, has spent decades wading through books on taxation. But even Sheppard took a few days to figure out what Rafalca was doing in the 203-page tax return of Ann and Mitt Romney. Rafalca is a fine, dark brown, 15-year-old Oldenburg dressage horse with an estimated value of $500,000 (€404,000). Horse enthusiast Ann Romney, the wife of the Republican presidential candidate, has been a co-owner of the mare since 2006. Last week Rafalca, ridden by German-born equestrian Jan Ebeling, even competed for the United States in dressage at the London Olympics. No ordinary Olympian, the valuable horse traveled to London in a chartered jet -- in the style to which she is accustomed. Rafalca is a pretty expensive source of entertainment, but not necessarily for the Romneys, as Sheppard discovered while poking around in their tax return. As it turns out, the political couple posted a loss of $77,731 for the mare's upkeep and transport on their 2010 tax return, just as if the horse were a business. Although the Romneys have not claimed the loss as a deduction yet, they were acting with foresight. Whenever they earn a little money with Rafalca in the future, be it through prizes or breeding fees, they will be able to carry forward the 2010 expenses as a deduction on future tax returns. "Do we want a president who takes advantage of tax loopholes for his wife's horse hobby?" asks Sheppard, who just published a long article on the subject. Do Americans even want Willard Mitt Romney, 65, in the White House? It's an increasingly relevant question. The Washington Post selected Romney for its "Worst Week in Washington" column after Romney's much-touted foreign trip turned into a flop. First he insinuated that the British would not be good Olympic hosts. Then, in Israel, he said that the Palestinians were economically backward because of their "culture." Finally, his spokesman verbally abused journalists in Warsaw. "Romney is perhaps the only politician who could start a trip that was supposed to be a charm offensive by being utterly devoid of charm and mildly offensive," the Daily Telegraph wrote bitingly. Newsweek Calls Romney a Wimp According to the Washington-based Pew Research Center, the Republican presidential candidate is now polling 10 percentage points behind President Barack Obama, as conservatives in the United States become increasingly exasperated with Romney. After all, he is campaigning against a president whose economic policies meet with disapproval among the majority of Americans. One of the reasons Romney is trailing Obama is that he persistently refuses to talk about his past and his plans for the future. He has been deliberately vague about his own proposals for America's future economic and foreign policy. This approach prompted Newsweek to characterize Romney as a "wimp." This man avoids all risk, unlike previous Republican candidates like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, who both went on to win the White House. "It looks like they're banking on simply the angst about President Obama," influential conservative journalist Craig Shirley told Politico. [... ]His inability to shed this reputation is his own fault. The former businessman likes to pose while jet skiing in front of his $10-million lakeside vacation house, and he raves about how nice it is to "fire" people. Some 89 percent of Americans believe that Romney's main motivation is to help the rich, whose taxes he promises to cut considerably.

In fact, as the Daily Caller reminds us "The White House and Treasury Department have consistently maintained that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) independently made the decision to terminate the 20,000 non-union Delphi workers’ pension plan...Former Treasury official Matthew Feldman and former White House auto czar Ron Bloom, both key members of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry during the GM bailout, have testified under oath that the PBGC, not the administration, led the effort to terminate the non-union Delphi workers’ pension plan." Turns out they lied... Under oath.""

There are shades of gray. But then even the dalai-lama, supreme Buddhist says so. Obama falls into the light gray area (which brings into question the allegations of him being a hybrid space-alien reptilion), Boosh/Chieney into the dark side of the gray scale, with Willtard following Boosh/Chieney into Hell.

As a matter of fact, I could hardly have stalked you there being how I don't even have a facebook account or have ever have gone there. I don't judge all casino-goers as welfare recipients. Get a grip now. As far as "whoops" go, it is a nickname....a term of endearment. To set the record straight and generally speaking I have sympathy for the whoops on many issues. I also have a opposing opinion on how the the government handles many of those issues. Parents who allow their ATV driving kids to make noise and spread heavy dusts clouds over your property espeially when you are having a patio party are effed-up neighbors. Have spent countless hours on private fish (salmon) habitat and watershed improvement projects to enhance our fisheries and environment. Never have sailed into foreign water to commercial fish except. Have done sport fishing in Canada and Mexico. Released my marlins. Now back to the original subject/question my ADD protagonist. Why do you think I think that a gunner knows more than a pilot about flying a huey when I don't think that at all? Now as to there being 300% less wrong with you if I weren't in this world I'm not sure whether to give you one of your classic "boo-hoos" (cry me a river) or "tee-hees" or give myself a "he shoots, he scores". Seems they might all be appropriate.</Msg><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1344394428000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 22:53:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344394937000-238</Id><Topic><Title>Romney 179 Obama 180 Electorial Votes</Title><Username>hoodickhertz</Username><Timestamp>1344367189000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 15:19:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But what does that make Al Davis not the Rupert Murdoch or the Joe Paterno but he was definitely into someting BIG</Msg><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1344394937000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 23:02:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344395529000-239</Id><Topic><Title>"YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT"</Title><Username>fredjones801</Username><Timestamp>1344382066000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 19:27:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Railroads did most of this at risk. &gt;&gt; I reiterate there was no personal risk by the robber barons, it was, at best a corporate risk.

We could have put a man in office whose accomplishments spoke for them selves. We could have put a man in office whose ideals were more than simple slogans. Yesterday, the President of the United States quipped that his opponent could be known as "Romney Hood". Other than being pathetic and just not very funny, save to those that are inclined drink such kool-aid, he has nothing of worth to say about himself. Nothing. There is nothing in his record, his accomplishment over the past nearly four years that anyone can agree, "yes, that was good". Nothing. OK, he killed OBL. But that was going to happen no matter who was in office. That was pre-ordained from the work started by the previous administration. So, really an absolute zero, save for 8.3% unemployment and a $1 trillion deficit, slightly less than the average $1.34T yearly deficits. Nothing. Zero. Oh, you can put your toes in the water, but that is simply the leech from the local Obama sewer.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1344398353000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 23:59:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
