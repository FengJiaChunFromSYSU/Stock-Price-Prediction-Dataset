The question is whether the Dreamliner order will help the ailing state-run carrier. So far, however, the move has failed to yield positive results: the national carrier has been making losses ever since. Air India is also seeking bids from interested parties such as airlines and cargo companies to lease out up to five of its eight 777-200 long-range planes. The airplane delivered today was built in Everett, Washington and flown to South Carolina for delivery. So much for non union workers who did what? Air India took delivery of its first Boeing 787 commercial widebody airplane on Thursday at Boeing Co's final assembly plant after a months-long dispute between airline and manufacturer over compensation for a four-year production delay.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347017851298</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 07:37:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347018088730-2</Id><Topic><Title>Please, do not post any</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1346983398847</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 22:03:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I didn't watch the speech, but I think it is safe to say that your opinion is so biased it is useless.

A: No. A court official confirms that no public disciplinary proceeding has ever been brought against either of them, contrary to a false Internet rumor. By voluntarily inactivating their licenses, they avoid a requirement to take continuing education classes and pay hundreds of dollars in annual fees. Both could practice law again if they chose to do so.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1347020516000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:21:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347020641874-7</Id><Topic><Title>Bill Clinton Used</Title><Username>jetstream_2010</Username><Timestamp>1346961181037</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 15:53:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FULL ANSWER We briefly addressed rumors about the status of the Obamas’ law licenses back in January 2010 in an Ask FactCheck titled “Clueless ‘Columbo.’ ” But a steady stream of questions about them has continued to flow to our inbox ever since. It’s true that neither the president nor the first lady holds an active license to practice law. A search on the website of the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois shows that Barack Obama is listed as “voluntarily retired and not authorized to practice law,” and Michelle Obama is listed as “voluntarily inactive and not authorized to practice law.” But it’s not true that President Obama “surrendered his license back in 2008 in order to escape charges he lied on his bar application,” or that Michelle Obama “ ‘voluntarily surrendered’ her law license in 1993 after a Federal Judge gave her the choice between surrendering her license or standing trial for Insurance fraud,” as the chain email claims. Lawyers who voluntarily change their registration status to inactive or retired “may not practice law based upon their Illinois license or hold themselves out as being so authorized,” according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois. But James Grogan, deputy administrator and chief counsel for the ARDC, said that the Obamas were “never the subject of any public disciplinary proceedings.” Voluntary Changes President Obama graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991 and was admitted as a lawyer by the Supreme Court of Illinois on Dec. 17, 1991. Prior to being elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1996, he worked as a civil rights lawyer at the firm formerly known as Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland. Four days after Obama announced that he would run for president in February 2007, he voluntarily elected to have his law license placed on “inactive” status, according to Grogan. Then, after becoming president, he elected to change his status to “retired” in February 2009. Michelle Obama graduated from Harvard Law School in 1988, and was admitted as a lawyer by the Supreme Court of Illinois on May 12, 1989. Following graduation, she joined Sidley Austin, a corporate law firm in Chicago. But a few years later, in 1994, while working for the Public Allies project in Chicago, Obama voluntarily had her license placed on “inactive” status. But the claim that the Obamas “surrendered” their licenses to avoid ethics charges has no basis in fact. Neither of the Obamas has any public record of discipline or pending proceedings against them, according to the online public registration records of the ARDC. We also confirmed that with Grogan, who said that the Obamas were “never the subject of any public disciplinary proceedings.” The Obamas haven’t said exactly what prompted them to change the status of their licenses. But Grogan said that it was fairly common for lawyers who didn’t intend to continue practicing law to go on inactive status. It was actually one of the reasons, he said, that the rule was changed so that lawyers wanting to switch to inactive status no longer had to petition the Illinois Supreme Court to do so. In 2011, more than 12 percent of the state’s 87,943 registered attorneys were on inactive status (see Chart 2), according to the ARDC’s annual report for that year. In addition, prior to June 5, 2012, the Obamas would have been required to pay an annual fee of $289 (now $342), and take classes to satisfy the state’s Minimum Continuing Legal Education requirement, in order to keep their licenses active. Lawyers on retirement status, however, don’t have to pay an annual fee or take classes. And lawyers on inactive status also don’t have to take classes, but they do have to pay an annual fee of $105. Perhaps one reason for these false claims is that the online registration record used to list Michelle Obama as being “on court ordered inactive status.” But that wasn’t because of any wrongdoing. As previously mentioned, before 1999, an Illinois Supreme Court rule required active lawyers who wanted to change their registration status to do so by petitioning the court.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1347020641874</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:24:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347021339437-8</Id><Title>August Jobs Report -- 96k Jobs</Title><Msg>Bye, Bye Barack</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1347021339437</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:35:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347021501717-9</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Woodward Book: Debt Deal Collapse Led to 'Pure Fury' From President Obama</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346946440844</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 11:47:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What will O'Bummer say about this?</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1347021501717</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:38:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347022228612-10</Id><Topic><Title>August Jobs Report -- 96k Jobs</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1347021339437</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:35:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just like Obama, Missing Expectations.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347022228612</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:50:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347022252133-11</Id><Topic><Title>Traders of this stock...</Title><Username>foursquaresdiamond</Username><Timestamp>1346977915842</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 20:31:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you, "wayne".

POST-IT is the same guy that never listen when the 787 was a fiasco, the entire engineering/tech staff knew it (except for the brown noses who were drinking the cool aid) They did the 100 million dollar fake roll-out and the BOD keeps rewarding POST-IT for a great job. Looking at power-pointless charts all day is not worth very much in my opinion. The BOD and POST-IT have a mutual pay me more bonuses attitude for all the work someone else is doing. It is time for SPEEA to remind POST-IT that it takes more than paste and a piece of paper to make a product. POST-IT wasn't here in 2000 so he needs to be reminded who really makes airplanes.

Today I sold off my BAC at 8.69 as the market appear's to be flat and I have some other activities(fun) I need to do this weekend on the pacific coast. So I booked more than many people make in a month in a two day trade on BAC. If you want to day trade go with stocks that are moving, at the time your trading and go with stocks that have moved up this year , not Boeing-- it is a dead cat bounce stock. I think Boeing will be delisted in five years it is bankrupt or getting their fast. This Boeing company is much like banks, for example BAC, except it is not being bailed out. BAC actually has huge bad loans and would be in bankruptcy if the government could shut it down. it is too big, unlike Boeing which has 30 billion in bad debt on the 787 and only a few delivered and not working as expected, the latest plane was delivered 4 years late and the customer would not take the 787 until boeing paid up a late fee and lowered the price due to rework. Every 787 delivered costs teh shareholders money, they make nothing .So if Boeing was a trade stock I would do it. The stock is nothing except good to stay away from. Boeing will be out of business in five years , don't believe me look at MD they went out of business and phil Condit did a very dumb thing and lost his job too, he paid way too much for MD and now the MD people are using the same failed outsourcing business model and running BA into the ground.

However, the Dems controlled Congress for two of the 3.75 years that Obama had taken residence at 1600 Penn. Instead of concentrating on the economy, he embarked upon a budget bomber healthcare bill. That was the totality of his first two years in office. The next year was getting Osama - that was good. This year he has paid little attention to creating jobs, ergo, the "Jobs Council" goes unused and unattended almost this entire year. I believe that you have overstated Obama's competition's effect while understating Obama's responsibility and ownership of the problem.

From the Dems 2012 Platform (got it off the internet): "Protecting A Woman's Right to Choose. The Democrat Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay. We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right. Abortion is an intensely personal decision between a woman, her family, her doctor, and her clergy; there is no place for politicians or government to get in the way. We also recognize that health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby reduce the need for abortion." I will reiterate for you, "We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right." Sounds unlimited to me. No lie here. Maybe you just were uninformed. That is forgiveable once.

My Breakout co-host Matt Nesto and I discuss the report in the attached clip. Starting with the participation rate, Nesto notes that "almost 400,000 people dropped out, just gave up" looking for work in August. For each one-tenth of one percent improvement in the unemployment rate, 184,000 Americans had to become quitters. Quitting could mean going on disability, going into the grey market (read: getting paid cash for odd jobs), doing something illicit, or begging. Whatever they're doing instead of working or looking for legitimate jobs, 368,000 Americans gave up on participating in the economy in August alone. What would it take to make you just give up entirely? That's what hundreds of thousands of your fellow Americans went through last month. Think about that if anyone tries to tell you a drop in the headline rate is anything but more evidence of an ongoing national disgrace. What's really disgraceful is the O'Bummer hasn't even bothered to meet with his pobs council in almosat 7 months you can find the video on CNBC</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1347033557515</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:59:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347033741614-54</Id><Topic><Title>No matter what you hear or read elsewhere, America's job picture is getting worse</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1347033557515</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:59:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yet corporate profits at a all time high</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1347033741614</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:02:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347033855826-55</Id><Topic><Title>No matter what you hear or read elsewhere, America's job picture is getting worse</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1347033557515</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:59:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>since Obama is leading the country into a recession, they don't need to hire anyone else.</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1347033855826</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:04:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347034200746-56</Id><Title>Robert Reich: Today's disappointing jobs report and the 2012 election</Title><Msg>What's this -- another democrat telling the truth??? find the article at MSNBC</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1347034200746</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:10:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347035954394-57</Id><Topic><Title>No matter what you hear or read elsewhere, America's job picture is getting worse</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1347033557515</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:59:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Love the title of your subject line.

Lieberman was an independent that came within a few inches of being asked to run as VP with McCain and he was angry over his lack of support by the DNC in his primary. He caucused with the dems but vote against almost everything they asked. I don't agree with the Affordable Health Care being a budget bomber.

A few have tried to squash me like a bug today! But I do not get angry at all. When they hit me with things about God, I look at that as a good thing and an opportunity to challenge other's thinking. Here is what I think may happen this Nov: Obama may very well be re-elected and the Congress will switch over to Dem control again. (As you might imagine, that is not my preference. Perhaps I will be "pleasantly surprised".) A lot of people, many of my friends and neighbors, simply like Obama and have reasoned somehow that he is not at fault for the problems with the economy. The House, right or wrong, is way down in popularity and the "kick them all out" mentality will simply flip over the polarity of the party in control. One of the posters asked, with some measure of sarcasm, "did God tell you (me) to give your (my) useless opinion?" I laughed a bit because, as a Christian, I have wrestled with that very notion. Here is what I concluded: Jesus said, "Render to Caesar that which is Caesar's ..." We all know the rest. So what does that mean? I have concluded that, here in the United States, our version of "Caesar" is an elected representative government which involves competition, debate, and discussion for each office. That competition requires that citizens be involved in the process - and, might I add, that does not mean be silent because you are a believer. So, here I am.

But those dropping out aren't so much the discouraged 30-, 40- or 50-year olds. In fact, the Labor Department said there was a modest decline in the overall number of discouraged job seekers. The drop is because so many young adults, aged 16 to 24, are no longer looking for work. There were 453,000 fewer young adults with jobs in August than in July. But despite that plunge, only 27,000 more young people were looking for new jobs. Most apparently stopped looking and left the labor force. And those numbers take into account seasonal factors such as younger workers returning to school. As a result, the percentage of young people who are counted in the labor force fell to its lowest level since 1955. The unemployment rate for young adults rose to 16.8% from 16.4% in July."
