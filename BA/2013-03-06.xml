I suspect the attraction was the "filet mignon". That is what my wife and I had for dinner tonight for a "celebration". Bought the steaks at Costco, trimmed real well, then roasted in the oven. Now I am a staunch grill man, but filet is excellent when cooked in the oven. Effectively, that is how it is done at a restaurant. First they put it on the grill to sear and make the nice markings, then to the very hot oven (400+ degrees) to finish it off. At home, first let the meat reach room temp, season to taste, then using a temp probe to monitor progress, roast it in the oven (400 deg). The meat should not get above 125 deg F (internal) if you like medium rare. Perfect, every time. I use "Scott's Santa Maria" seasoning. (Salt, pepper, onion, and garlic).

Did I miss something?" Conner "said a team of about 200 Boeing engineers has worked on the fix, clocking about 200,000 hours of analysis and testing" and AvWeek says Boeing has conducted around 70 ground tests as of March 1st at various system and component laboratories at Boeing Field. So, part of the 200,000 hours could include the 70 ground tests which could be running up to 24 hours/day for the last month. So no 21.3 hour days for those engineers.

However, I doubt the attention from Genna was solely to the "filet mignon"....he as a deep hatred for people who enjoy the rewards of capitalism, hard work and good choices. He has always indicated the "collective" should be forced to protect people from their poor choices. He believes in government forced charity and is hostile to the Biblical concept that it should be delivered "not of compulsion" but voluntarily because of generous hearts. Charity is not a government's job and the founding father's acknowledged that but that doesn't fit the narrative of the socialist minded.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362579627133</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 09:20:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362579651748-27</Id><Topic><Title>Is BA too good to be true?</Title><Username>kristopherrobert</Username><Timestamp>1362575838751</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 08:17:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>number 1 out there</Msg><Username>denis.mardis</Username><Timestamp>1362579651748</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 09:20:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362580151063-28</Id><Topic><Title>Socialist Vermin Hugo Chavez Has Died</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1362540768265</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 22:32:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read this morning Hugo's family has amassed a fortune of over $2 billion dollars plundered from the poor people of Venezuela since he became president.

That promise can reasonably be construed to mean that a president is obligated to make sensible efforts, wherever possible, to minimize -- not enhance -- any "pain" experienced by law-abiding US citizens as he executes his duties. How disgraceful, then, to note that the Obama administration is trying to implement the sequester's funding reductions in a way that will maximize problems for those he is sworn to serve. As reported in the Washington Times, officials in Washington sent an email to an official with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service denying him authorization he sought to lessen the sequester's impact. Washington officials emailed that: " We have gone on record with a notification to Congress and whoever else that APHIS would eliminate assistance to producers in 24 states in managing wildlife damage to the aquaculture industry, unless they provide funding to cover the costs.’ So it is our opinion that however you manage that reduction, you need to make sure you are not contradicting what we said the impact would be." (emphasis added). In other words, the Obama administration's position is: We promised the sky would fall if the sequester happened. So don't do anything that will reduce its consequences -- even when it's possible. The conduct of the Washington officials can be characterized in many (unflattering) ways. But it certainly doesn't suggest that anyone in charge is committed to "preserving" and "protecting" the American people when it's not in their political interests to do so.

Of three circuit boards that burned, one that was damaged in April had to be replaced, Shozo Tsue, secretary general of the Japan Federation of Aviation Workers’ Unions, told reporters in Tokyo today. ANA fixed three circuit boards last year safely before flights, Megumi Tezuka, an ANA spokeswoman said by telephone. Tsue said he doesn’t know whether there is a link between circuit-board damage and the battery fires and that he has sent a letter to the nation’s transport minister asking that “issues” uncovered in the 787 be reconsidered. Boeing’s Dreamliners have yet to fly commercially after the January grounding, the first time in 34 years an entire airplane model has been pulled from service. “The circuit board case on April 7 was serious and caused damage to the surrounding area,” Tsue said. Investigators have yet to say they’ve found the causes of a lithium-ion battery fire on a Japan Airlines Co.-operated Dreamliner in Boston in January and that for an emergency landing of an ANA 787 later that month. Boeing last month submitted a proposed permanent solution for the battery problem to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to get the plane back in service. The plan will require extensive testing and approval before regulators end the plane’s grounding, the U.S.’s top aviation official said. “We can’t say if there was any connection between the circuit boards and the battery, but there have been lots of problems with the electrical system,” Kazuo Harigai, assistant secretary of the Japanese aviation workers’ union, sa</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1362582885896</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 10:14:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362582893761-37</Id><Topic><Title>FAA faces obstacles in approving Boeing Dreamliner fix</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362527803742</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 18:56:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing has made the 787 safer than any other plane model in the sky.

Given that neither the FAA nor the Japanese FAA have been able to figure out what the problem is from looking at the two damaged batteries, why hasn't the FAA required that every battery in all active 787s be removed, torn apart, and examined in order to see what is going on inside. If this were an auto company with a battery problem, they would have torn open thousands of batteries already. If some of the batteries are damaged then a solution can be found. If there is no battery damage on the other batteries, then the safety people could have more confidence with Boeing taking one type of solution or another. I simply do not understand why Boeing and the battery manufacturer have not had a major product recall. How could regulators not require a recall? Then the new batteries could be manufactured to super tight inspection and documentation and Boeing could put in some additional safety measures.</Msg><Username>thedeathrace</Username><Timestamp>1362587193505</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 11:26:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362587334193-50</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes 500 Rich List Acquiring BA Shares!</Title><Username>james.tingle</Username><Timestamp>1362414215788</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:23:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>warren's currently dumping his fed stimulated shares on the li'l people plenty to be had if you wanna increase your share of the maobowan depression (and price inflation)</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362587334193</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 11:28:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362587605389-51</Id><Topic><Title>Is BA too good to be true?</Title><Username>kristopherrobert</Username><Timestamp>1362575838751</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 08:17:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>is that you</Msg><Username>parke_armstrong</Username><Timestamp>1362587605389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 11:33:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362587641628-52</Id><Topic><Title>Why hasn't every operational Dreamliner battery been disassembled and examined?</Title><Username>thedeathrace</Username><Timestamp>1362587193505</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 11:26:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you should apply for a job with maobowa's unlimited gov't...he's looking for more know nothing know it alls.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362587641628</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 11:34:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362588136561-53</Id><Topic><Title>Our Dear Ruler Can Now Assassinate Americans Without Due Process.</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1362581017588</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 09:43:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>crapper err spaz err sparty err chrissie err maobowa err spaz err spazmo err censored blather weirdo</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1362588136561</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 11:42:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362588258070-54</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like Capitalism Hit an All Time High = Dow @ All Time High</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1362531587633</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 19:59:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>warren err spaz err sukers err fascist err censored err spaz err censoredspazMO err islaMOcensoredspazMO</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1362588258070</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 11:44:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362588915321-55</Id><Topic><Title>Analyst Downgrades The Boeing Company.

To believe, or not believe what somebody says, look at their record and that includes the management of companies. 2. The US Federal Aviation Administration voiced its concerns about the use of lithium ion batteries in an April 2007 proposed special condition. It’s now 2013 and Boeing is still trying to Band- fix the battery or a do a work around! The inept management is driving this half-fast solution and reflects poorly on the quality engineers and technicians that work at Boeing. At the time, the FAA said that the 787-8 would have "novel or unusual design features" and required, "additional safety standards that the [FAA] administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards". .The FAA cited three specific safety concerns about lithium ion batteries, which included overcharging, over-discharging and the potential flammability of cell components. 3. The FAA sets the global gold standard for the regulation of airlines. If they approve a "fix" that does nothing more than "contain" fires, and thus passengers will be getting on planes in which fires might occur, the FAA will loose all credibility. The NTSB said that passengers should have the expectation that they will be on planes without fires, contained or otherwise. This seems to be more than a little bit of shareholder stroking by the board. "We can get this fixed really fast everybody! If we don't, it isn't not our t fault, it's those pesky folks at the FAA." nice try Conner...blame it on the FAA if you don’t get approval for the FIX.. Nailed it would have been getting it right in the first place, just like the fuel system, braking system , control panel, wings, and tail assemblies. There is that old saying..when you are guilty, Obfuscate and blame the other party.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362589851211</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 12:10:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362590039558-59</Id><Topic><Title>"Get that Dreamfryer back in the air!

LOT Polish Airlines said Tuesday it will push ahead with compensation claims, and British carrier Thomson Airways indicated it wants Boeing to cover the refunds it promised passengers who were shunted onto older planes. LOT, the first European carrier to receive the Boeing 787, wants payment by the end of June, Poland Treasury Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski said. Thomson Airways said Dreamliner "We will ensure that we are adequately compensated for the situation we and our customers are facing," Thomson spokeswoman Grace Jones said. The Boeing 787 has been grounded worldwide since Jan. 16 as regulators investigate battery problems following a fire and an emergency landing. LOT is the first airline to publicly demand compensation from Boeing for the grounding. LOT said last month it has ditched the 787 from its summer plan The carrier may halt payments for the two 787s it has already taken until the compensation issue is resolved Norwegian Air Shuttle AS, another 787 customer-in-waiting, said Tuesday it has signed an agreement with Lisbon-based lessor HiFly to rent two Airbus SAS A340-300s, along with crews, to commence long-haul services if its Dreamliners are delayed. British Airways, which was due to receive 787s this year, also expects deliveries to be late.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362597760507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 14:22:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362597829593-85</Id><Topic><Title>Florida finds evidence of voter fraud by GOP-tied firm</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362592123965</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 12:48:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Both Florida and Ohio have Republican governors.

In the most serious case, which took place in April 2012, ANA found burns in the protection circuit and the breaker of an electric distribution panel during on-ground inspections after pilots received a generator-related bug message, ANA spokesman Etsuya Uchiyama said on Thursday. The company believes a foreign material entered the panel and caused the short circuit. The material is likely to have scattered and damaged the breaker, and ANA replaced the damaged panel, he said. "We believe this is not serious. Fire damage in electric distribution panels are also found in other types of aircraft, and it has no impact on safe operation of aircraft," he said. ANA, which is Japan's largest airline and the biggest operator of 787s worldwide, reported the case to Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau, Uchiyama said. The airline also replaced an electric distribution panel in June 2012 and exchanged parts in a panel in March 2012, he said. These two cases were not reported to the Civil Aviation Bureau. On Wednesday, the Japan Federation of Aviation Workers' Unions said ANA experienced short circuits in its 787 electric distribution panel at least five times between December 2011 and October 2012, citing ANA mechanics. Asked about the Federation's information, ANA's Uchiyama said the panel problems occurred three times, not five.

"I have made it very clear that I want a thorough review" of the Boeing plan, Mr. LaHood told The Wall Street Journal Wednesday. "I am going to ask a lot of questions" before a final decision is made. Mr. LaHood's comments are the latest sign that Boeing faces regulatory headwinds in getting quick approval for a package of fixes to the Dreamliner's battery system that it hopes will end the world-wide grounding of its flagship jetliner that started in mid-January.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362620685225</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 20:44:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362621582091-131</Id><Topic><Title>Socialist Vermin Hugo Chavez Has Died</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1362540768265</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 22:32:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I want to know who the HELL is Sean Penn anyway and why does he praise Hugo Chavez?

The President's final Sequestor meeting with leading republicans is a JOKE! Obama isn't looking for compromise! What's going to happen is that the President will come out of the meeting saying the sequestor is going to happen because republicans don't want to compromise on spending cuts. While all along the sequestor was the brainchild right out of the White House. After the meeting he'll report to the Lamestream Media that republicans were not willing to renegotiate spending cuts. Spending cuts which only amount to a paltry 2% of government spending. This isn't even a cut of the budget. It's a cut in the rate of government expansion. Even with the cuts, the rate of government will still increase over the previous year.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1362623037502</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 21:23:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362624217955-135</Id><Topic><Title>Lee joins Paul in talking filibuster against CIA nominee Brennan</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1362601900152</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 15:31:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Spart has it right.
