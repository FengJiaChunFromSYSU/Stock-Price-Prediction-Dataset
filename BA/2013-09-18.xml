Navy Yard shooting. A Nation In Distress Obama waived a provision in federal law specifically designed to keep the U.S. government from supplying firearms to terrorists such as al-Qaeda, according to the Washington Examiner. Citing his authority under the Arms Export Control Act, the president declared Monday that he would “waive the prohibitions in sections 40 and 40A of the AECA related to such a transaction.” No longer will Obama need to rely on the CIA to give free guns to Islamic extremists in Syria; now he will make the transfers openly with this “transparent government” initiative. On the same day as his overt approval for arms to al-Qaeda, Obama announced that he is drafting executive orders for more gun control. “We have gone about implementing the executive actions that were part of the president’s plan to take action to reduce gun violence,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said after the Navy Yard shooting. “Obviously, he continues to support measures taken by Congress — that could be taken by Congress to reduce gun violence in a common-sense way, like improving our background-check system.” In essence, Obama will act on his own to force firearm restrictions onto the American people and if Congress would like to join him later, they are welcome to do so. He already has allies in Congress drooling to disarm law-abiding citizens.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379484762575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 02:12:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379489403791-9</Id><Topic><Title>Where the heck is Waynedickenson aka Elonmusk?</Title><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1379463583817</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 20:19:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wayne You said you sold at $110 last week.

(AP) -- The first addition to the Boeing 787 family completed its maiden test flight Tuesday, taking off from Paine Field, near the factory where the plane was assembled, and landing in Seattle about five hours later. The flight took the 787-9 over Eastern Washington, where Boeing conducts a lot of flight testing. Several hundred Boeing employees watched the blue and white plane with a number 9 on the tail take off at about 11 a.m. in Everett. It landed at 4:18 p.m. at Boeing Field in Seattle. "This is about as close to a flawless first flight as I could have imagined," Mark Jenks, vice president of 787 development, told reporters at Boeing Field. Piloting the plane were Capt. Mike Bryan and Randy Neville, the Daily Herald of Everett reported. "We've got five more hours of gas left in there," Bryan said after the plane landed. "We'd still be flying if they hadn't told us to bring it back." The 787-9 is 20 feet longer and can seat 40 more passengers than the original 787-8, which carries between 210 and 250 passengers. The new version of the fuel-efficient, long-haul wide-body known as the Dreamliner also can carry more cargo and fly farther, Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bergman said. The 787-9 has 388 firm orders, which account for 40 percent of all 787 orders, Bergman said. After flight tests and certification, the first 787-9 will be delivered next June to the launch customer, Air New Zealand. The original 787-8 was delivered in September 2011, nearly three years late because of production problems. The worldwide fleet of about 50 planes was grounded for almost four months this year after lithium batteries smoldered on two planes in January. The redesigned battery system, which resolves the overheating problems, is built into the 787-9. Boeing plans another stretch with the 787-10. That plane would seat between 300 and 330 passengers.</Msg><Username>cutthemoffnow</Username><Timestamp>1379495696519</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 05:14:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379504338764-11</Id><Title>On 9/11 ...in 490 BC</Title><Msg>The Athenians defeated the Persian King Darius at the Battle of Marathon....and won FREEDOM for western Civilization ........9/11 keeps showing up again and again in history as a pivitol point for liberty in World History...the New World Order believes it has reversed the trend</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379504338764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 07:38:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379504538154-12</Id><Topic><Title>Congratulations Boeing investors!</Title><Username>maramwp</Username><Timestamp>1379452480595</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 17:14:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Congrats</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1379504538154</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 07:42:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379504619878-13</Id><Topic><Title>150$ will come..</Title><Username>osulin_11</Username><Timestamp>1379438645282</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 13:24:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lets get to 120 first......nice thought</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1379504619878</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 07:43:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379509992831-14</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: The Second Amendment Only Applies to Al-Qaeda</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379484762575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 02:12:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Congress just voted on a United Nations Amendment on gun control on the notion it will control violence at nations borders. 46 congressmen, or congress folks voted to give up our 2nd Amendment rights to the UN....guess what party the 46 belonged to?

The fine line that the retailer is walking to address the concerns of both gun rights and gun control advocates reflects how heated the issue has become, particularly in light of recent mass shootings. Most states allow people to openly carry licensed guns in some way and many companies do not have laws banning firearms in their stores. But Starbucks has become a target for gun control advocates, in part because of its liberal-leaning corporate image. In turn, gun rights advocates have been galvanized by the company's decision to defer to local laws. In an interview, CEO Howard Schultz said the decision to ask customers to stop bringing guns into stores came as a result of the growing frequency of "Starbucks Appreciation Days," in which gun rights advocates turned up at Starbucks cafes with firearms. Schultz said the events mischaracterized the company's stance on the issue and the demonstrations "have made our customers uncomfortable." Schultz hopes people will honor the request not to bring in guns but says the company will nevertheless serve those who do. "We will not ask you to leave," he said.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1379510631886</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 09:23:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379511142149-18</Id><Title>YOU SNOOZE YOU LOOZE ;-)</Title><Msg>BUY BUY BUY !!!!!

Despite some marginally positive news on medium-term deficits -- Kevin has more here -- our long-term debts and obligations are dangerously unsustainable. The Associated Presssummarizes CBO's core findings: A new government study says federal health care and retirement programs are threatening to overwhelm the federal budget and harm the economy in coming decades unless Washington finds the political will to restrain their growth. The Congressional Budget Office report says government spending on health care and Social Security would double, relative to the size of the economy, in 25 years and that spending on other programs like defense, transportation and education would decline to its smallest level by the same measure since the Great Depression. The report is one of a series by the agency and other budget watchdogs warning that spiraling long-term debt threatens to crowd out private investment, raise interest rates and limit Washington's ability to respond to a financial crisis.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1379511683641</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 09:41:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379511774419-21</Id><Title>President pushes for MORE debt...</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will appeal to business leaders on Wednesday to urge Congress to approve an increase in the U.S. debt limit and avoid a default that is possible as early as mid-October. Obama is to address the Business Roundtable as part of a renewed push to focus on domestic budget and economic issues after a month dominated by foreign policy. The U.S. Treasury is expected to exhaust measures to avoid exceeding the $16.7 trillion debt limit as soon as mid-October. If the cap is not raised, the United States will not be able to pay all of its bills and would go into default. Obama will tell business leaders that they should pile pressure on Congress, which must vote to increase U.S. borrowing capacity, to avoid a default.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1379511774419</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 09:42:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379512692068-22</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: The Second Amendment Only Applies to Al-Qaeda</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379484762575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 02:12:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Notice that Hoozdik or the Raven or the rest of the background singers have nothing to say about this...because there is NO DEFENSE to giving our enemies weapons at tax payer expense and taking away the guns of red blooded americans.......When I say they are Anti american...its not hyperbolie or innacurate...there is another word and its starts with a T</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379512692068</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 09:58:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379513701684-23</Id><Topic><Title>YOU SNOOZE YOU LOOZE ;-)</Title><Username>cutthemoffnow</Username><Timestamp>1379511142149</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 09:32:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IT"S SO SWEET$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1379513701684</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 10:15:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379513754829-24</Id><Topic><Title>Congratulations Boeing investors!</Title><Username>maramwp</Username><Timestamp>1379452480595</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 17:14:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WHY THANK YOU$$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1379513754829</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 10:15:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379513944870-25</Id><Topic><Title>Congratulations Boeing investors!</Title><Username>maramwp</Username><Timestamp>1379452480595</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 17:14:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Captain said he still had about 5 more hours of fuel after 5 hours of flying but was told the bring the plane back!!

Since the last time I wrote about Boeing last May, the company's share price has appreciated by 70%. Currently, the company trades at an all-time high share price. While there is no such thing as a "sure" or "safe" investment, Boeing has been as close to being sure as a stock could ever get and the investors are likely to continue getting rewarded in this company. There are several reasons why Boeing has been such a great investment. First, the airline fleets in the developed world have been getting old and many planes needed to be replaced. Second, several countries decided to upgrade their air force equipment due to increased tensions in many parts of the world. Third, several countries including but not limited to China saw their economies grow rapidly, increasing air travel within those countries. Fourth, the newer planes are much more fuel-efficient than the older planes, which urged many airline companies to get their hands on these newer planes in order to save on their biggest and most volatile cost item, which is fuel. Fifth, Boeing has been enjoying a large backlog, which serves to guarantee the company revenues for many years to come. Sixth, the barrier of entry in the airplane manufacturing industry is very high and it is very difficult for competition to emerge unlike other markets such as the smartphone market where a new competition pops up from Asia every week. These five reasons, along with many others, have made and will continue to make Boeing a great investment for years to come. In order to address some of the strong demand and the ever-growing backlog, Boeing decided to increase some of its production capacity. Recently, the company announced that it would invest $35 million to increase its capacity at Helena, Montana. The new investment will add 55,000 square feet to the existing manufacturing site and it will be responsible for ramping up production of the company's 787-10 model. When a company is aggressively investing into additional manufacturing capacity in order to address a growing demand, you know that it is a good investment. Boeing continues to receive orders from both commercial and military customers. A couple weeks ago, it was announced that South Korea was ready to spend $7.64 billion on upgrading some of its fighter aircraft and Boeing is expected to win the bid since it is the only company whose offer was within the budget eligibility limits. Regardless of whether a global or local war occurs, Boeing will continue to sell aircraft to many nations across the world because countries don't want to be caught off guard, especially at a time tensions are high and global terrorism is on the rise. Putting politics aside, a possible U.S. intervention in Syria or Iran (or both) would be very beneficial to the business of Boeing. In China, Boeing is expecting to see a lot of growth. In fact, the company will be delivering 120 planes in the country, which is up 50% from last year's 80 planes. The Chinese air traffic volume is expected to increase in double-digits for the rest of the decade (and possibly beyond) and Boeing is one of the biggest players in the country. If the merger between US Airways (LCC) and American Airlines (AAMRQ.PK) gets approved, the combined airline will be replacing many of its older planes with newer planes in order to maximize its efficiency. Keep in mind that the combined airline will be the largest airline in the U.S. by volume and Boeing can expect a large number of orders from this new airline if the merger goes through. If the merger doesn't go through, the number of new plane orders will be a little smaller, but both US Airways and American Airlines will still need to order a lot of new planes to replace a significant portion of their fleet that is getting older. The analysts are very optimistic for the company's future. For example, Sterne Agee increased its target price from $120 to $164 and the newly upgraded number represents 12 times the company's expected free cash flow in 2015. In fact, out of the 21 analysts covering the stock, 16 rate it as "strong buy," and 1 rates it as "buy," whereas 4 analysts see the company as "hold." There are no analysts that see the company as a "sell" despite its strong run up in the last year and half. Even though Boeing's trailing P/E ratio of 21 is slightly over the market average of 19, the company's growth rate is much bigger than the average growth rate of the S&amp;P 500 index. In the next few years, the companies in the S&amp;P 500 index are expected to grow at a mid-single digit rate, and Boeing will continue to grow in double digits. In the last 12 months, Boeing earned $5.48 per share, and the company is expected to earn $6.50 per share this year, followed by $7.27 per share in 2014, $8.31 in 2015 and $9.01 in 2016. The company currently pays $2 per share in annual dividends and its current earnings can easily support this number. In fact, I would be really surprised if Boeing didn't increase its dividend payments to at least $3 per share (corresponding to a payout ratio of less than 50% for this year) in the next few years. Boeing continues to be a great investment for both growth investors as well as those that are looking for a relatively stable blue-chip company. At this point, Boeing has both fundamentals and momentum going for it. In fact, I wish the company saw a correction or pullback so that I could load up on more shares, but I don't see that happening anytime soon unless the market itself sees a major pullback or a correction.</Msg><Username>cutthemoffnow</Username><Timestamp>1379517192814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 11:13:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379518657239-34</Id><Topic><Title>Hooz' AR-15 Post is False</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1379456333654</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 18:18:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If it were not false it wouldn't have been posted by HOOZ!

But now, deep in his fifth year in office, Mr. Obama finds himself frustrated by members of his own party weary of his leadership and increasingly willing to defy him. In recent weeks, disgruntled Democrats, particularly liberals, have bolted from the White House on issues like National Security Agency surveillance policies, a planned military strike on Syria and the potential choice of Lawrence H. Summers to lead the Federal Reserve. In private, they often sound exasperated describing Mr. Obama’s operation; in public, they are sometimes only a little more restrained. They complain the White House has not consulted enough and failed to assert leadership. They say Mr. Obama has been too passive and ceded momentum to Republicans. Their grievances are sometimes contradictory; some grouse that he takes on causes he cannot win, while others say he does not fight hard enough for principled positions. The failure to enact tightened gun control laws and the Republican hold on immigration legislation have left liberals little to celebrate this year.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1379521041731</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 12:17:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379521050962-37</Id><Topic><Title>Obviously a righteous shooting (if you are a George Zimmerman fan)</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1379465852312</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-17 20:57:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Zimmerman fired one shot.</Msg><Username>bdbaca99</Username><Timestamp>1379521050962</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 12:17:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379521082092-38</Id><Topic><Title>BA Market Cap - 88 Billion</Title><Username>censored53</Username><Timestamp>1379512474384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 09:54:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Somewhat out of date.

The report, by staffers for Rep. Darrell E. Issa, California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, quoted two Internal Revenue Service officials saying the tea party applications were singled out in the targeting program that has the agency under investigation because “they were likely to attract media attention.” In the report, the investigators do not find evidence that IRS employees received orders from politicians to target the tea party, and agency officials deny overt bias or political motives. But the report says the IRS was at least taking cues from political leaders and designed special policies to review tea party applications, including dispatching some of them to Washington to be vetted by headquarters. “As prominent politicians publicly urged the IRS to take action on tax-exempt groups engaged in legal campaign intervention activities, the IRS treated tea party applications differently,” the staff report concludes. “Applications filed by tea party groups were identified and grouped due to media attention surrounding the existence of the tea party in general.” That finding contradicts Democrats on Capitol Hill, who argue that some liberal groups also were given special scrutiny, thus showing there was neither a witch hunt for conservatives nor political pressure from the White House.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople3</Username><Timestamp>1379534957051</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 16:09:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379535122087-94</Id><Topic><Title>BA WILL CLOSE IN THE RED TODAY !!!!!-----------$112 BY FRIDAY</Title><Username>qqqqqqqt</Username><Timestamp>1379529634175</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 14:40:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Watch what???

Americans, generally speaking, did not want it when it was proposed. We didn’t want socialized healthcare when Ted Kennedy championed it, we didn’t want it when Hillary Clinton pushed it, we didn’t want it after the anointed savior of socialism arose to power and helped shove the disastrous Affordable Care Act down the throats of Americans. Americans voiced their vehement dislike for Obamacare then, and still our “leaders,” those who we charged with representing our voices in Congress, pushed ahead. Now, here we are years later and Americans still don’t want it. In fact, those who championed the healthcare overhaul are jumping ship. The AFL-CIO and other unions are voicing their discontent. Congress has exempted itself from the requirements. They passed the bill (presumably to “see what’s in it”) over our loud objections and as it becomes remarkably fiscally unstable, they have backed away from it. It’s good enough for us, for our families, for the millions of Americans who are likely to abuse the system, but it’s not good enough for the elites in Washington.

People are most emotionally vulnerable following a tragedy and politicians being the headline seeking #$%$ that they are run to the microphone to try to shape the opinions of the emotionally distraught. For instance Sandy Hook was used by some pols and writers at the Washington Post to indict white males as the key demographic of mass murderer. They completely disregarded/avoided the fact that a sub group of Millennials with mental issues/drug use are the largest demographic for mass murder because it would be politically incorrect. Of course now we have a Black mass murderer so there goes the "White males are the problem" meme. Pols and media still however do not want to address the 800 pound mental disorder gorilla staring them in the face with these mass murders and instead point the finger at the NRA and gun manufacturers.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1379536846939</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 16:40:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379537236945-101</Id><Topic><Title>BA WILL CLOSE IN THE RED TODAY !!!!!-----------$112 BY FRIDAY</Title><Username>qqqqqqqt</Username><Timestamp>1379529634175</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 14:40:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good call Wayne, it did close in the red for the shorts</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1379537236945</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 16:47:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379537393545-102</Id><Topic><Title>It’s Time for Legislators to Hear the People: We Don’t Want Obamacare… Period</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople3</Username><Timestamp>1379535328370</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 16:15:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I come to this board because I still have 8300 shares of Boeing, I sold the other half over the past 3 weeks.

Source: FBI Uniform Crime Reports. As the graph above highlights, according to the latest figures obtained by the FBI, violent crime offenses in the United States have been falling since 2007. The five year trend clearly shows that, despite there being an ongoing national debate about gun violence in America, violent crime itself is actually becoming less of a problem. The graph below from the Department of Justice also highlights the fact that over the last 40 years, the amount of guns in America per 1000 people has increased, whereas serious violent crimes have decreased. In addition, despite the media drumbeat that murders involving guns represent the number one safety threat to American citizens, the reality is completely the opposite. Amongst the “top ten killers” in the United States, homicide by firearms is at the bottom of the list, according to figures from the CDC and the FBI. Almost 20 times more people die in the United States from medical errors than they do from firearm homicides, but there is no outcry to slap draconian regulations on the medical industry. In addition, the number of murders committed with hammers and clubs in the United States routinely outpaces the number of homicides committed using a rifle. Should US lawmakers introduce urgent legislation to outlaw hammers and baseball bats? The figures clearly illustrate that rising gun ownership does not cause a rise in violent crime.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379553145033</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 21:12:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379553170875-130</Id><Topic><Title>FBI's onw Statistics Prove: More Guns, Less Crime</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379553145033</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 21:12:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look at Chicago, which in 1982 passed a ban on all handguns except for those registered with the city before the ban was enacted. Since the handgun ban took effect, the number of murders in Chicago committed using handguns has been 40% higher than before the ban, and has spiked even higher in recent years, proving that the gun ban actually served to cause an increase in violent crime. In comparison, let’s take a look at Britain, which has some of the strictest gun control laws in the developed world. Given that one of the most vocal advocates for gun control in the aftermath of Sandy Hook has been a British citizen – Piers Morgan – who has used his platform on CNN to attack the second amendment, the contrast is illuminating. Despite the fact that it is virtually impossible for an average citizen to obtain a gun through legal channels in Britain, the rate of violent crime in the UK is higher per capita than the US and the highest in the world amongst “rich” countries aside from Australia, which also instituted a draconian gun ban in the 1990′s. Preventing law-abiding people from owning guns clearly has no impact on violent crime, and if anything causes it to rise because the criminals know their victims will not be able to defend themselves. In addition, you are more than twice as likely to be a victim of knife crime in the UK than you are a victim of gun crime in the United States, but there is no media debate about banning kitchen knives. Despite virtually all handguns being outlawed in 1996 following the Dunblane school massacre in Scotland, with law-abiding people people rushing to turn in their firearms, over the next decade gun crime in the UK more than doubled. This proves that while law-abiding citizens willingly disarmed themselves, criminals were unfazed by the new laws and continued to use guns illegally. Therefore gun control only disarms innocent people since criminals do not follow the law. As the Wall Street Journal recently noted, “Strict gun laws in Great Britain and Australia haven’t made their people noticeably safer, nor have they prevented massacres.” In summary, despite a widespread ban on gun ownership in the United Kingdom, it is the most dangerous place to live in terms of violent crime in the entire western world.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379553170875</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 21:12:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379555130390-131</Id><Title>25 fast facts about the New World Order/ Federal Reserve that everyone should know</Title><Msg>#1 The greatest period of economic growth in U.S. history was when there was no central bank. #2 The United States never had a persistent, ongoing problem with inflation until the Federal Reserve was created. In the century before the Federal Reserve was created, the average annual rate of inflation was about half a percent. In the century since the Federal Reserve was created, the average annual rate of inflation has been about 3.5 percent, and it would be even higher than that if the inflation numbers were not being so grossly manipulated. #3 Even using the official numbers, the value of the U.S. dollar has declined by more than 95 percent since the Federal Reserve was created nearly 100 years ago. #4 The secret November 1910 gathering at Jekyll Island, Georgia during which the plan for the Federal Reserve was hatched was attended by U.S. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Department A.P. Andrews and a whole host of representatives from the upper crust of the Wall Street banking establishment. #5 In 1913, Congress was promised that if the Federal Reserve Act was passed that it would eliminate the business cycle. #6 The following comes directly from the Fed's official mission statement: "To provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. Over the years, its role in banking and the economy has expanded." #7 It was not an accident that a permanent income tax was also introduced the same year when the Federal Reserve system was established. The whole idea was to transfer wealth from our pockets to the federal government and from the federal government to the bankers. #8 Within 20 years of the creation of the Federal Reserve, the U.S. economy was plunged into the Great Depression. #9 If you can believe it, there have been 10 different economic recessions since 1950.

The following is a list of loan recipients that was taken directly from page 131 of the report... Citigroup - $2.513 trillion Morgan Stanley - $2.041 trillion Merrill Lynch - $1.949 trillion Bank of America - $1.344 trillion Barclays PLC - $868 billion Bear Sterns - $853 billion Goldman Sachs - $814 billion Royal Bank of Scotland - $541 billion JP Morgan Chase - $391 billion Deutsche Bank - $354 billion UBS - $287 billion Credit Suisse - $262 billion Lehman Brothers - $183 billion Bank of Scotland - $181 billion BNP Paribas - $175 billion Wells Fargo - $159 billion Dexia - $159 billion Wachovia - $142 billion Dresdner Bank - $135 billion Societe Generale - $124 billion "All Other Borrowers" - $2.639 trillion #11 The Federal Reserve also paid those big banks $659.4 million in fees to help "administer" those secret loans. #12 The Federal Reserve has created approximately 2.75 trillion dollars out of thin air and injected it into the financial system over the past five years. This has allowed the stock market to soar to unprecedented heights, but it has also caused our financial system to become extremely unstable. #13 We were told that the purpose of quantitative easing is to help "stimulate the economy", but today the Federal Reserve is actually paying the big banks not to lend out 1.8 trillion dollars in "excess reserves" that they have parked at the Fed. #14 Quantitative easing overwhelming benefits those that own stocks and other financial investments. In other words, quantitative easing overwhelmingly favors the very wealthy. Even Barack Obama has admitted that 95 percent of the income gains since he has been president have gone to the top one percent of income earners. #15 The gap between the top one percent and the rest of the country is now the greatest that it has been since the 1920s. #16 The Federal Reserve has argued vehemently in federal court that it is "not an agency" of the federal government and therefore not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. #17 The Federal Reserve openly admits that the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks are organized "much like private corporations". #18 The regional Federal Reserve banks issue shares of stock to the "member banks" that own them. #19 The Federal Reserve system greatly favors the biggest banks. Back in 1970, the five largest U.S. banks held 17 percent of all U.S. banking industry assets. Today, the five largest U.S. banks hold 52 percent of all U.S. banking industry assets. #20 The Federal Reserve is supposed to "regulate" the big banks, but it has done nothing to stop a 441 trillion dollar interest rate derivatives bubble from inflating which could absolutely devastate our entire financial system. #21 The Federal Reserve was designed to be a perpetual debt machine. The bankers that designed it intended to trap the U.S. government in a perpetual debt spiral from which it could never possibly escape. Since the Federal Reserve was established nearly 100 years ago, the U.S. national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger. #22 The U.S. government will spend more than 400 billion dollars just on interest on the national debt this year. #23 If the average rate of interest on U.S. government debt rises to just 6 percent (and it has been much higher than that in the past), we will be paying out more than a trillion dollars a year just in interest on the national debt. #24 According to Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Congress is the one that is supposed to have the authority to "coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures". So exactly why is the Federal Reserve doing it? #25 There are plenty of possible alternative financial systems, but at this point all 187 nations that belong to the IMF have a central bank. Are we supposed to believe that this is just some sort of a bizarre coincidence?</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379555173632</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 21:46:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379555951493-133</Id><Topic><Title>25 fast facts about the New World Order/ Federal Reserve that everyone should know</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379555130390</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 21:45:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cut/pasted from info wars.
