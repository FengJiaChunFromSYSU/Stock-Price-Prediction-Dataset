Yes, during the waning portion of the Bush administration but also at the time when it was patently obvious that Obama was going to win the upcoming 2008 election. People will flock to withdraw their money because they lose confidence in the banking system. That is dangerous because there is never enough cash to satisfy the deposits. The money is tied up in loans and investments - which are fundamental trusts, the operative term is "trust". While equity is a portion of the financial equation so also is emotion. If you are an investor, do you rush out and liquidate before or after the looming crisis? Of course, before. Thus, there is a competition between investors - at all levels - to exit a collapsing economic system. If in Sept 2008, the people anticipated something good from Obama, and knowing that he was the likely winner of the election, why did the negative emotion in the market swing into a peak? At all levels. Thus the massive layoffs and the tepid consumer spending and the financial institution bailouts. You think that Obama is a "gift" from Heaven. I don't see it that way. We certainly get what we deserve and that is what has been always true for all societies since the beginning. Obama didn't "calm" the financial crisis, he borrowed money, heavily, many trillions of dollars, to buy time. But the Obama Borrowing Binge Bubble will burst, likely we along with it.

Job losses "peaked" in December at 800K but started out at zero in Jan 2008. Bush was in office for seven years prior. Why didn't massive job losses start years earlier? A major step-function in job losses occurred in Aug/Sep 2008. I could easily say that that corresponds well to my previous post and likely is related job loss/financial crisis/Obama upcoming win. Now I know that you would dispute it, but neither you nor I can prove it one way or the other. What is true is that the economy has not recovered under Obama by any substantial measure - or at all. It was at about 8% unemployment when he came in and will be that we when he leaves. Basically, he did nothing.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1346777868006</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 12:57:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346778031004-30</Id><Title>Obamaville... Food Stamp President! Shameful.</Title><Msg>Food-Stamp Use Climbs To Record, Reviving Campaign Issue By Alan Bjerga - Sep 4, 2012 12:27 PM ET Food-stamp use reached a record 46.7 million people in June, the government said, as Democrats prepare to nominate President Barack Obama for a second term with the economy as a chief issue in the campaign. Participation was up 0.4 percent from May and 3.3 percent higher than a year earlier and has remained greater than 46 million all year as the unemployment rate stayed higher than 8 percent. New jobless numbers will be released Sept. 7. “Too many middle-class families who have fallen on hard times are still struggling,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in an e-mailed statement today. “Our goal is to get these families the temporary assistance they need so they are able to get through these tough times and back on their feet as soon as possible.” Food-stamp spending, which has more than doubled in four years to a record $75.7 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2011, is the USDA’s biggest annual expense. Republicans in Congress have criticized the cost of the program, and the House budget plan approved in April sponsored by Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the party’s vice-presidential nominee, would cut expenses by $33 billion over 10 years. Cuts Planned Reductions to the program have also emerged as a point of contention in debate over a farm bill to replace current law that expires Sept. 30. The U.S. Senate in June passed a plan that would lower expenditures by $4 billion over 10 years, while the House Agriculture Committee the following month backed a $16 billion cut. During the Republican primary campaign, then-candidate Newt Gingrich labeled Obama as “the best food-stamp president in American history.” When the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called his statements “inaccurate” and “divisive,” Gingrich dismissed the complaints as a smear from “modern liberals” who are “off the deep end.” Food-stamp enrollment is rising partly because the USDA is pushing higher participation too aggressively, giving government money to people who may not need or want it, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions said in a telephone interview. ‘Government Incompetence’ “This administration has been hawking food stamps,” said the Alabama Republican, who has called for lower spending on the program. “Every additional dollar in this program is borrowed money,” he said. “It’s one more example of government incompetence.” Today’s report shows the two most populous states, California and Texas, had the most recipients. California was tops with 4.012 million, a 0.8 percent gain from the previous month and 7.3 percent more than the previous year. Texas was in second place, while down 0.4 percent from the previous month and 1.4 percent lower than a year earlier. Louisiana and North Carolina, where Democrats are convening this week to renominate Obama, had the biggest monthly gains in enrollment, 1.3 percent. Enrollment fell the most in Utah, down 1.4 percent from May, followed by Idaho and Ohio. Spending on what’s officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program totaled $6.21 billion in June, 0.4 percent higher than the previous month and 2.8 percent more than a year earlier. The record is $6.26 billion spent in September 2011.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346778031004</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 13:00:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346778433547-31</Id><Title>Obama an Absolute Failure..

Fifty-two percent of likely voters say the nation is in “worse condition” now than in September 2008, while 54 percent say Obama does not deserve reelection based solely on his job performance. Only 31 percent of voters believe the nation is in “better condition,” while 15 percent say it is “about the same,” the poll found. Just 40 percent of voters said Obama deserves reelection. The results highlight the depth of voter dissatisfaction confronting Obama as he makes his case for a second term at this week’s Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. They also strongly suggest Democrats need to convince voters the election should be a choice between Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney, rather than a referendum on the president. Obama’s biggest problem remains voter unhappiness with his handling of the economy.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346778433547</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 13:07:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346779166294-32</Id><Title>Obama, the "Incomplete" and Incompetent President!</Title><Msg>11 News Anchor Dianne Derby Interviews President Obama It's President Obama's second trip to Colorado within a week and I had a chance to ask him a few questions before he took the stage at CU-Boulder.

We've recovered 4.5 million jobs since that time and half a million manufacturing jobs and here in Colorado you've seen sort of progress in areas like wind energy, for example, and clean energy where because of the investments we've made you're starting to see companies people being hired. Dianne Derby: Your party says you inherited a bad situation. You've had three and a half years to fix it. What grade would you give yourself so far for doing that? President Obama: You know I would say incomplete...but what I would say is the steps that we have taken in saving the auto industry, in making sure that college is more affordable and investing in clean energy and science and technology and research, those are all the things that we are going to need to grow over the long term. Dianne Derby: Thank you, Sir. President Obama: Thank you, enjoyed it.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346779166294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 13:19:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346780018952-33</Id><Title>Obama Stiffs Israel...

The new platform represents another shift by the Obama Democrats toward the Palestinian position on key issues in the peace process. For Jerusalem, the new platform has been brought into line with the Obama administration’s policy of not recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and supporting its division. Jerusalem is unmentioned in the 2012 document, whereas the 2008 and 2004 Democratic Party platforms declared “Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel…It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.” The Obama administration’s refusal to recognize Jerusalem has been a point of significant controversy in recent months. On the issue of Palestinian refugees, the new document has removed language from the 2004 and 2008 platforms specifying that Palestinian “refugees” should be settled in a future Palestinian state, not in Israel.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346780018952</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 13:33:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346781503688-34</Id><Topic><Title>Awful and Soul-Crushing: Honey Boo Boo Vs.

In other words, spending has grown 64% faster when a Republican sits in the White House than when a Democrat does. During the 20 years Democrats have controlled both houses of Congress, spending has grown at an average rate of 1.84% per year, more than double the average rate of 0.89% per year during the six years the GOP ran Congress. (During the other eight years, when control of Congress was split between the two parties, spending grew at an average rate of 2.52%. The split-control years all occurred during Republican presidencies.) When Democrats controlled the White House plus both houses of Congress, spending grew at 1.70% per year, slightly below the average growth rate of 1.83% for the entire period. The slowest spending growth occurred when a Democrat sat in the White House and Republicans controlled both houses of Congress. Spending rose by an average of just 0.89% during the six years of this situation, which all occurred with Bill Clinton as president and Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House. During the 14 years Republicans controlled the White House and Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, spending grew at an average annual rate of 1.92%. During the eight years with a Republican president and a split Congress, spending grew at 2.54% per year.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1346783417017</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:30:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346783598782-38</Id><Topic><Title>I love Obama</Title><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1346721127841</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 21:12:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where did I say that?

Some things are better, such as job security, lending conditions and the stability of the overall economy. But there are fewer jobs, incomes have fallen and average net worth has plummeted. If things are better for the majority of Americans, it's only at the margins. But some Americans are indisputably better off--and the man who hopes to unseat Obama is one of them. As a member of the investor class, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has benefited directly from one of the few developments under Obama that has been unambiguously positive.

So while korea got their plane the Boeing shareholders lost .42% and apple shareholders made 1.47%. for the year Boeing is down over 3% and apple shareholders are up over 66% der do the math . If you trade your opinion on boeing instead of the stock price then you have lost over 3% while apple shareholders have gained over 66% and have beat Boeing shareholders all the way for the last 15 years der !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1346811448636</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 22:17:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346812364592-107</Id><Topic><Title>this is how Obama thinks....if we can get 51% of Americans on Welfare we win. and thats how Obama wants America</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1346806419497</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 20:53:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It would be a short lived victory.</Msg><Username>zombiegrunt</Username><Timestamp>1346812364592</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 22:32:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346812918454-108</Id><Topic><Title>I love Obama</Title><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1346721127841</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 21:12:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>His core policy is to give government money to his freinds.
