To achieve this they choose to use a raked wingtip instead of a winglet, the raked tip introduces less torsional loads then a winglet for the same virtual span increase. The result is that Boeing can design a less stiff wing as they have less torsion loads from the wingtip device. To profit from the less stiff wing B can not have the normal aileron being used as high speed aileron, they have a separate high speed aileron directly behind the engine. This loads the wing less in torsion when engaged, thus avoiding the dangerous aileron reversal phenomenon when using an outboard aileron at high speed on a torsionally weak wing. The drawback of an inboard high speed aileron is that it interrupts the flap line when starting and landing. B has mitigated most of that by letting it work as a flaperon during these flight phases. Airbus The Airbus philosophy is to have an uninterrupted flap line from body to outboard high speed aileron (the aileron is split in two, inner and outer where the both are used for low speed and only the inner at high speed). This requires a somewhat stiffer wing because of the high speed aileron placement. When you have this stiffer wing you can also use a non planar wingtip device, ie a winglet. The secondary effect is less wing-flex</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1371442119869</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 00:08:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371442638677-2</Id><Topic><Title>From Fox News to Rush: Secrets of the right’s lie machine</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371416744907</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 17:05:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>freedom of speech really scares you people.

I vote that no matter how good Boeing does it will not catch up that gap. I vote that as the pattern continues it is more probable that Airbus will continue to pull away and be better than Boeing stock price . I watched the reason for the stock price speak today, Mcnerney,, he had a good interview for him, meaning he did not do a spartacus9991 like poor boy smack down with Airbus like he does with me like the dog he is. However McNerney spun a lot, he is reaping the rewards now on the 787, nope, he is buried under excessive debt , 30 billion and no, he has not applied the composite technology to the 777, and the best commentary was when the interviewer asked about an aerospace analyst conclusion that Boeing was too costly and risky a stock to go with considering the low profit margins and suggested Boeing was not a stock to buy and hold. Well yes, I agree with that question, as I have said ACAD for 1 year is up 1289% and 315% YTD% and TSLA gained 100% in 15 days last month, and SCTY city is up 204% year to date. for the risk those 3 stocks have made me a lot more money than Boeing in a short time. I can sell any day I want just like if I held Boeing so going with Boeing to me, seems not the best stock choice .I have said many times there are better dow stocks this year by far than Boeing and I have posted their names too. thanks for the vote if your being serious and not sarcastic Wayne</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371468295725</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 07:24:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371468605655-36</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing executive sees 100-200 international tanker sales</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1371468080967</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 07:21:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing was working closely with the U.S. Air Force to respond to strong international demand for the planes.

"At a conference held in Baton Rouge at the end of May, called at Large and aimed to attract black conservatives, black Democrat Elbert Guillary, a member of the state legislature, announced that he was switching party and becoming a Republican. Less than two weeks later, just up the road in Central City, Louisiana, black Democrat city councilman Ralph Washington – who attended this same at Large conference, made the same announcement – he’s becoming a Republican. It’s really not such a mystery. The mystery is why this is not happening more often. I’m asked all the time why, when it is so clear that blacks are damaged by the left wing political agenda, black voters so uniformly and consistently support candidates – Democrats – who advance this agenda. My answer is that Republicans need to start acting more like the businesspeople they claim to be. Any businessman convinced that his product is the best doesn't blame customers for not buying it. He doubles down on his efforts to understand these potential customers better and how to sell to them." This gives white people hope.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371477475380</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:57:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371477649862-52</Id><Topic><Title>Sarah Palin Rocks</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371475914453</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:31:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's illuminating how the left will viciously attack, insult and belittle anyone who dares tell the truth.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371477649862</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 10:00:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371477821304-53</Id><Title>USAA INSURANCE CON = If your house is destroyed, USAA pays nothing up front (full payment option), they low bid you, you must re-build, then they nickel and dime you!!!!!!

Bryant, who tells his own story about leaving the left-wing black establishment in his new film “Runaway Slave.”C.L. Bryant was president of the NAACP chapter in Garland, Texas, but his relationship with the NAACP soured when he refused to speak at a Planned Parenthood pro-abortion event. His eyes began to open and see that his traditional Christian values – protecting the unborn and promoting the traditional family, individual freedom, and dignity – were out of whack with the political agenda blacks were automatically signing onto. Elbert Guillary is now the first black Republican in the Louisiana state legislature since reconstruction. Listen to him to understand why a conservative black leaves the Democratic Party. He called the Democrats “the party of disappointment” and expressed disillusionment with Democratic policies on abortion, gun control, education, and immigration. Democrats “have moved away from the traditional values of most Americans,” he said. “Their policies have encouraged high teen birth rates, high high school drop-out rates, high incarceration rates, and very high unemployment rates.” Or listen to now-Republican councilman Washington: “…the value system I was raised up with, it really doesn’t side with the Democrats...Some of the things I see happening today, with the entitlement programs, we have to change. We can’t continue doing the things we are doing and survive.” Everyone understands that black American history is unique and complicated. But wallowing in the past is never an answer to anyone’s personal challenges. The challenge is clarifying right from wrong and acting accordingly moving forward. It has always seemed pretty clear to me that traditional values and personal freedom and responsibility must be the agenda moving forward for every American of every background. Black Americans, like every American, need less taxes taken out of their paychecks, need to be able to choose where to send their children to school, need to be able to pick freely a health care plan that suits their needs, and need to save for retirement instead of paying payroll taxes. You can’t sum it up any better than what Elbert Guillary and Ralph Washington have said. There are many, many Guillarys and Washingtons out there in black America. We need more efforts like the AT Large conference to reach them.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371478416429</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 10:13:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371478575989-55</Id><Topic><Title>ANOTHER new HIGH $103.30$$$$</Title><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1371476044666</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:34:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing will announce some Orders then will Hit some more new Highs this week$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1371478575989</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 10:16:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371479146634-56</Id><Topic><Title>Why the Left Wing Loons Hate the TEA Party</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371476135330</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:35:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Makes sense......you have to wonder why they have so much hatred for a group that only wants lower taxes, a smaller federal government and for law makers to obey the constitution.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371479146634</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 10:25:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371479347651-57</Id><Topic><Title>Paris Air Show- Vote on Boeing vs Airbus Stock Price</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371247771854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 18:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Freeveritas, actually Boeing gives a discount to the customer Airlines to keep the orders secret until Boeing wants the announcement made. the airline customers are only too glad to save some money on the cost of the plane and usually will do this for Boeing.

Replacing black fathers with welfare and sending the signal to black men there's no need to accept responsibility for contributing sperm to women they're not married to. Here's a good example of what Democrat policies are doing to damage black children and their image of fatherhood. “Catholic ministry workers were reaching out to male inmates in a prison, and when Mother’s Day came, they asked the men if they would like to send a card to their moms. The response was overwhelming, as virtually every prisoner said “Yes” until the workers actually ran out of cards. Buoyed by their success on Mother’s Day, they decided to get cards for Father’s Day, offering them to the inmates so they could write notes of love and appreciation to their dads. This time, the response was the exact opposite. They got absolutely no takers. “Children from fatherless homes are: a. Seven times more likely to live in poverty b. Six times more likely to commit suicide c. More than twice as likely to commit crime d. More than twice as likely to become pregnant out of wedlock e. Worse off academically and socially f.

Liberals have shifted gears from arguing the law will lower costs and reduce premiums for everyone -- which is how the unpopular overhaul was dishonestly marketed -- to shrugging that hey, at least many uninsured and lower-income citizens will get affordable coverage. But even that's not universally true, as many American workers are about to painfully discover. Behold, the "Affordable" Care Act in action (via the Associated Press): It's called the Affordable Care Act, but President Barack Obama's health care law may turn out to be unaffordable for many low-wage workers, including employees at big chain restaurants, retail stores and hotels. That might seem strange since the law requires medium-sized and large employers to offer "affordable" coverage or face fines. But what's reasonable? Because of a wrinkle in the law, companies can meet their legal obligations by offering policies that would be too expensive for many low-wage workers. For the employee, it's like a mirage — attractive but out of reach. The company can get off the hook, say corporate consultants and policy experts, but the employee could still face a federal requirement to get health insurance. Many are expected to remain uninsured, possibly risking fines. That's due to another provision: the law says workers with an offer of "affordable" workplace coverage aren't entitled to new tax credits for private insurance, which could be a better deal for those on the lower rungs of the middle class. Some supporters of the law are disappointed. It smacks of today's Catch-22 insurance rules. They're "disappointed," and are already mobilizing to pin their own mess on insurance companies. Their solution, of course, will be to forge ahead to a fully government-run single payer system -- which has been the objective from word one. They'll ask Americans to forgive them for producing a disastrous, unworkable federal power-grab, insisting that it can only be fixed by even bigger government. No thanks. The AP story above shines the spotlight on a gaping loophole in Obamacare. Basically, major employers of low-wage workers can technically satisfy the law's requirement that they offer "affordable" coverage to full-time employees, even if the new rates aren't actually affordable in reality. Unable to pay the premiums being offered by their employers, and ineligible for taxpayer subsidies to obtain coverage on their own (because they're "choosing" not to accept their "affordable" employer options), many of these workers will determine they have no choice but to remain uninsured -- and will pay the anti-middle classObamacare mandate tax for the privilege of doing so. What a deal. Guess who's heading for the exits as this monstrosity looms?

Obama's a former constitutional scholar. He has not excuse. He knows exactly what he's doing. The ACLU warned years ago that Obama has taken some of the worst Bush excesses and not only kept them but even extended them into a "New Normal". Obama has no excuse. What Bush did in panicked lunacy, Obama does stone-cold sober.

The survey found that 45 percent of respondents approve of the president, while 54 percent disapprove. In mid-May, the numbers were essentially reversed -- 53 percent approved and 45 percent disapproved. Americans under 30 flipped by 17 points against Obama, according to the poll. Half of the respondents said they do not feel that he is honest and trustworthy -- a nine-point drop from last month. The public disapproves of surveillance, and 43 percent of people think the administration has gone too far in sacrificing civil liberties in the name of fighting terrorism, the CNN poll found. A recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 45 percent of Americans feel Obama is doing a poor job when it comes to protecting constitutional rights. The CNN poll found that 61 percent of people disapprove of surveillance efforts, while 35 percent said they approve. The numbers suggest that the president's approval level has been damaged by the revelations that the NSA is surveilling Americans' phone and Internet activities, and the president's support for such programs. The president's approval rating has fallen recently overall, according to HuffPost/Pollster's polling average:</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1371489304179</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 13:15:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371490175385-84</Id><Title>President Obama's Approval Drops by Eight Percent in Past Month</Title><Msg>As scandalpalooza continues to unfold inside the Beltway, a new CNN/ORC International poll shows President Obama's approval rating has dropped by eight percent over the past month. President Barack Obama's approval rating dropped eight percentage points over the past month, to 45%, the president's lowest rating in more than a year and a half, according to a new national poll. The CNN/ORC International survey released Monday morning comes as the White House has been reacting to controversies over a massive U.S. government surveillance program; the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of tea party and other conservative groups who applied for tax-exempt status; the administration's handling of last September's attack in Benghazi that left the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead; and the Justice Department's secret collection of journalists' phone records as part of a government investigation into classified leaks. The poll indicates that for the first time in Obama’s presidency, half of the public says they don't believe he is honest and trustworthy. And Americans are split on the controversial National Security Agency anti-terrorism program to record metadata on U.S. phone calls, but they support the NSA program that targets records of Internet usage by people in other countries. That doesn't mean they necessarily like what is going on: Just over six in 10 believe that government is so large and powerful that it threatens the rights and freedoms of ordinary Americans. The number of Americans who think he is honest has dropped nine points over the past month, to 49%. Fifty-seven percent of those questioned say they disagree with the president's views on the size and power of the federal government, and 53% say he cannot manage the government effectively. Fifty-two percent say the president is a strong and decisive leader. That's still a majority, but it's down six points from last month. The most important and interesting numbers come from Obama's base and loyal voters. The president's approval rating stands at 45%, down from 53% in mid-May. And 54% say they disapprove of how Obama's handling his job, up nine points from last month. It's the first time in CNN polling since November 2011 that a majority of Americans have had a negative view of the president. "The drop in Obama's support is fueled by a dramatic 17-point decline over the past month among people under 30, who, along with black Americans, had been the most loyal part of the Obama coalition," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. The president also dropped 10 points among independent voters, from 47% last month to 37% now, with Obama's disapproval among independents jumping 12 points to 61%.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371490175385</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 13:29:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371491148223-85</Id><Topic><Title>Paris Air Show- Vote on Boeing vs Airbus Stock Price</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371247771854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 18:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Typical Wayne answer.

The magazine peddled anecdotes from sources horrified that Palin greeted top advisers at her hotel room -- gasp! -- "wearing nothing but a towel" and "wet hair." Fox News reporter Carl Cameron breathlessly reported that his unnamed McCain sources told him Palin lacked "a degree of knowledgeability necessary to be a running mate" because, they claimed, she didn't know which countries were parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement and "didn't understand that Africa was a continent, rather than a series, a country just in itself." Let's assume for a moment that the McCain rumormongers are telling the truth about Palin (and I don't believe they are). Who would it damn more: Palin, or McCain and his vetters, who greenlighted her for the vice presidential nomination? Don't need a fancy Ivy League degree to figure that one out. In introducing her to America, McCain praised her independence and backbone: She "stands up for what's right, and she doesn't let anyone tell her to sit down." The inside snipers are now roasting her for that very attribute -- redefined as "going rogue" -- because she had the nerve to try to schedule media interviews on her own. The nerve of her! Palin's response to the campaign fragging? At a late Wednesday night airport press conference in Anchorage, immediately upon landing home after the election defeat, she smiled cheerfully. The Alaska governor shrugged off the "foolish things" said by the McCain saboteurs, and simply said, "It's politics. … It's rough and tumble and you've got to have a thick skin just like I've got." Hollywood savaged Palin. Journalists mocked her. Liberal blogs slimed her. Opponents cursed her, Photoshopped her, hacked her e-mail, hanged her in effigy, called her bigot, Bible-thumper and #$%$, and attacked her husband and children. But nothing Palin endured during the election season compares to the treatment she's receiving from these backstabbing blabbermouths who worked on the same campaign she poured herself into over the last three months. Sarah Palin worked her heart out. She energized tens of thousands to come out when they would have otherwise stayed home. She touched countless families. I didn't agree with everything she said on the campaign trail. But she vigorously defended the Second Amendment and the sanctity of life more eloquently in practice than any of the educated conservative aristocracy. And she did it all with a tirelessness and an infectious optimism that defied the shameless, bottomless attempts by elites in both parties to bring her and her family down. Liberty needs a virtuous people to survive; self-governance requires virtuous leaders. "Knowledgeability" is a necessary trait in political life, but it is not sufficient. The elitist critics of Palin, so blindly enamored of Barack Obama's ability to hold forth for hours on theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, ignored the Founding Fathers' counsel: Character counts. In times of adversity and crisis, it counts more than IQ points, instant trivia recall and bloviation skills. "The most important thing I have learned, from my parents, from teachers, from my faith, from many good people I have been blessed to know, and from the lives of people whose stories we have included in this book," John McCain wrote in "Character Is Destiny," "is to want what they had, integrity, and to feel the sting of my conscience when I have risked it for some selfish reason." John McCain not only failed to make that message stick with the electorate, he apparently couldn't persuade his own staff to heed his advice and practice what he preached.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371492187764</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:03:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371492332887-89</Id><Topic><Title>Two Black Democrats Become Republicans in Louisiana</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371477475380</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:57:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't suppose a few of them are waking up do you?</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371492332887</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:05:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371492588756-90</Id><Topic><Title>Blacks, Fatherhood and the Democrat's Policies</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371479995685</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 10:39:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You ain't being PC now and no matter how true it is, it will surely cause the libtards to get their panties in a wad.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371492588756</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:09:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371492611350-91</Id><Topic><Title>Lots of awards for Boeing today-- must read message</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1371461684147</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 05:34:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good to see you Back Falmouth Boeing setting new high for the rest of the Week$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1371492611350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:10:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371492614889-92</Id><Topic><Title>Paris Air Show- Vote on Boeing vs Airbus Stock Price</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371247771854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 18:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These were the starting prices as of Friday's close, to be compared to this Friday's close for the percentage calculations(It's probably would be better to compare them on Monday's opening since the show ends on a Sunday) Airbus (EADSY) 57.17 Boeing 101.83</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371492614889</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:10:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371493030206-93</Id><Topic><Title>Any input on who will get the 777x wing assy---SC right</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1371454938416</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 03:42:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing can make more, just need surplus 747s which are plentiful right now.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1371493030206</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:17:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371493198109-94</Id><Topic><Title>The Cowardly Character Assassination of Sarah Palin</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371492187764</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:03:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one could "assassinate" Palin's character or intellect any more than she did herself.</Msg><Username>freedumber</Username><Timestamp>1371493198109</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:19:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371493253932-95</Id><Title>If We want the Economy to Cruise at high speed, We need to put it on Cruz control</Title><Msg>Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin made her return to Fox News as a contributor Monday morning.

Protected health information, or PHI, is highly protected under federal law, but the latest ruling from the Department of Health and Human Services allows agencies to trade the information to verify that Obamacare applicants are getting the minimum amount of health insurance coverage they need from the health "exchanges." The ruling, explained on pages 72-73 of the book-thick guidance, does not mention any requirement that applicants first OK the release of their PHI. HHS already allows some exchange of PHI without an individual's pre-approval, especially when for a "government program providing public benefits." Officials said the swapping of information is simply meant to help figure the best insurance coverge of Obamacare users.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371496110097</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 15:08:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371496361397-103</Id><Topic><Title>If We want the Economy to Cruise at high speed, We need to put it on Cruz control</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371493253932</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:20:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cruz will have to do something about his birth certificate- what goes around comes around HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1371496361397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 15:12:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371496917029-104</Id><Topic><Title>What's the Highest Nuber of Thumbs Down Ratings One can Get</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371494389014</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:39:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're pretty, sure.

The President is due to attend the G8 summit in Fermanagh, but his wife and daughters are to head south of the border this morning. Meanwhile, a mini army of Shelbourne Hotel staff were giving the front facade of the famous old building a final wipedown – as gardai and American Secret Service agents hovered in the background. Nothing was being left to chance – it was all hands on deck for the arrival of yet another famous visitor. This time it's Michelle Obama, the wife of US President Barack Obama. She will be staying in the hotel – along with their daughters Malia (14) and Sasha (12) – while her husband discusses global affairs at the G8 summit about 160km up the road in deepest Fermanagh. But yesterday afternoon both Shelbourne management and staff were staying strictly mum as the countdown to the arrival of its most famous guest in recent years got under way. A number of gardai were strategically placed at the front and sides of the hotel. And an array of prototype American Secret Service officers – complete with dark suits sunglasses and ear pieces – discretely kept a watchful an eye on arrivals and departures. No expense has been spared in catering for the comforts of Mrs Obama and her party. It is understood she will stay in the luxurious €2,500-a-night Princess Grace suite. It is understood a total of 30 rooms in the five-star, 265-bedroom hotel, have been booked for the visit of Mrs Obama and her entou- rage. During their stay in Dublin, Mrs Obama and and her daughters will visit Trinity College where they will view the Book of Kells.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371498576175</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 15:49:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371499896578-108</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle O entourage takes 30 rooms at posh hotel...</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371498576175</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 15:49:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your jealousy is appalling.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371499896578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 16:11:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371501627260-109</Id><Topic><Title>The Cowardly Character Assassination of Sarah Palin</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371492187764</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:03:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ain't THAT the truth.</Msg><Username>cloroxcowboy</Username><Timestamp>1371501627260</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 16:40:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371501819842-110</Id><Topic><Title>Any input on who will get the 777x wing assy---SC right</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1371454938416</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 03:42:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maybe Boeing can buy some A380's too</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371501819842</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 16:43:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371502375794-111</Id><Topic><Title>The Cowardly Character Assassination of Sarah Palin</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1371492187764</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:03:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sissified men don't like strong women like Sarah.

Oddly enough, we get a minor assist from right-wing radio. They are making it nearly impossible for the party to run a moderate candidate. In 2008, McCain didn't even resemble the candidate he was in 2000, and he pretty much had Palin forced on him. Romney also had to take extreme positions, and admitted Ryan wasn't really his first choice. This time around, I'm not sure the Tea Party will accept anybody other than Palin... Cruz...

You don't think Obonzo cares that there is a growing number of people like me that are no longer fooled by his constant lying and realize that he is an unqualified fraud pretending to be presidential? I doubt it. He lost 17% approval from people under 30 years of age in just 30 days according to the latest CNN Poll.
