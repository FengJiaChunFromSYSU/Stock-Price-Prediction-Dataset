"waynedickenson961 • Apr 11, 2013 7:01 PM • so spartacus9991, you asked me to stop pointing out that your a poor critic and I used your ignorant claim about a stock (IGZ) you offered to criticize my 19 day ago 26% ACAD gain. Spartacus9991, it's real weak of you to wait 19 days then, attempt to reinvent history. First of all sparticus9991, , you started the crapola years ago with me when I was making money on Apple and you just constantly harassed me about apple . Until Steve jobs died that stock went up for 15 years of yoru F ing around. Spartacus9991 now you want to cry uncle? Why would I stop , you have been dogging me for years , you could have moved on or actually made some real money off my stock suggestions at the time they were apple for 15 years , you dogged me about it for 15 years as you claim it is spirited dialog, nope your a Boeing Hack not a very good one at that. spartacus9991, I have been pointing out now that Airbus long term is far better than Boeing and ACAD is a great swing trade stock, did you follow ACAD or Airbus , nope your a Boeing Hack not a good one . so once more and as usual for you listen up, ACAD just made me another 67% today just 19 days on a swing trade and you tried to slam me with a bogus stock , get it how ?

Isn't it usual that you won't engage in a discussion on any scientific aspect of something you apparently believe so deeply in? I took the time to learn and comprehend the actual physics of climate, examine data from satellites and oceans, and interact with actual climate researchers, and I am willing to discuss the science and I'm open to you convincing me that the climate science is settled. So educate me! I would be happy to have you educate me on why climate models have been diverging from measured temperatures over the last 30 years. I assume there are engineers on this board who are familiar with using models who understands that when a model fails to replicate reality the model is false and must be revised or an alternative model must be considered. Engineers don't keep clinging to models that give erroneous results in the real world. So I am open to hearing an explanation as to why the climate models are diverging from reality. I am ready to believe what you believe, what I once believed, and all I need is an explanation for the climate model problem.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1370271184458</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 10:53:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370271793647-21</Id><Topic><Title>Fewer Americans Call Themselves Economic Conservatives</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1370130222046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 19:43:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you are not a conservative because you think being liberal will increase your standard of living by being on the side of Obama, and the socialists you are either stupid, or have been deceived.

Many of the things he transmitted contain evidence of war crimes. The "Collateral Murder" video depicts a US Apache attack helicopter killing 12 civilians and wounding two children on the ground in Baghdad in 2007. The helicopter then fired on and killed the people trying to rescue the wounded. Finally, a US tank drove over one of the bodies, cutting the man in half. These acts constitute three separate war crimes. Manning fulfilled his legal duty to report war crimes. He complied with his legal duty to obey lawful orders but also his legal duty to disobey unlawful orders. Section 499 of the Army Field Manual states, "Every violation of the law of war is a war crime." The law of war is contained in the Geneva Conventions. Article 85 of the First Protocol to the Geneva Conventions describes making the civilian population or individual civilians the object of attack as a grave breach. The firing on and killing of civilians shown in the "Collateral Murder" video violated this provision of Geneva. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions requires that the wounded be collected and cared for. Article 17 of the First Protocol states that the civilian population "shall be permitted, even on their own initiative, to collect and care for the wounded." That article also says, "No one shall be harmed . . . for such humanitarian acts." The firing on rescuers portrayed in the "Collateral Murder" video violates these provisions of Geneva. Finally, Section 27-10 of the Army Field Manual states that "maltreatment of dead bodies" is a war crime. When the Army jeep drove over the dead body, it violated this provision.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1370276791975</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 12:26:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370277112597-34</Id><Topic><Title>88 IRS agents should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law all doing major time</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1370215723311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 19:28:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And you ain't smart enough to understand why every decent American should be complaining a lot.

The aircraft was in the air for more than four hours and completed all first-flight test objectives, including evaluation of aerodynamic handling qualities, aircraft systems performance, and autopilot functions. The flight took place at the Beechcraft facility in Wichita, Kan., following ground tests that included a high-speed taxi. This milestone is a key event on the path to Limited User Tests and the Milestone C low rate initial production decision. EMARSS will provide the Army the ability to detect, locate, classify, identify, and track surface targets in nearly all weather conditions, day or night, with a high degree of timeliness and accuracy.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1370281615491</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 13:46:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370284092562-42</Id><Title>$3 Trillion</Title><Msg>Analysts say aerospace manufacturers will be competing for as much as $3 Trillion in contracts over the next 20 years.

This is a shame. I don’t share the GOP’s philosophy, but I do believe that competition makes both of our major parties smarter. I also believe that a big, complicated country facing economic and geopolitical challenges needs a government able to govern. What we don’t need is the steady diet of obstruction, diversion and gamesmanship that Republicans are trying to ram down the nation’s throat. It’s not as if President Barack Obama and the Democrats are doing everything right. It’s just that the GOP shrinks from doing anything meaningful at all. The most glaring example, at the moment, is in the Senate. For four years, Republican senators lambasted their Democratic colleagues — with justification — for not approving a budget, one of the basic tasks of governance. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and others regularly took to the Senate floor to announce the number of days since the Senate last produced a spending plan and to blast Majority Leader Harry Reid for this shocking failure. Two months ago, Reid and the Democrats finally passed a budget. Since the House has already passed its version — the controversial plan authored by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. — the next step should be for both chambers to appoint members of a conference committee that would iron out the differences. But Republicans won’t let this happen. Specifically, far-right conservatives including Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky are refusing to allow the Senate to appoint its representatives to the conference. Yes, having demanded this budget for four years, Republicans are now refusing to let it go forward. Some Republicans, that is. Establishment types such as John McCain of Arizona are apoplectic at the antics of their tea party-inspired colleagues, which McCain called “absolutely out of line and unprecedented.” Cruz and the others are worried that a conference committee might not only work out a budget but also make it possible to raise the federal debt ceiling without the now-customary showdown threatening default and catastrophe. They believe that brinkmanship is the only way to stop runaway government spending, which produces massive trillion-dollar deficits, which add to the ballooning national debt, which … Hold on, senator. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the deficit is shrinking rapidly and will fall to $642 billion this fiscal year. That’s still substantial, but it’s less than half the deficit our government ran in 2011. More important, if annual deficits continue to decline as the CBO predicts, the long-term debt problem begins to look more manageable. That’s good news, right? What Republicans ought to do is declare a victory for fiscal conservatism and move on to the battle to have their priorities reflected in the budget — a promising fight, since the conferees appointed by the GOP-controlled House are hardly going to be flaming liberals. Instead, the party seeks not consensus but crisis. This is no way for a 2-year-old to act, much less the self-proclaimed “world’s greatest deliberative body.” And speaking of juvenile behavior, I would be remiss not to mention how Rep. Darrell Issa of California and his GOP colleagues in the House are embarrassing themselves by straining to turn Obama administration missteps into Watergate-style scandals. The deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, resulted from a security lapse of the kind that every recent administration, unfortunately, has suffered. Since future administrations will have lapses as well, congressional oversight could be useful in at least making sure the specific mistakes of Benghazi are not repeated. But instead, House Republicans summon the television cameras and ask round after round of tendentious questions — without paying the slightest attention to the answers. Similarly, on the question of how and why the IRS gave added scrutiny to conservative “social welfare” groups seeking nonprofit status, House inquisitors seem barely interested in what actually happened. “What did the president know and when did he know it?” was an appropriate question. But the follow-up — “Harrumph, well then, why didn’t he know sooner?” — isn’t much in the way of scandal material. And concerning the Justice Department’s overzealous crusade to thwart classified leaks — and investigative reporting — it is amusing to watch House Republicans twist themselves into champions of the hated Lamestream Media. Who knew? None of this is boosting the GOP’s poll numbers. I’ve got an idea: Why don’t they try doing the people’s business for a change?</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1370309887084</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 21:38:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370311110131-74</Id><Topic><Title>F-15 are still selling well after 39 years in service</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1370236049222</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 01:07:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We don't need the F-35. we can do better.

Google "Operation Home Run" ...Since Drone technology has been around for 30 years and Drones are unbiquitous now...this is no longer debatable.
