It's like they were carrying a jigsaw puzzle of history and dropped it, then put it back together with big chunks in the wrong places." I notice you dispute nothing but make some kind of conclusion which is meaningless other than some kind of harassing slam. Albucucu, some people can get into a stock like you posted about, a farm subsidy stock, , you complain that your stock , peix may be doing a reverse split and while I do not know where you got in, clearly it has been a bad stock all the way, you might have got in at around 90 dollars and rode it long from 90 dollars to now where it is at about 35 cents, that should be your history lesson . Too bad albucucu, you should have been awake and you might have noticed apple under Steve Jobs who came back after a very successful leave developing other companies. Once Steve Jobs came back to in 2000, Apple stock price went up 610% when he had to retire on Aug 25, 2011. That is the real history lesson you should learn . . albulcucu, the only history I can find on you is you are a poster who uses the Boeing message board to try to be a postive spin sales person for Boeing Managment's failure, albucucu, that is your fragile grasp on reality of the Boeing history. BA stock price when the CEO took charge to fix the company was 66 today it is 74 a gain of 12% nasdaq is up over 15% year to date. So history, albucucu is against you, harassment is all you offer to history of Boeing fail.or the comparison between Theodore Roosevelt who took a gun shot and kept on schedule while the CEO of Boeing makes excuses and puts on dog and pony shows about how emergency landings is normal, after FAA and Boeing certified the 787 was safe.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355721473540</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 00:17:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355721677094-2</Id><Topic><Title>=militia</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1355706164485</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 20:02:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I am concerned here about how to stop a murder from becoming 26 murders."

So far it seems that most of the weapons used in the Conn. shooting were owned by the kid's mother. She clearly wasn't a responsible gun owner. She was probably very much like a lot of American gun enthusiasts. Many American gun owners end up killed by their own firearms. Or worse, a family member or friend ends up killed by them. Those children and teachers had a right to not be killed by any of those weapons. There will be no justice because the stupid gun owner is dead and the mentally ill shooter is dead, as well as all the unsuspecting children and teachers.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1355723341432</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 00:49:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355727506070-4</Id><Title>Looks like we are about to enter the Wyatt Earp days!</Title><Msg>Pack a gun for your own safety!</Msg><Username>coms_geek</Username><Timestamp>1355727506070</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 01:58:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355727813187-5</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing CEO and APPLCE CEO were hired to fix company problems</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355718727581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 23:32:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>McNurdy is a piece of DoDo.!

Already there are two online petitions, both originating from the White House, one for and one against more gun control in an attempt to skew results in favor of more gun control. Who in their right minds are going to put their name on a list put out by the White House to not ban guns, and because of this, the the petitions are running this morning 119,505 to 1,905 for a 63 to 1 ratio in favor of more gun control, which Obama will use as proof America wants more gun control while ignoring recent past petitions from several pro-gun organizations with 100's of thousands signatures against more gun control. Already we are seeing announcements of gun buy backs for a fraction of the gun cost with no questions ask promoting stolen guns. What happened to demands for closing loopholes for background checks for all sales of guns? For example: Baltimores "goods for guns". Amazing, no questions asked.

During the '80's, the Reagan administration saved a lot of tax dollars by de-institutionalizing people for mental and emotional illnesse, and they were absorbed into society. I'm pretty much ok with that, even though most of them and their families can not afford the psychiatric care nor the meds that may stabilize their conditions. We're talking thousands of people, new ones born every day. Their conditions are not always obvious. Are all of you comfortable with them having the same access to semi-automatic weapons as you have? The gun dealer can't always tell a person's mental condition. The seller in a two party transaction will not always be able to tell. Certainly a person who wants to deliver destruction will find a way to do it, but a revolver would limit it in comparison to something that can deliver 30 rounds in 10 seconds. And the argument that it is the person who causes the harm, not the weapon, there is some truth to that. But by that standard, any of the above mentioned people should be allowed to walk around with a bag of ricin in their pockets. I'm no more keen on that than the assault rifle.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1355763310275</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 11:55:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355763490535-55</Id><Topic><Title>Ban Assault Weapons</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1355757368954</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 10:16:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What if he had screwed the fire doors shut and set the place on fire?

Which is better for the economy? Analysts say it depends. Economists generally agree that a simpler tax code with lower rates and fewer deductions, exemptions and credits would help the economy. With fewer tax preferences, people would be more likely to seek the best investments for their money instead of the most lucrative tax breaks. And lower rates would leave them more money to spend. Both would add oomph to the economy. But ask whether the higher tax rates that President Barack Obama wants would hurt the economy more than curbing deductions, as Republicans assert, and the picture is less clear. While many economists say the economy theoretically would work more efficiently if the tax code provided fewer preferences, many said it would depend on which deductions lawmakers curb — a complicated exercise in a world where one person's wasteful loophole may be viewed by others as an economic lifeline. For example, one of the biggest tax breaks is the widely popular deduction for interest on home mortgages below $1 million. Because of it, the government this year will take in $87 billion less than it would if the deduction didn't exist. That deduction allows many to buy homes they otherwise couldn't afford and is strenuously defended by the housing industry. But critics say it does little to help lower-income people while it encourages others to go into debt for costlier homes than they need — an activity they say taxpayers should not subsidize. "I'd definitely go for cutting deductions first, especially if I have the opportunity to make the choices about which deductions go," said Alan Auerbach, director of the Robert Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California, Berkeley. The clash is a key part of negotiations for a deal to avert big tax increases and spending cuts due to begin in January — the fiscal cliff — unless Obama and Congress reach an accord on some other way to rein in the government's ballooning debt. Obama wants to raise $1.6 trillion in revenue over the next 10 years, partly by letting decade-old tax cuts on the country's highest earners expire at the end of the year. He would continue those Bush-era tax cuts for everyone except individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples making above $250,000. The highest rates on top-paid Americans would rise from 33 percent and 35 percent today to 36 percent and 39.6 percent. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has offered $800 billion in new revenues to be raised by reducing or eliminating unspecified tax breaks on upper-income people. There are more than 100 tax breaks with a cumulative price tag estimated at $1.1 trillion yearly. They range from huge breaks like the deduction for charitable contributions and the income exclusion for employer-provided health insurance to obscure tax incentives for capturing carbon dioxide emissions or maintaining railroad tracks. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a report last month that raising tax rates would dampen people's incentive to work and reduce the nation's labor supply. Raising the same amount of revenue by eliminating tax breaks would probably be less negative, but the impact would depend on which deductions were erased, the budget office said. A separate study by the same agency and in the same month, however, suggested that the economic harm from letting tax rates rise for top earners would be relatively negligible. That report estimated that extending the George W. Bush-era tax breaks for everyone would mean the economy would grow by 1.4 percent more than if all the tax cuts are allowed to expire. Extending the tax breaks for all but the top earners as Obama wants would produce economic growth of 1.3 percent, just 0.1 percent less. In a nearly $16 trillion economy, that one-tenth of 1 percent equals $16 billion. While higher tax rates can discourage investment, "whether or not we actually see significant changes in behavior from small changes in tax rates is another story," said Joe Rosenberg, research associate at the bipartisan Tax Policy Center, which analyzes tax policy. "We do see some, but the magnitude is probably fairly small." Part of the dispute is grounded in politics. Obama made raising rates on the wealthy a keystone of his re-election campaign. For two decades, Republicans have made opposition to higher tax rates their party's mantra. Neither side is eager to surrender. The present faceoff is also a tactical duel ahead of an even larger war over revamping the entire tax code that could come next year. Both sides know that if tax rates on the wealthy rise now, it will be harder to push them back down later. In addition, the battle underscores ideological differences in the two parties' constituencies. Republicans say raising tax rates on high-income Americans discourages investments that would produce new jobs. "Here's how Republicans think," said Kenneth Kies, a former top House GOP tax aide and now a tax lobbyist. "If I'm a risk-taker and I'm getting ready to invest $1, if I'm successful and the top rate is 35 percent, I get to keep 65 cents." If the top tax rate is much higher, Kies said, he would get to keep less "and my incentive to invest is significantly reduced." For Democrats, imposing higher tax rates on people making the most money is a fair way to make them contribute to deficit reduction. They say Obama would merely return rates to levels that existed under President Bill Clinton, and the economy prospered then. Because various tax breaks have such powerful defenders — for example, charities, churches and colleges — it's politically difficult to limit them. The subsequent search for revenue could expose the middle class to higher taxes, Democrats say. During the presidential campaign, Republican nominee Mitt Romney suggested limiting itemized deductions to a dollar cap, such as $25,000. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that capping deductions at $25,000 would raise $1.3 trillion. But 29 percent of it would come from those earning under $200,000, whose taxes both parties say they don't want to increase.</Msg><Username>ordinarybob25x18</Username><Timestamp>1355767700167</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 13:08:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355768142963-67</Id><Topic><Title>The G.O.P.’s Existential Crisis</Title><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1355564649558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 04:44:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why won’t the Republicans get specific?

I don't own one and do not have an interest in owning one. However, I respect the 2nd Amendment. The WIKI has an interesting summary of "massacres" (WIKI + massacre + gun). In that list, you will not find Switzerland. Yet, Swiss citizens are all required to have a gun in their posession in their homes - it is an extension of being in the militia. You do find Israel in that list - only because they are constantly under attack by outsiders, not themselves. There are very strict rules on gun ownership in Israel (license and training) and guns are issued (on a loan basis) in the "settlements". And ther are a lot of gun owners in Israel. We can debate the necessity of semi-automatic weaponry, but we must be careful of the "slippery slopes" - either way. One poster suggested that only the police, etc. should have these weapons. Well, those that are suspicious of their government and its intentions would disagree with that (ergo, Waco and Ruby Ridge). I am more concerned that folks are losing their marbles of late. Each President has seen on average about one to two massacres per term over the past 50 years. Obama has had five or six in his first term depending upon whether you count the Fast and Furious deaths. Clever people - the Aurora and Newtown massacres were perpetrated by apparent brilliant individuals - will find a way to "do" people in, whether by fuel/ferilizer bombs, bows and arrows, or guns.

What is it about the Democrats that they cannot help but divide people -- by race, by sex, by class?</Msg><Username>cws2012wc</Username><Timestamp>1355772557053</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:29:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355772964791-98</Id><Topic><Title>Newtown Is A Game Changer</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1355771067496</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:04:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>' Newtown Is A Game Changer ' remains to be seen !</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1355772964791</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:36:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355773086468-99</Id><Topic><Title>The NYT couldn't bury this one</Title><Username>cws2012wc</Username><Timestamp>1355772557053</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:29:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"We put a Black man in the White House."

You see a simple rephrasing of your question would be: Whats more likely to cause fatality; a whacked liberal suicide bomber with 100 lbs. of TNT strapped to his chest looking to kill as many peole as possible, or whacked neocon suicide bomber with 100 lbs. of TNT strapped to his chest looking to kill as many peole as possible? "btw; what makes you think Chris is not a nut... or will not snap... or is not a member of the NRA or was a Republican at one time..." This is a breakthrough.

However, a 2007 law change banned the storage of ammunition in homes. The coalition is looking to extend this, control the purchase of military weapons and set up a national gun register, because of murders and suicides. Green lawmaker Josef Lang said more than 1.5 million unused weapons were kept in Swiss homes. Lang said their presence "at the heart" of the population could not be justified. He said a national register had to be created to keep track of the weapons, something police had long been seeking. Lang said the weapons had to be "banished" from homes.

It’s shuttered its Facebook page. It’s silent on Twitter. It’s released no public statements on its website. It isn’t responding to media inquiries. And it hasn’t launched an aggressive push on Capitol Hill to shore up support among its allies. The go-dark strategy is unusual for an elite interest group so deeply entwined in a national controversy — even for the NRA, which has released condolence statements soon after past shootings, including this summer after a gunman killed 12 people in an Aurora, Colo. movie theater. It’s also not the normal course of business for the NRA in Washington, where the powerful lobby has spent years building an arsenal of pro-gun lawmakers, an extensive grassroots network and a political money arm that has made gun control legislation nearly untouchable. But crisis communicators said the decision isn’t surprising considering the unique circumstances. “I’m sure the NRA considers itself in a lose-lose situation regarding communications,” said Jonathan Bernstein, a crisis management expert. “When there is that level of anti-gun outrage, there is literally nothing a pro-gun organization can say in the near term.” Richard Feldman, a former NRA lobbyist and president of the Independent Firearm Owners Association, agreed. “I’m sure what they would want to say is, ‘We’re so sorry, this is horrible,’ but if they said that it would be viewed as it’s cynical for them to be saying such a thing,” Feldman said. The NRA did not respond to an email and a phone call requesting comment. How long they can stay silent is unclear. Friday’s massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Conn., that left 20 children and six adults dead, has put the gun issue back on the national political stage. The group also hasn’t been aggressive with allies on Capitol Hill, even as pro-NRA members like Sens. Joe Manchin D-W.Va.) and Mark Warner (D-W.Va.) have said there might need to be more gun control to prevent future shootings. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), also said Monday that it was time to have a debate on the country’s gun laws. Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat from Kentucky, also came out publicly, apologizing for not speaking out on gun violence over the past six years. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has pledged to reintroduce the federal ban on assault weapons, which expired in 2004.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1355790195449</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 19:23:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355790227830-131</Id><Topic><Title>NRA Shuts Down</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1355790195449</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 19:23:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the Cowards !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1355790227830</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 19:23:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355791190943-132</Id><Topic><Title>NRA Shuts Down</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1355790195449</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 19:23:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No they aren't.

But how responsible are you gun enthusiasts, really? For instance, would you be willing to take full responsibility for any injury or death, accidental or deliberate, caused by one of your registered firearms? Yes, all must be registered and owners sign a contract stating they take full responsibility for anything that happens, regardless whether the gun is borrowed or stolen. This would in no way reduce the responsibility of the doer, but like jail time for the gun owner, just like riding along on an armed bank robbery gets doers and tag alongs the same charges. Are you willing to be that responsible? It's lost, stolen and unaccounted for guns that become involved in crimes, and that's irresponsible gun ownership.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1355801892444</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 22:38:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355802859210-160</Id><Topic><Title>Ban Assault Weapons</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1355757368954</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 10:16:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My check for last quarter was only about $12,570.

Here is a statment about stock buybacks and the results."A stock buyback occurs if the stock price remains stagnant, or worse, plummets. Between 2000 and 2009, most share buybacks were "losers" in this sense. The loss is amplified if the company does the buyback, which is often the case. The share buy backs drain valuable cash from the company, they increase the earnings per share that is typically used as a benchmark for executive compensation. T sinewavepattern, you sir are an enthusiastic Boeing advertisement user. Your claim of good company is false. Due to the outsourcing fail on the 787, 3 years late and 30 billion over original budget, the Boeing company shareholders have made nothing for 3 years and will continue to suffer until the 787 makes a cent , predicted now to be in the year 2021 . This buyback will fail other than short term gains to reward executives .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355806545186</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 23:55:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355806728264-163</Id><Topic><Title>=militia</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1355706164485</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 20:02:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because for the left no amount of "less rounds" in the clip will be enough until it reaches 0. He broke a multitude of laws before he even got to the school, would having more laws have stopped him? There are bad people out there, I believe in 1927 full auto and big drums were legal, but a bad guy back then decided to use bombs: The Bath School disaster is the name given to three bombings in Bath Township, Michigan, on May 18, 1927, which killed 38 elementary school children, two teachers, and four other adults; at least 58 people were injured. The perpetrator first killed his wife, and committed suicide with his last explosion. Most of the victims were children in the second to sixth grades (7–14 years of age[1]) attending the Bath Consolidated School. Their deaths constitute the deadliest mass murder in a school in United States history.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1355806728264</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 23:58:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
