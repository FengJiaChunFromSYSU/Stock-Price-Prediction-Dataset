The misperception that propelled events from the very start was Zimmerman’s assumption that a black kid in a hoodie did not belong in his neighborhood. If he had known Martin was the guest of a local resident with no other mission than to reach home with the package of Skittles he had just purchased, Zimmerman would not have followed the young man. In fact, if he had simply not held a stereotype in his head that a young African American in a hoodie is very likely a criminal, Martin would be alive today and Zimmerman would not have had his own life turned upside down. Conversely, if Martin had not looked at Zimmerman and seen a “cracker” – as Martin described Zimmerman in a phone call to a friend when he noticed Zimmerman behind him – he may have reacted with less fear and anger. If he had seen George Zimmerman as he appeared in court – cleanshaven, wearing a nice suit – perhaps nothing more would have happened than a brief, heated conversation. Instead, he saw a burly Latino man with a goatee, a baseball cap and clothes that made him look like a tough guy from the streets. Once Martin lay dead and Zimmerman was identified as the shooter, it became convenient for commentators and activists to mold perceptions in ways that served their purposes. Some pushed the image of Zimmerman as a white racist vigilante and Martin as a callow child. Others portrayed Zimmerman as a well-intentioned Latino with a civic conscience who was overwhelmed by a physically imposing marijuana user. Now, with the verdict in and Zimmerman a free man, it is clear that many people misperceived the strength of the case against him. The one fact that is undisputed is that Zimmerman killed Martin. That is all some people need to know to believe the man should be in jail. But the law said something different. No matter what Zimmerman’s motivations may have been, no matter his feelings about black people, no matter that a police dispatcher told him not to get involved, despite any of that, the prosecution failed to undermine Zimmerman’s story that, in the thick of the confrontation, it was he who felt threatened. Even though Zimmerman’s attorneys did not base their defense on Florida's “stand your ground” law, the judge’s instructions to the jury had to take that into account. Like it or not, Florida law gave him the right to pull a gun and shoot. Now some will argue that, apart from the prosecution’s poorly crafted case, Zimmerman was helped by the fact that the jury was composed of five white women and one Latino woman who may harbor their own biases and fears regarding young black men. An all black jury may have perceived things differently. They might have had more sympathy with Martin. They might have found Zimmerman guilty. The question then would be, should justice turn on the racial makeup of a jury? Shouldn’t the law be applied the same way, no matter the skin color of the defendant or the victim? What would the right outcome be in this horribly tragic situation? Does fidelity to the letter of the law produce real justice? It depends on your perception. Given the overreach of the prosecutors in seeking a conviction on second-degree murder, and given the scant evidence about what really happened, the law dictated a not guilty verdict. That does not mean Zimmerman did not do something terrible, but, bizarre as it may seem, it was impossible to prove he broke the law when he did it.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1374294176846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 00:22:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374294188152-3</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking News .</Title><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1374288852616</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 22:54:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No doubt.

The police and prosecutor were derelict in their duties by not investigating this murder right from the start. Zimmerman should have stayed in his car and minded his own business instead of arming himself and going after a 17 year old boy walking home from the store with iced tea and candy and talking on the phone to a girl. The girl testified that he had told her that someone was following him (every child's nightmare). She told him to run. She heard him ask "Why you following me?", she heard a thud and wet grass. Then she heard him say "Get off me. Get off me". It doesn't take a genius to figure out who accosted who and who was on who in the grass. Zimmerman lied his way thru the whole thing and got away with murder, and he is the son of a judge who know exactly how to play a stupid jury and make it look like self defense, when it was murder.</Msg><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1374300607380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 02:10:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374311468037-12</Id><Topic><Title>ANA ELT's</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1374255126401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:32:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hopefully that problem is put to rest.</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1374311468037</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 05:11:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374311517729-13</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking News .</Title><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1374288852616</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 22:54:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you like wearing a pledge pin on your Waffen SS uniform?</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1374311517729</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 05:11:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374311563656-14</Id><Topic><Title>boeing contracts</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1374265425989</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 16:23:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for BA post.</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1374311563656</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 05:12:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374311802415-15</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like Honeywell will take one in the gut for Boeing</Title><Username>harpersarah94</Username><Timestamp>1374208963165</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 00:42:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another disgruntled short...</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1374311802415</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 05:16:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374311997453-16</Id><Topic><Title>Travon-like Fury seen Before...In #$%$ Germany !</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374275163526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:06:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wouldn't an American President either A) not get involved in such a case.

The days are few and far between when President Obama has intentionally reminded us that he is the first African-American president. Friday was one. The president did something no other holder of his office has ever had the life experience to do: He used the bully pulpit to, as an African-American, explain black America to white America in the wake of last week's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. Appearing unannounced before surprised reporters who were expecting the White House press secretary, it was Obama — "the bridge" as New Yorker editor David Remnick has called him — trying to span a divide. It was Obama trying to help white Americans comprehend black America's reaction to the Martin-Zimmerman tragedy. To a degree, it was reminiscent of the widely hailed Philadelphia speech Obama made during the 2008 presidential campaign to explain American racial realities during the controversy over the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. For that moment, Obama's bridge went two ways as he explained whites to blacks and blacks to whites. That speech found Obama standing between two races as the son of a black African father and white American mother and translating for each side. Not so with Friday's remarks: They were one way. The president focused on why so many African-Americans have reacted as if they were gut-punched from the time they first learned of the circumstances surrounding the shooting until the verdict. He made no attempt to explain whites to blacks. To whites who have insisted the case wasn't about race, the president explained why so many blacks disagree. In a powerful reminder of his unique place in history, he cited his own personal experience as an African-American. You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that — that doesn't go away. There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. While other presidents have had their common-man stories of hardship or challenge, this is first time a president has been able to tell this particular story of being a minority who was racially profiled. Or the story of the head of the Justice Department, for that matter. Just days ago Attorney General Eric Holder told of how, when he was a U.S. attorney, police stopped him as he ran down a Washington street because he was trying to make it to a movie. The president is right that it seems like almost every African-American male has at least one story about being profiled. As a teenager in New York City heading to basketball games with teammates I was twice stopped by police officers who held their guns on us because, they said, we fit the description of crime suspects they were looking for. We were walking while black. While he was ever Obama, gentle and cautious in his comments, the president made clear his strong disagreement with those who suggest blacks should be more concerned about violence by blacks against other blacks than by whites against blacks since the former poses the greater threat to young black males. This made for another striking moment. Obama essentially said to white Americans "we get it," but he went further. He suggested that what bothers many blacks is that too many whites act as if this violence came out of nowhere. Or if not nowhere, out of some moral or other difference in black people. We understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country, and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history. And so the fact that sometimes that's unacknowledged adds to the frustration. And the fact that a lot of African-American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given, well, there are these statistics out there that show that African-American boys are more violent — using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain. It's potent stuff to blame the violence in black neighborhoods on the violence and poverty tens of millions of blacks have been subjected to over the course of American history. It was Obama telling many white Americans to stop blaming the victim. Obama's Friday comments very likely went some way toward satisfying many African-Americans who had wanted to hear from the president ever since the Zimmerman verdict came down — and wondered where he was. Aside from a brief written statement issued shortly after Zimmerman was acquitted, he had been quiet on the issue. Conservative reaction ranged from unimpressed to scornful. For a president who has in the past drawn significant criticism from many blacks for lecturing to African-American audiences about the need to be more responsible parents, Friday's message came from a completely different direction. Interestingly, though, in a way it came from the same place, the president's identity as African-American. As the nation's first black president, he has been in the unique position of being able to speak to black audiences about the need for greater responsibility. But it was also that very African-Americaness that allowed him to speak so personally and honestly about the Martin-Zimmerman case and to be the bridge to whites that might help them better understand what so many blacks have been experiencing.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374328175618</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 09:49:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374329275940-20</Id><Title>Evidence reveals Hastings was assasinated !</Title><Msg>Alternative media have pointed out a number of suspicious anomalies that demonstrate the crash was part of a conspiracy to assassinate the award-winning journalist. Prior to his murder, Hastings said the Obama administration had declared war on the press. His desire to go into hiding – expressed in an email mere hours before his assassination – demonstrates the ability of the government to monitor opponents by using a well-developed NSA surveillance grid and take executive action against investigative journalists and others who dare to stand up to the national security state. U.S. Army brass told Hastings he would be hunted down and killed over his story that led to the downfall of General McChrystal’s, according to one of his closest friend during a June 26 interview on the Alex Jones Show. “I remember when the story broke with General McChrystal and he [Hastings] gave me a call and he’s like ‘man, I’m pretty scared,’” SSG Joe Biggs said. “I told him, ‘You have a reason to be, brother. You basically just got a general of a war fired. I’m pretty sure that doesn’t sit too well with him right now.’” Biggs, who met Hastings when the journalist was covering the war in Afghanistan, also said a story he was working on about the CIA was apparently what led to his assassination. “Hastings had the Central Intelligence Agency in his sights is no surprise to those who knew his work,” Dennis Romero wrote last month, adding that “the shadowy world of intelligence and off-the-record American aggression was a favorite topic of the journalist.” Biggs told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly in late June that “something didn’t feel right” after Hastings sent a panicked email saying the authorities were on his tail, adding that the story of him driving at high speed in the early hours of the morning was completely out of character. “His friends and family that know him, everyone says he drives like a grandma, so that right there doesn’t seem like something he’d be doing, there</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374329275940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 10:07:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374329293374-21</Id><Topic><Title>Appearance of a Doomed Detroit</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374269112446</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 17:25:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Energetic climate change denial" ?? splain that statement please.</Msg><Username>doublehaul32</Username><Timestamp>1374329293374</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 10:08:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374329472328-22</Id><Title>Indiana: Obamacare will force 72% increase in insurance</Title><Msg>Indiana: Obamacare will force 72% increase in insurance Tony Cook Indy Star July 20, 2013 Insurance rates in Indiana will increase 72 percent for those with individual plans and 8 percent for small group plans under President Barack Obama’s healthcare overhaul, according to the state’s insurance department. The spike in costs is due primarily to new mandates under the law, which requires insurers to cover those with pre-existing conditions and to offer a minimum level of benefits, said Logan Harrison, chief deputy commissioner with the Indiana Department of Insurance under Republican Gov.

Dvorak’s investigation also uncovered the fact that police and firefighters in the area were given a gag order and told not to talk to the media about the death. This would also explain the attempt by the LAPD and Coroner to hide Hastings’ body from witnesses at the scene of the accident. The corporate media has gone out of its way to dismiss evidence that Hastings was the victim of foul play and has characterized the evidence as little more than baseless conspiracy theories. Soon after the accident, it was conclusively demonstrated that it is possible to hack into a car’s computer and take control of a vehicle. In 2011, Car and Driver magazine published an article substantiating Pentagon research into the subject. “What has been revealed as a result of some research at universities is that it’s relatively easy to hack your way into the control system of a car, and to do such things as cause acceleration when the driver doesn’t want acceleration, to throw on the brakes when the driver doesn’t want the brakes on, to launch an air bag,” Former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard Clarke told The Huffington Post. “You can do some really highly destructive things now, through hacking a car, and it’s not that hard.” A number of experts dispute the official explanation of the accident.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374329618730</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 10:13:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374329648197-24</Id><Topic><Title>Evidence reveals Hastings was assasinated !</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374329275940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 10:07:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“No matter how you slice this particular pie, a Mercedes is not just going to explode into flames without a little assistance,” writes freelance journalist Jim Stone. “Car fires in new cars happen for three main reasons — running the engine out of oil, or running the engine out of coolant, or after an absolutely huge car mangling accident, having the hot side of the battery short out against the frame before it reaches the fuse panel. And for all 3 of those normal reasons, which account for virtually all car fires in modern cars, the fire would have started in the engine compartment, progressed slowly, and scorched the hell out of the paint before ever reaching the gas tank. That clean paint is the be all tell all, Michael Hastings was murdered, and the rest is detail.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374329648197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 10:14:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374330392506-25</Id><Title>The LITERAL NAME "Barry Soetoro" registered to vote in D.C....address the White House</Title><Msg>A quick search of D.C. Board of Elections records conducted by PJ Media found a voter named “Barry Soetoro” registered to vote in the nation’s capital with the address … 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. That’s correct – at the White House. “Barry Soetoro,” as WND reported in 2008, was the name used to register 6-year-old Barack Obama at Jakarta, Indonesia’s Roman Catholic Franciscus Assisi Primary School by his stepfather, Lolo Soetoro. The school registration card lists Barry Soetoro as a Indonesian citizen born Aug. 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii. His religion was listed as Muslim. Indonesian school registration for “Barry Soetoro” (AP photo) So is Obama returning to his childhood roots or re-adopting the name of his stepfather? Not likely. “Did President Obama submit this registration, or is it a fraud? Who knows?” asks PJ Media’s J. Christian Adams, an election lawyer who formerly served in the Voting Rights Section at the U.S. Department of Justice and is author of the New York Times bestselling book “Injustice: Exposing the Racial Agenda of the Obama Justice Department.” Get your copy of Adams’ “Injustice” – at a discount price – from the WND SuperStore now! “Obtaining the actual registration forms submitted to the D.C. elections board might answer the question,” Adams continues. “In my view, it is worse if it is a fraud because it illustrates the ease at which one can trick the system. Or perhaps, President Obama wants out of crime-infested Chicago after his term is up and registered using his old name. “I’ll go with option 1, the fraud,” Adams concludes. Obama’s American mother, Ann Dunham, separated from her first husband, Barack Obama Sr., in 1963 when the future president was 2 years old. Dunham and Obama Sr. later divorced. Dunham married Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian, and moved to Indonesia sometime between 1966 and 1967. When he was 10 years old, little Soetoro, a.k.a. Obama, moved to Hawaii to live with his maternal grandparents.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374330392506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 10:26:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374332728343-26</Id><Topic><Title>The LITERAL NAME "Barry Soetoro" registered to vote in D.C....address the White House</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374330392506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 10:26:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A quick search of U.S. "certified insane" posters who incessantly post WND articles found a deranged humanoid named "Spartaloon" and "Spartafreak" and "Spartadoofus."</Msg><Username>jumbojetskl</Username><Timestamp>1374332728343</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 11:05:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374333403322-27</Id><Topic><Title>Indiana: Obamacare will force 72% increase in insurance</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374329472328</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 10:11:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So what does Obama do when he has already caused double digit unemployment when you factor in all the workers he's forced to give up even looking for a job?

Censored is accurate that sea ice extent is showing an upward trend. Keep in mind that is sea ice. The more important aspect is 'ice mass balance' on land determined by ice gain minus ice loss. Mass balance is tracked by satellite and there is rapid ice melt in Antarctica on the Western Peninsula (Ross Ice Shelf) but both ICESAT and GRACE satellite missions show that ice accumulation on the Central and Eastern parts of Antarctica are greater than the ice loss in the Western portion over the last decade.

I have my own opinion on this .......................................... here is the yahoo article Black America’s real problem isn’t white racism In the aftermath of the acquittal of George Zimmerman, Eric Holder, Al Sharpton and Ben Jealous of the NAACP are calling on the black community to rise up in national protest. Yet they know — and Barack Obama, whose silence speaks volumes, knows — nothing is going to happen. “Stand-Your-Ground” laws in Florida and other states are not going to be repealed. George Zimmerman is not going to be prosecuted for a federal “hate crime” in the death of Trayvon Martin. The result of all this ginned-up rage that has produced vandalism and violence is simply going to be an ever-deepening racial divide. Consider the matter of crime and fear of crime. From listening to cable channels and hearing Holder, Sharpton, Jealous and others, one would think the great threat to black children today emanates from white vigilantes and white cops. Hence, every black father must have a “conversation” with his son, warning him not to resist or run if pulled over or hassled by a cop.</Msg><Username>happy_sam007</Username><Timestamp>1374345221495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 14:33:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374345295463-67</Id><Topic><Title>Shocking statistics: Why?

But is this the reality in Black America? When Holder delivered his 2009 “nation-of-cowards” speech blaming racism for racial separation, Manhattan Institute’s Heather Mac Donald suggested that our attorney general study his crime statistics. In New York from January to June 2008, 83 percent of all gun assailants were black, according to witnesses and victims, though blacks were only 24 percent of the population. Blacks and Hispanics together accounted for 98 percent of all gun assailants. Forty-nine of every 50 muggings and murders in the Big Apple were the work of black or Hispanic criminals. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly confirms Mac Donald’s facts. Blacks and Hispanics commit 96 percent of all crimes in the city, he says, but only 85 percent of the stop-and-frisks are of blacks and Hispanics. And these may involve the kind of pat-downs all of us have had at the airport. Is stop-and-frisk the work of racist cops in New York, where the crime rate has been driven down to levels unseen in decades? According to Kelly, a majority of his police force, which he has been able to cut from 41,000 officers to 35,000, is now made up of minorities. But blacks are also, per capita, the principal victims of crime. Would black fathers prefer their sons to grow up in Chicago, rather than low-crime New York City, with its stop-and-frisk policy? Fernando Mateo, head of the New York taxicab union, urges his drivers to profile blacks and Hispanics for their own safety: “The God’s honest truth is that 99 percent of the people that are robbing, stealing, killing these drivers are blacks and Hispanics.” Mateo is what The New York Times would describe as “a black Hispanic” Yet he may be closer to the ‘hood than Holder, who says he was stopped by police when running to a movie — in Georgetown.</Msg><Username>happy_sam007</Username><Timestamp>1374345295463</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 14:34:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374345401324-68</Id><Topic><Title>Shocking statistics: Why?

After researching the FBI numbers for “Suicide of a Superpower,” this writer concluded: “An analysis of ‘single offender victimization figures’ from the FBI for 2007 finds blacks committed 433,934 crimes against whites, eight times the 55,685 whites committed against blacks. Interracial rape is almost exclusively black on white — with 14,000 assaults on white women by African Americans in 2007. Not one case of a white sexual assault on a black female was found in the FBI study.” Though blacks are outnumbered 5-to-1 in the population by whites, they commit eight times as many crimes against whites as the reverse. By those 2007 numbers, a black male was 40 times as likely to assault a white person as the reverse. If interracial crime is the ugliest manifestation of racism, what does this tell us about where racism really resides — in America? And if the FBI stats for 2007 represent an average year since the Tawana Brawley rape-hoax of 1987, over one-third of a million white women have been sexually assaulted by black males since 1987 — with no visible protest from the civil rights leadership. Today, 73 percent of all black kids are born out of wedlock. Growing up, these kids drop out, use drugs, are unemployed, commit crimes and are incarcerated at many times the rate of Asians and whites — or Hispanics, who are taking the jobs that used to go to young black Americans. Are white vigilantes or white cops really Black America’s problem? Obama seems not to think so. The Rev. Sharpton notwithstanding, he is touting Ray Kelly as a possible chief of homeland security.</Msg><Username>happy_sam007</Username><Timestamp>1374345401324</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 14:36:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374345908895-69</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Explains Black America To White America</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374328175618</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 09:49:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, spartacus... you will really stir up a hornets' nest with that one.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374345908895</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 14:45:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374345984520-70</Id><Topic><Title>God bless Travon and his family</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1374187645122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:47:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Trevon was lucky he made to be a teenager.

Far from committing suicide, MLK was planning to lead a half-million people to occupy Washington DC and stay there until the war and poverty were both ended. So – as a jury verdict legally established in 1999 – the US Army, FBI, and CIA worked together to murder Dr. King. The full story is in William Pepper’s book Act of State. Other “actionable threats” in recent history include JFK Jr., who was murdered in 1999 for pursuing the killers of his father and uncle; Senator Paul Wellstone, murdered in 2003 for planning to investigate 9/11 and prevent the US from invading Iraq; and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, killed with a cancer weapon for the crime of having enough charisma to almost single-handedly lead Latin America out from under the US empire. Malcolm Shabazz’s grandfather, Malcolm X, was also an “actionable threat” when the CIA orchestrated his assassination in 1965. Malcolm X was forging an anti-empire alliance consisting of Muslims and other non-Western victims of imperialism, along with poor and middle-class American whites and blacks…the same alliance Dr. King was assembling when he was killed three years later. And now, Malcolm Shabazz – who was forging an updated version of the same anti-empire alliance – is murdered in Mexico. Coincidence? Maybe. But look at it from the point of view of his likely murderers. From their perspective, Malcolm Shabazz seemed to be following in his grandfather’s footsteps. If they waited much longer to kill him, and let him establish his growing reputation as a respected activist, it would be a lot harder to stage an assassination and then spread the media propaganda line, based on the ancient history of his alleged teenage misdeeds, that he was “just a thug.” If they waited until his book was finished and published,</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374346531152</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 14:55:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374346754383-72</Id><Topic><Title>Evidence reveals Hastings was assasinated !</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374329275940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 10:07:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe they ALL should lay off the steak and potato salad.

John McNeil, 46, received a life sentence in November 2006 after killing a white man who was trespassing on his property. Police detectives investigating the case determined that McNeil acted in self-defense, but Cobb County District Attorney Pat Head decided a year later to try the case and won a conviction. The incident took place when McNeil arrived home after his teenage son had called him about an unfamiliar man lurking about their property. Brian Epp, a hired contractor with whom McNeil had past difficulties, had already pulled a knife on the teenager. Epp refused to leave, and McNeil, who had called 9-1-1, fired a warning shot into the ground. Epp then charged toward McNeil while reaching into his pocket. McNeil fatally shot him in the head at close range. Court documents state that a pocketknife was clipped inside Epp’s pants pocket. McNeil’s neighbors who witnessed the incident backed his story. Kennesaw police detectives investigated the case, decided that McNeil had acted in self-defense and didn’t charge him. McNeil’s self-defense claim is supported by Georgia’s “castle doctrine law,” which allows an individual to use deadly force to protect his or her home, or anyone inside it, from a violent trespasser. McNeil and his family thought the worst was over, until Head decided to pursue prosecution. During the trial, McNeil’s neighbors, the two senior detectives investigating the case and a couple who said that they felt threatened by Epp when they hired him to do work all testified in McNeil’s defense. All of those individuals are white. “We are victims at both ends of the gun,” said Marcus Coleman, who leads the Atlanta chapter of the National Action Network.</Msg><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1374348733161</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 15:32:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374348962669-83</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Explains Black America To White America</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374328175618</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 09:49:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, please...</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374348962669</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 15:36:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374349050884-84</Id><Topic><Title>One African-American's prespective on the killing of trayvon</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374346973535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 15:02:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>censored, 3 streets... neighborhood watchman for 4 years.

Instead, numerous studies confirm that racial biases -- both implicit and explicit -- persist in the United States. Implicit biases are the most difficult to counter because they are nonconsious ways of evaluating individuals. Racial stereotypes can even influence the behavior of people who embrace racial egalitarianism and condemn prejudice. One study of implicit racial bias shows that whites often view blacks as more aggressive than whites. When the victim was white and the person initiating the physical contact was black, seventy-five percent of the subjects interpreted the shove as violent. Only six percent described it as horsing around or dramatic. The results were markedly different when the victim was black and the pusher was white. In this scenario, only seventeen percent of the subjects labeled the contact as violent. Instead, forty-two percent of the subjects rated the white perpetrator as horsing around or being dramatic. Implicit racial biases might make it difficult for whites to view blacks as victims and whites as aggressors. If people accept racial stereotypes that make it difficult to believe that blacks can be victims or that whites can be aggressors, then they will likely credit Zimmerman's self-defense argument. Although the facts might clearly show that Zimmerman was the initial aggressor, racial stereotypes might prevent jurors from accepting these facts. Prosecutors will need to emphasize strongly that Zimmerman was the initial aggressor. To the extent that Martin inflicted physical harm upon Zimmerman, he acted in self-defense against an angry amateur police officer, who was tired of #$%$ and #$%$ committing crimes in his neighborhood. This case presents an excellent opportunity to discuss the operation of racial stereotypes in a supposedly post-racial society. Equal justice depends upon this vital dialogue taking place.</Msg><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1374350102621</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 15:55:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374351152426-90</Id><Topic><Title>NAACP Urges Freedom For Black Man Who Killed White Man In Self-Defense</Title><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1374348733161</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 15:32:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>except that she left the house- went to her car- got the gun- returned to the house and then fired a shot- into an adjoining room with two children nearby !! get yur facts first !!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1374351152426</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 16:12:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374351621686-91</Id><Title>Music Video: You Might Not Want to Know, But the Truth Must be Told</Title><Msg>Google: music video You Might Not Want to Know, But the Truth Must be Told</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374351621686</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 16:20:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374351709680-92</Id><Topic><Title>Appearance of a Doomed Detroit</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1374269112446</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 17:25:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How many years has Detroit been run by Democrat Mayors?

Address where Zimmerman's truck was located. An address has two components: street name and residence number. It was strange for him to not know the name of the street (given that they are so few), but he may have been stumbling to give an answer as he did not have visibility to the number - and he lived at the opposite end of the development. After he got out of his truck at 2:10 minutes into the 911 call and had been moving, he could not see what was the number of the building where his truck was parked. 2. Address where he lived. He did not want to give it out, he said, because he said he did not know where the presumed suspicious person was standing. It was dark; hence, he did not want the guy to overhear and then know where he lived. It had nothing to do with not wanting the police to know where he lived. They can find where you live through your cell phone number records. He had given them his phone number. 3. Whether Zimmerman continued to pursue Trayvon after being admonished by the operator that "we do not need you to do that" is pure speculation. But in that 4:10 minute phone call, he is only moving for about 20 - 25 seconds. It is very clear when Zimmerman is moving and when he is not moving. He starts moving moments after exiting his truck (you can hear the door chime at 2:10). At 2:28, the 911 operator says they didn’t need him to do that, and he stops walking 10 seconds later. You can hear that in his voice in terms of "huffing and puffing". 4. Zimmerman was not the "block captain", he was the area coordinator and was recruiting block captains.

I know that it is unprofitable (i.e., use of my time) to provide extensive proof and background and facts and data, but what I am about to say is simply freely there for any honest person to read on the internet: 1. Trayvon Martin was actively and often attempting to obtain an illegal weapon (a 22 or 38). He had identified the necessary cost, $150., even included images on his phone to demonstrate his interest. (cell phone images and text) 2. He was kicked out of the house by his mother for fighting. (his text messages) 3. He regularly smoked dope (his words and those of Rachel Jeantel, and photos of himself). 4. He was kicked out of school three times for drugs, vandalism, and theft (undisputed fact, multiple sources). 5. He was 95% a full grown man (mathematics). 6. His hundreds of tweets were so foul and filthy that even Obama would be embarrassed (DailyCaller). 7. He engaged in fights in and out of school (his test msgs). 8. He referred to himself as a “gangsta” (his test msgs). 9. His phone contained a couple videos that he took showing a bicyclist being beaten up. He did nothing – other than laugh and encourage the beating (his cell phone). There was an interesting text exchange with (most likely Jeantel) where she said that she was praying for him and encouraged him to pray for himself. No response. Let’s say that he was a Christian, having accepted Jesus as his Savior when he was younger. Then it is very possible the Lord took him home before he took someone else’s life. Basis? 1 Corinthians 5:5 is a verse of scripture wherein a Christian has so strayed from the Lord that the Apostle Paul declared, “hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.” Whether Trayvon did or did not know Jesus, we cannot know, but what is clear: he was a troubled young man whose behavior had taken him down the wrong path.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1374370105126</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 21:28:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374370415471-114</Id><Topic><Title>Geroge Zimmerman got a Fair Trial</Title><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1374354781046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 17:13:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is a sad reflection on the state of our nation that there are so many who are utterly CERTAIN they know what happened that night, based purely on bias, willful ignorance.... and hate</Msg><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1374370415471</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 21:33:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374370628426-115</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking News .</Title><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1374288852616</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 22:54:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just like cg to try to do a switch.

I have only repeated what Trayvon said about himself. It is HIS witness not mine. If it is false, then he is at least a liar.

(Matthew 15:11) And Trayvon apparently had a lot of "stuff" coming out of his mouth falling into that "defile" category.
