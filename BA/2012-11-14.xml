So Ron, sorry, once more you do not get the facts. Ron since this is a stock market blog site, I can make suggestions on stocks , you can spread your hate message if you want, that is spam and not allowed but if you want go ahead, I could care less. Or you can post worthless boeing pane deliveries without pointing out they are mostly at a loss. I like it, why, because you loose on Boeing and others learn about Boeing and I win. Ron, since you need more stock market training, even if you can't understand or accept it, here is your next lesson, since Obama won, and Obama is for clean energy, I was in CLNE today, as it is a Obama style, clean energy stock and per my charting was a buy,( it has run down to a support@ 11 but now it is at the r1 and close to the 25mda,@ 12.44, so no more run up for now) I was at 100k, my minimum get in, I like CLNE as it is a Pelosi pumped and owned company, I do not think it is worth anything, but that does not matter, I made a nice 3K today, nice --- as I want to make money on the government pumping of the stock maket. Ron, , today I did real good on that one. Tomorrow, there will be two bad economic reports and I will make a ton on JRCC if I am right,( I will watch the pre market and the international markets ) so when the economic reports come out tomorrow I will be ready at the open or later in the day or not depending upon what happens, but then your not willing to accept that Boeing has made nothing in 11 months so why would you be ready to make any money tomorrow? BTW Ron, apple is up 34.5% year to date and Boeing is up .01% year to date and if you shorted apple your up 54% Nice try Ron, as a shill for Boeing, your doing your job as you see it. Ha Ron thankyou this post is back on top and all can see who is making a point here.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1352869488838</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 00:04:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352872115817-2</Id><Topic><Title>12 billion to Airbus and Boeing started the lawsuit, next the SPEEA fight, what will that cost Boeing ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1352830133744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 13:08:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I never said I owned BA.

Apple has the largest market capitalization of any corporation in the U.S. Given how much time we spend working for and interacting with corporations every day, it’s unsurprising that we tend to see them as a natural part of our social fabric. But it’s important to remember that what happens at work and what corporations do in the political system can matter as much for individual freedom and representative politics as our rights against the government. Corporations, of course, are not naturally occurring entities. They are the product of state laws, and they have been reshaped regularly throughout American history by courts and legislatures in order to respond to changing societal needs. In a piece Demos published yesterday titled What is a Corporation?, I tried to describe how the corporation has changed over time and how, more recently, conservative jurists have transformed the corporation into a less democratic, less accountable entity. By seeing corporations as natural, “private” entities with rights, we risk missing the potential that the corporate form and corporate governance could have in expanding the freedoms of the majority of our lives. Rather than conferring corporations with First Amendment rights that shield them from democratic accountability as conservative members of the Supreme Court have recently done, we should see corporate law as one of the most direct and effective ways to address societal problems. As recently as 1990, a majority of the Supreme Court explicitly acknowledged that corporations received serious economic advantages from the State and could therefore be regulated to prevent those state-conferred advantages from disrupting the political process: State law grants corporations special advantages — such as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets — that enhance their ability to attract capital and to deploy their resources in ways that maximize the return on their shareholders' investments.These state-created advantages not only allow corporations to play a dominant role in the Nation's economy, but also permit them to use "resources amassed in the economic marketplace" to obtain "an unfair advantage in the political marketplace." Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652, 658-59 (1990). It is only by returning to a more historically rooted understanding of corporations—as a changeable, democratically accountable product of state laws—that their progressive potential can be unlocked and democratic supremacy restored. Until then, the there’s good reason to expect that corporate rights will continue to enlarge the freedom of the powerful to ignore the freedoms of everyone else.</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1352875380407</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 01:43:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352875957056-6</Id><Topic><Title>12 billion to Airbus and Boeing started the lawsuit, next the SPEEA fight, what will that cost Boeing ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1352830133744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 13:08:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So you made 3K today?

So Ron what about making another 20% going short after apple peaked, if you use a chart it is pretty easy to see. Ron, if you used your brain, then when you read about Apple having riots on the assembly line , ,you know Ron, just like SPEEA and the Boeing Company having a dispute---- it is not a time to be long a stock like Apple or Boeing. So Ron you use your brain and think about it( not hate and sick attempts to catch me in some kind of intellectual game of argument. So Ron I will have to post other facts about Boeing now as you clearly are not getting it. So , Ron boeing is not a stock to go long on as the 787 cost 30 billion extra to build and is 3 years late so Ron, ( sure you hve no boeing stock your just wasting your time here being a hater) Ron, ha ha ha, Ron, ,you do not invest in Boeing. Ron when the apple product was released with bad maps you do not go long you short, Ron are you learning yet? Nope Ron your not interested in learning on the boeing message board. soi Ron did I point out that Boeing has made nothing for the shareholders year to date yet? Ron, Nope your not getting it are you Ron. So if Boeing only sold 5, 747 planes this year and Boeing 747 development costs on the 747 exceeded the estimates by 2 billion over budget for the 747 and the delivery is 2 years late you would not be in Boeing stock .Ron did I mention that because of failure to produce the product on time and working boeing is not a stock to own,nor apple right now. Boeing has made nothing this year. Apple was so high a price (700) it was easy to short. Ron, stock price is bad not too high or too low a dead stock, so Ron Boeing has been in a dead cat bounce mode for years @ 65 to 75 but nothing to make money on, not like jrcc or clne or amd today. So Ron still attempting to use your brain and having fun at my expense. I heard your not very good at it, a guy at Renton told me that . Ron , this is fun at your expense. Ron, try the 5 million again maybe if you repeat it something will change! or not ha ha ha</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1352879115758</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 02:45:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352879523454-8</Id><Topic><Title>12 billion to Airbus and Boeing started the lawsuit, next the SPEEA fight, what will that cost Boeing ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1352830133744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 13:08:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Wayne, are you the former dell.george and fred.james48?</Msg><Username>ronanderson727</Username><Timestamp>1352879523454</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 02:52:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352880285592-9</Id><Title>Boeing costs, accounting for pensions, and no profits</Title><Msg>American airline has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcies and its order for 460 aircrafts from Boeing and Airbus is in the hand of bankruptcy court Southwest delaying its orders of 30 737 aircraft for four years to conserve capital, Southwest loss $18 million, Southwest blamed the $478 million increase on fuel costs compared to the same quarter last year Delta airline and other have delay or cancelled their order for aircrafts for several years (2020 Boeing Co. is studying different ways to account for pension expenses, which reduced the aerospace company's third-quarter earnings. Chief Financial Officer Gregory D. Smith said Tuesday that Boeing is considering several options, including making no change. The options under review include changing to mark-to-market accounting, which would take into consideration changes in the value of pension assets and obligations. It could, however, introduce more swings in earnings reports because the current accounting method spreads out gains and losses from assets over several years. This is an accounting act that will pretend to make the 2 billion shortfall less on the Boeing accounting format, but the money is still owed and the pension is underfunded. The bottom line is the story of Boeing will be planted like the 747 and the 787 two plane programs that will never make a dime for the shareholders. Boeing said the production doubled on the 787 that is like saying a cent doubled is 2 cents , true but it still is worthless. Both planes delivered 747 and 787 make nothing and the pension owed , changed to mark to market is still 2 billion. A 787 makes a gross sales of 225 to 250 million , the net is 7.5% per plane but the cost is 32 billion (wikipedia) at 100% so at net prifit of 7.5% on 250 million with less than 1000 planes on order this plane will make no money for the shareholder ever . With 5 747 on order for this year the 2 billion above the original development cost will not make any money. the old 737 is the only real money maker and the 777X is going to be late like the 737max and over budget.

I love it when idiot union members – unthinking mobs – shoot themselves in the foot. It’s happened again, and I’ll try not to laugh out loud as I tell you about it. Hostess Brands … you know, the folks who make Twinkies, Ho Hos and other such goodies as well as Wonder Bread, declared bankruptcy last January. Now this was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That means that Hostess was asking the Bankruptcy Court for protection from its creditors as it tried to reorganize so that the business would be profitable and sustainable. Hostess asked for, and the court granted, permission to force certain concessions regarding wages on benefits on the labor unions representing its workers. This is why we have Chapter 11 bankruptcies. The theory behind Chapter 11 is that it is better to allow a company to reorganize by restructuring its debt and agreements with labor unions than it is for the company to simply shut down and put all of the workers on the streets and the lenders with unpaid loans. Well … as you might expect … the union workers didn’t like this even one little bit. The took a strike vote and prepared to walk out. Hostess CEO Gregory Rayburn made it clear to the unions and to the media that he would flat-out close – shut down – any Hostess facilities that were no longer able to produce and deliver products because of union action. The unions chose to ignore his warning and went on strike last Friday. Who knows, maybe they were feeling emboldened by the victory of their hero Barack Obama. At three plants non-union workers refused to cross the union picket lines, and these locations were permanently closed. Over 650 union jobs … gone. Now on the show today you’re going to hear some audio from one of these union members. You will hear him say that “all you want to do is just take our jobs away from us.” Well, union dude, here’s a hint. Those are NOT your jobs. Those jobs belong to the company – to Hostess. They created those jobs, not you. You were looking for a job. They had a job. You found the job. It’s theirs. They let you do it in exchange for money and benefits. You didn’t give them a damn thing. You traded work for money. By the way, union dude, you need to brush up on your English before you go looking fo another gig. It’s a buyer’s market right now. Potential employers aren’t impressed with people who say “we ain’t got no ….” Just a friendly hint.

Why is that? Because these figures show that raising taxes on the rich will do absolutely nothing to reduce our deficit. Let’s be clear: Raising taxes has nothing to do with our fiscal cliff and getting our finances in order. Just how much deficit reduction would Obama’s tax hikes on the rich necessarily accomplish? Nothing, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Letting tax rates rise to Clinton era levels for those families making over $250,000 a year would only raise $824 billion over ten years. That is not even enough revenue to undo the sequester that Obama promised “will not happen” during his final debate with Mitt Romney. Yesterday, Obama met with union leaders and other progressives to discuss the fiscal cliff. You will be happy to hear, “Labor leaders said they plan to mobilize their members in the coming weeks to press Republicans to support the extension of tax cuts for middle income families” in order to make sure that “the middle class and workers don’t end up paying the tab for a party that we didn’t get to go to.” Just remember folks that Obama’s insistence on these tax increases has nothing to do with logic and math; his true reason for raising taxes is to aid in his class warfare agenda. Period. End of story. Obama despises rich people because of his historical understanding of our evil colonialist and oppressive capitalism ways. Now that he is president, he can correct that damage … right those wrongs. Beyond this pathetic bid to raise income taxes, he will also work to impose a wealth tax. It is coming, folks.

The world's biggest airline is considering the 350-seat plane to replace older Boeing 747s, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. United already has agreed to buy 25 of the mid-sized A350-900. A United order would help Toulouse, France-based Airbus in its effort to loosen Boeing's grip on the market for large twin- aisle aircraft. "This will be a big wake-up call for Boeing," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, a Fairfax, Va.-based aerospace forecasting company.

Airbus is promising the A350-1000's first delivery by 2017 and promotes it as 25 percent more efficient than a 777-300ER, partly because it uses more lightweight composite materials.

For more than 50 years, Boeing flight crew training has only been provided by full-time, experienced Boeing pilots. According to an internal Boeing announcement, flight crews at Qatar Airways and LAN Airlines are scheduled to be the first Boeing customers to receive flight crew training from temporary, contract pilots. The temporary pilots have little of the advanced training required to become, and maintain qualification as, a full-time Boeing pilot, according to the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), IFPTE Local 2001, which represents the full-time pilots who belong to the Airplane Manufacturing Pilots Association (AMPA). In some cases, the temp pilots have less than one hour at the controls of the 787, according to the union. “This means these ‘instructor pilots’ are ‘training’ Qatar and LAN pilots who have orders of magnitude more actual flight time and experience in the 787 than they do,” said Ray Goforth, executive director of SPEEA. “Full-time Boeing instructor pilots are available to support Qatar and LAN, but Boeing is choosing to risk its reputation and stick these customers with minimally qualified contract pilots in order to save a few nickels.” In August, AMPA pilots unanimously voted ‘No Confidence’ in management at Boeing Training &amp; Flight Services in an effort to raise attention and alert airplane customers to the scheme to substitute temp pilots for the genuine Boeing pilots customers paid for. Launch customer All Nippon Airways (ANA), along with Japan Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, and Air India have, thus far, received flight training from full-time Boeing pilots. “The humiliation for LAN and Qatar in having these temp pilots pawned off on them is startling,” said Goforth. “Did Boeing even tell these customers that they’re not worth being served by genuine Boeing training pilots?” Unlike Boeing instructor pilots, the contract pilots did not participate in the flight test and certification program of the 787. Pilot training for airline customers is part of the complete line assist and flight training package Boeing includes with the purchase of a new commercial airplane. “When Boeing customers buy a 787, they expect experienced flight and training instructors,” said Goforth. “They don’t expect Boeing to give them a temp flight instructor who has little, if any, actual experience flying the aircraft they are training others to fly.”</Msg><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1352915826033</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 12:57:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352917165833-28</Id><Title>Boeing net income down 6% year over year, pensions costs set to increase, stock price down over 1% for the year</Title><Msg>Boeing's net income in the third quarter fell 6 percent, because of higher pension expenses..

The planted 787 story that a Boeing supporter constantly repeats here on the Boeing message board about Boeing deliveries is not a good thing for shareholders( 787 &amp; 747) as each 787 and 747 delivered is at least 3 years late(787) and two year late(747) and part of the 32 billion dollar over cost estimate due to the failed “cheap” out sourcing failure for the 787 or 2 billion over budget for the 747. The real story is not deliveries but the fact that Boeing share price is down over 1% year to date , the income is down year over year 6% and while Boeing claims there is a huge demand for planes, the facts are that the planes in demand like the 777 are being filled by Airbus new plane not Boeings 777X which is on hold, The 787 and the 747 will make no money, in fact each delivery costs the shareholders a loss as the planes were not made within the budget or on time so the deliveries are discounted to a loss.

UPDATE #7: LINKED BY TOM NELSON! THANKS TOM! Like what you see? Follow me on Twitter This post will be the first in a series in which I attempt to bring some clarity to the profitability - or, more accurately, lack thereof - of the Volt. There is a lot of misinformation floating around regarding the Chevrolet Volt. Recently reporters have unearthed some very useful data about the economics of the Volt. Unfortunately, these reporters clearly lack the basic financial and accounting knowledge to turn that data into useful information, and instead have muddied the waters with foolish claims, such as Reuters' assertion that Chevy loses $49,000 on every Volt it makes. I explain why this claim is faulty in this post. For this post, I have modeled out the current and prospective profitability of the Volt, using publicly available data and estimates, as well as some estimates of my own. My estimates are certainly open to debate, but on balance I believe that I have erred on the side of generosity to GM. THE BOTTOM LINE: even with generous assumptions, the first generation of the Chevrolet Volt will consume about $1 billion in federal tax credits, and STILL result in an economic loss to GM shareholders in excess of $600 million over its lifetime.Without the subsidies, the cumulative loss would triple to $1.8 billion. Let's start with a look at the Volt's cost of production. Reuters published estimates of the Volt's marginal cost of production ranging from $20,000 to $32,000. That's an awfully wide range. For the purposes of this exercise, I will use the midpoint: $26,000. At that cost of production, the marginal Volt is quite profitable. The MSRP is $39.995. Of course, even if someone pays the full sticker price, GM doesn't see the entire $39,995. Dealers have to eat, too. According to Bob Lutz, who ought to know, GM sees a dealer net price of about $37,000, implying an $11,000 profit margin on each marginal Volt sold. That's nice work if you can get it, but there are some mitigating factors. Margins Swollen By Subsidies: The first factor is that the buyer isn't actually paying the $39,995 MSRP because he's getting a $7,500 federal tax credit. In other words, fully 68% of the profit on the marginal Volt is the result not of GM's creation of economic value, but of GM's rent-seeking. The money is still green, but it suggests that the volume of Volt sales, weak as it is, is artificially propped up. Absent the tax credit, which expires after 200,000 qualifying sales, GM either sells far fewer Volts at the same profit margin, or the same number of Volts at a much lower profit margin. Model Year-End Discounting: The second is that GM is actually employing some pretty significant incentives - reportedly about $10,000 per vehicle, mainly in the form of highly subsidized leases. This is probably the driving force behind the Volt's record sales volume in September. This isn't the end of the world; it's just the end of the model year. Presumably GM is moving aggressively to clear out the 2012 models, and will dial back the incentives once the 2012 models are gone. And if their marginal production cost really is around $26,000, then they are still eking out a modest profit on those heavily subsidized leases. The one caveat is that leasing entails making assumptions about the Volt's residual value, even though there is little data on which to base those estimates, so the profits GM prints today could be illusory, and wind up being offset by writedowns when those 2-year leases begin expiring in 2014. Low Margins On Fleet Sales: The third is that some proportion of Volt sales are to fleet buyers at substantially reduced margins. I haven't seen a lot of data on fleet sales. In fact, I could only come up with three data points from various media reports. Fleet sales accounted for 35% of sales in December 2011, 7% in March 2012, and 3% in June 2012. The 35% is certainly an outlier. The mid-point of the other two data points, or 5%, seems like a conservative placeholder in the absence of better data. On the other hand, anecdotal evidence suggests that unless retail Volt sales significantly accelerate, the proportion of lower-margin fleet sales will rise. General Electric alone has said that it will purchase 12,000 Volts by 2015, and the Department of Defense is buying 1,500. Despite this, in the model I assume that 95% of Volt sales are at the MSRP and earn GM $11,000, and 5% are fleet sales at $30,000, yielding a profit of $4,000. This gives us an estimated weighted average profit margin of $10,650 per vehicle, before accounting for development costs. Development Costs: Reuters reported that GM spent approximately $1.2 billion bringing the Volt to market. If true, then at an average profit of $10,650 per vehicle, GM just needs to sell 112,676 Volts (total development costs divided by average unit profitability) over the next few years to break even, right? Not so fast. Capital Costs: That $1.2 billion spent to bring the Volt to market didn't just fall from the sky. To the extent it was borrowed, GM incurred interest expenses. And any money that wasn't borrowed belonged to GM's shareholders, and if GM is going to invest it on their behalf, it needs to earn enough of a return to make the risks worthwhile. Otherwise, GM should just return the money to shareholders, who can spend it, or invest it elsewhere, as they see fit. The question of how much of a return shareholders require depends on things like the mix of debt and equity used, and how risky the investment is. There is no single, definite answer, and such discussions can quickly become very abstract, so in the interests of caution and simplicity I will assume a cost of capital of only 10%. I will also make the generous assumption that the $1.2 billion was invested in equal $400 million increments in 2008, 2009, and 2010. In reality, some meaningful chunk of that money was spent in prior years - the Volt concept car was introduced in 2007 - and so the real-world compounded required return may well be higher than in my model. Sales Volume: Finally, the big question is, how many Volts can GM sell? Ultimately, if they sell enough of them, they will earn back their investment, including the cost of capital, and can declare victory, albeit a hugely subsidized one. According to publicly available data, GM sold 326 Volts in the U.S. in December 2010, 7,671 in 2011, and 16,348 through September 2012. The surge in 2012 is a bit misleading since 35% of the year-to-date sales came in August and September, concurrent with those margin-destroying incentives. Foreign Sales Count, Too: On the other hand, Volt sales are not limited to the U.S. The Chevy Volt is sold as the Vauxhall Ampera in the UK, the Opel Ampera in continental Europe, and the Holden Volt in Australia and New Zealand. In the first five months of 2012 - the only data I could find - GM sold 2,284 Amperas, equal to 32% of sales in the U.S. during the same period. I have no idea about subsidies, or the retail/fleet breakdown, or overall profitability of overseas sales, so let's err on the side of generosity, and assume that GM can sell one Volt somewhere overseas for every three it sells here, at the same pre-subsidy profit margin (despite the very real possibility that total auto sales in Europe may be more likely to collapse then grow). For the purposes of this exercise, I assume that GM sells 2,000 Volts per month for the remainder of 2012 (lower than the August-September rate due to the presumed termination of model year-end incentives), rising to 2,500 per month in 2013, 3,000 per month in 2014 and 2015. In other words, I assume no decline in first generation Volt sales even as the second-generation Volt starts coming to market in 2015. This again errs on the side of caution in judging the continued marketability of first-generation technology in a highly competitive market. I concede that it is entirely possible that the Volt suddenly takes off, and GM sells many more Volts than I have modeled here. Or lots of the forthcoming Cadillac ELR Hydrid, which I have left out entirely although it ostensibly will further monetize GM's investment in the Volt's technology. But I am aware of no evidence to date that would support such speculation. It is also quite possible that non-fleet, non-incentivized sales flatline. This uncertainty is why I have tried to give GM the benefit of the doubt with respect to various estimates. As noted above, one could quite reasonably assume a higher required rate of return on capital, lower sales and/or margins, and wind up with losses greater by an order of magnitude than what I have estimated. Note that I also assume away tax effects. This is another act of generosity, since even if (as I expect) the Volt fails to turn an economic profit, it could still turn a nominal profit and incur tax liabilities. Finally, this all assumes that there are no recessions or economic shocks over the remaining life of the first-generation Volt that could cause demand to collapse. With all that said, here is the analysis. I lack the skills to insert an Excel table here (if someone knows how I'd be grateful if they'd let me know), so I'll just describe the numbers year-by year (all amounts pre-tax): 2008: $400 million in development costs, and the 10% cost of that capital, produce both an annual and cumulative loss of $440 million. 2009: Another $400 million in development costs, and another 10% charge for the cost of invested capital, produce an annual loss of $484 million and a cumulative loss of $924 million. 2010: Another $400 million in development costs, and another 10% charge for the cost of invested capital, along with an estimated $3.9 million in profit on the 326 Volts sold, leads to a $528 million annual loss, and $1.45 billion cumulative loss. 2011: No more development costs (we've already accounted for the full $1.2 billion in prior years), but a charge of $145 million on the total invested capital, against an estimated profit of $81.7 million on 7,671 Volts sold nets out to a $64 million annual loss and $1.52 billion cumulative loss. 2012: The Volt's first profitable year, as $152 million in capital costs are offset by $198 million in profit on 22,348 Volts sold in the US and $23 million in profit on 7,375 Volts sold abroad. Annual profit of $70 million reduces cumulative loss to $1.45 billion. One caveat: I have reduced domestic profits by $40 million ($20 million in August and $20 million in September) to account for the profits lost to the high model year-end incentives. 2013: $145 million in capital costs are offset by $320 million in profits on 30,000 Volts sold in the US, and $31 million in profits on 9,900 Volts sold abroad. Annual profit of $206 million reduces cumulative loss to $1.24 billion. 2014: $124 million in capital costs are offset by $383 million in profit on 36,000 Volts sold in the U.S., and $37 million in profit on 11,880 Volts sold abroad. Annual profit of $297 million reduces cumulative loss to $944 million. 2015: $94 million in capital costs are offset by $383 million in profit on 36,000 Volts sold in the U.S., and $37 million in profit on 11,880 Volts sold abroad. Annual profit of $326 million reduces cumulative loss to $617 million. A $600 million loss after subsidies: So after accounting for all the costs, and trying to err on the side of caution with estimates, the Chevy Volt would have cost GM shareholders $617 million, and U.S. taxpayers just under $1 billion. And with less generous but eminently plausible assumptions about the cost of capital, and sales volumes and margins, the loss to GM shareholders could easily top $1.5 billion. Without subsidies, the loss would be $1.8 billion: Just for fun, I ran the numbers on what the loss to GM shareholders would be without the $7,500 tax subsidy on each sale. Leaving all other estimates the same, the cumulative loss at year-end 2015 roughly triples, to $1.8 billion.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1352920135345</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 14:08:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352920556550-35</Id><Topic><Title>12 billion to Airbus and Boeing started the lawsuit, next the SPEEA fight, what will that cost Boeing ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1352830133744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 13:08:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>don't get your hopes up to do any "jousting with me", not interested, BA year over year 6% down on bottom line,stock price down over 1% this year, 747 and 787 cost too much to develop will make no money, pension costs going up, accounting formate being reviewed to hide the 2 billion and counting reporting requirements like the banks going to different accounting.

The company now sells $8.3 billion worth of hospital beds, artificial joints, medical cameras, and medical software every year. Stryker, a member of the Forbes 400 list, was one of the top five donors to the Obama campaign. Having donated $2 million to the Priorities USA Action super PAC, Stryker also gave $66,000 in contributions to Obama and the Democrat Party. Prior to the 2012 election, Stryker contributed millions to help Democrat candidates in his home state of Michigan. He also gave nearly $250 million to groups supporting gay rights, transgenderism, and the conservation of apes. In January, his Arcus Foundation donated $23 million to Kalamazoo College for an endowment to fund a center for social justice leadership.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1352924050581</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 15:14:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352925698186-42</Id><Topic><Title>deliveries thru 10 November</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1352676183371</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 18:23:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your obvious support of Boeing clearly clouds your vision and inhibits your ability to accept facts in evidence,( Boeing stock price today is down 2.69% year to date ) each 787 delivered is at a loss for the shareholder these plane deliveries are nothing more than a planted news story with no substance related to how the planes are delivered late and over budget.( same problem on the 747) The Boeing company has made 6% less revenue, year over year due to increased pension costs and with more than 50% of the workforce close to retirement that cost of doing business will increase .

Without these discussions, it is impossible to negotiate new contracts. Boeing needs to see tangible metrics of members’ dissatisfaction to persuade them to be realistic and get this deal done.

I am a Gonaza MBA graduate witha 3.9 GPA and was selected to become a CPA candidate by my professor who wanted to prepare me for the CPA exam. , so I have skills . Falmouther, it seems to me that your understanding of Boeing financial statements is lacking, pehaps you don't care to actually examine them or forget that three of the past four CFO's of Boeing were let go for problems associated with their accounting processes. If you want to put your head in the sand and act like a delivery of a 747 or a 787 is a good thing go ahead, but it is not a money maker, did you miss revenues are down 6% year over year by Boeing's own accounting figures , do you understand what revenue is compared to gross sales, go ahead, your making my point here . Mike Sears was put in prison for unethical conduct so his accounting is highly suspect. Another female Boeing CFO resigned right after she accounted for all the quartly OT on the 747 by moving the OT ahead to another quarter( fraud) to make the Boeing books for the Boeing quarterly report look good,I was there and know it for a fact. The other time CFO was retired when he could not account for the quarterly reports to managment and would not give them what he was asked to provide. So your financial reports story is just that. . A recent example is in the news right now , and Boeing is thinking of restating the pensions cost like the failed banks did. Remember Boeing books are just that, Boeing books and their auditors are their paid auditors. The analysts are independent and that is where I got my figures, their information is free public information. You seem to miss that Boeing stock price is down for the year and do not accept that Boeing plane deliveries account for that fact. All I see here is that you are using the excuse that figures are mine.

Investors and customers will be pretty upset if we walk out. Boeing is making record profits, record plane orders and is designing the USAF tanker now. So much is ongoing with this company yet they refuse to share the wealth of the company with those that got them there. Something has to give and the clock is ticking. This is a highly skilled workforce and Boeing isn't some fast food joint. If you want to be the best you need to present yourself as the best. Offloading to 3rd world countries and backyard farmers in So. Carolina is not the way to success, only rejection tags, rework, and customers upset about delaminations, malfunctioning planes and worse. Lets get serious finally and put this to rest.</Msg><Username>ev3044</Username><Timestamp>1352944448444</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 20:54:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352947401188-70</Id><Topic><Title>THANKS OBAMA</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1352928832206</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 16:33:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does this mean that Bronco Bama will still be up to his old cowboy rope tricks for 4 more years?</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1352947401188</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 21:43:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352949372163-71</Id><Topic><Title>THANKS OBAMA</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1352928832206</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 16:33:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... for four more years of gubberment checks .

The 'tard would just as soon see something destroyed if he/she/GLT can't have it, so, since the Liberal is the dimocrap party "base", hateful envious policies toward rich people are a "plank" in that party's "platform" . Elections have consequences . P.S. election exit polls indicated a majority of voters do not favor higher taxes for the rich (47% want it), but most (51%) say government is too big already . The trouble for Romney was that most already think that the economy is not fair to average Americans, and that he would make that worse (socialist propaganda) . Further, they do not care about the deficit problem, and are only barely aware of it . (they don't cover that on SeeBS news .) Y.T.
