Despite the fact that the Florida-based National Black Republican Association (NBRA) associates itself with the GOP, a number of the articles of impeachment refer to activities undertaken by the Obama administration that have been supported by establishment Republicans, such as mass NSA surveillance, the illegal torture program and the treatment of whistleblowers like Edward Snowden. This non-partisan broadside against Obama makes the articles of impeachment less easy to dismiss as merely a Republican group with an axe to grind. Citing the Declaration of Independence and the need “to free ourselves and our fellow citizens from governmental tyranny,” the articles note that Obama “has intimidated whistleblowers and brought twice as many prosecutions against whistleblowers as all prior presidents combined, also pointing out that, “while refusing to prosecute anyone for actual torture, (Obama) prosecuted former Central Intelligence Agency employee John Kiriakou for disclosing the torture program.”</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376482386107</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 08:13:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376482497661-27</Id><Topic><Title>Black Citizens Group Files ‘Articles of Impeachment’ Against Obama</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376482386107</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 08:13:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The articles slam Obama for his administration’s role in failing to secure the US consulate in Benghazi and then subsequently launching a cover-up to hide the true nature of the incident, including subjecting CIA agents to regular polygraph tests to ensure they don’t leak information about an arms smuggling operation based near the consulate that saw weapons smuggled to Al-Qaeda militants in Syria. The articles also mention the Department of Justice’s role in wiretapping over a hundred Associated Press journalists as well as Fox News reporter James Rosen. Article 6 lambastes Obama for having authorized and permitted, “(1) the National Security Agency to conduct or continue electronic surveillance of over 300 million average Americans; (2) given access to National Security Agency surveillance data to other intelligence units within the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security in violation of the law; and (3) conducted the surveillance of average Americans unconstrained by Congress, the United Supreme Court or the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court which has, to this date, functioned as a rubber stamp, having approved every request made of it in 2012 and rejecting only two of the 8,591 requests submitted between 2008 and 2012.” Other articles focus on the IRS’ harassment of Tea Party groups as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives trafficking guns to Mexican drug dealers under Operation Fast and Furious. Some of the articles of impeachment listed also echo those first launched by Infowars in January. The NBRA has done an exemplary job in compiling such a well written and detailed list. Hopefully this will serve to help a lot of black people and other Obama loyalists wake up to the fact that despite his promises of “hope” and “change,” Obama has fronted one of the most unconstitutional administrations in US history.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376482497661</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 08:14:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376482565856-28</Id><Topic><Title>Only sparty can go swimming in sweden !!</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1376452199952</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 23:49:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Only sparty can go swimming in Sweden" True..only those with Big Brass ones</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376482565856</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 08:16:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376482710841-29</Id><Topic><Title>I will tell you under the Cone of Silence</Title><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1376440342070</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 20:32:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>------------- --------------------- ----- ----------------------------------</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376482710841</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 08:18:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376482823183-30</Id><Topic><Title>Why the Anger?</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1376423902032</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 15:58:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Real Clear Politics now has Obonzo at a -7.4 spread on job approval.

Last month, the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit in Richmond, Virginia, ruled that Risen could not claim a reporter's privilege under the first amendment to win exemption from being compelled to testify. In effect, the court has ruled that the journalist must reveal his source. That sets a dangerous precedent now applicable in Maryland and Virginia, home to the NSA and CIA – the very states in which national security journalism matters most. If a reporter cannot guarantee confidentiality to an important source willing to provide information that may be of vital public interest, the job of journalism itself has been criminalised. If a reporter like Risen refuses to co-operate and name names, he himself may face time behind bars. Indeed, like a dedicated few before him, Risen has vowed to go to prison rather than break his vow of confidentiality in the courtroom. Although there will almost certainly be an appeal, the court's ruling is a potentially devastating blow to investigative journalism. Given its significance, it is shocking how little publicity the Risen/Sterling case has yet received from major media outlets with a direct interest in its outcome. The Obama administration's war on whistleblowers coupled with the court's ruling against watchdog reporters highlight the federal government's efforts to curb the flow of information from both ends. No one disputes that at times journalists have a duty of care when entrusted with secret information with possible national security implications, but Risen is critical of how government officials will use this argument cynically to delay or suppres</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376483599811</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 08:33:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376483768577-33</Id><Title>The U.S. Military Has Awarded Contracts To Al-Qaeda In Afghanistan</Title><Msg>By Tony Capaccio, Bloomberg July 29, 2013 “Supporters of the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan have been getting U.S. military contracts, and American officials are citing “due process rights” as a reason not to cancel the agreements, according to an independent agency monitoring spending. The U.S. Army Suspension and Debarment Office has declined to act in 43 such cases, John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, said today in a letter accompanying a quarterly report to Congress. “I am deeply troubled that the U.S. military can pursue, attack, and even kill terrorists and their supporters, but that some in the U.S. government believe we cannot prevent these same people from receiving a government contract,” Sopko said. The 236-page report and Sopko’s summary provide one of the watchdog agency’s most critical appraisals of U.S. performance in helping to build a stable Afghanistan as the Pentagon prepares to withdraw combat troops by the end of next year. “There appears to be a growing gap between the policy objectives of Washington and the reality of achieving them in Afghanistan, especially when the government must hire and oversee contractors to perform its mission,” said Sopko, whose post was mandated by Congress.”</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376483768577</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 08:36:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376484034293-34</Id><Title>Where are all the Black Race Pimps and White Liberal Bigots?</Title><Msg>“Three 15-yr-old black teens beat up a 13-yr-old white kid because he told school officials they tried to sell him drugs,” the former Army colonel wrote on his Facebook page. “Do you hear anything from Sharpton, Jackson, NAACP, Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z, liberal media, or Hollywood?

Yeah, right. Oprah addressed the media at the premiere of "The Butler" in L.A. last night -- backpedaling after the shop in question started to refute O's allegations of racism during an incident last month. The shop owner says the whole thing was a "misunderstanding" and had "nothing to do with racism." Last night, Oprah said ... "I think that incident in Switzerland was just an incident in Switzerland. I'm really sorry that it got blown up. I purposefully did not mention the name of the store. I'm sorry that I said it was Switzerland." Problem is ... O's full of it. What did she think was going to happen when she went on national TV and cried racism? The media was just going to ignore that?? Oprah once ragged on hamburgers and single-handedly CRIPPLED the beef industry. She knew damn well how the media was going to handle the Switzerland situation ... which is why she went to the media in the first place. Her mission was to destroy the shop. There are some people who are saying Oprah's Swiss encounter wasn't really about race -- Oprah was just mad she wasn't treated like Her Royal O-ness because the shop employee didn't recognize her ... but now, after the employee told the media she's being unfairly attacked, O's feeling a little guilty. But pretending not to know about the impact of her race allegations?? That's like Obama pretending not to know what's gonna happen if he pushes that big red button in the White House. C'mon O ... you're smarter than that.

The MET scientists are now suggesting we need to rethink CO2 increases in light of growing human population and future water stress. Of course salamander brained llinear thinkers like Hoodz and Obonzo are #$%$ there pants in fear that CO2 will kill them, and doing all they can to stifle debate and frighten low IQ adults and children.

This could be devastating for Bill and Hillary</Title><Msg>Today it runs with a fascinating takedown of the Clinton Foundation – that vast vanity project that conservatives are wary of criticising for being seen to attack a body that tries to do good. But the liberal NYT has no such scruples. The killer quote is this: For all of its successes, the Clinton Foundation had become a sprawling concern, supervised by a rotating board of old Clinton hands, vulnerable to distraction and threatened by conflicts of interest. It ran multimillion-dollar deficits for several years, despite vast amounts of money flowing in. Over a year ago Bill Clinton met with some aides and lawyers to review the Foundation's progress and concluded that it was a mess. Well, many political start-ups can be, especially when their sole selling point is the big name of their founder (the queues are short at the Dan Quayle Vice Presidential Learning Center). But what complicated this review – what made its findings more politically devastating – is that the Clinton Foundation has become about more than just Bill. Now both daughter Chelsea and wife, and likely presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton have taken on major roles and, in the words of the NYT "efforts to insulate the foundation from potential conflicts have highlighted just how difficult it can be to disentangle the Clintons’ charity work from Mr Clinton’s moneymaking ventures and Mrs Clinton’s political future." Oh, they're entangled alright.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1376502800161</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 13:53:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376503182698-89</Id><Topic><Title>Revealing: NYT Exposes Clinton Foundation for Shady Financial and Business Deals and then Goes Offline</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1376500939476</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 13:22:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I all ready know the Liberal Horde response, "They all do that".

PC Trance Political correctness is running rampant, and it is absolutely destroying this nation. In his novel1984, George Orwell imagined a future world where speech was greatly restricted. He called that the language that the totalitarian state in his novel created “Newspeak”, and it bears a striking resemblance to the political correctness that we see in America right now. According to Wikipedia, Newspeak is “a reduced language created by the totalitarian state as a tool to limit free thought, and concepts that pose a threat to the regime such as freedom, self-expression, individuality, peace, etc. Any form of thought alternative to the party’s construct is classified as ‘thoughtcrime.’” Yes, people are not usually being hauled off to prison for what they are saying just yet, but we are heading down that path. Every single day, the mainstream media in the United States bombards us with subtle messages about what we should believe and what “appropriate speech” consists of. Most of the time, most Americans quietly fall in line with this unwritten speech code. In fact, most of the time we enforce this unwritten speech code among each other. Those that would dare to buck the system are finding out that the consequences can be rather severe.

The few chaplains that have refused to follow orders know that it means the end of their careers. #9 The governor of California has signed a bill into law which will allow transgendered students to use whatever bathrooms and gym facilities that they would like… Transgendered students in California will now have the right to use whichever bathrooms they prefer and join either the boys’ or girls’ sports teams, thanks to landmark legislation signed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday. The law amends the state’s education code, and stipulates that each student will have access to facilities, sports teams, and programs that are “consistent with his or her gender identity,” rather than the student’s actual biological composition. A male student who self-identifies as female could therefore use the girls’ bathroom, even if he is anatomically male. #10 In San Francisco, authorities have installed small plastic “privacy screens” on library computers so that perverts can continue to exercise their “right” to watch pornography at the library without children being directly exposed to it. #11 In America today, there are many groups that are absolutely obsessed with eradicating every mention of God out of the public sphere. For example, an elementary school in North Carolina ordered a little six-year-old girl to remove the word “God” from a poem that she wrote to honor her two grandfathers that had served in the Vietnam War. #12 A high school track team was disqualified earlier this year because one of the runners “made a gesture thanking God” once he had crossed the finish line. #13 Earlier this year, a Florida Atlantic University student that refused to stomp on the name of Jesus was banned from class. #14 A student at Sonoma State University was ordered to take off a cross that she was wearing because someone “could be offended“.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376505468943</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 14:37:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376505506294-102</Id><Topic><Title>19 reasons as to how Political Correctness is destroying America</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376505373485</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 14:36:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#15 A teacher in New Jersey was fired for giving his own Bible to a student that did not own one. #16 Volunteer chaplains for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department have been banned from using the name of Jesus on government property. #17 According to a new Army manual, U.S. soldiers will now be instructed to avoid “any criticism of pedophilia” and to avoid criticizing “anything related to Islam”. The following is from a Judicial Watch article… The draft leaked to the newspaper offers a list of “taboo conversation topics” that soldiers should avoid, including “making derogatory comments about the Taliban,” “advocating women’s rights,” “any criticism of pedophilia,” “directing any criticism towards Afghans,” “mentioning homosexuality and homosexual conduct” or “anything related to Islam.” #18 The Obama administration has banned all U.S. government agencies from producing any training materials that link Islam with terrorism. In fact, the FBI has gone back and purged references to Islam and terrorism from hundreds of old documents. #19 According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it is illegal for employers to discriminate against criminals because it has a “disproportionate” impact on minorities. It would be hard to overstate the power that all of this relentless “thought training” has on all of us. And young people are particularly susceptible to the power of suggestion.

But national security experts, including some members of Reagan's administration, warned that the Marines were vulnerable to attack. In the aftermath, Col. Timothy J. Geraghty, the commander of the Marines in Beirut, said, "It didn't take a military expert to realize that our troops had been placed in an indefensible situation." Conservative columnist William Safire referred to the Beirut debacle as Reagan's "Bay of Pigs." Conservatives have casually smeared numerous Obama officials over Benghazi for the last eleven months, yet the embassy attacks surrounding Clark's tenure as Reagan's national security adviser apparently did not blemish his long public career. Despite the chronic terror attacks on a U.S. embassy and related facilities-- three separate assaults that claimed nearly 270 American lives in the span of just six months in 1983 -- Judge Clark is to be remembered as a patriot. But Obama officials are supposedly guilty of the unforgivable, treasonous crime of Benghazi. The contrast is striking. And it says a lot not only about the double standard used to grade Republican and Democratic failures, but also about the vicious way conservative commentators now effortlessly demonize public policy opponents. Benghazi has become such a momentous touchstone, conservatives insist, because Americans lives were lost at the hands of terrorists. Also, they claim Obama reacted callously to the news by flying to a fundraiser in Las Vegas the following day, an unpardonable sin. But note that after the fourth deadly Beirut bombing on a U.S. facility, this one on September 20, 1984, Reagan refused to curtail his re-election campaign appearances for just one day, even though he enjoyed an insurmountable lead in the polls.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1376506176242</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 14:49:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376507306362-108</Id><Topic><Title>Black Citizens Group Files ‘Articles of Impeachment’ Against Obama</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376482386107</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 08:13:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I suspect black surgeon Ben Carson MD is leading the band.

Yes, and if the government wasn't lying to you enough already.....take a look at their low, low inflation reports and compare them with your gasoline and grocery bills.

According to Zullo, who spoke to Carl Gallups of PPSimmons Radio after his presentation(full audio below), a large number of law-enforcement personnel and others in attendance were not aware of the evidence that Obama’s birth documentation is not genuine. He also stated that one elected official even admitted to him afterwards that he had been purposely ignoring the matter but because of the evidence Zullo presented at the conference he could “ignore it no longer.” It’s Zullo’s contention that the media has intentionally ignored the Obama birth certificate scandal causing a blackout of information which could explain why many of those officials in attendance were so flabbergasted upon hearing the evidence. Because of the evidence presented Zullo said many of those in attendance at the event are now pledging their full support in hopes of securing a congressional investigation into Obama’s eligibility to be President: ZULLO: “Sheriff Arpaio wants this in Congress. That’s where we intend to take it. We are making inroads and contacts that we have never made before. This conference is really going to pay off in moving things forward. Very important people are now beginning to see the amassed criminal evidence of perhaps the biggest fraud in American history. They are moved – they are shocked – and they are ready for action. Plans of action are now being laid at this very conference. This meeting could prove to be monumental.”</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376525548520</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 20:12:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376525631789-190</Id><Topic><Title>airbus dividend pays 1.6% after tax, boeing pays 1.81befor tax, about the same</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376524395383</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 19:53:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fyi Airbus is talking about raising their dividend , so it may far exceed Boeing, but until it happens that is just what the CEO is going to ask the BOD</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376525631789</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 20:13:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376525642753-191</Id><Topic><Title>which is better Airbus stock price increase of 51.2% or boeing 38%</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376522161137</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 19:16:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which is better, Dell/Fred/Wayne on this message board or Dell/Fred/Wayne not on this message board?

After all, Boeing’s stock price was not clobbered by the 787 grounding; the stock buyback took care of that issue. . Airbus/EADS, by contrast, has been benefiting from a strong jetliner market without any program disasters. In other words, it isn’t that there’s something particularly great with Airbus’s strategy. Rather, there’s something wrong with Boeing’s strategy, and their execution. Frankly Boeing and Airbus are not great stocks to hold. Its a case of Boeing over promising and under delivering. Let’s review. Last summer, Boeing’s top management axed the engineer CEO who had been turning around BCA and making it better again. They replaced him with a non-engineer CEO. Then, management got into a confrontation with the engineer’s union Then Chicago put off the very promising 777X until the next decade, which, from a customer perspective, might as well be an indefinite postponement. These moves were on top of a 787 development model that de-emphasized in-house engineering and relied on industry partners for much of the development work. For Boeing, there was no contrition or soul-searching on the call about how the 787 could have gone this wrong, or what could be done within the company to make it right (once again, 787 program analysis was left to the journalists). Instead, the call emphasized some impressive sales and profit numbers. It was like a farmer showing off a great crop, but not mentioning that the tractor just broke, he fired the mechanic, and outsourced tractor maintenance to Bolivia. And that customers for next year’s crop had been promised penalty payments if the farm didn’t deliver.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376528612822</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 21:03:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376528631984-201</Id><Topic><Title>A new kind of birther and death panel insanity explodes</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1376435470223</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 19:11:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You need to get yourself out of the closet" Well, we know you're out of the closet...</Msg><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1376528631984</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 21:03:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376528982456-202</Id><Topic><Title>Iraqi Airlines thrives, Takes Delivery</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1376446966440</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 22:22:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm sure it will .

To Giethner:</Title><Msg>Make the stock market bubble last until the midterms if you value your job . "By Angela Moon NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Wednesday, with the Dow industrials posting the worst day since late June, as investors speculated when the Federal Reserve might begin to reduce its ultra-loose monetary policy, which has helped propel stocks to record highs. Trading volume has been low as the earnings season winds down and economic indicators present a mixed view, complicating predictions of the Fed's next policy action. The Fed has been buying $85 billion in bonds each month to keep interest rates low. Some analysts expect the Fed to start tapering bond purchases as early as September if data shows the economy is improving. Wednesday's decline accelerated in the final hour of trading after a top Fed official said the U.S. central bank, which meets again in September, should have more evidence about the economy and inflation before it can make a decision. "There is a growing consensus that individual data points don't really matter at this point and that the Fed has made up its mind to have completed the bond purchases by the middle of next year," said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak &amp; Co in New York. Retail stocks were among the day's top decliners after Macy's Inc (M.N) department store reported an unexpected decline in sales and blamed hesitation by consumers to spend on non-essential items. Shares of Macy's fell 4.5 percent to $46.33. Rival Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) lost 1.1 percent to $59.54." Y.T.
