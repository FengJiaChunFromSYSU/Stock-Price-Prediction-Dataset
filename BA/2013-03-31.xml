The reason being is that whatever bill the Senate puts together, the odds are that Republicans in the House, most of whom have been undeterred by Obama’s Twitter bots harassing their accounts daily, will likely mark the legislation dead on arrival. Even the Democrats’ top man in the Senate, Harry Reid, recently admitted that even among Democrats in his chamber, the bill probably won’t have enough support to pass. Still yet, a defiant President Obama is pressing forward with his gun control agenda with or without their help – via executive order. According to a recent report published by The Hill, “The president has used his executive powers to bolster the national background check system, jump start government research on the causes of gun violence and create a million-dollar ad campaign…” These steps have enabled federal law enforcement officials to have unprecedented access to many state records, previously locked away from their eyes due to the nation’s longstanding tradition of separation of powers – giving federal agents access to many state records that detail just who in our nation owns a firearm and how many. Other steps have included eliminating many of the road blocks that presently prevent state governments from notifying the federal government of individuals suspected or deemed to be mentally unstable. This again gives the federal government more power to investigate, restrict and even detain such individuals. Earlier this month, the DOJ announced a $20 million grant program aimed at incentivizing many of the red states who have previously refused to surrender their records to the NICS database. “The economy is bad and all governments, state and local, are strapped for cash. Unlike the federal government, states can’t print their own money, so t</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364702608043</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 00:03:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364725575283-2</Id><Topic><Title>How Obama is sidestepping Congress on Gun Control</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364702608043</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 00:03:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chrissie likes that.</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1364725575283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 06:26:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364725793662-3</Id><Topic><Title>New World Order Banksters doing a number in Cyprus</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364696406264</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 22:20:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What do you think will happen and when?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1364725793662</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 06:29:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364725855753-4</Id><Topic><Title>He , Jesus used to speak of Peace</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1364522298390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 21:58:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did anybody ask you?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1364725855753</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 06:30:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364733710518-5</Id><Topic><Title>How Obama is sidestepping Congress on Gun Control</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364702608043</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 00:03:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fascists will do what has to be done to get what they want.

Juwanna rejected the help. "I don't want your answers, I want to take my own test," Juwanna told her teacher, according to Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard. On Friday, Juwanna – now 14 – watched as Fulton County prosecutors announced that a grand jury had indicted the Atlanta Public Schools' ex-superintendent and nearly three dozen other former administrators, teachers, principals and other educators of charges arising from a standardized test cheating scandal that rocked the system. Former Superintendent Beverly Hall faces charges including conspiracy, making false statements and theft because prosecutors said some of the bonuses she received were tied to falsified scores. Hall retired just days before the findings of a state probe were released in mid-2011. A nationally known educator who was named Superintendent of the Year in 2009, Hall has long denied knowing about the cheating or ordering it. During a news conference Friday, Howard highlighted the case of Juwanna and another student, saying they demonstrated "the plight of many children" in the Atlanta school system. Their stories were among many that investigators heard in hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students during a 21-month-long investigation. According to Howard, Juwanna said that when she declined her teacher's offer, the teacher responded that she was just trying to help her students. Her class ended up getting some of the highest scores in the school and won a trophy for their work. Juwanna felt guilty but didn't tell anyone about her class' cheating because she was afraid of retaliation and feared her teacher would lose her job. She eventually told her sister and later told the district attorney's investigators.

I'm sure Barry will tell us that children like Juwanan are great but in his public actions he loathes those that would refuse government help and Barry's political philosophy of "You didn't build that". Barry really prefers the children unlike Juwanna who are learning the lesson that they can't compete without help and handouts. You see if Juwanna attempts to be self-reliant and make something of herself without help, she will be excoriated by Barry and his collective who are of the mind set that "You didn't build that". Juwanna better learn fast that if she continues to choose not to be assimilated into Barry's collective ideology, and she continues to try to be self-reliant and an individual, she will become a target of Barry and his collective. The goal of Barry is assimilation into dependence and resistance is futile.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1364739470789</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 10:17:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364739741052-10</Id><Title>The Unaccountable Banksters in Cyprus</Title><Msg>What’s happening in Cyprus has struck terror into the hearts of all who live under the unaccountable rule of politician-bankers By Ezra Levant ,QMI Agency First posted: Saturday, March 30, 2013 07:00 PM CDT | Updated: Sunday, March 31, 2013 04:58 AM CDT Like much of Europe, Cyprus’ banks are wobbly, teetering on collapse. Cyprus is a small country of about a million people, so the money needed to prop them up was smaller than other European or American bailouts have been. It’s absurd to call 10 billion euros — about $13 billion — small, but these days politicians are used to talking in trillions. But this time Germany, the strongest European economy and the largest bailer-outer, balked. Cyprus’ banks, they noted, weren’t really for Cypriots — they do the bulk of their business for wealthy Russians, who use Cyprus’ banks the same way other wheeler-dealers use Caribbean banks. Let’s be gentle and say it’s for “legal reasons.” To give you an idea of the scale of it, Russian deposits in Cypriot banks total $31 billion. Cyprus’ entire annual GDP is only $25 billion. So that would be as if Americans kept $2 trillion stashed in Canadian banks. So the European Union’s masters of the universe refused to help, unless Cyprus agreed to a shocking condition: They demanded Cyprus’ banks literally seize 10% of all of their customers’ money and use that to prop themselves up. That is normally called theft. But in this case, it was the EU government pressuring Cyprus to do it. Anyone and everyone who had money in a Cyprus bank account would have had 10% of their savings — 10% of their children’s college fund, 10% of their retirement nest egg, 10% of their life savings — just taken. They called it a “tax.” It was a shock. There was a run on the banks, so the government closed the banks for a week to stop it, permitting Cypriots to withdraw just $130 a day from ATMs. Realizing the insanity of their solution – and sensing a popular revolt – the EU and Cyprus’ government switched to a second version of insanity. They revised the terms of their heist. Now the first 100,000 euros ($130,000) in savings would be exempted. But anyone with a larger bank account could lose 30% to 40%. You can imagine the rage from Russian millionaires — and the terror struck into the hearts of every single person, rich or poor, across Europe who lives under the increasingly powerful, unaccountable, whimsical rule of politician-bankers. Let’s call those rulers “banksters,” because after their Cyprus raid, that’s just accurate. Remember, this theft was excused because Cyprus’ depositors weren’t really Cypriot. But after the banksters got away with this without riots, they realized they had a new, lucrative model. And so the Dutch chairman of the eurozone — the countries that use the euro — told reporters that raiding bank accounts of savers could be repeated across Europe, in places like Italy and Spain, too.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364739741052</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 10:22:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364739964198-11</Id><Topic><Title>Since The Bin LAdin Death Fable 25 members of Seal Team 6 have been killed</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364672329662</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 15:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The model is to overthrow one brutal dictator (Assad) by putting even MORE brutal folks in charge (AlQaeda) and then getting the State Run Media over at CNN and MSNBC to say ( a year or two down the road) that we have to REinvade to get rid of AlQaeda. ... brilliant in its Evil MO.....</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364739964198</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 10:26:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364740043679-12</Id><Topic><Title>What ift Feels like to have your Life savings stolen by N.W.O.

The Americans With No Abilities Act is being hailed as a major legislative goal by advocates of the millions of Americans who lack any real skills or ambition. "Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society," said California Sen. Barbara Boxer. "We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability (POI) to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they have some idea of what they are doing." In a Capitol Hill press conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pointed to the success of the U.S. Postal Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has an excellent record of hiring Persons with No Ability (63 percent). Under the Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million mid-level positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance. Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given to guarantee upward mobilityfor even the most unremarkable employees.

Add to Portfolio Boeing Company Go to your Portfolio » Mitsubishi Motors said Wednesday that a lithium-ion battery for its i-MiEV electric car caught fire at an assembly plant on March 18. Three days later, a battery in a plug-in hybrid Outlander car overheated and showed signs of melting. No one was injured in either incident, Mitsubishi Motors said. It did not issue any recalls but said it would halt production and sales of the two models while it investigated the battery troubles. It also advised owners of the Outlander plug-in hybrid to drive only on gasoline mode for the time being. “First we need to clarify the cause,” Ryugo Nakao, the head of product and strategy development at Mitsubishi Motors, said at a news conference in Tokyo. Mr. Nakao stressed that the plane and auto batteries were “structurally different.” And Marc Birtel, a Boeing spokesman, said in a statement that the aircraft maker had been assured “that the battery in question is fundamentally different from the 787 battery both in its construction processes, design, and chemistry.” GS Yuasa, one of Japan’s biggest battery manufacturers, makes hybrid and electric vehicle batteries with Mitsubishi at a factory in Shiga in central Japan. The batteries GS Yuasa supplies to Boeing are manufactured at a different plant in neighboring Kyoto, where the battery maker has its headquarters. While both the car and plane batteries use lithium-ion technology, their structures and composite materials are different. The GS Yuasa batteries aboard the 787 use lithium cobalt oxide, an older technology. The batteries in Mitsubishi Motors’ electric and hybrid vehicles use lithium manga</Msg><Username>analyticanalysis</Username><Timestamp>1364784933105</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 22:55:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364785209451-74</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT IF(??) - 'A 787 LOSES POWER-CRASHES INTO RESIDENTIAL AREA near Tokoyo??</Title><Username>analyticanalysis</Username><Timestamp>1364784590717</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 22:49:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It must be tough to be so desperately short....</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1364785209451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 23:00:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364785286403-75</Id><Title>787 prospects</Title><Msg>I think or rather hope the FAA approves 787 transocean flights in another week maybe 10 days max. Prior to earnings on April 23rd would be a boon and offset the quarter's one time payments to airlines for 787 delays. Also, the 787 approval would bode well for guidance in upcoming quarters as that's likely the only holdup right now.</Msg><Username>anuandamit</Username><Timestamp>1364785286403</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 23:01:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364786180213-76</Id><Topic><Title>The Americans With No Abilities Act</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364747644996</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 12:34:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pot...Kettle...black</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364786180213</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 23:16:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364786713859-77</Id><Topic><Title>APPROVAL+CRASH=PRISON</Title><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1364412099429</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 15:21:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not years may be days</Msg><Username>nicehereinca</Username><Timestamp>1364786713859</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 23:25:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364786847840-78</Id><Topic><Title>Since The Bin LAdin Death Fable 25 members of Seal Team 6 have been killed</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364672329662</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 15:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Greg: "Obama is responsible for the deaths in Syria 40,000 last count" Yeah..I know...the board Brainwashed idiot just pointed out that it doesnt matter how many folks Obama killed cause he won the Noble Peace Prize</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364786847840</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 23:27:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
