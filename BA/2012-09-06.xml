The working environment seems also seems to have deteriorated. I for one would like a fair contract, one that encourages engineers to come to Boeing and spend their carriers.

The platinum [PLCV1 1576.80 1.20 (+0.08%) ] price rose to a new five-month high, swept higher by a broad investor push into precious metals, while world number three producer Lonmin LMI.L and several South African unions signed a peace deal aimed at ending a deadly three-week strike. The ECB holds a policy meeting at which it is expected to leave the euro zone benchmark rate unchanged at 0.75 percent, but bank president Mario Draghi is under pressure to deliver the framework of a plan to buy sovereign bonds to contain indebted nations' borrowing costs and, by extension, the debt crisis. Gold [XAU= 1704.70 11.66 (+0.69%) ], which benefits from an environment of low interest rates and support for the euro that drives it up against the U.S. dollar, could make fresh highs if the ECB gives enough detail of its plans to salvage the single European currency. Spot gold rose 1.0 percent to $1,709.54 an ounce on Thursday morning, around its highest since March this year. Gold priced in euros rose to a fresh peak for 2012 of 1,354.50 euros an ounce, its highest since Sept. 12 last year, the day the price hit a record 1,373.92 euros. Euro-gold was last up 0.8 percent on the day at 1,354.00 euros, while the single European currency traded near a two-month high against the dollar. "There is a bit of buying the rumor here and whether we see any correction on the facts or not, we will have to wait and see," Tom Kendall, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said. "What is clear is the break of $1,700 is going to pull in some additional momentum-following money. I think it will give further encouragement to those who are invested in physical (gold) and it is adding confidence to those who are already exposed...so this could be sustained," he said. Draghi is expected to flesh out enough details of the plan to back up the promise he made in late July to do "whatever it takes" to preserve the euro. The governing council began meeting on Thursday morning. Chances Of Cut Unclear A Reuters poll on Aug. 29 showed economists were split on the chances of the ECB delivering a 25-basis point cut to its main refinancing rate and 48 out of 62 surveyed said they did not expect the bank to set an upper limit on the yields on the government bonds of Spain and Italy, two of the countries in the firing line of the markets for their tenuous public finances. "For gold, a boost from the rate cut needs to be weighed against a softer euro and dampened risk appetite," Edel Tully, a strategist at UBS, said. "Gold will likely react strongest when the market gets over its initial disappointment on the lack of details from Draghi and once the focus turns to impending bond intervention and balance sheet expansion, this will be supportive of a higher gold price, especially (euro/gold)." Just as important for the near-term direction of the gold price will be Friday's monthly data release on U.S. unemployment. A Reuters survey offers a forecast for an increase of 125,000 works on non-farm payrolls. Evidence of strength in the economic recovery will be crucial in determining whether Federal Reserve policymakers will signal next week that they will use bond purchases to lower interest rates, thereby benefiting gold, to foster growth. Elsewhere, Lonmin and unions representing mineworkers at the strike-hit Marikana platinum mine in South Africa have signed an accord for a return to work, but a militant breakaway union was not part of the deal, union officials said on Thursday. On Wednesday, more than 3,000 striking miners marched through streets near the mine, the largest protest at the hot spot since police shot dead 34 of their colleagues last month. Platinum is trading around its highest in nearly five months after the strike paralyzed production at Lonmin's South African operations three weeks ago. In that time, platinum has gained more than 15 percent in value and now shows a gain for 2012 of 14 percent. Palladium was up 1.1 percent at $646.72 an ounce. Silver [XAG= 32.70 0.45 (+1.4%) ], which has gained nearly 4 percent since the start of the month, was up by 2.1 percent on the day at a 5-1/2 month high of $32.94 an ounce. The gold/silver ratio, or the number of ounces of silver needed to buy one ounce of gold, fell below 52.0, its lowest since late April, highlighting silver's outperformance against gold. The ratio was closer to 60.0 just a month ago. ============================================== Oil and gas are all up, along with gold and all the other metals are going through the roof. Looks like the likely hood of the QE3 is on the way. Nice rally.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1346935772356</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 08:49:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346936989316-21</Id><Topic><Title>Obama acceptance speech moved indoors</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346858114552</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:15:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"a bunch of democrats" . . . ??? that's a definative source if ever I've seen one.</Msg><Username>gpd8252</Username><Timestamp>1346936989316</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:09:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346937903556-22</Id><Topic><Title>Obama acceptance speech moved indoors</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346858114552</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:15:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh cares? and if that`s all you got for negativity today I feel sorry for you. if you could turn off the Faux noise and get informed you will see a big bumb someplace tomorrow. but then again you may not even get past the tip of your nose.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1346937903556</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:25:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346939846493-23</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Rmoney and Ryan hate the middle class?</Title><Username>bottomline5184</Username><Timestamp>1346935305048</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 08:41:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He did not run for a 2nd term because he has a 22% approval rating.

But — that ignores the national recessions before and after Romney’s time in office. If you look at how Massachusetts stacked up on job creation compared with other states, Romney actually fared worse than his predecessor and successor. ■The ad claims Romney “reduced unemployment to just 4.7 percent.” Yes — Massachusetts’ unemployment rate went from 5.6 percent to 4.6 percent under Romney. But — the state’s unemployment rate was slightly lower than the national rate when he took office, and was roughly the same as the national rate when he left office. ■The ad claims Romney “balanced every budget without raising taxes.” Yes — Romney never raised personal income taxes. But — in order to balance the budget, Romney increased government fees by hundreds of millions of dollars.</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1346940176136</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 10:02:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346940367704-29</Id><Topic><Title>in Mass what did Romney do for the Middle Class</Title><Username>tommaxgreg</Username><Timestamp>1346939352323</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:49:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In fact, the way the Romney campaign phrased the claim we’re checking is particularly bold. It doesn’t say that “under Romney, unemployment declined,” or “due to Romney’s policies, unemployment declined,” or “in Massachusetts, we reduced unemployment.” The ad we’re checking says simply that “Romney reduced unemployment,” as if no other factors mattered. Yeah, good point. If not for PolitiFact, who knows how many people might have watched Romney’s ad and concluded that he personally knocked a point off of unemployment unaided by anyone or anything else?

In April 2005, Romney's approval rating had fallen to 43% and he trailed every prospective Democratic gubernatorial candidate in an October 2005 poll. By the time Romney decided not to run for reelection, it was already evident that 2006 would be a fine year for Democrats, further imperiling his odds in perennially blue Massachusetts. I also suspect it would have been difficult for Romney to woo moderate Massachusetts voters while pivoting to the right in pursuit of the Republican nomination. It's also worth noting that the vast majority of successful Presidential candidates serve during their campaigns, and I don't believe that his team would have assessed that the Governorship would have meaningfully traded off with his ambitions. On the other hand, those that lose reelection rarely return to attain the Presidency, although it has happened before.

The book, "The Price of Politics," on sale Sept. 11, 2012, shows how close the president and the House speaker were to defying Washington odds and establishing a spending framework that included both new revenues and major changes to long-sacred entitlement programs. But at a critical juncture, with an agreement tantalizingly close, Obama pressed Boehner for additional taxes as part of a final deal – a miscalculation, in retrospect, given how far the House speaker felt he'd already gone. ... The failure of Obama to connect with Boehner was vaguely reminiscent of another phone call late in the evening of Election Day 2010, after it became clear that the Republicans would take control of the House, making Boehner Speaker of the House. Nobody in the Obama orbit could even find the soon-to-be-speaker's phone number, Woodward reports. A Democratic Party aide finally secured it through a friend so the president could offer congratulations. While questions persist about whether any grand bargain reached by the principals could have actually passed in the Tea Party-dominated Congress, Woodward issues a harsh judgment on White House and congressional leaders for failing to act boldly at a moment of crisis. Particular blame falls on the president. "It was increasingly clear that no one was running Washington. That was trouble for everyone, but especially for Obama," Woodward writes. ... Intriguingly, Cantor and Biden frequently had "private asides" after larger meetings, according to Woodward. After one of them, Woodward writes that Biden told Cantor: "You know, if I were doing this, I'd do it totally different." "Well, if I were running the Republican conference, I'd do it totally different," Cantor replied, according to Woodward. Woodward writes: "They agreed that if they were in charge, they could come to a deal." With the president taking charge, though, Obama found that he had little history with members of Congress to draw on. His administration's early decision to forego bipartisanship for the sake of speed around the stimulus bill was encapsulated by his then-chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel: "We have the votes. F--- 'em," he's quoted in the book as saying.</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346946440844</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 11:47:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346946569095-60</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Woodward Book: Debt Deal Collapse Led to 'Pure Fury' From President Obama</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346946440844</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 11:47:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama's relationship with Democrats wasn't always much better. Woodward recounts an episode early in his presidency when then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid were hammering out final details of the stimulus bill. Obama phoned in to deliver a "high-minded message," he writes. Obama went on so long that Pelosi "reached over and pressed the mute button on her phone," so they could continue to work without the president hearing that they weren't paying attention. (NOW THAT IS FUNNY!!!) As debt negotiations progressed, Democrats complained of being out of the loop, not knowing where the White House stood on major points. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, is described as having a "growing feeling of incredulity" as negotiations meandered. "The administration didn't seem to have a strategy. It was unbelievable. There didn't seem to be any core principles," Woodward writes in describing Van Hollen's thinking. Larry Summers, a top economic adviser to Obama who also served as Treasury Secretary under President Clinton, identified a key distinction that he said impacted budget and spending talks. "Obama doesn't really have the joy of the game. Clinton basically loved negotiating with a bunch of pols, about anything," Summers said. "Whereas, Obama, he really didn't like these guys."</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346946569095</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 11:49:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346946750438-61</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Woodward Book: Debt Deal Collapse Led to 'Pure Fury' From President Obama</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346946440844</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 11:47:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One important moment in the negotiations came when the president scheduled a major address on the nation's long-term debt crisis. A White House staffer thought to invite House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., along with the other two House Republicans who had served on the Simpson-Bowles debt commission. The president delivered a blistering address, taking apart the Ryan budget plan as "changing the basic social compact in America." Ryan left the speech "genuinely ripped," Woodward writes, feeling that Obama was engaged in "game-on demagoguery" rather than trying to work with the new Republican majority. "I can't believe you poisoned the well like that," Ryan told Obama economic adviser Gene Sperling on his way out of the speech. The president told Woodward that he wasn't aware that Ryan was in the audience, and he called inviting him there "a mistake." If he had known, Obama told Woodard, "I might have modified some of it so that we would leave more negotiations open, because I do think that they felt like we were trying to embarrass him… We made a mistake."

Boehner told Woodward that at one point, when Boehner voiced concern about passing the deal they were working out, the president reached out and touched his forearm. "John, I've got great confidence in my ability to sway the American people," Boehner quotes the president as having told him. But after the breakthrough agreement fell apart, Boehner's "Plan B" would ultimately exclude the president from most of the key negotiations. The president was "voted off the island," in Woodward's phrase, even by members of his own party, as congressional leaders patched together an eleventh hour framework to avoid default. Frustration over the lack of clear White House planning was voiced to Obama's face at one point, with a Democratic congressional staffer taking the extraordinary step of confronting the president in the Oval Office. With the nation facing the very real possibility of defaulting on its debt for the first time in its history, David Krone, the chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, told the president directly that he couldn't simply reject the only option left to Congress.

In his crucial home state of Michigan, Romney reiterated his new tax plan to applause from an audience dwarfed by the scope of the stadium that seats up to 80,000 spectators. As Romney celebrated the auto industry indoors, outside protestors gathered with a giant banner with an amended headline from Romney’s 2008 New York Times Op-Ed. Protestors changed Romney’s “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt,” to “Let Romney Go Bankrupt.” Romney, in his home state where his father ran an automobile company and served as governor, began and ended his speech noting his love for cars.

Born in Mexico, George fled to the United States at the age of 5, arriving here with absolutely nothing, little George worked his way up until he eventually became a cabinet member under Richard Nixon. A heartfelt and touching story. And it left out a very big piece, one which destroys the entire foundation upon which he had built his very nomination. You see, George Romney arrived in El Paso, Texas, as part of 4,000 other refugees fleeing the Mexican Revolution. Once they arrived, the United States did not just wave them by, to let them fend for themselves. Instead, it opened up its arms, welcoming them not only into the United States, but granted to them $250 each, equal to just under of $6,000 today. On top of that, the US provided food, clothing, and supplies. George Romney grew up with his food, housing, and schooling taken care of by the US Government. And he had a large sum of money granted to him, which the family had used to buy stocks and bonds, which George then used to pay for his college, and getting started in life. Mitt Romney’s own mother destroyed months of planning and message building in just a few simple words. She even used the word “welfare” directly. Mitt cannot catch a break, first by taking on the pathological liar as his vice president, then by being upstaged by an empty chair. Now his own mother from beyond the grave is destroying her sons hopes of becoming the first President of the United States from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1346958085305</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 15:01:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346958938981-111</Id><Topic><Title>Romney, Son Of Welfare Receiving Mexican Immigrant</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1346958085305</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 15:01:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing you said makes sense.

It's easy, especially with professionals. Unless, of course, you are determined to continue redistributing income from the middle class to the very rich while rubbing the union's face in it. And that appears to be Boeing's strategy in dealing with the Society of Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA). The savage spirit of Jack Welch is alive and well in Chicago. There are two sides in any negotiation and it's impossible to know all the details and nuances unless you're sitting at the table. Still, based on the reporting of the Seattle Times' Dominic Gates, it seems Boeing wants to pick a fight with its engineers. Put them in their place. This is odd coming from a company that croaks so much about the value of "labor peace." Such peace requires two sides working together. Boeing is offering only a 3 percent raise, down from the 5 percent won in 2008. Also, "a key Boeing proposal would switch new hires from the pension plan that current employees have to a 401(k)-type plan that SPEEA says will deliver up to 40 percent less upon retirement than the current Boeing pension." This from a company that posted $4 billion in profits and has a vast backlog of orders. Boeing says it wants to prepare for future competition by reining in compensation. That would have more credibility if it started at the top. CEO James McNerney was given total compensation of $22.9 million in 2011. It's also bad strategy. The engineers and Boeing's historic -- but neglected after the McDonnell takeover -- engineering culture represent a massive competitive advantage. Smart management would want to invest in this culture, especially the people, rather that low-balling them. "No nerds, no birds," indeed. The American middle-class has been hollowed out by this kind of action across corporate America. It's a looter/taker mentality, with outrageous CEO pay, bad mergers, industry consolidation and a Wal-Mart attitude toward workers much at odds with the capitalism that made America great and exceptional. In Boeing's case, here is a company that has received billions in incentives from the state of Washington, fawning special treatment and has the U.S. government as its No. 1 sales rep. Surely a company like this ("we built it") would seek to act in the national interest. And yet it wants to throw some of its most valuable employees (who do not inhabit the executive suites) into the circling drain of downward mobility. Maybe just a little dip of the toes for starters. But after 30 years of this across the economy, we know where it leads.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1346961114822</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 15:51:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346961181037-118</Id><Title>Bill Clinton Used</Title><Msg>the full power of the oval office and the presidency to pressure a young fat intern into being his human humidor at the expense of the entire country.

Steelworker Featured at DNC Didn’t Work for Bain The Democratic National Convention on Wednesday featured three speakers billed as “former employees of companies controlled by Bain Capital.” They each told compelling stories about jobs lost, allegedly because of the actions of Bain under Romney’s leadership. But it turns out one of those employees never actually worked for a company controlled by Bain Capital. David Foster was supposedly one of those former employees on the convention schedule. He told the story about 750 steelworkers who lost their jobs when the Bain-controlled company GST steel filed for bankruptcy in the early 1990s. “In 2001, with GST bankrupt and Romney still CEO of Bain, I stood in front of hundreds of steelworkers in their 50s and 60s, and retirees in their 70s and 80s, and told them Romney and Bain had broken their promises. Jobs, vacation pay, severance, health insurance and pension benefits that were promised — they were all gone,” he said. Read his full speech here Watch our ABC News/Yahoo News Convention Show LIVE tonight, 7-11:30 PM HERE. But Foster, according to a former spokesman for GST Steel, never actually worked for the company. “David Foster was never an employee of GST Steel’s Kansas City plant. He was employed by the United Steelworkers of America as their regional union director to represent GST Steel, but was not employed at our facility,” according to BC Huselton, who was head of HR at GST. Instead, Foster was a union organizer, who negotiated for workers that did work for the company. Foster explained in his remarks that he was an organizer during his dealings with GST Steel. But it is not clear from the remarks that he never worked for a company controlled by Bain. Foster was prominently featured in an Obama campaign video, “Romney economics,” where he is identified as lead negotiator for workers at GST Steel. In the video he explains that Bain executives took bonuses even as the company flailed. Politifact rated that Obama video “mostly true.” Read their assessment. An Obama campaign TV ad based on the story of a GST worker who suggests that his wife’s death from cancer years later was due in part to losing health insurance when the plant closed got a “false” from Politifact and drew criticism for being misleading.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346962009519</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 16:06:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346962495013-122</Id><Title>Lovely, Just Lovely.

That such a contestable proposition serves as the administration’s economic headline does more to underscore its abysmal record than to inspire confidence in its continued economic stewardship. The administration didn’t save the auto industry. The stronger case is that it damaged the auto industry along with several important institutions vital to capitalism’s proper functioning. However, it should be granted that President Obama’s commandeering of GM’s and Chrysler’s bankruptcy process saved jobs at those companies and elsewhere in their supply chains (and provided an opportunity to dole out spoils for politically favored interests). How many jobs were saved is impossible to determine because it’s not clear what would have happened to GM’s and Chrysler’s assets had a normal, non-political bankruptcy process been allowed to unfold. Yes, jobs were saved for the time being in Michigan, Ohio, and a few other industrial states in the Midwest. That is what can be seen. And politicians are hardwired to tout the benefits—and only the benefits—of their policies. But an informed citizenry should insist on a proper accounting of the costs of those policies, as well—not just the losses put on the taxpayers’ tab (right now taxpayers’ “investment” in GM is $27 billion, but the public’s 500 million shares of GM stock is worth only $10 billion), but the unseen costs.</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346967040749</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:30:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346967193786-148</Id><Topic><Title>Obama 332, Romney 206</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_007</Username><Timestamp>1346966049554</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:14:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sweet!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1346967193786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:33:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346967314304-149</Id><Topic><Title>No matter how you spin it</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1346956603352</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 14:36:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awesome Indeed!!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1346967314304</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:35:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346967391658-150</Id><Topic><Title>Obama 332, Romney 206</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_007</Username><Timestamp>1346966049554</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:14:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope that you saw "sweet!!" on November 7 after Romney relegates O'Bummer to the trash heap of history.</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346967391658</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:36:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346967491628-151</Id><Topic><Title>Senate map 51 GOP -- 49 DEM</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346966694229</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:24:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who was supposed to beat Reagan the first time? -- Can't remember the name.. was it a Georgia pig farmer??</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346967491628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:38:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346967708231-152</Id><Topic><Title>Bill Clinton Used</Title><Username>jetstream_2010</Username><Timestamp>1346961181037</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 15:53:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still waiting for W, Shooter Cheney, Rummy, Wolfie, Caribou Barbie, and God.</Msg><Username>orly_taint</Username><Timestamp>1346967708231</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:41:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346967748084-153</Id><Title>August delivery info released</Title><Msg>48 planes commercial were delivered.

(AP) You could see all the rhetorical sleights of hand, the magic of a delivery, the wit of the argument, the sarcastic sallies against the other side. All of that was in former President Bill Clinton’s speech at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night. But it was clear, as he spoke, that his client was guilty of being a very bad president who has accomplished very little. President Clinton’s record is by now so well known that each of us was silently mouthing to ourselves as he spoke about the contrast between his record and Obama’s. “We face a long hard slog to recovery” he intoned. But we remembered how he created 6 million new net jobs right after he took office (by the end of 1994). “We need to lay a solid foundation for a future economy,” he said. But we all realized that Obama has increased the debt by $6 trillion. Hardly a solid foundation. When Clinton criticized the Republicans for doubling the debt after his administration left office, we all said to ourselves “and Obama tripled it." The low point of Clinton’s speech was when he boldly charged into the fray – like the charge of the light brigade – and said that we are better off today than we were four years ago! Four years ago, with the U.S. unemployment rate at just 6 percent, was worse than today with 8.3 percent? Four years ago, with just a $10 trillion debt, it was somehow not as good as today with a $16 trillion debt? Clinton’s arguments were obviously inadequate and sought to do something that cannot be done: speaking positively of Obama’s record. In his obvious inability to win the argument, Clinton showed us how weak it is. As he recited his statistics, we came to understand how hollow they are. Is this all he can say about Obama’s record we all asked? Even watching Clinton up there at the podium in Charlotte underlined the difference between his administration and Obama’s. We could see how far Obama’s record fell short of Clinton’s. It was obvious that Clinton balanced the budget while Obama tripled the deficit. It was obvious that Clinton created a net of 23 million new jobs while Obama has lost almost a million net even now. When Clinton had to go back to 1961 to generate positive job numbers, it was clear that something was weak in the case. Now the attention turns to Obama. He has to do everything. He needs to make the attack on Ryan and Romney. He has to justify his record. He has to paint his vision for the future. So far none of this has happened in the first two days of the convention.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346968488005</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:54:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346969006222-161</Id><Topic><Title>No matter how you spin it</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1346956603352</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 14:36:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nate Silver at fivethirtyeightblogs.nytimes puts it this way Romney chance of winning 23.7% -5.9 since Aug. 29 Obama chance of winning 76.3% +5.9 since Aug. 29 But wou have to go there and look at graph to get the full Democrat belly laugh</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1346969006222</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 18:03:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346969164225-162</Id><Topic><Title>Obama 332, Romney 206</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_007</Username><Timestamp>1346966049554</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:14:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure buddy</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1346969164225</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 18:06:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346969260892-163</Id><Topic><Title>Obama 332, Romney 206</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_007</Username><Timestamp>1346966049554</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:14:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would never be a "buddy" with #$%$ like you.</Msg><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346969260892</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 18:07:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346969397036-164</Id><Topic><Title>Senate map 51 GOP -- 49 DEM</Title><Username>dfwskier</Username><Timestamp>1346966694229</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:24:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"At least Jimmy Carter is still alive and still doing the right things.

Again Refuses to Name Capital of Israel! 6:52 PM, SEP 6, 2012 • BY DANIEL HALPER The State Department today again refused to name the capital of Israel, even after being questioned by the press and even after the Democratic party (President Obama's party) voted yesterday to add language to its platform stating that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Here's the remarkable exchange from today's press briefing, with reporters and press secretary Patrick Ventrell: QUESTION: On Israel? MR. VENTRELL: Yeah. QUESTION: Which city does the U.S. Government recognize as the capital in the – Israel? MR. VENTRELL: Well, as you know, longstanding Administration policy, both in this Administration and in previous administrations across both parties, is that the status of Jerusalem is an issue that should be resolved in final status negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. So that’s longstanding Administration policy and continues to be so. QUESTION: I mean, no city is recognized as a capital by the U.S. Government? MR. VENTRELL: Again, I just stated our position, and it’s one we’ve said here many times before. QUESTION: That means Jerusalem is not a part of Israel? MR. VENTRELL: What it means is that the status of Jerusalem must be resolved in final status negotiations. QUESTION: But you do have an Embassy in a city which is not Jerusalem. MR. VENTRELL: Our Embassy is in Tel Aviv, and we have a Consulate General in Jerusalem.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346973762447</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 19:22:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346974244844-172</Id><Topic><Title>Biden guest at the DNC a untion thug</Title><Username>tommaxgreg</Username><Timestamp>1346973799691</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 19:23:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Trumka is a Thug and a Thief of Hard Working Union Members... he Raped Them for his Personal Gain as He was More Equal than His Flock.
