I'm sure Neville Chamberlain would have been a huge supporter of research like this to point out that those that believed that the #$%$s intended to exterminate the Je ws and invade and conquer European countries, were just a bunch of conspiracy theory RWNJs. Actually in the scientific literature there is more scientific strength in the argument for the idea that the epigenomes of children of #$%$ supporters are likely to carry the genetic material that leads them to be supporters of fascist thinking, than there is for the Lewandowski garbage and other garbage written in this article on conspiratorial thinking. Science 2.0 reviewed and debunked this nonsense several months ago when this conspiratorial pseudoscience was making its rounds in the MSM. Genetics and the epigenome mapping are hard science in comparison. It's easy to get fooled the way you did but when you don't spend the time doing the research to check facts, you end up believing nonsense.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367674952898</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 09:42:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367674998431-8</Id><Topic><Title>YOU ARE THE HOPE !!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367627494445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Normalacy (sic) bias" translation: "sanity."

People have been conspiring for thousands of years. For example, this article of yours consists of 7517 characters. Of late, I have detected a limitation on my posting ability. Not whining, it simply tempers and challenges my creativity and editing skills. So, I did a test. I copied your article (this one) and tried to post it as new. My attempt was truncated to 1962 characters. I guess the folks doing the filtering really like you and not me. Or is that too paranoid? Yet, the facts are there. I even have a Flickr Pro account so that this corporation makes money off of me. Do you have one? So, I suspect that there is a synergy of philosophy between you and the filterers. Because there is no other logical explanation (save possibly one). Both of us post non-Boeing stuff - policital and religious. Both of us post without denigrating others. Yet, there is a difference. Is it philosophy? Now, to be fair, it may be that you enjoy significant "thumbs up" while I am the beneficiary of many "thumbs down". And then that would be automatic. That is, those with many "thumbs up" get rewarded. I am trying to be fair. We do know that filtering and removal of posts takes place so that there is human intervention. Is this a conspiracy against those of conservative beliefs?

The three frames are ZA800 (LN 11), ZA801 (LN 12), and ZA803 (LN 14). All three were previously going to be delivered to ANA but has since asked for later built 787s. Boeing still has about 7 more that need to be re-allocated to other airlines. These are among the group of 787s that are known as the "terrible teens." It has been rumored that Transaero would pick up these aircraft from Boeing on the cheap when they closed on the order of 4 787s early last year. It's also rumored that Lion Air will be picking up their 5 aircraft from this block as well but that change has yet to be reflected in the system. Production flight testing has picked up today with ZA318 (LN 94, G-TUIB) for Thomson making its first flight today. ZA512 (LN 83, JA818A) made it 12th flight and this aircraft should be delivered to ANA late next week though it still has to go through customer acceptance flight(s). Two Charleston built 787s for Hainan swapped places today as ZA431 (LN 76, B-2722) flew back to Charleston and ZA433 (LN 81, B-2723) flew to Ft.

Bush and #$%$ Cheney From a Dying Veteran To: George W. Bush and #$%$ Cheney From: Tomas Young I write this letter on the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War on behalf of my fellow Iraq War veterans. I write this letter on behalf of the 4,488 soldiers and Marines who died in Iraq. I write this letter on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of veterans who have been wounded and on behalf of those whose wounds, physical and psychological, have destroyed their lives. I am one of those gravely wounded. I was paralyzed in an insurgent ambush in 2004 in Sadr City. My life is coming to an end. I am living under hospice care. I write this letter on behalf of husbands and wives who have lost spouses, on behalf of children who have lost a parent, on behalf of the fathers and mothers who have lost sons and daughters and on behalf of those who care for the many thousands of my fellow veterans who have brain injuries. I write this letter on behalf of those veterans whose trauma and self-revulsion for what they have witnessed, endured and done in Iraq have led to suicide and on behalf of the active-duty soldiers and Marines who commit, on average, a suicide a day. I write this letter on behalf of the some 1 million Iraqi dead and on behalf of the countless Iraqi wounded. I write this letter on behalf of us all—the human detritus your war has left behind, those who will spend their lives in unending pain and grief. You may evade justice but in our eyes you are each guilty of egregious war crimes, of plunder and, finally, of murder, including the murder of thousands of young Americans—my fellow veterans—whose future you stole.

I write this letter because, before my own death, I want to make it clear that I, and hundreds of thousands of my fellow veterans, along with millions of my fellow citizens, along with hundreds of millions more in Iraq and the Middle East, know fully who you are and what you have done. You may evade justice but in our eyes you are each guilty of egregious war crimes, of plunder and, finally, of murder, including the murder of thousands of young Americans—my fellow veterans—whose future you stole. Your positions of authority, your millions of dollars of personal wealth, your public relations consultants, your privilege and your power cannot mask the hollowness of your character. You sent us to fight and die in Iraq after you, Mr. Cheney, dodged the draft in Vietnam, and you, Mr. Bush, went AWOL from your National Guard unit. Your cowardice and selfishness were established decades ago. You were not willing to risk yourselves for our nation but you sent hundreds of thousands of young men and women to be sacrificed in a senseless war with no more thought than it takes to put out the garbage. I joined the Army two days after the 9/11 attacks. I joined the Army because our country had been attacked. I wanted to strike back at those who had killed some 3,000 of my fellow citizens. I did not join the Army to go to Iraq, a country that had no part in the September 2001 attacks and did not pose a threat to its neighbors, much less to the United States. I did not join the Army to “liberate” Iraqis or to shut down mythical weapons-of-mass-destruction facilities or to implant what you cynically called “democracy” in Baghdad and the Middle East. I did not join the Army to rebuild Iraq, which at the time you told us could be paid for by Iraq’s oil revenues. Instead, this war has cost the United States over $3 trillion. I especially did not join the Army to carry out pre-emptive war.

And as a soldier in Iraq I was, I now know, abetting your idiocy and your crimes. The Iraq War is the largest strategic blunder in U.S. history. It obliterated the balance of power in the Middle East. It installed a corrupt and brutal pro-Iranian government in Baghdad, one cemented in power through the use of torture, death squads and terror. And it has left Iran as the dominant force in the region. On every level—moral, strategic, military and economic—Iraq was a failure. And it was you, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, who started this war. It is you who should pay the consequences. I would not be writing this letter if I had been wounded fighting in Afghanistan against those forces that carried out the attacks of 9/11. Had I been wounded there I would still be miserable because of my physical deterioration and imminent death, but I would at least have the comfort of knowing that my injuries were a consequence of my own decision to defend the country I love. I would not have to lie in my bed, my body filled with painkillers, my life ebbing away, and deal with the fact that hundreds of thousands of human beings, including children, including myself, were sacrificed by you for little more than the greed of oil companies, for your alliance with the oil sheiks in Saudi Arabia, and your insane visions of empire. I have, like many other disabled veterans, suffered from the inadequate and often inept care provided by the Veterans Administration. I have, like many other disabled veterans, come to realize that our mental and physical wounds are of no interest to you, perhaps of no interest to any politician. We were used. We were betrayed. And we have been abandoned. You, Mr. Bush, make much pretense of being a Christian. But isn’t lying a sin? Isn’t murder a sin? Aren’t theft and selfish ambition sins? I am not a Christian. But I believe in the Christian ideal.

In fact, Popper was describing a cognitive bias that psychologists now commonly refer to as the “fundamental attribution error”: the tendency to overestimate the actions of others as being intentional rather than the product of (random) situational circumstances. __________ This was my answer … for which Hooz Chi Minh went on a tirade/tangent about Alex Jones instead of answering some of the fundamental philosophical contradictions of Popper himself. Post and rebuttal below ___________ • “Why Hoozdiks cut and paste job about Karl Popper and conspiracy theories is wrong I was just reading a great book debunking Karl Popper and his ridiculous stand on Conspiracy theories. This gives me a great Segue into refuting your post. In your post the great philosopher Karl Popper believes that all conspiracy theories or all theories in general are non scientific by definition because they cannot be disproved. HOWEVER..... Isnt the Governments story about 19 Saudi Muslims with boxcutters taking over an airplane ALSO and IN ITSELF a conspiracy theory ? Or to look at this another way lets shift the burden of proof and, lets argue that the Governments account of the Kennedy assassination set forth in the Warren report is ITSELF a mere theory.

If it were a verifiable fact wouldn't black boxes be found ? ...... A conspiracy theory as distinct from the "official" version can only be called a conspiracy theory if it is advanced by a skeptic and there is the rub.

However, he did not mention the gun smuggling undertaken by his own administration under the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Operation Fast and Furious. Speaking to Mexican university students, Obama pointed a finger at his own country, as Reuters reported: Drug-fueled violence in Mexico is not entirely the fault of the Mexican people, he said. Instead, the United States shares the blame because much of the violence is centered around the Americans’ demand for illegal drugs and the fact that guns are smuggled into Mexico from the United States.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367712202165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:03:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367712279121-67</Id><Topic><Title>YOU ARE THE HOPE !!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367627494445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that one of you famous ad hominems you're always whining about?</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1367712279121</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:04:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367712286112-68</Id><Title>thanks bush &amp; cheney for</Title><Msg>$1.83 gas</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1367712286112</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:04:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367712357054-69</Id><Topic><Title>Why Hoozdiks cut and paste job about Karl Popper and conspiracy theories is wrong</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367624239012</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 19:37:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought you didn't CARE what Questions I asked...was BENEATH you ....I guess by asking me ANOTHER question you must have LIED....again !</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367712357054</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:05:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367712381785-70</Id><Topic><Title>A letter to George Bush and #$%$ Cheney from a Dying Veteran !!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367695931405</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 15:32:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ahkmed, why do defend m uslim made disasters? and when's the last time you worked (a real job)?</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367712381785</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:06:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367712412086-71</Id><Topic><Title>thanks bush &amp; cheney for</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1367712286112</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:04:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and for stability in the Middle East - until 2009 and for no terrorist attacks on U.S. soil after 9-11 - until 2009</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1367712412086</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:06:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367712490271-72</Id><Topic><Title>Why Hoozdiks cut and paste job about Karl Popper and conspiracy theories is wrong</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367624239012</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 19:37:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My asking you a question has almost nothing to do with you asking me -- except to hold you to the same standard as you hold others.

The veteran cop next to me started talking only to find out he had a BSEE from UC - Berkeley and his first job out of school was at none other than Boeing Everitt. I taken aback and I asked him why had he joined the police force. He said just one word - Pension. His pension after 20 years as a cop be greater than if he'd work 20 years a level 5 at Boeing. I said you must be joking. A pension for a level 5 might be as high as $50k/yr give or take. When he said that by the time he reached retirement in 5 years as a lieutenant his pension would be $100K./yr or more. I said, didn't you find the projects you were working on cool? He said yeah for about a year or so. He said he also left also because the work environment gave him no sence of pride, had a negtative social culture and the senior people he worked with seemed to feel this crushing weight all the time worrying if they worrying if they were the next middle-aged HR would set up for layoff. He described most of the engineers and managers he had to work with as cracked, wacked, and seemed always on the verge of being sacked. STEM is a good idea, he said. He said there needed to be a fall back option if a kid acked the ambition, ability or motivation to work in the public service sector. I said you had me sold with just the pension difference. He said "besides, the engineering, manufacturing, skilled trades and some medical specialities were all being oursourced to asia. I'd like to see them try and outsource the police and fire departments." I guess he also implied that the smart jobs were for the dummies. I gave he a cockeyed look and said 'those engineers and scientists are making people like you live longer". To which he replied "Then they must be happy with no paid healthcare and half as much pension when they retire."</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1367716196832</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:09:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367716402857-92</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Blames U.S. For Crime And Gun Violence In Mexico; No Mention Of Fast And Furious</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367712202165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:03:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>His Aliases are too easy to ID.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1367716402857</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:13:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367716444245-93</Id><Topic><Title>YOU ARE THE HOPE !!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367627494445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I officially rename this thread in honor of you Raven "You are the Dope"</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367716444245</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:14:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367716452044-94</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty's Jihad</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367714835925</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:47:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumbos have increased the annual cost of federal government more than the total cost of the iraq war they've deserted our people and allies overseas and given the enemy the timetable for withdrawl they throw money at homeland security, frisk non suspicious old ladies and kids out of Political Correctness, they promote open borders, and release illegal immigrant criminals on our streets pretending they don't have enough money to keep or deport em destruction from within (inclusive of your disinformation jihad)</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367716452044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:14:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367716454284-95</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Blames U.S. For Gun Violence In Mexico</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367619887927</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 18:24:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's not very likely.

Kobach warned, in a statement released Thursday, “With respect to any litigation, we will happily meet Mr. Holder in court.” For the State of Kansas to pass the strongest 2nd Amendment legislation in the nation made my heart swell with American pride and their rejection of Mr. Eric Holder yesterday made me even prouder. I was born in Kansas and will die a “Jayhawk.” Last week Eric Holder sent a letter to Governor Sam Brownback informing the Governor that Kansas S.B. 102, The Second Amendment Protection Act, was unconstitutional. Here is a brief quote from the letter: “In purporting to override federal law and to criminalize the official acts of federal officers, S.B. 102 directly conflicts with federal law and is therefore unconstitutional.” Kris W. Kobach, Kansas Secretary of State, was quick to respond. Here is an excerpt from his official statement: “On April 26, 2013, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder sent a letter to Kansas Governor Brownback concerning SB 102, the Second Amendment Protection Act. In that letter, Holder declares SB 102 to be unconstitutional and suggests that federal officials will disregard it. Holder’s understanding of the United States Constitution is incorrect. As one of the co-authors of SB 102 and a former professor of constitutional law, I ensured that it was drafted to withstand any legal challenge. SB 102 states that a firearm that is assembled in Kansas, that is stamped “Made in Kansas,” and that never leaves the State of Kansas is not subject to regulation by the federal government. It was drafted with the intent to assert Kansas’s authority as a co-equal sovereign under the United States Constitution to regulate a matter that is outside Congress’s jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8. It was also drafted to stave off unconstitutional legislation pending in Congress that not only infringes upon the</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367716967663</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:22:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367717017547-99</Id><Topic><Title>Will Ron Paul or Donald Trump...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367712973646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:16:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>say it ain't so, hooz, i mean spart</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367717017547</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:23:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367717111182-100</Id><Topic><Title>KS State Secretary: “We will happily meet Mr. Holder in court” Over Gun Law</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367716967663</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:22:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CONTINUED: Second Amendment rights of Kansas Citizens, but also exceeds Congress’s constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce.” . Eric Holder was just taken to school by a real constitutional scholar. The legislators in Kansas have shored up every loophole and this legislation should be a model for other states to follow. Make no mistake Mr. Holder. If you send your people to Kansas in pursuit of any kind of unconstitutional gun grab they can and will be arrested. This is the law. You do not write laws in the State of Kansas. This is not New York or California Mr. Holder. This is Kansas. In Kansas we still cling to our God and our guns.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367717111182</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:25:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367717291788-101</Id><Topic><Title>Will Ron Paul or Donald Trump...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367712973646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:16:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there IS a case coming up...in Alabama.

No one spoke of as the risk of going to war in Iraq that the various factions in the country would butcher each other and must be policed to avoid genocide. Once we won the war we were stuck in the country to arrest the insuing civil war. Our brave soldiers volunteered to serve. There is no amount of gratitude that we can repay them. We owe them for the security of our nation. But for that gratitude we owe them they took on risk of encountering harms way.
