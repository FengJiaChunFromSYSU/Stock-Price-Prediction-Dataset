Clearly, the definition implies BOTH AT ONCE. To feel differently about an issue now than you did 40 years ago is not hypocrisy, but change, evolution, etc. You use a few pet words not wisely but too well. The way you bandy about the word, someone could say when you quit the Marines to join the Air Force, you were being a hypocrite. I mean, you professed you love and loyalty to the Marine Corps, right?

The path of the pipline was deliberately chosen to endanger the Oglallah aquifer when it could have been routed further east to bypass the aquifer. Now the new proposed line is to the east of the Oglallah as it easily could have been to start with and the line will be OKd by Obama. The biggest part of the fraud is that it will be a major generator of new jobs.

Local Tea Party leaders provided the document, a resolution that can be passed by local and state GOP committees, to Breitbart News. It argues that Graham’s activities in the U.S. Senate are a violation of the principles of the South Carolina Republican Party platform. Graham is up for reelection next year. Items highlighted by Tea Partiers include: Graham’s support of providing weapons to “Al Quaeda / Muslim Brotherhood Revolutionaries in Syria,” how Graham “[s]upported amnesty but not border control,” how he supported “NSA spying on private American citizens,” “abridging the First Amendment for those who criticize the government,” “restrictions on the Second Amendment,” “Obama’s drone program against American citizens,” “subordinating American sovereignty to the United Nations,” “giving foreign aid to terrorist governments in the Middle East,” “granting members of the Muslim Brotherhood high level positions in the US government,” “giving taxpayer money to international organizations,” “giving taxpayer money for excessive foreign aid generally, not just to terrorist governments in the Middle East,” “restricting the First Amendment rights to criticize Islamic radicalism,” “Obama’s radical appointments to the Supreme Court,” “liberal proposal to nationalize banks,” “Obama’s energy taxes and Cap and Trade,” “bailouts for financial institutions (TARP),” and “bailouts for independent mortgage institutions</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378152006405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-02 16:00:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378152129396-34</Id><Topic><Title>No Matter How Much You Shake, Kick,and Dance!!!</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1378140236115</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-02 12:43:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How come you are on the side of AlQaeda in Syria ?

Photo: Guillaume Paumier French president Francois Hollande has called for bombing Syria. Photo: Guillaume Paumier Socialists love war. Mussolini was a socialist before he invented fascism. He engaged in mass murder in Libya, Somalia, Ethiopia and helped his fascist buddy Franco win the Spanish Civil War. Hitler was a socialist, although establishment historians deny this. #$%$, after all, is short for Nationalsozialismus, or national socialism. Hitler came to power with the help of German industrialists and American bankers. It was the ruling elite who fostered socialism and fascism, the most effective control systems yet imposed on humanity. Authoritarian control freaks have used the policy of siege socialism to consolidate power and impose iron-fisted rule. Hitler used it to conquer the Sudetenland and then the rest of Europe. Socialists opposed to imperialism and violence perpetuated by the state often understand how communists use naked and violent power to conquer and dominate. Michael Parenti, for instance, writes how the Soviet system was a form of siege socialism, a “beleaguered and therefore unattractive and grim kind of socialism,” as Jacques T. Pauwels writes. Socialism’s love affair with violence continues to this day. Thus it is not surprising that Francois Hollande – the current president of France, the first secretary of the French Socialist Party and a co-prince of Andorra – is one of Obama’s most ardent supporters. Like Obama, Hollande wants to illegally bomb Syria and either kill (like Gaddafi was killed) or merely depose its current leader, Bashar al-Assad.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378152751277</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-02 16:12:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378152809280-36</Id><Topic><Title>Syria: Socialists Love War</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378152751277</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-02 16:12:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Despite the fact the French people, like the American people, are not interested in attacking Syria, Hollande has enthusiastically called for attacking the country. “The chemical massacre of Damascus cannot and must not remain unpunished,” Hollande said in an interview on Friday with the newspaper Le Monde, according to USA Today. “There are few countries that have the capacity to inflict a sanction by the appropriate means. France is one of them. We are ready,” he said. Hollande cited a document handed down from French intelligence and leaked to the Journal du Dimanche. It states that the Syrian government has “several hundred tons of mustard gas” and “sarin (gas)” and claims that at least 281 deaths can be attributed to the attack in areas outside Damascus. Although widely viewed as a milquetoast socialist bureaucrat, Hollande showed his chops and taste for state violence and intervention in the affairs of other countries in January when he sent troops to chase Islamic fanatics around northern Mali. Now he wants to send troops into Syria – or at least stand on the sidelines cheering as the United States bombs the country back to the Stone Age. Obama is a socialist, too, although not of the European pedigree, a lineage that produced some of the worst mass murderers in history. That’s why he loves war and organized mass murder just like his comrade Francois Hollande. War is a political tool same as rigging election boxes and strong-arming the opposition.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378152809280</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-02 16:13:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378152860468-37</Id><Topic><Title>Syria: Socialists Love War</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378152751277</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-02 16:12:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course, this really isn’t fair. Because Obama and Hollande, while they might be politically socialist, have very little to do with the decisions that lead to war and invading small and largely defenseless countries. Despite the control system – socialism, communism, and “democracy” (where we are said to control ourselves) – the global elite invariably use violence to gain control and steal valuable assets. “War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the peoples who have courage to meet it,” said Mussolini, the Nietzsche-loving nihilist, socialist journalist, newspaper editor, and fascist dictator. Such machismo is no longer required as an excuse to wage state violence against targeted victims. Now we do it for the children. Government wages modern war under the banner of humanitarianism. It’s even more effective when a woman – for instance, Samantha Power – does the arguing that neighborhoods in Damascus should be leveled in exchange for a dictator using chemical weapons (never mind this cannot be verified). It works much more effectively than the old style of conquering nations and shuffling around pawns on the geopolitical chessboard.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378152860468</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-02 16:14:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378153019991-38</Id><Topic><Title>Barack Hussein Wins Judgement to Keep White House Visitor Records a Secret</Title><Username>censored53</Username><Timestamp>1378143095540</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-02 13:31:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Barack Hussein Wins Judgement to Keep White House Visitor Records a Secret" Why not?
