According to the Anchorage Daily News of April 20, 2012: "Activist and musician Ted Nugent has signed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors admitting he illegally shot and transported black bear in Southeast Alaska two years ago, according to the agreement. "Nugent, 63, launched an arrow at a black bear while on a bow-hunting trip with friends in Tongass National Forest in May 2009. Federal prosecutors say he wounded the bear, attracted to the hunters by a bait station. Nugent's lawyer says the arrow grazed the animal and it scampered off alive. "Whether injured or merely scratched, the bear got away. Nugent shot and killed another bear four days later. Then he put the scenes on TV. " "The Motor City Madman" was filming on Sukkwan Island, south of Hydaburg, for his TV show "Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild," according Nugent's deal with federal prosecutors, made public Friday. [Note to bouncy -- that would presumably profit him monetarily. Thus I said, "for money."] "It's unclear if a viewer notified federal authorities or if the investigators saw the clip themselves."

"The biggest criticism of this team," said the interviewer," has been [that there is] an abdication of the United States on the world stage, sort of reluctance to become involved in another entanglement." Obama interrupted. "Well, Muammar Gaddafi probably does not agree with that assessment," he said. "Or at least if he was around, he wouldn't agree with that assessment." Quite. Gaddafi, to whom the US authorised $15m worth of arms sales in 2009, is not around because he was murdered by a mob shortly after being sodomised by a bayonet following his ousting by US-led Nato bombardment. In the minutes between the sodomising and the summary execution there just wasn't time to reflect on US foreign policy. The day after the interview was screened, Obama met with the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association and the Major County Sheriffs' Association. The president, fresh from boasting about having Gaddafi "smoked", wanted to discuss how to stop guns getting into the wrong hands, bolster the forces of law and order, and stem violence in US cities. Over the last few weeks there has been a distinct incongruity – to say the least – between the agenda Obama is promoting at home and the one he defends abroad. His justification for targeted killings and drone strikes in foreign parts, prompted by his nomination of a CIA director, has coincided with his advocacy for stiffer gun control and appeals to respect human life following mass shootings. The result is an administration raising life and death issues in its actions and pronouncements but being unable to talk with any moral authority or ethical consistency on either. In short, the credibility of a president in challenging lawless social violence in US cities is fundamentally undermined when he has his own personal kill list in violation of international law to terminate enemies elsewhere. "The diplomatic historian traces foreign affairs as if domestic affairs were offstage disturbances," writes Walter Karp in his book The Politics of War. "The historian of domestic politics treats the explosions of war as if they were offstage disturbances. Were that true, we would have to believe that presidents who faced a mounting sea of troubles at home have nonetheless conducted their foreign policy without the slightest regard for those troubles – that individual presidents were divided into watertight compartments, one labelled 'domestic' and the other 'foreign'." Yet that is precisely how the Obama administration appears to have compartmentalised its response to violence and its victims. One moment the Obamas are mourning the tragic loss of Hadiya Pendleton, the 15-year-old girl who attended his inauguration. She was shot less than a mile from their Chicago home while sheltering from the rain in a park. The first lady, Michelle Obama, who attended Hadiya's funeral on Saturday, said, through a spokeswoman: "Too many times, we've seen young people struck down with so much of their lives ahead of them." The next, his administration is maintaining a stony silence over the murder of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, the 16-year-old American born in Denver who was killed by a drone in Yemen in 2011. His father, Anwar (also American), was an Islamist cleric – killed by a drone a few weeks earlier. When asked about the incident during the election campaign, Robert Gibbs, former White House press secretary and senior adviser to Obama's re-election campaign, essentially blamed Abdulrahman for having the kind of dad the US wanted to kill. "I would suggest that you should have a far more responsible father if they are truly concerned about the wellbeing of their children." On the one hand, we should not be surprised. These contradictions are inherent in the tension between the position to which he was elected and the forces that elected him. For all the global investment in Obama – peaking early, stratospherically and ridiculously, in the Nobel peace prize just nine months after he was voted in – he was elected to represent the interests of the most powerful and well-armed nation on Earth at a time of war. Murder was in the job description of the office he applied for and won to great fanfare. For all the claims of him becoming a great role model for young black men, he was always going to be responsible for the deaths of more innocents than Biggie and Tupac combined. According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, between 2004 and 2013 drone strikes have killed up to 893 civilians (including 176 children) in Pakistan, 178 civilians (including 37 children) in Yemen, and 57 civilians (including three children) in Somalia (while these started under Bush they were accelerated under Obama). According to the New York Times, his ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, complained to colleagues that "he didn't realise his main job was to kill people", a colleague said. But Obama was returned to office by the votes of – among others – blacks, Latinos, youth and the poor, the very people and communities most likely to be blighted by gun violence. Michelle Obama came to Hadiya's funeral after considerable pressure had been applied by black communities in Chicago and nationwide. Since the shootings of children at Sandy Hook elementary school Obama has led an audacious push to galvanise a majority, in the country and in Congress, for tougher gun controls. The unfortunate timing has highlighted the discrepancy between his foreign and domestic policies, exposing them not only as hypocritical but deeply tragic. While shop windows all around Obama's Chicago home hang posters saying "Stop killing people", the man they sent to the White House is doing precisely the opposite. Having shown his ability to rally human empathy to progressive causes at home, he then fails to recognise the common humanity of the innocents he is killing abroad. "[America can be] a moral power," said Martin Luther King – on whose Bible Obama swore in as president – during the Vietnam war. "A power harnessed to the service of peace and human beings, not an inhumane power unleashed against defenceless people." That's as true on the streets of Chicago as it is in the border regions of Pakistan.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360843406772</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 07:03:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360843562865-21</Id><Title>The Lithium-ion Battery Revolution</Title><Msg>Should Boeing ever get the lithium-ion battery right and the 787 approved for flight think of the possibilities.

But the assault that occurred at Withrow High School last week proves once again that if a deranged lunatic wants to attack someone, he’s going to use any weapon at his disposal, even if it’s something as crude and readily-available as a simple combination lock. Precious Allen, 31, is charged with felonious assault and aggravated criminal trespass in an assault that seriously injured one student and left one teacher with a black eye. The assault occurred inside a classroom at Withrow High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. Precious Allen was assisted in the assault by her daughter and another adult female. The weapon of choice? Fists… and a combination lock. At around 2 p.m. on Thursday, February 22, Allen, accompanied by her 14-year-old daughter and 28-year-old Dawn Brunner of Covington, Ky, entered the school, burst into the classroom and began beating a 15-year-old student with their fists and a combination lock. At one point, Allen even held the victim down and instructed her daughter to strike the girl in the face with the lock. Although juvenile court records are not available, the police report states that Allen’s daughter was arrested on charges of felonious assault, assault, and criminal trespass. According to court records, Brunner was also charged with criminal trespass. The victim of the brutal attack, a 15-year-old girl, suffered cuts and bruises all over her face and body, and a teacher who tried to stop the assault ended up with a black eye. No mention is made of how the women were able to enter the school and barge into a classroom, nor is there anything to indicate who owned the lock or whether the weapon was legally registered. Police and Cincinnati Public School officials are will be analyzing the situation and plan to institute measures so that nothing like this will ever happen again. Perhaps next school year they’ll have an armed guard at every door and all students will be required to pass a psychological test and register their combination locks.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360843620319</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 07:07:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360843724143-23</Id><Topic><Title>Will Obama take over the Internet via Executive Order this week ?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360759091588</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 07:38:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are asking all Majors and up "Would you fire on US citizens" ? ..if you answer no you dont get promoted</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360843724143</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 07:08:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360844701854-24</Id><Title>An insane tin foil hat wearing conspiracy Theorist</Title><Msg>is now ANYONE who questions KNOWN Liars and individuals caught in False Flag attacks (like giving Guns to Mexican Drug Lords to demonize the second amendment such as internal memos described in "Operation Fast and Furious") .... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ....In other news Obama wants you to turn in your Semi Autos while at the same time enforcing the National Defense Authoriazation Act and...and NOW makes the claim that he can have US citizens killed on American soil without Judge or Jury.

But it has not offered the American public, uneasy allies or international authorities any specifics that would make it possible to judge how it is applying those laws. *** “They’ve based it on the personal legitimacy of [President] Obama — the ‘trust me’ concept,” [American University law professor Kenneth Anderson] said. “That’s not a viable concept for a president going forward.” *** Under domestic law, the administration considers [assassinations] to be covered by the Authorization for Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In two key sentences that have no expiration date, the AUMF gives the president sole power to use “all necessary and appropriate force” against nations, groups or persons who committed or aided the attacks, and to prevent future attacks. [But the government just broadened the authorization for use of military force from those who attacked us on 9/11 to include the Taliban and the vague category of "associated forces".] *** The authorization did not address targets’ nationality or set geographical boundaries, and there was “nothing about the permission of the government” of any country where a terrorist might be found, the former official said. ALMOST ANY AMERICAN COULD BE ARBITRARILY LABELED A "TERRORIST" As I've previously noted, this is especially concerning when almost any American could be labeled a "terrorist" if the government doesn't happen to like them: It is dangerous in a climate where you can be labeled as or suspected of being a terrorist simply for questioning war, protesting anything, asking questions about pollution or about Wall Street shenanigans, supporting Ron Paul, being a libertarian, holding gold, or stocking up on more than 7 days of food. [And the FBI says that activists who investigate factory farms can be prosecuted as terrorists.] And see this. And it is problematic in a period in which FBI agents and CIA intelligence officials, constitutional law expert professor Jonathan Turley, Time Magazine, Keith Olbermann and the Washington Post have all said that U.S. government officials “were trying to create an atmosphere of fear in which the American people would give them more power”, and even former Secretary of Homeland Security – Tom Ridge – admitst hat he was pressured to raise terror alerts to help Bush win reelection.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360845575381</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 07:39:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360846698969-26</Id><Topic><Title>An insane tin foil hat wearing conspiracy Theorist</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360844701854</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 07:25:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>= ALMOST ANY AMERICAN COULD BE ARBITRARILY LABELED A "TERRORIST" = Labelling _you_ this way would certainly not be arbitrary.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1360846698969</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 07:58:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360846818736-27</Id><Topic><Title>The Lithium-ion Battery Revolution</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1360843562865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 07:06:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So what do you dream about nights?</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1360846818736</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 08:00:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360847449714-28</Id><Topic><Title>An insane tin foil hat wearing conspiracy Theorist</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360844701854</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 07:25:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What objective basis are you referring to?

YOU ARE A POTSO! (CNN) -- The former Army staff sergeant who was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Barack Obama Monday is declining the first lady's invitation to be her guest at Tuesday's State of the Union address. Clint Romesha, who was awarded the prestigious medal for uncommon valor in Afghanistan, told CNN that he has decided to spend the evening with friends from his former unit, Black Knight Troop, 3-61 CAV, his wife Tammy -- with whom he celebrates a wedding anniversary Tuesday -- and their families. "It's such a great honor to be invited to the State of the Union," Romesha, 31, told CNN. "I really feel bad about not being able to go. But a lot of these guys I haven't seen a really long time and I'd like to hang with them just a little bit more." Romesha said he also wants "to be there with the family, especially on the 13th wedding anniversary of me and Tammy," his high school sweetheart. Obama honors soldier's heroics Little boy steals show at medal ceremony "I've done some soul searching," he said. "As much as a great honor it would be to be a guest of the first lady, it's also kind of hard to break away from the friends and the family and all the great guys here" from Black Knight Troop, who have come to Washington for the Medal of Honor events. "I just need to spend a little more time with them." Opinion: Clint Romesha, the bravest of the brave Romesha has always been a reluctant hero, uncomfortable in the spotlight and eager to share credit with his fellow troops. After the ceremony Monday, Romesha briefly spoke to reporters on the White House grounds, where he was overcome with emotion. "I stand here with mixed emotions of both joy and sadness for me today," he said. "I don't think I'm much different than Medal of Honor recipients Sergeant First Class Petry and former Staff Sergeant Giunta and feeling conflicted with this medal I now wear. But joy comes from recognition for us doing our jobs as soldiers on distant battlefields, but is countered by the constant reminder of the loss of our battle buddies, my battle buddies, my soldiers, my friends." Romesha said he accepted "this tremendous honor on behalf of all soldiers who have served with me that day." "This award is for the eight soldiers that didn't make it and for the rest of the team that fought valiantly and magnificently that day. I will forever be humbled by their bravery, their commitment to service and their loyalty to one another."</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1360850060891</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 08:54:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360850799820-34</Id><Topic><Title>Is pre market trading in BA halted?</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1360849064988</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 08:37:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have been watching...very strange...</Msg><Username>buckman2777</Username><Timestamp>1360850799820</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 09:06:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360850886993-35</Id><Title>Equality of Inputs or Outcomes?</Title><Msg>Anyone who is not a victim of socialized government education knows there has always been a communist element in the United States. From Jamestown in 1607 until now it has been tried and has failed over and over again. An explosion of communism both nationally and international took place in the early 1900s. Always trying to obtain the unobtainable utopia of what they framed as “equality of the classes.” "From each according to his ability to each according to his needs." In 1913 they succeeded in installing a basic tenement of the communist ideology with installation of a progressive income tax along with the Federal Reserve. The Russian Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 installed a communist government. Every time from1607 forward it failed whenever it was tried and private property rights had to be restored to correct its damage. Once you think this ideology is dead it resurrects itself with new leaders who fool people into believing they have a new message as they try to disguise this old ideology. The ideology of forced communism or socialism is evil because it seeks equality of outcomes without any pretense of equality of inputs......just another highfalutin way of saying it legalizes thievery, involuntary servitude, plunder and disrespects private property rights. It is an enemy of freedom. When you look at N. Korea, Cuba or the old Soviet Union it is easy to see its evilness. But when it infiltrates a government one small tenant at a time it’s much more easily tolerated and accepted. One wise observer described it this way: “When under the pretext of fraternity, the legal code imposes mutual sacrifices on the citizens, human nature is not thereby abrogated. Everyone will then direct his efforts toward contributing little to, and taking much from, the common fund of sacrifices. Now, is it the most unfortunate who gains from this struggle? Certainly not, but rather the most influential and calculating. Now, legal plunder can be committed in an infinite number of ways. Thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it: tariffs, protection, benefits, subsidies, encouragements, progressive taxation, public schools, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed profits, minimum wages, a right to relief, a right to the tools of labor, free credit, and so on, and so on. All these plans as a whole—with their common aim of legal plunder—constitute socialism. But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.” Think about it whenever you hear politicians come up with more tempting schemes to promote equality of outcomes without equality in input.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1360850886993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 09:08:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360850897645-36</Id><Topic><Title>Is pre market trading in BA halted?</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1360849064988</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 08:37:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>9:05 and Still no trades</Msg><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1360850897645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 09:08:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360850963492-37</Id><Topic><Title>Is pre market trading in BA halted?</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1360849064988</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 08:37:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Have you ever seen that before?</Msg><Username>buckman2777</Username><Timestamp>1360850963492</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 09:09:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360851936381-38</Id><Title>I don't like this one bit</Title><Msg>The Street (Cramer) reiterated a buy (in case you didn't hear them the first time).

The actions are in addition to reports of managers holding mandatory meetings with employees to interrogate and intimidate them regarding the current contract votes by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), IFPTE Local 2001. “We are extremely disappointed in the company’s misconduct,” said Ray Goforth, SPEEA executive director. “Boeing’s contract proposals should pass or fail on their merits. This illegal intimidation must cease immediately.” Ballots were mailed Feb. 5 and will be counted Tuesday (Feb. 19) to determine if 15,550 engineers and 7,400 technical workers accept Boeing’s latest contract offers. Union leaders are recommending members reject the offers and grant their negotiation teams authority to call a strike if subsequent negotiations fail. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects employees’ rights to engage in concerted (union) activity and prohibits employers from interfering in these activities. Filed at the Seattle office of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the new charge reads: “The employer has interfered with, threatened and restrained its employees, members of the Charging Party’s bargaining unit, in the exercise of their Section 7 rights by, among other things, interrogating employees about how they are voting on the proposed contract and preventing employees from passing out leaflets related to the upcoming vote.”</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360861142863</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:59:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360861491018-61</Id><Topic><Title>The Heroes of the Right</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1360858458601</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:14:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Zero of this is a surprise.

In addition to Alaska Airlines, another airline had 14 incidents and a third airline had one. Boeing said Alaska did not experience any engine shutdowns. According to a source with knowledge of the problem, fuel dispensed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has been one focus of the investigation.</Msg><Username>wimax2day</Username><Timestamp>1360876477948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:14:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360876481100-90</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking News: Boeing warns of 737 engine problems on West Coast</Title><Username>olderdud</Username><Timestamp>1360876308226</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:11:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>actually that news is a few months old try nov -dec but it was published yesterday in the seattle times</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1360876481100</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:14:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360876565897-91</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking News: Boeing warns of 737 engine problems on West Coast</Title><Username>olderdud</Username><Timestamp>1360876308226</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:11:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Seattle Times Published 2:35 p.m. CST, February 14, 2013 - New is News and its bad for BA</Msg><Username>olderdud</Username><Timestamp>1360876565897</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:16:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360876771878-92</Id><Topic><Title>more BA grief with 737 NG ??</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1360856001852</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 10:33:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its only the right wing engines that have a problem on the Left coast !!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1360876771878</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:19:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360876820371-93</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking News: Boeing warns of 737 engine problems on West Coast</Title><Username>olderdud</Username><Timestamp>1360876308226</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:11:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like the FAA might have some major egg on their face if this was covered up.

UHhhh - by today- BA will get a certified mail with the same description put out by SPEEA. NLRB requires a minimal charge. then SPEEA must provide affadavits or similar under oath along with evidence - and Boeing gets to respond. In most cases, the process is drawn out - and if possible BA ignores the response or gives a BS answer. By that time - there will or will not be a strike, etc And IF nlrb goes against BA - then it gets sticky- cuz the NLRB does NOT have a qualified qorum and BA will claim such. Eventually - BA if they lose **may* have to provide a poster with a Mea Culpa or If SPEEA signs a contract- SPEEA will drop as part of the deal Its a big kabuki dance</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1360877337519</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:28:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360878695181-95</Id><Topic><Title>Sequestration 'Wolf' Eats at Nation's Readiness, Carter Says</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1360878426680</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:47:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sequestration is a symtom of a much biggerproblem.
