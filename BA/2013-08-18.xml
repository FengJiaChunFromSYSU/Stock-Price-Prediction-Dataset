I honestly don't know (and yes, you have it correct). Unless someone speaks the language or has been around it in some form or like yourself does a little sleuthing, I suspect most people have no idea that it actually means something. Even if someone knows what the exact translation is, as you're aware they also need a fairly decent knowledge of local aerospace or U.S. labor history to connect the dots. I originally used a similar ID in English, but many years ago somebody #$%$ loud enough and often enough that the wizards at Yahoo! finally disabled it one day. Post here long enough, even if it's only occasionally, and it happens to just about everybody sooner or later. Given that my "assignment" was in the evening (during the event, I never missed a shift), I decided to reflect that in a new ID and also to switch to another language I speak. It wasn't really an attempt to deceive anybody. I just thought I'd have a little fun with it and do something different. And now you know the story of how I became, vierzig_nachten ...</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1376822339444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 06:38:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376825867258-2</Id><Topic><Title>Charleston 787 Production Lagging, Everett to Make Up the Difference</Title><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1376764757424</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-17 14:39:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>another example of why you don't outsource key skills at work for all the Corporate supporter barkers</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376825867258</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 07:37:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376826034194-3</Id><Title>so the Airbus plane appears to have two defective pilots landing on autopilot , not advised at that airport due to geography, nothing wrong</Title><Msg>But he said the NTSB would be looking closely into "UPS's instrument approach procedures" and how it typically went about guiding a large cargo hauler to touchdown on Birmingham-Shuttleworth's Runway 18. That's the runway the UPS jet was approaching when it crashed and Sumwalt said the investigation would include a flight test at the airport in a UPS A300. Kevin Hiatt, president and chief executive officer of the Flight Safety Foundation, an Alexandria, Virginia-based international watchdog group, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that a "full instrument" landing was not highly advisable at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth. The airport can be tricky to land at because it is nestled among hills and that is especially true of Runway 18, said Hiatt. Hiatt, a former Delta Airlines pilot, said he had touched down on the runway many times himself. "It is not a full instrument landing. You have to visually fly into that runway," he said. "Sometimes it takes nuance to land there. You have to realize that hill is there or you could come in too low."</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376826034194</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 07:40:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376826143513-4</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing should be admitting that Boeing failed 100% with quality assurance of their vendor, not UTX is responsible</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376708719933</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-16 23:05:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>russellg you are an idiot, and a liar for Boeing</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376826143513</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 07:42:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376826204994-5</Id><Topic><Title>Flying on the 787 today especially wow what a thought</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369078902465</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 15:41:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there are 10 Boeing employees angry at the truth ha ha</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376826204994</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 07:43:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376826269649-6</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing traces faulty fire extinguishers to Boeing top management failure in outsourcing the 787</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376736389047</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-17 06:46:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there are 7 angry Boeing employees who read this post ha ha</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376826269649</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 07:44:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376826340037-7</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing’s solution is to ask airlines to check their own 787s using an instruction sheet, how lame</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376735844336</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-17 06:37:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there are six angry Boeing employee's who read this post</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376826340037</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 07:45:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376826578652-8</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing is scaring the 787 Flying public, blames Fire suppresion supplier , not BA - QA! and want Airlines to inspect</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376678413618</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-16 14:40:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there are 7 Boeing employees who do not like your honest post shwing Boeing accepts responsibility for QA that the working fire suppression system is set up right for each engine too bad about those thumbs down they are living in denial</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376826578652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 07:49:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376826882603-9</Id><Title>Boeing is 100% at fault on the utx fire suppression system fail , Boeing should have caught the problem per flight cert.</Title><Msg>An FAA audit of Boeing's supplier control procedures was part of the production certificate for the 787. Mistakes can happen, but something like this should have been discovered during a functional test for the plane. August 26, 2011 EVERETT, WA – Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Randy Babbitt today announced that the FAA has approved production of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. At an event at Boeing’s facility in Everett, Washington, Administrator Babbitt presented Boeing executives with two certificates for the design and production of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner with Rolls-Royce engines. The first, a Type Certificate, is for the FAA’s approval of the airplane’s design. The second, a Production Certificate, allows Boeing to manufacture the 787 following a rigorous review by FAA inspectors of Boeing’s quality system, production tooling, manufacturing processes and controls, inspection methods, and supplier control procedures. from another user this shows Boeing not utx is responsible for the fire suppression system working per plan and Boeing should be admitting , not utx admitting, fault as being ultimately responsible for failure, the supplier is also responsible but only for their part, the suppression system was hooked up wrong and left the Boeing factory untested and wrong that is 100% Boeing's fault</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376826882603</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 07:54:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376827007208-10</Id><Topic><Title>BA closed below its 50 day MA for the first time since January</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1376611231008</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 20:00:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>still 4 Boeing employees that do not want investors to know airbus gives more back for investing in Airbus</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376827007208</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 07:56:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376827168775-11</Id><Topic><Title>August stock stock comparison year to date Airbus stock up 51.3% Boeing not so good 37%</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376675963346</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-16 13:59:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no matter how you slice it Boeing employee's who frequent this message board and hate the truth, Airbus pays investors more than Boeing in combined stock increase and dividend combined, and Airbus got a 20 billion dollar airplane order that Boeing did not get go ahead slice it up, you still have to eat it don't you</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376827168775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 07:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376827798295-12</Id><Topic><Title>787 activity</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1376672323015</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-16 12:58:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for the info</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1376827798295</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 08:09:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376827824650-13</Id><Title>Why are 787 problems newsworthy , because BOEING ALWAYS SAYS “Blame them.”</Title><Msg>Why are these problems newsworthy? Because those aircraft are 787 Dreamliners—the Boeing aircraft that is under the microscope of regulators, investors, consumers, and rival companies. According to Boeing, the two oil incidents happening within two days of each other are unrelated. While it’s pretty easy to find some commonality between both, we’ll trust Boeing for now. Also notable and to be fair, understandable, the company was quick to release a statement which pretty much said, “Blame them.” "We will work with United and General Electric to complete the appropriate maintenance and testing activities, and return the airplane to service." In other words, “we didn’t make the engine, WE DID NOT MAKE THE FIRE SUPPRESSION EQUIPMENT RIGHT BUT BOEING DID SIGN A CERTIFICATE MAKING BOEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FLIGHT SAFETY OF THE PRODUCT AND BOEING SHOULD BE BLAMING BOEING FOR FAILURE . THE STOCK BUYING PUBLIC AND THE PASSENGERS AND THE REGUATORS AND THE FAA IS ASSIGNING BLAME TO BOEING .

Some signatories added comments explaining why Manning deserved the award, including a Czech national who wrote: "I know you can't really do this because of (the) USA, but still. He deserves it more than (US President) Barack Obama did." Obama was a surprise winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. Manning faces 90 years in prison.

However, unnamed Boeing engineers did open up to the news outlet when the topic of machine-controlled manufacturing came up. “We’ve going to introduce a whole lot of automation,” the engineer told the Times, discussing the construction of the fuselage and how it would change. Local residents are awaiting news of how Boeing will construct the different elements of the 777x, as many jobs rest on the company’s decision to stay local or scrap the concept and have the fuselage built in Japan. The 777X program is expected to begin in the coming months, by which time Boeing will have settled whether the Fidalgo Bay location, Japan, or another spot in Washington state will be the site of manufacturing. The company has plenty of regulatory favor in the area, as government officials are set to welcome the company’s new manufacturing projects with open arms.</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1376856584339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 16:09:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376857291978-55</Id><Topic><Title>777x fuselage may not be built it Everett?</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1376856584339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 16:09:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In that case, those that 'invented' the robots' might be willing to #$%$ your case in the invent of a full-fledged war.
