This pathetic and evil race baiting is exactly one of the biggest problems with this country. My issues with Obama are his personal philosophy, his belief systems, his lies and deceptions, who he pals around with, his lousy leadership, the wanton and rampant killings overseas by drones, and his consistent drive to destroy this country with his socialist program. I could care less what color he is.

The angry woman who was never proud of her country until she and her partner started getting major freebees from her country is who she really is. When she worked at University of Chicago Hospital as an executive she was fine with the hospital accepting Medicaid funding even though the hospital refused Medicaid patients in the ER and put them back in the ambulance and shipped them off to Cook County Hospital. Hubby won election and shortly after started providing earmarks to the Medicaid dumping U of C, who later were investigated by the state and found in violation of Medicaid standards. Michelle in the meantime saw her salary tripled. “Michelle Obama was promoted to vice president for external affairs in March 2005, two months after her husband took office in the Senate,” the Tribune reported. “According to a tax return released by the senator this week, the promotion nearly tripled her income from the hospitals from $121,910 in 2004 to $316,962 in 2005.” So those that know the real Obamas know that they are the usual Chicago Way political trash. They are performers (Hollywood loves them for it) that are part of a fantasy sold to drooling dupes like you that put such trash up on a pedestal to worship.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362237619868</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 10:20:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362238136608-20</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle Obama on the buzz about her</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1362164149017</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 13:55:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But they worked hard to become the president and first lady.

The JMR TD program supports the Army's Future Vertical Lift initiative to deliver the next generation of vertical lift utility and attack aircraft. "The Sikorsky and Boeing proposal will demonstrate how X2 Technology, with its counter-rotating coaxial main rotors, pusher propeller, and advanced fly-by-wire system, will deliver efficient 230-knot cruise airspeed, improved hover efficiency, and weight-optimized design in an affordable package," said Samir Mehta, president of Sikorsky Military Systems. "By leveraging our proven design, we can offer the Army reduced risk, a 100-knot improvement in speed, a 60 percent improvement in combat radius, and 50 percent better high-hot hover performance." "The Sikorsky-Boeing team for JMR TD is truly a team of equals," said Leanne Caret, vice president and general manager of Boeing's Vertical Lift division. "Sikorsky will take the lead role in this JMR TD Phase 1 proposal, and Boeing will take a lead role for Phase 2, the mission systems demonstrator program.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362242284887</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 11:38:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362243065314-32</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle Obama on the buzz about her</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1362164149017</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 13:55:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As usual are delusional or drugged out.

However, another short term negative is the defense cuts engendered by sequestration. The "conundrum" in my mind comes from analysts estimates for 2013. They have risen in the past 90 days without a hitch. While I can see leaving 2014 estimates unscathed or even raising them as production ramps up, I think that a downward revision to 2013 would be inevitable. This might not affect the stock price as investors look to the long term. Then again, the price might just be holding up because of the strong market in general.

The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace said Friday that ballots are scheduled for mailing by next Thursday and will be due by March 18. The union has said it's disappointing the offer does not provide pensions for new employees. They would have a 401(k) retirement plan instead. However, the union says accepting the company's last offer would lock in "considerable improvements" achieved since the company's initial offer. The 7,400 technical workers have already given their union strike authorization. The 15,500 engineers represented by the same union approved a 4-year Boeing contract in ballots tallied Feb. 19. The engineers and technical employees work on plans for new planes and solve problems that arise on the factory floor.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362246005124</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 12:40:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362246502795-37</Id><Topic><Title>Conundrum</Title><Username>hrosenldgt56a</Username><Timestamp>1362234914144</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 09:35:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I dont see a big problem from the sequestration.

All parts for U.S. planes must be FAA certified at some point, but that can happen as part of the final assembly of a plane rather than at the factories where they are made.. emerging details show how regulators relied heavily on Boeing to do most of the work on what the FAA acknowledged from the start would be a potentially dangerous technology. The FAA approved "special conditions" for the 787 battery in 2007, acknowledging risks including "Flammability of Cell Components." "Safe cell temperatures and pressures must be maintained during any foreseeable charging or discharging condition and during any failure of the charging or battery monitoring system not shown to be extremely remote," the first condition reads. "Extremely remote" is FAA code for once in 10 million flight hours.

Eight years ago, U.S. regulators substantially increased their dependence on the aircraft industry to help keep flying safe. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would no longer directly manage routine inspection of design and manufacturing. Instead, it would focus on overseeing a self-policing program executed by the manufacturers themselves through more than 3,000 of their employees assigned to review safety on behalf of the FAA. These so-called designees had existed for decades, but the FAA had vetted and controlled them. Under the new system, companies chose and managed them, to the point where the FAA even had trouble rejecting those they felt were unsuitable for the job, according to one government watchdog. As the drama of the overheating lithium-ion batteries on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner unfolds, that relationship is coming under intense scrutiny.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362253126287</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 14:38:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362257419126-48</Id><Topic><Title>George Zimmerman Still Being Persecuted for Defending Himself</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1362004095612</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 17:28:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, well.

First off, let me be clear that if anything good can be said of the Boeing Dreamliner nightmare it’s that no one had to die before the FAA would take definitive action to ground the 787 until its battery fire problems could be investigated properly. That’s a big deal indeed. There’s no question in my mind that further operations without understanding and correcting what was happening to the batteries would have placed an unacceptable level of risk on the passengers, crew and aircraft. I’ve walked through the charred wreckage of too many aircraft accidents–and met with far too many grieving relatives of the victims–not to appreciate the significance of this moment. Yes, it should be obvious that when the FAA learns of a significant threat to air safety–and an onboard fire anywhere on an aircraft surely qualifies–it has a duty to act, and act immediately. Bureaucrats in Washington cannot allow passengers or crewmembers to be flying guinea pigs while they try to figure out what the problems are and how to fix them. But this is not often the FAA way. Whether it’s held captive to the aviation industry or just has a difficult time making tough decisions, the agency–on far too many occasions–has failed to take appropriate action until after a deadly accident. So often it’s only under the intense media pressure of a disaster, and the unrelenting lobbying of family members of the deceased, that the FAA is finally forced–usually by Congressional direction–to make safety improvements.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1362258490151</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 16:08:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362258548001-51</Id><Topic><Title>FAA watchdog or Boeing plebe</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362252880446</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 14:34:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And, yes, I know that the groundings in Japan probably forced the FAA’s hand in this case. The FAA issued the emergency AD only after both Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways announced that they would ground their fleets, following the emergency landing of the ANA 787. That emergency landing was prompted by an unusual odor in the cockpit that was traced to a battery fire. Yet it’s still nice to see that the FAA can act quickly in the face of a significant safety question. And, of course, the problems with the lithium-ion batteries (it’s not exactly a surprise that they have problems with overheating and catching fire) may lead back to the way the FAA certifies new aircraft types. Many of its own engineers have complained in recent times that too much work is delegated to designees and the agency provides so much less oversight than it did in the past. This problem is no doubt exacerbated by the challenges of overseeing development of an aircraft whose component parts are produced all over the world, many of them thousands of miles from any FAA certification office. Type Certificate Action Warranted I don’t question that a grounding of the 787 fleet was prudent and necessary in the interests of air safety. But I do question the use of an Emergency Airworthiness Directive to accomplish that grounding, when no fix is provided. There’s no inspection that’s mandated, no corrective action that needs to be taken. The action required is a marvel of government gobbledygook. Under the heading AD Requirements, it states: “[T]his AD requires modification of the battery system, or other actions, in accordance with a method approved by the manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) FAA.” What does that mean when no method is provided?</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1362258548001</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 16:09:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362258592911-52</Id><Topic><Title>FAA watchdog or Boeing plebe</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362252880446</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 14:34:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Those of us old enough to remember the 1979 grounding of the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 remember that it was accomplished by pulling the aircraft’s type certificate. In that case, after American Airlines Flight 191 crashed on takeoff from Chicago O’Hare Airport on May 25, 1979, killing all 271 on board and two people on the ground, investigators determined that the accident occurred because of faulty maintenance procedures. But investigators also found a design flaw in the aircraft. Because of that design flaw, the FAA suspended the DC-10’s type certificate. Once the design flaw was fixed, the FAA lifted the order suspending the type certificate. The FAA pulled the type certificate because of questions it had regarding the aircraft design, and pulling the type certificate was the only way to legitimately halt operation of the aircraft. The agency didn’t issue an Emergency AD to the aircraft operators, because aircraft operators can’t fix design or manufacturing problems. Which brings me to the Emergency AD on the Boeing 787. It’s pretty clear that United–currently the only U.S. operator of the type–can’t fix a design or manufacturing problem with the aircraft, its electrical system or its batteries and that any FAA order should have been directed at the manufacturer, Boeing. So what difference does it make? The aircraft is grounded, right? Well, it may end up making a difference when a supposed fix is found for the problem. It’s a lot easier to say that an AD has been complied with than to ensure that the requirements of a type certificate have been met.

It is my opinion, for whatever it is worth, that Boeing will have the abliity to be more generous to new members by greater contributions to a 401K than having the burden of overhead costs in managing a complex pension plan system.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1362276483899</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 21:08:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362277115545-65</Id><Title>Shame on Tampa Rescue Efforts</Title><Msg>People work and pay taxes in Tampa. They expect that their gov't do whatever is possible to save lives and not give up because it is difficult. Noone asks the Rescue team to endanger their lives to save another life. But to merely give up because the challenge is difficult is wrong. If it was Jed Bush and not Jeff Bush, all kinds of digging tools would be digging out the sinkhole to save a life 24/7.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1362277115545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 21:18:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362278202123-66</Id><Topic><Title>Cupcakes and Flu Shots for Syria</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1362162559586</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 13:29:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Assad has an iron fist in Syria.</Msg><Username>ghostridr772</Username><Timestamp>1362278202123</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 21:36:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362279592781-67</Id><Topic><Title>You have to love ted cruz</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362244478187</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 12:14:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ahkmed err censored err spaz err chrissie err sparty err islaMOspaz err censoredMO err AhkmedMO.</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1362279592781</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 21:59:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362280050101-68</Id><Topic><Title>Shame on Tampa Rescue Efforts</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1362277115545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 21:18:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree.

The Russians . They protect Assad . Assad protects the Bathists who fled Iraq, he and his mob are also Bathists . The WMDs may have fled Iraq with the Bathists, and may also now have been evacuated from Syria . Remember a few months ago the Russian special forces arriving in Syria in their super not-so-secret Russian "freighter" . Neither Syria, or Russia would say why they were there . Let's not forget that B.O. fears the Russians greatly due to his lack of spine; his kind only use force against those that they estimate cannot, or will not fight back . Y.T.
