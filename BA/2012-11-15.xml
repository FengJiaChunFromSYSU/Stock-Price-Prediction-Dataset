Theoretically, Boeing could build airplanes anywhere in the world. All they have to do is invest sufficient time and money to recreate the highly educated and talented workforce that already exists in Puget Sound. Problem is, that investment would cost them AT LEAST an order of magnitude (or two) more than a fair contract for us techs and engineers, and take at least a couple of decades. Witness the 787 fiasco (including South Carolina). Intial investment was to be $3B. A decade later it's now well past $30B and counting. Boeing execs said recently that the 787 business plan was not flawed, just poorly executed. Yeah, theoretically you can fly if you flap your arms hard enough. And if you ain't flying, why you just ain't flapping HARD enough. As I said, this push against SPEEA isn't about running a business so ALL the stakeholders are making good money, it's about BEING RIGHT.</Msg><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1352965897294</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 02:51:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352970057869-7</Id><Topic><Title>The BA Board Strap Hanger......</Title><Username>alangonquin11</Username><Timestamp>1352850128691</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 18:42:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm all-powerful, Jumbo.

According to the letter I just received: An increasing number of people, due to changes in laws, have purchased coverage without any review of their health conditions. That review would normally identify applicants with significant medical needs so they can be referred to coverage through the state's high-risk health insurance pool. This pool is designed to prevent sicker individuals driving up costs for all our members. Last year, 40% of our new members joined without any review of their health, and these members have a greater need for medical services and incur higher costs than our other members. So Obamacare which is now another tax which I am going to have to pay according to the Supreme but Obama said it wasn't, is now going to cost me more to cover all the other pre-existing sickies higher medical expenses.</Msg><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1352997258989</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:34:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352999141379-23</Id><Topic><Title>My health insurance costs going up</Title><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1352997258989</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:34:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you think without Obama care your health care cost would continue to rise for the very same reason?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1352999141379</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:05:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352999185342-24</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. to Become Largest Oil Producer, Energy Independent: Big Implications</Title><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1352743413317</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 13:03:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let them drink Perrier!</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1352999185342</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:06:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352999189716-25</Id><Topic><Title>Clint Eastwood has a Message that ALL Americans should Listen to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>ppedroli</Username><Timestamp>1351821581993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:59:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you feel lucky punk? well do yeah?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1352999189716</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:06:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353000985439-26</Id><Topic><Title>My health insurance costs going up</Title><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1352997258989</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:34:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With all of my other insurance coverage I pay low(er) premiums because I'm with insurers who don't carry high/poor risk individuals.

Should the obstructionists insist on continuing their budget blocking to protect the richest Americans from having to bear the "burden" of a puny 4 percent tax increase on any earnings over a quarter of a million dollars annually they will stick it to the rest of us. Just the threat of the so-called fiscal cliff is already hurting the stock market, which has plunged in the past week.

The classified briefing was held on Wednesday before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee - of which Senator McCain is a member - and lasted three hours. It featured testimony by officials from the State Department, the Pentagon, the CIA and the National Counterterrorism Center. During part of the briefing, McCain was holding a press conference demanding answers about the administration's handling of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya on Step. 11 that killed four Americans, including US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens. McCain called on Congress to launch Watergate-style hearings to get to the bottom of what happened. "More than two months after the Benghazi attack, there are still many unanswered questions," McCain told reporters in the Capitol Hill press conference. "While we await the findings and recommendations of the administration's internal review of the Benghazi attack, it's essential for the Congress to conduct its own independent assessment." At precisely the same time McCain was holding that press conference, the briefing for the Homeland Security Committee was happening in another part of the Capitol building. Why did he missing the briefing on a subject he has been so adamant in demanding answers on? McCain's office says his absence was unintentional - an oversight.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353013606350</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 16:06:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353013761699-61</Id><Topic><Title>McCain misses Classified Briefing on Benghazi</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353013606350</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 16:06:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i think some one needs to retire... eh John !</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353013761699</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 16:09:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353013905360-62</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing, SPEEA union far apart after top-level talks</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1352991774888</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:02:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep.

By Keith Ervin Seattle Times staff reporter PREV of NEXT MIKE SIEGEL / THE SEATTLE TIMES King County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Satterberg says the defendants' aim was to make money, not influence an election outcome. Related Court: Felons can't vote until fines paid Workers accused of concocting the biggest voter-registration-fraud scheme in state history said they were under pressure from the community-organizing group that hired them to sign up more voters, according to charging papers filed Thursday. To boost their output, the defendants allegedly went to the downtown Seattle Public Library, where they filled out voter-registration forms using names they made up or found in phone books, newspapers and baby-naming books. One defendant "said it was hard work making up all those cards," and another "said he would often sit at home, smoke marijuana and fill out cards," according to a probable-cause statement written by King County sheriff's Detective Christopher Johnson. Prosecutors in King and Pierce counties filed felony charges Thursday against seven employees of ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, claiming they turned in more than 1,800 phony voter-registration forms, including an estimated 55 in Pierce County.

Sowers is identified on an NAACP website as a member of the Tunica County NAACP Executive Committee. Sowers received a five-year prison term for each of the 10 counts, but Circuit Court Judge Charles Webster permitted Sowers to serve those terms concurrently, according to the Tunica Times, the only media outlet to cover the sentencing.

Obama has been to less than 44 percent of the vital meetings, the White House admits, with his attendance reaching a low spot towards the end of 2011 and the start of this year. His predecessor, George W, Bush made a point of having the meetings six days a week, and attending as many as possible, the American Enterprise Institute fellow, Marc Thiessen reports in the Washington Post. Obama’s attendance figures were prepared by the conservative Government Accountability Institute, and were not disputed by the White House. At one point he was attending fewer than two meetings out of five. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor told Thiessen that Obama’s attendance at the meetings was “not particularly interesting or useful,” as he received written daily briefings. “The president gets the information he needs from the intelligence community every day,” Vietor said. However, in January, the Post published an article, in which security officials stressed the importance of the daily meetings. “One regular participant in the roughly 500 Oval Office sessions during Obama’s presidency said the meetings show a president consistently participating in an exploration of foreign policy and intelligence issues,” that piece said. Thiessen’s Op-Ed says that the president’s personal attendance at the briefings “is enormously important both for the president and those who prepare the brief.” “For the president, the meeting is an opportunity to ask questions of the briefers, probe assumptions and request additional information,” Thiessen writes. “For those preparing the brief, meeting with the president on a daily basis gives them vital, direct feedback from the commander in chief about what is on his mind, how they can be more responsive to his needs, and what information he may have to feed back into the intelligence process.” Thiessen adds, “This process cannot be replicated on paper.” © 2012 Newsmax.

And in one Ohio county – widely considered ground zero for the election – Obama received 106,258 votes from 98,213 eligible voters – an impossible 108 percent of the vote.
