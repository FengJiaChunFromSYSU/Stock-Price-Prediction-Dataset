I find this proposed solution hard to believe its being made by sane people. In my world of government oversight, the FDA does not let you propose such solutions. Products are to be designed robustly so they don't have impurities and harmful contaminates in them. They also don't let you make them under sloppy conditions and then run tests to make sure you didn't screw up. This solution makes about as much sense as providing an EpiPen with every container of drugs, so in the unlikely event our unrobust process created a deadly allergic response you can treat yourself for anaphylaxis. Sure we could do the long painful work to figure out how this impurity got into the product but hey we need to sell, sell, sell and with an EpiPen, heck, you can breath again, no harm done. Be clear, in the case of an uncontrolled exothermic reaction at 35,000 + ft. over open ocean you can't possibly predict the outcome of what can and will go wrong. For example, the battery fires were clearly not identified correctly and now we the traveling public should have faith with the same people who say well we got that wrong but we can’t screw up twice, we can reliably handle a lithium melt down. You do know that combustion inside an enclosed vessel is just another description for a bomb. Starting to understand how ridiculous this is yet. So let’s cut to the chase, fix the damn plane, make it as robust and reliable as any other in the fleet or I'm not putting my family on it...</Msg><Username>a_friendly</Username><Timestamp>1361251032602</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 00:17:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361252156531-2</Id><Title>Secret Service thoughts about Obama and Michelle</Title><Msg>From Ronald Kessler’s book about our presidents Here are snippets from a book of “Impressions &amp; Observations” of Secret Service personnel assigned to guard U.S. Presidents/First Ladies, and Vice Presidents.

The jet, flown by All Nippon Airways Co, was forced to make the landing after its main battery failed. "I do not know the exact discussion taken by the research group on the ground, but I heard that it is a slight swelling (in the auxiliary power unit battery cells). I have so far not heard that there was internal damage," Masahiro Kudo, a senior accident investigator at the JTSB said in a briefing in Tokyo. Kudo said that two out of eight cells in the second battery unit showed some bumps and the JTSB would continue to investigate to determine whether this was irregular or not. The plane's auxiliary power unit (APU) powers the aircraft's systems when it is on the ground. National Transportation Safety Board investigators in the United States are probing the APU from a Japan Airlines plane that caught fire at Boston's Logan airport when the plane was parked. The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority grounded all 50 Boeing Dreamliners in commercial service on Jan. 16 after the incidents with the two Japanese owned 787 jets. The groundings have cost airlines tens of millions of dollars, with no solution yet in sight. Boeing rival Airbus said last week it had abandoned plans to use lithium-ion batteries in its next passenger jet, the A350, in favor of traditional nickel-cadmium batteries. Lighter and more powerful than conventional batteries, lithium-ion power packs have been in consumer products such as phones and laptops for years but are relatively new in industrial applications, including back-up batteries for electrical systems in jets.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361258734454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 02:25:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361260689647-5</Id><Topic><Title>I am reporting ALL the political posters on the BA Message Board</Title><Username>rwh4fshg</Username><Timestamp>1361254451007</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 01:14:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they support it. it causes a lot of traffic and the controversy and replies ad to traffic .

Indeed, Senator Chuck Schumer has actually insisted that the sequester puts Democrats -- who are still pretending that the country's fiscal problems can be solved by higher taxes on "the rich" -- on the "high ground" in the fiscal debate. Perhaps this gamble is why -- though Republicans have offered a plan to replace the sequester with targeted cuts -- Democrats have offered . . . nothing. Despite Schumer's brave face, apparently the sequester will hit Democratic districts harder than Republican ones, thus providing Democrats with a greater incentive to end the standoff. And at some point, the American people will catch on that to subsidize the new Obama welfare state, Dean's right; their taxes will have to go up, significantly.

IAG Chief Executive Officer Willie Walsh said Airbus was right to remove lithium-ion batteries from the A350 aircraft after fires in similar Boeing Co. power packs grounded the global fleet of 787 Dreamliners. “Its a sensible thing to do,” Walsh said of Airbus’s decision, which the planemaker disclosed last week.

During debate about legislation eliminating concealed carry on campus, Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Salazar argued that call boxes and whistles were sufficient enough to protect women from rape. Revealing Politics grabbed the video: "There are some gender inequities on college campuses, this is true and universities have been faced with that situation for a long time. It's why we have call boxes, it’s why we have safe zones, that's why we have the whistles. Because you just don’t know who you’re gonna be shooting at. And you don’t know if you feel like you’re gonna be raped, or if you feel like someone’s been following you around or if you feel like you’re in trouble and when you may actually not be, that you pop out that gun and you pop — pop a round at somebody.” What To Do If You Are Attacked These tips are designed to help you protect yourself on campus, in town, at your home, or while you travel. These are preventative tips and are designed to instruct you in crime prevention tactics. Be realistic about your ability to protect yourself. Your instinct may be to scream, go ahead! It may startle your attacker and give you an opportunity to run away. Kick off your shoes if you have time and can't run in them. Don't take time to look back; just get away. If your life is in danger, passive resistance may be your best defense. Tell your attacker that you have a disease or are menstruating. Vomiting or urinating may also convince the attacker to leave you alone. Yelling, hitting or biting may give you a chance to escape, do it! Understand that some actions on your part might lead to more harm. Remember, every emergency situation is different. Only you can decide which action is most appropriate. Yes, you read that correctly. The university recommends women tell attackers they have a disease, are menstruating, to scream, bite, hit, run away or allow rape to occur through "passive resistance." You know what action would be "most appropriate" instead of these ridiculous and unrealistic responses? Pulling out a .38 Special, .22 Magnum, 9mm or other handgun. No bodily functions necessary, only a steady hand.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361291712261</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 11:35:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361291800625-55</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and the Democarts Don't Want to Give the Working Poor a "Fair Shot."</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1361246040178</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:54:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Everyone is a subject to be manipulated by democrats. voters are things and objects of scorn by democrats. common folks are held with bitter disdain by democrats.

Menendez</Title><Msg>Remember Sen. Menendez's "assurances" that there's nothing to the sordid litany of scandals swirling over his head? Well, he's not backing down, maintaining that it's all part of some "smear campaign" dreamed up by his enemies. If this is all some baseless partisan grudge, the FBI, the mainstream media, and the Senate Ethics Committee sure seem to be taking it awfully seriously. Forget public relations -- Menendez's bigger concern may soon become what his long-time friend and mega donor could tell investigators to help mitigate his own sentence, should be become convinced that charges of Medicare fraud are likely to stick. As far as 'big fish' go, sitting Senators tend to be a few notches up the food chain from shady doctors. Meanwhile, another name has been added to the Menendez/Melgen mix: US Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Raul Yzaguirre. Menendez, then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee that oversaw the Caribbean, proved a valuable ally during Yzaguirre's rocky confirmation process in 2009. Another vocal advocate for Yzaguirre at the time? Surprise! Dr. Salomon Melgen. Once Yzaguirre was installed in Santo Domingo, it appears that he may have used his position to flexed his muscle in a renewed push for a dormant port security deal, which promised to deliver a massive windfall to Melgen -- who had acquired an ownership share in the company that stood to benefit from the $500 million deal. From the perspective of this chummy little club, it was wins all around: Yzaguirre got a Senate rabbi who shepherded him through a tough confirmation to a coveted position, Melgen got an ambassador who was friendly to his substantial financial interests in the Dominican Republic, and Menendez got a fat and happy donor...who funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats in 2012 alone. The Washington Post is beginning to connect the dots: When the U.S. Embassy set out to press the Dominican government over a long-stalled contract to provide port security, American officials took on some tough opponents. The deal had languished for more than a decade amid stiff resistance from the American Chamber of Commerce, which represents the interests of American and local businessmen in the Dominican Republic, and the country’s customs authorities. Ambassador Raul Yzaguirre’s team pushed the government to enforce the contract — which calls for operating X-ray scanners to screen cargo at the country’s ports — despite objections over its merits and its price tag. The port deal has come under heightened scrutiny in the United States in recent weeks because of its chief investor, a wealthy Florida eye doctor named Salomon Melgen who stood to gain a windfall if the contract was enforced, and his close friend Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). Menendez, whose relationship with Melgen is the subject of a Senate ethics inquiry, was a major beneficiary of the doctor’s generosity, repeatedly flying on his private plane to the Dominican Republic, staying as a guest at his seaside mansion and receiving large campaign contributions. Melgen donated $700,000 to Menendez and other Senate Democrats last year. The senator was also the most powerful champion of the port deal, publicly urging U.S. officials to pressure Dominican authorities to enforce the contract. Menendez pointed to the port security deal at Yzaguirre’s confirmation hearing to become ambassador, an aide to the senator said, asking him to put a priority on security efforts aimed at countering drug trafficking through the Dominican Republic. Melgen, too, sought Yzaguirre’s help in enforcing the contract. Yzaguirre, for his part, received help from both men in becoming ambassador. They had provided a crucial boost to his nomination when it ran into trouble. When push comes to shove, the solicitation rumors may end up being the least of Menendez's legal troubles. Ed Morrissey also makes a good point: As the lid is slowly pulled back on this can of worms, Amb. Yzaguirre may find himself in the FBI's cross-hairs, too.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361292298155</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 11:44:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361292522645-61</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and the Democarts Don't Want to Give the Working Poor a "Fair Shot."</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1361246040178</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:54:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"most absurd poster " if anyone ever catches up to rockstar in that category, he will indeed belong to the "useful i.d.i.o.ts club."</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361292522645</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 11:48:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361292679980-62</Id><Topic><Title>CBS News: FBI Investigating Prostitution Allegations Against Corrupt Dem Sen.

The Boeing offer is an insult to every present, past and futurer worker of America. The CEO gives himself 34% pay raise and has a 22 million dollar fully funded retirement and is responsible for the 787 business outsource plan. The SPEEA union offered to design the plane for 5 billion dollars and had a 100% success rate since the company was founded. the 777 is the last 100% SPEEA designed plane which came in on time and on budget. The cheap out sourcing and shared cost design is now 4 years late and 33 billion in cost. Now grounded and the same fools in control now are in group think on the lithium batteries .The offer to SPEEA is a reduction in pay, reduction in benefits and a cancellation of the pension.

"[First responders'] ability to help communities respond to and recover from disasters will be degraded. Border patrol agents will see their hours reduced. FBI agents will be furloughed. Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go...These cuts are not smart, they are not fair, they will hurt our economy, they will add hundreds of thousands of Americans to the unemployment rolls." And who, pray tell, is primarily responsible for these "not smart , not fair," job-destroying, chaos-creating cuts? Over to you, liberal reporter Bob Woodward: "It was the White House. It was Obama and Jack Lew and Rob Nabors who went to the Democratic Leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, and said, '[the sequester] is the solution.'" Woodward went on to say that "everyone has their fingerprints" on the package of cuts -- which is true to a large extent. The idea was the Obama administration's brain child, they proposed it, members of both parties in both houses voted for the 2011 debt deal (in which the sequester was embedded), and the president affixed his signature to it. He also threatened to veto Republicans' attempts to make the cuts more responsible and targeted. But now, as Obama tells it, America faces a sequester-induced apocalypse, and it's all the GOP's fault. Criminals will run free. Airport delays will get worse. Fires will burn unfought. Puppies will go uncuddled. All because Republicans are willing to allow the president's own proposal to go into effect.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361296206160</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:50:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361296634995-79</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and the Democarts Don't Want to Give the Working Poor a "Fair Shot."</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1361246040178</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:54:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>= And don`t try to tell me Republicans don`t go putting their hands in people pockets they are just as guilty they are just better at deceiving the public on how its done. = Man, ain't that the truth...</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1361296634995</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:57:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361296774591-80</Id><Topic><Title>Come on Liberals Tell us Why not a $50 an hour Minimum wage?</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1361244027073</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:20:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>= indication they realize they've overdosed on that kool-aid.= More likely it's an indication rthat your question is so preposterous that it doesn't merit a reply at all.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1361296774591</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:59:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361296997446-81</Id><Topic><Title>BA may well prove to be the ticker to look at this week.</Title><Username>headenbelser</Username><Timestamp>1361279104217</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 08:05:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>beauty</Msg><Username>mitchelljuan314</Username><Timestamp>1361296997446</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:03:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361297502075-82</Id><Topic><Title>Come on Liberals Tell us Why not a $50 an hour Minimum wage?</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1361244027073</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:20:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only thing preposterous about the question is.....no liberal seems to be able to answer it.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361297502075</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:11:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361297741251-83</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and the Democarts Don't Want to Give the Working Poor a "Fair Shot."</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1361246040178</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:54:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hawfaeces Ive told you this before- the United States is a hybrid capitalist socialist society which works pretty well inspite of wannabe tax cheats and slackers like you- try to practice the patriotism you give lip service to and be glad to do your duty and pay your taxes even if it is just a couple of twenties a year</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1361297741251</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:15:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361297785894-84</Id><Title>I know that global-warming is a hoax</Title><Msg>because: - it is cold and snowy today, where I live - it uspets the democrats/liberal/commies to say so - I am a repubeliar</Msg><Username>repugsareliars</Username><Timestamp>1361297785894</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:16:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361297818449-85</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and the Democarts Don't Want to Give the Working Poor a "Fair Shot."</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1361246040178</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:54:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The USA is no different than the entire rest of the civilized industrialized world- they are a hybrid socialist capitalist economy and society</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1361297818449</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:16:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361297825270-86</Id><Title>Updated: Ohio Poll Worker Voted For Obama...6 Times?</Title><Msg>Two weeks ago, John Fund brought us news from Ohio of democratic poll watcher Melowese Richardson proudly voting for President Obama twice in November. Now, it looks as though Richardson may have voted as many as six times for Obama, twice under her name and four times under the names of others. The Obama/Biden lawn sign remains proudly planted in front of Melowese Richardson's Cincinnati home, three months after the presidential election. It seems that President Obama has an especially ardent supporter in the veteran Ohio poll worker. Richardson told a local television station this month that she voted twice for Obama last November. She cast an absentee ballot and then voted at the polls as well. "Yes, I voted twice," Richardson told WCPO-TV. "I, after registering thousands of people, certainly wanted my vote to count, so I voted. I voted at the polls." Authorities also are investigating if she voted in the names of four other people, too, for a total of six votes in the 2012 presidential election. "I'll fight it for Mr. Obama and for Mr. Obama's right to sit as president of the United States," Richardson vowed when asked about the voter fraud investigation that is now under way. Richardson is one of 19 people suspected of illegal voting by the Hamilton County Board of Elections in the last election. If these allegations prove to be true, that's a lot of votes and these are only the people who got caught. "It appears she not only attempted to vote more than once, but was actually successful at it and having those additional votes counted," Ohio Secretary of State John Husted, who is in charge of the state's elections, told Fox News. "She appears to have used her position as a poll worker to cover her tracks. That would be someone who is an official in the elections process, using that position to commit a fraud. That is especially troubling to me, as the chief elections officer of the state, because it is my responsibility to make sure the system runs effectively, that it has integrity. When I find issues like this, I know that it undermines voter confidence in our elections, and we must pursue it."</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361297825270</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:17:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361297978612-87</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and the Democarts Don't Want to Give the Working Poor a "Fair Shot."</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1361246040178</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:54:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mediocre why don't you take your racism and put it you know where- you kookluksklannners are going extinct and in a few years you will have converted or found a new abode in one of the hotter circles of hades</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1361297978612</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:19:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361298194003-88</Id><Topic><Title>Come on Liberals Tell us Why not a $50 an hour Minimum wage?</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1361244027073</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 22:20:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>xxx Im not a bit surprised to see your post- while I suppose most folks consider it an exaggeration to suggest a minimum wage of 50 bukcs- just consider the option of raising it to 5000$ or something. 9 dollars is going to provide a bare minimum earning power and will prevent the return to slavery that most of you RWNJs want</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1361298194003</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:23:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361298420303-89</Id><Title>Mandatory cuts to kill jobs</Title><Msg>Anyone read, or listen to Obama lying about what will happen if those mandatory spending cuts are made to take place?

Obviously, Nancy and the rest of the family were at his side, as well as the family minister. Knowing that his time might be short, they asked if there was anything he wanted. "Yes," he replied, "I'd like very much to have Bill and Hillary Clinton at my side before I go." They were all amazed at this request and several assumed his memory was failing even worse than they had suspected. Regardless, they went ahead and forwarded his request to the former first family. Within hours, the former president and first lady arrived at his bedside, courtesy of the loan of Air Force One. For a time, no one said anything. Bill and Hillary stood, one on each side of the bed, and were touched and flattered that Ron would ask them to be with him during his final moments. They were also puzzled - obviously they were of different political parties and had thrown barbs in one another's direction over the years. Why not George H. W. Bush, G.W. Bush or some of Reagan's many Hollywood friends? He had never given the Clintons any indication he particularly liked either of them. Finally, Bill spoke up and asked, "Mr. President, why did you chose the two of us to be at your bedside at this critical moment?" The former president mustered up some strength and said very weakly, "Jesus died between two thieves ... and that's how I want to go, too."</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361301418523</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 14:16:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361301429902-103</Id><Topic><Title>a lb. of butter $4.29 as gas prices soar again after the election of course</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1361297494390</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:11:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ask Mittens Rawmoney, he can give every R- Amwerican a three-dollar bill</Msg><Username>repugsareliars</Username><Timestamp>1361301429902</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 14:17:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361301553537-104</Id><Topic><Title>BA Union says "reject" Boeing contract off</Title><Username>truthbtoldhonest</Username><Timestamp>1361295039308</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:30:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>22,999</Msg><Username>outoftheblueofthewesternskies</Username><Timestamp>1361301553537</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 14:19:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361301760787-105</Id><Topic><Title>Ronald Reagan's Death Bed Wish</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361301418523</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 14:16:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and so they asked, mr. bedtime fot bonzo, which is worse: Your knowing about Iran-Contra, or your not knowing...??? and then the devil RWR - aka 666 died</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1361301760787</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 14:22:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361301771101-106</Id><Topic><Title>BA Union says "reject" Boeing contract off</Title><Username>truthbtoldhonest</Username><Timestamp>1361295039308</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:30:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Off course the union leaders say that.

During the Reagan administration, senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, the subject of an arms embargo.[1] Some U.S. officials also hoped that the arms sales would secure the release of hostages and allow U.S. intelligence agencies to fund the Nicaraguan Contras. Under the Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress. The scandal began as an operation to free seven American hostages being held by a group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised to do everything in their power to achieve the release of the U.S. hostages. The plan deteriorated into an arms-for-hostages scheme, in which members of the executive branch sold weapons to Iran in exchange for the release of the American hostages.[2][3] Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-Sandinista and anti-communist rebels, or Contras, in Nicaragua.[4][5] While President Ronald Reagan was a supporter of the Contra cause,[6] the evidence is disputed as to whether he authorized the diversion of the money raised by the Iranian arms sales to the Contras.[2][3][7] Handwritten notes taken by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on December 7, 1985, indicate that Reagan was aware of potential hostage transfers with Iran, as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to "moderates elements" within that country.[8] Weinberger wrote that Reagan said "he could answer to charges of illegality but couldn't answer to the charge that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free the hostages'".[8] After the weapon sales were revealed in November 1986, Reagan appeared on national television and stated that the weapons transfers had indeed occurred, but that the United States did not trade arms for hostages.[9] The investigation was impeded when large volumes of documents relating to the scandal were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials.[10] On March 4, 1987, Reagan returned to the airwaves in a nationally televised address, taking full responsibility for any actions that he was unaware of, and admitting that "what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages".[11] Several investigations ensued, including those by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither found any evidence that President Reagan himself knew of the extent of the multiple programs.[2][3][7] In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted, including then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal.[12] The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned in the final days of the presidency of George H. W. Bush, who had been vice-president at the time of the affair.[13] what say you now</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1361304024100</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:00:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361304515358-122</Id><Topic><Title>a lb. of butter $4.29 as gas prices soar again after the election of course</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1361297494390</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:11:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that is major #$%$ on welfare 160% disabled american dating back the the revolutionary war day and b4 and ewe, some shitd-canned BA czckinthemail former BA emplyee hoping 4 whitpeople get a USD</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1361304515358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:08:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361304558328-123</Id><Topic><Title>Ronald Reagan's Death Bed Wish</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361301418523</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 14:16:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"BLOW OUT 332 VS. 206 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

However, the appeals from Boeing continued. The company had produced the largest twinjet yet, the 777, and for certain routes over the Pacific they wanted another extension, to 207 minutes, in order to optimize its efficiency. This was granted in 2000. And, indeed, the 777 has had an exemplary safety record—with nearly 1,500 777s delivered, not a single passenger has died in one. Moreover, the 777 gave a somewhat unnerving demonstration of its ability to fly on one engine: In August, 2003, a United Airlines 777 flying nonstop from New Zealand to Los Angeles lost an engine beyond the halfway point and diverted to Kona, on the west coast of Hawaii’s Big Island. Pushing against strong headwinds, it took 192 minutes to reach the runway—a record for ETOPS diversions (and a white-knuckle experience for the passengers). READ MORE The Week’s Best Business Longreads: Business Beast’s Picks for Feb. 14, 2013 In 2011, the longest-range versions of the 777 were cleared for yet another upper limit for a diversion time: 330 minutes, or five and a half hours. This meant that, for example, the plane could a fly non-stop route from Sydney, Australia, to Argentina over both the south Pacific and Atlantic. This also enables flights over the North Pole, which greatly speed up the times between continents—but where airports that meet the strict standards for emergency diversions are few and far between.

This was granted in 2000. And, indeed, the 777 has had an exemplary safety record—with nearly 1,500 777s delivered, not a single passenger has died in one. Moreover, the 777 gave a somewhat unnerving demonstration of its ability to fly on one engine: In August, 2003, a United Airlines 777 flying nonstop from New Zealand to Los Angeles lost an engine beyond the halfway point and diverted to Kona, on the west coast of Hawaii’s Big Island. Pushing against strong headwinds, it took 192 minutes to reach the runway—a record for ETOPS diversions (and a white-knuckle experience for the passengers). READ MORE The Week’s Best Business Longreads: Business Beast’s Picks for Feb. 14, 2013 In 2011, the longest-range versions of the 777 were cleared for yet another upper limit for a diversion time: 330 minutes, or five and a half hours. This meant that, for example, the plane could a fly non-stop route from Sydney, Australia, to Argentina over both the south Pacific and Atlantic. This also enables flights over the North Pole, which greatly speed up the times between continents—but where airports that meet the strict standards for emergency diversions are few and far between. That was the 777, a conservatively-designed airplane. In contrast, the 787 Dreamliner represents, in one quantum leap, a radical break from the old ways of building a jet—including making it what Boeing called a “more electric jet.” That requires an on-board system to generate enough electricity to power 400 homes and, as a part of that system, the use of a battery technology, lithium-ion, that Boeing had never put into an airplane before.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1361305067688</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:17:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361305351209-126</Id><Topic><Title>Short BA NOW!</Title><Username>queen_of_fartz</Username><Timestamp>1361304704769</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:11:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>c'mon baby, needd 1</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1361305351209</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:22:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361305390240-127</Id><Topic><Title>Short BA NOW!</Title><Username>queen_of_fartz</Username><Timestamp>1361304704769</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:11:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>USD x 1000</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1361305390240</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:23:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361305622061-128</Id><Title>FLASH: Boeing 787 return reportedly many months away</Title><Msg>Boeing Co.'s 787 is reportedly at least four months away from returning to service with a short-term fix, and if the lithium-ion battery system is completely redesigned, it could be nine plus months Who cares about the Union strike - The dreamliner could be in mothball for all of 2013 and that is extremely bad news for BA bottom line.

It all depends on the situation, she said in reply to a Huffington Post reporter who asked if President Obama’s administration should acknowledge when it targets a U.S. citizen in a drone strike, the Washington Examiner reported. “Maybe, it just depends,” she reportedly said. “People just want to be protected.” She also said that such disclosure “depends on the timing, because that’s right — it’s all about the timing.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361316181212</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:23:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361316341541-161</Id><Topic><Title>What R We Up TO...</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1361315625237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:13:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so I quit the police department and got myself a steady job the sun-roof on t-top cmaro is open and we are the marina district blaring the end by the beatles excusy-moi even thought the light is green IAM going to enjoy the moment wait4it ringo's drum solo the end the lights are still green</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1361316341541</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:25:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361316750813-162</Id><Topic><Title>What R We Up TO...</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1361315625237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:13:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it was either this some lemoney-madelaines work/tkill the jason the transporter with a kittens claw...</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1361316750813</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:32:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361317015257-163</Id><Topic><Title>Nancy Pelosi says drone strikes on Americans can stay Secret</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361316181212</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:23:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you kinda look that that former LAPD-cop who was snuffed a few day ago by pyrothecnic-gases but then you don't pleasse, pleasse, please Nancy is our 'problem'...</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1361317015257</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:36:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361317060081-164</Id><Topic><Title>Nancy Pelosi says drone strikes on Americans can stay Secret</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361316181212</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:23:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do fat people drink diet drinks while watching TV?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1361317060081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:37:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361317416284-165</Id><Topic><Title>Nancy Pelosi says drone strikes on Americans can stay Secret</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361316181212</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 18:23:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, but what if a future republican administration should target Pelosi at her Star Kist Tuna factory in San Francisco?

My point was . Group think is involved where Boeing wants to work on a better fire alarm and fire truck instead of making the system work as promised. That idea will not well or end good. It is the all about the money fix, I sure hope the FAA has the common sense to say nope , find and fix the problem, not fly with the problem and hope . Think about it , if the 200 hour two plane failure continues then Boeing gets bad press on more emergency landings and the cost is still there, for Boeing the grounded planes will have to be inspected and the passengers will have to reschedule their flight schedule , more bad passenger lack of satisfaction with the 787 and th airline company.

The toxin is trichloroethylene, or TCE. The solvent is used in degreasing and cleaning airplane parts. Long periods of exposure to TCE can cause cancer, and test results showed it had seeped into the groundwater. "We don't know the full extent of this plume of groundwater contamination, and the investigation is taking us into parts of Algona, which are residential areas," said Larry Altose of the state Department of Ecology. Former Pacific Mayor Rich Hildreth said there are test wells all over the area. But the wells are unmarked, and no one except for Boeing and the state Department of Ecology knew what they were. In 2011, Hildreth and the mayors of Algona and Auburn were told the wells were being tested to see whether a toxin used by Boeing in the 60s, 70s and 80s had gotten off the Auburn site. They were also told a public notice would be issued in March 2012. "Here it is a year later, and we have not heard," said Hildreth. "We're just now hearing reports." Without clear answers, the residents are on edge as they await additional test results. "All I heard is that it was toxins that Boeing had released in the early 80s, and it just kind of has been growing and been seeping," said Algona resident Sara Byers. "So that's pretty scary." The residents' main concern is over drinking water contamination, but ecology officials say there is nothing to worry about.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1361329334672</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 22:02:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361329596299-204</Id><Topic><Title>Drone Attacks ....
