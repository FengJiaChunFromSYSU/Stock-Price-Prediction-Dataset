I originally took out the spartacus99991 nick back when I was toying with the "sparty" who was big into 9/11 conspiracies and I liked to point out contrary facts and articles. Since that seemed to be a lost cause, I took up "dell's",( fred's, wayne's) challenge about his 10 stocks beating BA "going forward" from March 2011. When it seemed that he might have put me on ignore and couldn't stand to see the latest weeks results of his stocks falling behind BA (he claimed many months later that he really meant some of the 10 should be shorted, HaHa), I added "neospart99" for a while and acknowledged that I was the same as 99991. Maybe I'll go back to using that one since some on this board are having trouble differentiating the IDs, although the style and subject matter should be quite obvious.

I know how to jump the evolution of airplane technology. It is odd that no aerospace of big shot has figured it out. There are two very great aerospace guys in the eastern Washington and Northern Idaho area. I will patent the idea first. I might share when I visit them.

I originally took out the spartacus99991 nick back when I was toying with the "sparty" who was big into 9/11 conspiracies and I liked to point out contrary facts and articles. Since that seemed to be a lost cause, I took up "dell's",( fred's, wayne's) challenge about his 10 stocks beating BA "going forward" from March 2011. When it seemed that he might have put me on ignore and couldn't stand to see the latest weeks results of his stocks falling behind BA (he claimed many months later that he really meant some of the 10 should be shorted, HaHa), I added "neospart99" for a while and acknowledged that I was the same as 99991. Maybe I'll go back to using that one since some on this board are having trouble differentiating the IDs, although the style and subject matter should be quite obvious.

The proposal would double the number of Border Patrol agents from 20,000 to 40,000, spend billions of dollars on enhanced surveillance equipment for the border, and double the amount of border fencing required by the bill, from 350 to 700 miles.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372084085498</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:28:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372084219896-64</Id><Topic><Title>How good are ex Boeing CEOs</Title><Username>barbing1965</Username><Timestamp>1372022232208</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 17:17:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>read up on the sonic cruiser it is the mother of the 787 failure</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372084219896</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:30:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372084661872-65</Id><Topic><Title>UNH so that is how you make 1.38% on a down day and out ,learning yet Boeing blarkers</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372082878448</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:07:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I did not see your post so you making that up I posted ACAD up 1000% in one year freeveritas your a Boeing hack so how much did you lose of Boeing today over 3% then Boeing year to date has beat VHS by 32% so your a liar, a one day spike is your crapola after the fact call, your a fraud . acad is up 300% year to date and Boeing is much better than VHS so your picking stock after the fact for a one day spike yoru a Boeing barker who does not know how to read a stock chart or you would never be making that crapols claim and where is yoru call on this message board pre the VHS call , nothing there but acad and Tare in my hstory as well as Airbus befor the stock move freveritas your a fraud</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372084661872</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:37:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372084937497-66</Id><Topic><Title>UNH so that is how you make 1.38% on a down day and out ,learning yet Boeing blarkers</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372082878448</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:07:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Waynedick-feb lies lies lies...lol u never posted anything except monday mornings...after the fact...lol!</Msg><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1372084937497</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:42:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372085287410-67</Id><Topic><Title>How good are ex Boeing CEOs</Title><Username>barbing1965</Username><Timestamp>1372022232208</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 17:17:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read up on Aerospatiale (todays EADS/Airbus) maker of the Concorde and learn about failure.</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1372085287410</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:48:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372085491127-68</Id><Topic><Title>How good are ex Boeing CEOs</Title><Username>barbing1965</Username><Timestamp>1372022232208</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 17:17:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Any CEO in Corporate America, or anyone that has run a successful small business is light years ahead, and more knowledgeable regarding the economy, and how to make a profit then the Regime' we have destroying the economy in WA DC.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1372085491127</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:51:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372085554624-69</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans want 20,000 more Border Patrol Agents</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372084085498</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:28:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>RINOs will settle for business as usual, nice try spazticus, err stik#$%$, republicans want to secure the borders and the same rules for EVERYBODY, not just cheaters and lawbreakers. the latest effort to legalize illegals will seal the deal for dumbos, transforming American into a 2nd / 3rd rate useless nation, securing an endless reign of power for lying dumbogogues</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372085554624</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:52:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372085586111-70</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus wants to recruit Boeing workers , the list of to do items</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372006423793</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 12:53:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't make such a dumb statement.

The first is that in his column today, Michael Gerson of the Washington Post writes, “The GOP’s political goal is modest. It doesn’t need to win majorities among minorities, just avoid lopsided losses.” That’s quite right. Consider Mitt Romney in 2012. If he had merely secured 42 percent of the Hispanic vote—rather than 27 percent—Romney would have won the popular vote and carried Florida, Colorado, and New Mexico. And if breaking the 40 percent barrier sounds like an impossible goal, recall that George W. Bush won over 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004. That doesn’t mean Governor Romney didn’t have problems with other parts of the electorate, including blue-collar voters in key states. It simply means that losing the Hispanic vote by 44 percent makes it increasingly difficult for Republicans to win national elections. My second observation is that many of the most ferocious critics of immigration reform claim they are the sons and daughters of the Reagan Revolution, the true of heirs of Reagan. But they are–in both policy and tone–most un-Reagan like. As this post documents, Reagan himself not only signed legislation granting amnesty to three million illegal immigrants in exchange for relatively weak enforcement measures; he never demonized illegal immigrants. In 1977, for example, Reagan criticized “the illegal alien fuss” and said illegal aliens may “actually [be] doing work our own people won’t do.” More broadly, Reagan emphasized the great and vivifying diversity that immigrants brought to this country, and that flowed into and became as one with the national fabric. In Reagan’s words: We have a statue in New York Harbor . . . of a woman holding a torch of welcome to those who enter our country to become Americans. She has greeted millions upon millions of immigrants to our country. She welcomes them still....</Msg><Username>stupidrightwingbigot</Username><Timestamp>1372088935437</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 11:48:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372088976632-101</Id><Topic><Title>IMPEACH OBAMA AND ALL THE SCANDALS WILL GO AWAY !!!!!!!!!OBAMA IS THE ROOT OF THESE SCANDALS</Title><Username>americafirst570</Username><Timestamp>1372076466798</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 08:21:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bushhhhhhhhhhh, you're a one trick stooge. try this one...moore-onnnnnnnnnnnn</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372088976632</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 11:49:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372089179414-102</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans want 20,000 more Border Patrol Agents</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372084085498</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 10:28:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dems will counter with Walmart style greeters at the border handing out bottled water, maps, a sheet of key English phrases, gift baskets and vote Dem pins. lol</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372089179414</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 11:52:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372089227552-103</Id><Topic><Title>IMPEACH OBAMA AND ALL THE SCANDALS WILL GO AWAY !!!!!!!!!OBAMA IS THE ROOT OF THESE SCANDALS</Title><Username>americafirst570</Username><Timestamp>1372076466798</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 08:21:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rushbo listeners epitomize the stupidrightwing low information voter.

(AP) — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has disappointed some of her liberal base with her defense of the Obama administration's classified surveillance of U.S. residents' phone and Internet records. Some of the activists attending the annual Netroots Nation political conference Saturday booed and interrupted the San Francisco Democrat when she commented on the surveillance programs carried out by the National Security Agency and revealed by a former contractor, Edward Snowden, The San Jose Mercury News reports. The boos came when Pelosi said that Snowden had violated the law and that the government needed to strike a balance between security and privacy. As she was attempting to argue that Obama's approach to citizen surveillance was an improvement over the policies under President George W. Bush, an activist, identified by the Mercury News as Mac Perkel of Gilroy, stood up and tried loudly to question her, prompting security guards to escort him out of the convention hall. "Leave him alone!" audience members shouted. Others yelled "Secrets and lies!," ''No secret courts!" and "Protect the First Amendment!," according to the Mercury News. Perkel told the newspaper that he thinks Pelosi does not fully understand what the NSA is up to. Several others in the audience walked out in support of Perkel. "We're listening to our progressive leaders who are supposed to be on our side of the team saying it's OK for us to get targeted" for online surveillance, said Jana Thrift of Eugene, Ore. "It's crazy. I don't know who Nancy Pelosi really is." Netroots Nation is an organizing and training convention for progressive political leaders. Pelosi was Saturday's keynote speaker at the event, which opened Thursday at the San Jose Convention Center and was scheduled to conclude Sunday.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1372089930091</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 12:05:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372090016240-108</Id><Topic><Title>IMPEACH OBAMA AND ALL THE SCANDALS WILL GO AWAY !!!!!!!!!OBAMA IS THE ROOT OF THESE SCANDALS</Title><Username>americafirst570</Username><Timestamp>1372076466798</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 08:21:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you sound hateful, kinda like the "teabaggers" at msdnc, cnn....</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372090016240</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 12:06:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372090042062-109</Id><Topic><Title>IMPEACH OBAMA AND ALL THE SCANDALS WILL GO AWAY !!!!!!!!!OBAMA IS THE ROOT OF THESE SCANDALS</Title><Username>americafirst570</Username><Timestamp>1372076466798</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 08:21:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You think illegal wars, throwing innocent people in the dungeon, and hoovering up every email and phone call in the USA are "nothing but hot air"?

Her firm was an early investor in Tesla, . An acquisition of Tesla “could be a possibility, but it’s also a strong possibility that they stay independent for the near future because they can,” Pfund said.

I originally took out the spartacus99991 nick back when I was toying with the "sparty" who was big into 9/11 conspiracies and I liked to point out contrary facts and articles. Since that seemed to be a lost cause, I took up "dell's",( fred's, wayne's) challenge about his 10 stocks beating BA "going forward" from March 2011. When it seemed that he might have put me on ignore and couldn't stand to see the latest weeks results of his stocks falling behind BA (he claimed many months later that he really meant some of the 10 should be shorted, HaHa), I added "neospart99" for a while and acknowledged that I was the same as 99991. Maybe I'll go back to using that one since some on this board are having trouble differentiating the IDs, although the style and subject matter should be quite obvious.

Get people a job the way of the GOP. Even Bernanke said Obama's policies do not support a recovery. Now look at Africa, just what Obama promotes, racism against Whites and Blacks.

Maybe I'll go back to using that one since some on this board are having trouble differentiating the IDs, although the style and subject matter should be quite obvious so spartacus9991 or is it neospart99 or is it censored 50 or is it joe dokes 45 BTW " going foreword" look it up, neospart99,I am a stock market trader and going , forward as definedis a "near term "word not a forever word , neospart99 .tsla up 7% today and it wasnear term for ACAD for a year up 1000% you missed it all the way. until the FED spoke last week .

So why do you care if I post the facts about Boeing and Airbus you seem to be annoyed and yet political posting does not bother you . It is so obvious you are Boeing barkers . When I was making thousands of percent on Apple it was the same thing , go to apple After Jobs died I moved to ACAD and made another thousand percent, now its tesla and I made one hundred percent in just fifteen days and called my trade Boeing barkers if you are really stock market investors that information should be good news for you.

Senate bill 5 aims to ban abortion after 20 weeks, force clinic doctors to hold admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and restrict abortions to surgical centers, measures that opponents say will virtually outlaw the procedure in the state and deny thousands of women vital medical care. “If this passes, abortion would be virtually banned in the state of Texas, and many women could be forced to resort to dangerous and unsafe measures,” Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also oppose the measure. Hundreds of protesters filled the Capitol building on Sunday to voice their opposition to the measure, while House Democrats tried to delay the vote by drawing out the debate and adding amendments to alter the bill. As reported by Chris Tomlinson at the Associated Press, one such amendment would have called for an exemption to the ban in cases of rape and incest; state Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, R-Parker, felt such an exception was unnecessary because “in the emergency room they have what’s called rape kits where a woman can get cleaned out,” she said, incorrectly comparing the procedure to collect physical evidence after a sexual assault to an abortion. “The woman had five months to make that decision, at this point we are looking at a baby that is very far along in its development.” Following the exchange, Laubenberg, who is also the bill’s sponsor and a member of the state’s public health committee, rejected all proposed changes to the measure. House Republicans then forced a vote. The measure passed 97-33. Senate Democrats said they will try to stage a filibuster until the special legislative session ends at midnight Tuesday night.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372115269480</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 19:07:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372115282284-244</Id><Topic><Title>spartacus whats your agenda on the boeing message board revealed</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372107268746</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 16:54:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>domerrrrr45, so you just admittted yoru spartacus9991 and uniposter99 , any other reasons to keep wishing? then spartie you have been hated by other users , that is how you came to defend yourself and posted your manipulative reasonsfor being here to , chris genna your not the same sparti your a different sparit sure you are , right that makes makes no sense .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372115282284</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 19:08:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372115348903-245</Id><Topic><Title>What to do About Syria</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1371648116954</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 09:21:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Err....haven't we tried your solution in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, and perhaps to some degree in Pakistan?

How the tax agency improperly singled out Tea Party groups for extra scrutiny in a nefarious political vendetta against conservatives because the agency is either inherently liberal or was acting on orders from the Democratic President? Remember how it cost even Mitt Romney the election? Well, as it turns out, that whole scandal is entirely bogus. False. A fiction. The entire notion that the agency singled out groups with “Tea Party” in their name in simply wrong, we learn today, thanks to new documents revealed by the Associated Press. The documents, and confirmation from officials, show the IRS targeted groups with other keywords in their names, including “Progressive” and “Occupy.” “There was a wide-ranging set of categories and cases that spanned a broad spectrum” on the lists, newly appointed IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said on a conference call with reporters. So the IRS was targeting Tea Party groups, but it was also targeting progressive groups, which means it wasn’t really singling out anyone. And remember the only group actually denied tax-exempt status was a progressive one. This should put this matter to bed forever. All along, everyone agreed that the problem with the IRS’ behavior was that the agency seemed to be giving extra scrutiny to groups of one political affiliation, and not the other. Now we know that it targeted groups on both sides. The IRS still considers some of the criteria “inappropriate,” but this seems to deescalate the controversy to an wonky internal agency matter, rather than a national political scandal.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372115830588</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 19:17:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372116035410-249</Id><Topic><Title>spartacus if yoru not doging me, then put me on ignore</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372109173106</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 17:26:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nope dell george, and fred james quit posting or you would be all over them, spartacus9991 that is a deceptive statment, or plain languege a is just another of your propaganda statments " is a lie spartacus9991 when is the last time fred or dell posted eh ! when is the last time your avatoar posted uniposter99?

Dionne, Jr. WASHINGTON—The roof fell in on John Boehner’s House of Representatives last week. The Republican leadership’s humiliating defeat on a deeply flawed and inhumane farm bill was as clear a lesson as we’ll get about the real causes of dysfunction in the nation’s capital. Our ability to govern ourselves is being brought low by a witches’ brew of right-wing ideology, a shockingly cruel attitude toward the poor on the part of the Republican majority, and the speaker’s incoherence when it comes to his need for Democratic votes to pass bills. Boehner is unwilling to put together broad bipartisan coalitions to pass middle-ground legislation except when he is pressed to the wall. Yet he and his lieutenants tried to blame last Thursday’s farm legislation fiasco—the product of a massive repudiation by GOP conservatives of their high command—on the Democrats’ failure to hand over enough votes. He seemed to think he could freely pander to the desire of right-wing members of his caucus to throw millions of low-income Americans off the food stamp program. When that didn’t produce enough votes, he then expected Democrats to support a measure that most of them rightly regarded as immoral. In the end, the bill went down, 234-195, with 62 Republicans voting no and 24 Democrats voting yes—more help, by the way, than Nancy Pelosi usually got from Republicans when she was speaker. Boehner can’t have it both ways, and he should be called out if he lets his party’s disarray throw the nation into an entirely unnecessary debt-ceiling crisis this fall. The nation shouldn’t be held hostage because of Republican chaos. Advertisement Start with the food stamp cuts, and let’s remember that this program is a monument to bipartisanship. The current form of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is, in large part, the product of an unlikely alliance between former Sens. Bob Dole and George McGovern in the 1970s. They were far apart ideologically, but both were horrified that too many Americans were going without nourishment. Food stamps have been an enormous success in curbing hunger in our rich nation, while also serving as a powerful stimulus to economic recovery during hard times. The bill the House voted down would have cut food stamps by $20.5 billion, eliminating food assistance to nearly 2 million low-income people, most of them working families with children or senior citizens. This alone should have been bad enough to sink the bill. But then Republicans pushed through an amendment by Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., to toughen work requirements in the program. Work requirements sound reasonable until you look at what Southerland’s amendment was actually designed to do. As Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, explained, Southerland’s proposal violated “the most basic standards of human decency” because it made no effort, as other work requirements have in the past, to create employment openings for those who “want to work and would accept any job or work slot they could get, but cannot find jobs in a weak economy.” In fact, noted Greenstein, a longtime advocate of nutrition assistance, the amendment barred states “from spending more on SNAP employment and training than they do now.” And it created incentives for states to throw people off food stamps by letting their governments keep half the SNAP savings to use for anything they wished (including, for example, tax cuts for the wealthy). In a more rational political world, progressives and small-government conservatives might join forces to slash subsidies for agribusiness and wealthy farmers while containing market distortions bred by price supports. But when Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., proposed an amendment to restore some of the food stamp funding by reducing spending on crop insurance, it was defeated. And Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., exposed hypocrisy on the matter of government handouts by excoriating Republican House members who had benefited from farm subsidies but voted to cut food stamps. The collapse of the farm bill will generally be played as a political story about Boehner’s failure to rally his own right wing. That’s true as far as it goes and should remind everyone of the current House leadership’s inability to govern. But this is above all a story about morality: There is something profoundly wrong when a legislative majority is so eager to risk leaving so many Americans hungry. That’s what the bill would have done, and why defeating it was a moral imperative.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372116272830</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 19:24:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372116361270-252</Id><Title>so spartacus99991 when are your going to put wayne on ignore now eh !</Title><Msg>so since fred and dell no longer post what is yoru new excuse for not putting wayne on ignore you want to dog him ?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372116361270</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 19:26:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372116577820-253</Id><Topic><Title>spartacus whats your agenda on the boeing message board revealed</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372107268746</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 16:54:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you don't like what I have to say you'll have to live with it.... the CEO of Airbus never said the A350 was 25 percent more fuel efficient than the 787 ... and YES 9-11 was an inside job</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1372116577820</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 19:29:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372116927050-254</Id><Topic><Title>marmaps why are you claiming some one is singling out Boeing on the BA message board wow</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372114811540</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 19:00:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They gotta put the money someplace.

The practice of compensated stock endorsements is currently prohibited by Fox rules, and resulted in the recent contract termination of contributor Tobin Smith. According to a Media Matters review, Payne was paid $40,000 to promote The Brainy Brands Company, "$25,000 by a third party" to promote NXT Nutritionals Holdings, and an undisclosed amount for a "consulting arrangement" to promote Generex Biotechnology Corporate. The share prices of the companies Payne was paid to tout are now essentially worthless. Payne forecasted lofty gains for investors who bought those stocks. He projected in 2011 that Brainy Brands could hit $4.50 a share in three years. At the time of the pitch, Brainy Brands was trading at around $1.35 -- it's now below 1 cent. Payne claimed in 2009 that NXT could "turn $10,000 into $25,000." At the time, NXT was trading for $2.00 -- it's now below 1/10th of a cent. And Payne claimed in November 2007 that Generex, then at $1.58, was a long term "screaming buy" which could hit $7.00. It's now trading at roughly 4 cents. Aside from rosy projections, Payne's sponsored stock pitches shared a common theme: using his cable news and Fox credentials to assure skeptical investors that his advice was trustworthy. A direct marketing company which worked with Payne stated it brandished Payne's Fox News connections "to build credibility" with his potential customers. The stock pitches were also used as a vehicle to entice readers to join Payne's subscription newsletter. Fox policy prohibits contributors from receiving compensation to promote a stock. MarketWatch -- which, like Fox, is owned by News Corp. -- reported on June 18 that a spokesman said "no Contributor to FBN, nor his/her firm, and/or family members are allowed to accept financial consideration of any kind whatsoever to issue research, advertisements, or to otherwise promote individual stocks or securities." As a result of the rule, Fox News fired contributor Tobin Smith, who regularly releases sponsored research reports (Smith claimed his contract "did NOT include any exclusion from me or my company sponsored research"). While Fox currently prohibits financial arrangements like Payne's, it's not clear whether his actions specifically violated Fox rules. MarketWatch quoted Smith claiming that the rule was instituted in "late" 2012, or after the three Payne stock promotions studied in this report first occurred. It's also not clear if Payne has been compensated for stock promotions after 2011. Regardless, even if Payne's actions occurred before an official Fox policy, he still used Fox's brand to engage in practices that the network now thinks is problematic enough to prohibit and fire an employee. Fox and Payne did not respond to requests for comment. Payne and his company, Wall Street Strategies, have a problematic history related to the disclosure of paid stock endorsements. In 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that while not "admitting or denying" wrongdoings, Payne "agreed to pay a civil penalty of $25,000." The SEC alleged of Payne: The Complaint alleges that on at least eight occasions, Wall Street Strategies recommended that its clients purchase Members stock through recorded messages on its telephonic stock recommendation service. The Complaint also alleges that Payne failed to disclose that he received payments from Members to promote Members stock.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372117581860</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 19:46:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372118501282-257</Id><Title>Muchelle said someone gong to have to give up thier piece of the pie.
