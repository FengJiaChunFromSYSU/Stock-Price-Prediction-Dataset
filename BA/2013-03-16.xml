Why did Dems support the Iraq war in Bush's first term? They had access to everything Colin Powell used to make the case for war. If Dems knew it was all BS, why didn't they speak up and try to stop him? Your denial of Dem involvement means that you either don't understand anything or that you choose not to understand anything. If Dems want to send Bush to the Swiss then Obama would have to go with him because Obama was warned by his lawyers to seek Congressional approval before continuing the Iraq war and Afghanistan and Obama chose not to do so. Any investigation would hurt both sides in a political scorched Earth result that would only create further mistrust in all politicians.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1363444276819</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 10:31:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363444972323-20</Id><Topic><Title>Calling Out Ryan’s Radicalism</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1363395380609</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 20:56:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I give facts...you give typical libtard stinky pooo.

Speaking to Newsmax TV at CPAC 2013, Keene said former President Bill Clinton was right when he warned Obama around Christmas last year to tread carefully as he considered expanding gun restrictions. “[Gun control proposals were] one of the main reason for Republicans seizing the House in 1994. Americans care about the Second Amendment and the president is seeing that,” Keene said. Keene was in Albany recently following the passage of expanded gun control in New York. There, he witnessed more than 10,000 people braving the rain to protest the expanded laws, which he believes sent a strong message to the president and Democrats. Urgent: Support Obama's Gun Ban Plan? Vote in Poll “There are rallies like that all over the country. Members of Congress are receiving lots of letters. It’s clear the narrative that the president tried to construct was wrong. That’s the reason a lot of what [Obama] proposed is being slowed down,” Keene said.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363453334010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:02:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363453656573-29</Id><Title>Medical Examiner Snubs Official Request for Adam Lanza Toxicology Report</Title><Msg>Was Connecticut Shooter, Adam Lanza, on Psychiatric Drugs? Kelly Patricia O’Meara Cchrint.org March 16, 2013 While state and federal lawmakers frantically push for massive mental health reform and sweeping gun control laws, two Connecticut mothers recently took to the streets of Newtown, connecting with local residents and gathering signatures on a petition that asks a simple but essential question—did prescription psychiatric drugs play a role in the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting? Seems like an easy and obvious question that, remarkably, has escaped the consideration of legislators who seem hell-bent on legislating increased mental health services without first having all the necessary information to make thoughtful, fact-based decisions. Sheila Matthews, co-founder of AbleChild, a national parents’ rights organization, and Newtown resident, Patricia Sabato, went one-on-one with local residents to collect hundreds of signatures requesting the release of the complete autopsy/toxicology results and medical/psychiatric records of alleged shooter, Adam Lanza. To back up the need for full disclosure of Lanza’s records, the petition points out certain undisputed facts, such as, at least 31 school shootings and/or school-related acts of violence have been committed by those taking or withdrawing from psychiatric drugs resulting in 162 wounded and 72 killed. The Petition further points out that 22 international drug regulatory warnings have been issued on psychiatric drugs causing violent behavior, including mania, psychosis and homicidal ideation. Additionally, between 2004-2011, there were nearly 13,000 reports to the FDA’s MedWatch system of psychiatric drugs causing violent side effects, including homicide, mania and aggressive behavior. Both Matthews and Sabato were gratified by the community’s support. “The vast majority of the people were really supportive of our efforts,”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363453656573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:07:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363455776170-30</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes 500 Rich List Acquiring BA Shares!</Title><Username>james.tingle</Username><Timestamp>1362414215788</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:23:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report !</Msg><Username>oyolam</Username><Timestamp>1363455776170</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:42:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363455946387-31</Id><Topic><Title>BA Insider Trading Reported !!!</Title><Username>doris.shealey</Username><Timestamp>1361811207875</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 11:53:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report !</Msg><Username>oyolam</Username><Timestamp>1363455946387</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:45:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363456191982-32</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats SHOCKED by Support for Second Amendment</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363453334010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:02:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is beyond belief.

The $85 billion in cuts began on March 1 after a gridlocked U.S. Congress was unable to resolve fiscal fights and find a solution to replace the sequestration. Students who have already enrolled in classes using the tuition assistance program will be allowed to complete those classes, according to a memo from the Army announcing the cancellation of the program. "This suspension is necessary given the significant budget execution challenges caused by the combined effects of a possible year-long continuing resolution and sequestration," the Army memo said. "The Army understands the impacts of this action and will re-evaluate should the budgetary situation improve." The Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard have also suspended their tuition assistance programs. Another example of the Promise broken to 'Support Our Veterans" and Active service Members. Although Pres. Obama has managed to raise VA funding for some issues in this tight "bugget" (?) times, I would hope All Congressional members work toward Increases in Support of those that are now Serving and those that have Served ALL of US here in America......</Msg><Username>tcmoiba</Username><Timestamp>1363462980542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 15:43:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363463081725-47</Id><Topic><Title>The Raven and Hooz are always in the same</Title><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1363462161742</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 15:29:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That makes "two" of you.

On Friday, newly installed Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel held a press conference in which he outlined serious, urgent measures the Obama Administration is undertaking, just in case North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un isn't joking. Specifically, Hagel announced that "in order to bolster our protection of the homeland and stay ahead of this threat," the U.S. is taking several steps. Chief among them, the Defense Department plans to purchase and deploy 14 additional ground-based interceptor missiles under the Missile Defense Agency's Ground-Based Midcourse Defense program. BOEING (NYSE: BA ) manages this program, in which Raytheon (NYSE: RTN ) AN/TPY-2 radar systems detect ballistic missile launches, which are then hit-to-killed by Raytheon warheads launched atop Orbital Science (NYSE: ORB) -built missiles. The U.S. currently has 30 such interceptor missiles in its arsenal. Adding 14 more is expected to cost $1 billion.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1363472741074</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 18:25:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363473519824-62</Id><Topic><Title>What IS going on here...........</Title><Username>alangonquin</Username><Timestamp>1363467840784</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 17:04:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's just another brick in the wall of a pysop.</Msg><Username>alangonquin</Username><Timestamp>1363473519824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 18:38:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363473594659-63</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats SHOCKED by Support for Second Amendment</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363453334010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:02:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, what's really astonishing is how fat you are.

But it is routine for you to insult everyone else's service but your own. Here is most of it, courtesy of Wikipedia. For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as Commanding Officer, USS Liberty (AGTR-5) in the Eastern Mediterranean on 8–9 June 1967. Sailing in international waters, the Liberty was attacked without warning by jet fighter aircraft and motor torpedo boats which inflicted many casualties among the crew and caused extreme damage to the ship. Although severely wounded during the first air attack, Captain (then Commander) McGonagle remained at his battle station on the badly damaged bridge and, with full knowledge of the seriousness of his wounds, subordinated his own welfare to the safety and survival of his command. Steadfastly refusing any treatment which would take him away from his post, he calmly continued to exercise firm command of his ship. Despite continuous exposure to fire, he maneuvered his ship, directed its defense, supervised the control of flooding and fire, and saw to the care of the casualties. Captain McGonagle's extraordinary valor under these conditions inspired the surviving members of the Liberty's crew, many of them seriously wounded, to heroic efforts to overcome the battle damage and keep the ship afloat. Subsequent to the attack, although in great pain and weak from the loss of blood, Captain McGonagle remained at his battle station and continued to conn his ship for more than seventeen hours. It was only after rendezvous with a United States destroyer that he relinquished personal control of the Liberty and permitted himself to be removed from the bridge. Even then, he refused much needed medical attention until convinced that the seriously wounded among his crew had been treated. Captain McGonagle's superb professionalism, courageous fighting spirit, and valiant leadership</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1363478142917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 19:55:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363478404013-75</Id><Topic><Title>Radical left and radical right all controlled by Israel and Mossad.</Title><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1362682592889</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 13:56:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Being a halocaust denier puts you in the same club with the Iranian looney toon and Hugo Chavez and David Duke.
