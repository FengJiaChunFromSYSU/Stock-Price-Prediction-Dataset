I see this as still having a significant amount of question marks," said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Imperial Capital in San Francisco. National Transportation Safety Board head Deborah Hersman said regulators must review the "special conditions" used in approving lithium-ion battery technology on the 787 Dreamliners, after two battery related safety incidents in a matter of days " On positive news it may be months but at least one customer is happy to report eventually after 3.8 years late to the market and over 33 billion extra cheap outsourcing and no control of the product good news is a coming ( you bettya) IGA CEO, one of the inner circle boys said,” I don't know how long it's going to take for them because they will have to do some redesigning of the battery system and I'd expect it to take a couple of months In short, Boeing’s hopes of a strategic victory are gone, or at least deferred this 3.8 years delay is allowing Airbus to study and improve their new plane to compete with the failed Boeing 787. It was 2003 . Remember the Boeing CEO on rollout of the 787 told the crowd that the plane would fly within two months. Reality of Board Room group think, , It would be more than two years before the plane's first test flight. Now a full decade later it is worse total gounding and redesiging,. How are those cheap outsourcing ideas that flew around teh Board Room working for you now MR Boeing CEO? I guess the 787 did not set the Boeing Company stock on fire! Boeing stock , in five years is up 2.9% while all major stock market averages are buring up Boeing Stock investorss the Dow at a high and the other averages lighting fire to boeing losing value investors. The S and P average which can be inested in with a ETF is up over 36% in just three years and individual stocks , if you know how to trade would have made any investor 100 percent multiples over that past 5 years . You could have made 5000% in apple until Steve Jobs died and then moved into other stocks or just buy and hold the averages to burn up Boeing investors returns !

Bush painting Lyndon Baines Johnson, a thoroughly corrupt Texas politician, gained office through the death of JFK, and held office during the high profile assassinations of MLK and RFK, when Johnson stunned political observers and declined to run for re-election. He died four years, almost to the day, after leaving office, reportedly after suffering from severe depression. Lawyer and close LBJ associate Barr McClellan wrote the 2003 book Blood, Money &amp; Power, which implicated LBJ in the Kennedy assassination, and reported on his swift decline after office: “He was exhausted. The emotions of paranoia and depression left him weakened. The decision was spur of the moment. He instantly regretted it. Clark did not know and never forgave him. By 1968, Johnson was a broken man and could take no more.” Nixon’s resignation after the pressure from the Watergate scandal threatened impeachment, was bitter and reluctant, much like his narrow loss to Kennedy in the 1960 presidential race and subsequent embarrassing defeat to Pat Brown for California governor in 1962, after which he bitterly told the press, “You won’t have Nixon to kick around anymore.” Nixon after Watergate was reportedly paranoid, isolated, unhinged and depressed. He took frequent long walks on the beach, rarely meeting with the press or public eye, and used his Phlebitis illness to avoid subpoenas to testify in trials for his former cabinet officials after being formally pardoned by Gerald Ford. Bush 43 swiftly left the limelight, with the celebrity and precedent of Obama, the first black president, taking over the media focus with deafening thunder, effectively giving the first presidential dynastic successor since John Quincy Adams (the 6th president), a clean get away from public scrutiny and frequent criticism. The Bush political family is solidly rooted in Skull &amp; Bones, and the skullduggery of East Coast blood bloods. His grandfather Prescott Bush worked in Wall Street banking for railroad heir and fellow bonesman Averill Harriman and played a prominent role in financing the Nazis before becoming Senator. His father, George H.W. Bush, worked the oil business before entering politics, while rising to power through his ties to the covert intelligence networks Skull &amp; Bones had used to found the CIA, which Bush 41 would head in the mid-1970s. Previous Bushes were involved in WWI munitions profiteering and Rockefeller oil interests, and the dynasty is overall deeply tied to the shadow network that has hijacked the country. George W. Bush, like LBJ and Nixon, was thoroughly complicit in the crimes of his administration, yet was also overwhelmed, chewed up and spit out by the shadow government system that used these puppet presidents to incrementally siphon off the Constitutional powers and protections through a long train of abuses. These used-vessels are left behind to carry the blame, scorn and weight of a dark, looming legacy that has undone the country. History is filled with such men, who did anything to gain power, but felt the stinging poison of their own medicine in decline</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360444291361</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 16:11:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360444794432-54</Id><Title>CEO to Engineers please don't go ! tick tock 10 more days</Title><Msg>Boeing Begs Its Union: Baby, Please Don't Go!

EVER HEAR OF SEWARDS FOLLY ??? The Alaska Purchase was the acquisition of the Alaska territory by the United States from the Russian Empire in the year 1867 by a treaty ratified by the Senate. Russia, fearing a war with Britain that would allow the British to seize Alaska, wanted to sell. Russia's major role had been forcing Native Alaskans to hunt for furs, and missionary work to convert them to Christianity. The purchase, made at the initiative of United States Secretary of State William H. Seward, gained the United States 586,412 square miles (1,518,800 km2) of new territory. Originally organized as the Department of Alaska, the area was successively the District of Alaska and the Alaska Territory before becoming the modern state of Alaska upon being admitted to the Union as a state in 1959.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1360465129318</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 21:58:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360465698956-81</Id><Title>Re: Sparty's fractured history</Title><Msg>Latch onto whatever you can perceive as victory, Loon.
