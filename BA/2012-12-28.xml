BTW the Dow Jones average beats Boeing, if you owened a etf DJ average it is up over 7% year to date, so never put all your money in a stock like Boeing when the whole Dow( lower risk over 30 stocks ) beats this BA loser company stock price ! One thing on the Boeing work force that is on the union's side is AIRBUS will start designing and building planes in USA. That will change the equation!. Boeing management has little competition in the USA market place a collective of USA aerospace companies , so they do as their ego's please. With movement by Airbus into the USA and their desire to hire the best Boeing workers, that will change the monopoly by USA aerospace. . And it will be better for America and airline industry in General. Competition from Aribus has killed Boeing about 50% of market share and yet the arrogant Chicago managment is still out of touch with reality. Workers at Airbus make more wages and benefits, get more vacation and produce less than american workers who ware the best in the world union or non union. It is simple chicago move to china if you want to pay your workers 50 doolars per month but in Seattle 50 dollars per month or per hour does not go far to buy a house food, clothing insurance for your car, cloths taxes, and all the other living expenses.

"I'd be scared of a return to the bad old days," said Aboulafia. "If there's anybody helping the Airbus A350 now, it's Boeing." Airbus' Leahy says Boeing won't be able to match his A350-1000 until around 2022. "It'll take them that long to come up with technology that'll be competitive," The outlook for Boeing is clouded by persistent industry worries over the company's strategy for the future. Is the Airbus A320neo narrow body jet already eclipsing Boeing's 737 MAX, years before either jet flies? With a shrinking order book for its new 747-8, will Boeing have to cut or stop production of the 747? Will Boeing's Executives in Chicago make sure that the engineers and technical workers strike early in the new year and shut down production? How much more shareholder money will the executives spend to raise the earnings per share so they can get executive compensation while the stockholder's get nothing. BA stock price is up only 3.38% year to date, while the Dow Jones average is up over 7 %, and the Bank of America, BAC is up 106%. All that failed 787 outsourcing worked to create a huge hiring build up in Puget Sound to fix the problems that the Chicago management team created on the 787. Also the other majpor fail problem from Chicago is being slow to move forward on all new derivative airplane programs. The facts show still more of the same too late to develop a derivative to continue! Boeing has added almost 5,000 new UNION jobs in Washington state in 2012, on top of 8,300 UNION paid workers in Washington, the year before. Boeing's in-state workforce to just shy of 87,000 — the highest total 13 years then add the cheaper labor in Carolina still a cost tot he shareholder and the land now, thi is not watching the core business, foucusing on derivaties . The idea of outsourcing the 787 was cheap labor, the facts clearly show that Chicago does not need cheap labor as it does not work. , chicago did need skilled labor and skilled engineer’s, but the cost of the best is not the cheap price. The result is the 787 is 3 years late 30 billion over budget and will not break even until 2021- 9 years from now . Usually, Boeing can break even in 4 years on a new plane and start to make money for Boeing shareholders. . This is the difference between the last Boeing designed and controlled plane the 777 and the cheap 787 , a total failure . Each 787 delivered cost the shareholder 116K in loss. A Company controlled and sponsored union SPEEA strike will cost the shareholder 250K per day. So far the Boeing Management is talking tuff to the only workers able to bring planes in on time and budget. Chicago listen up, the SPEEA and IAM workers, these are Americans , and the best workers in the world . Attention Boeing Managment like you the best workers in the world also have a labor contract, get over it Chicago.! So how is all that cheap outsourcing working for chicago Managment employee's now ?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1356689366323</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 05:09:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356692664128-6</Id><Topic><Title>Collectivism is an Admission your too stupid......</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1356662238396</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 21:37:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL!

REAL AMERICANS believe in Liberty and strong property rights. They realize that individual liberty is far more important than collectivism. They see government as an instrument empowered to protect the rights and property of individuals. " Now, legal plunder can be committed in an infinite number of ways. Thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it: tariffs, protection, benefits, subsidies, encouragements, progressive taxation, public schools, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed profits, minimum wages, a right to relief, a right to the tools of labor, free credit, and so on, and so on. All these plans as a whole—with their common aim of legal plunder—constitute socialism. But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime."</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1356704207974</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 09:16:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356704236980-9</Id><Topic><Title>Mahatma Ghandi's Quote concerning Gun Control</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356654640028</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 19:30:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does that have to do with the following quote: "Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the act of depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest." -- Mahatma Gandhi For a guy that preached non violent resistence...AND WE ALL KNOW HE DID...he ALSO knew that the best way to NON VIOLENCE was to keep his own people Armed....this concept is deep enough that you won't get it.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356704236980</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 09:17:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356704403219-10</Id><Title>US Drone Strikes TRIPLE in 2012</Title><Msg>US Drone operators were able to kill around seven people in Yemen earlier this week before going home to celebrate the holidays on Christmas Eve with their families. As blogger Kevin Gosztola notes: There was no ceasefire from the Obama administration during the holiday. In fact, it appears they waited until Christmas Eve on purpose to conduct a couple strikes as there had not been action in the covert drone war in Yemen for well over a month. In earlier wars, there may have been some kind of a truce because most of the soldiers and their families would be celebrating Christmas, however, characteristic of drone warfare, the drone pilots who carried out the order to fire upon suspected militants were nowhere near the area of the strike. They were completely detached and, depending on where they were when they directed the flying killer robot to attack, they were likely able to go home and see their family on Christmas Eve. The strikes come in the same week that a new report released by Washington based think tank, The New America Foundation revealed that the number of drone strikes in Yemen almost tripled in 2012, compared to 2011. In total, 53 known strikes were carried out this year, compared to 18 in 2011, AFP reported on Thursday. The figures indicate that between 397 and 539 “militants” were killed in the attacks. It is not known how many of those killed were innocent civilians. US officials did acknowledge for the first time this month, that a September drone attack in Yemen killed 12 civilians, including three children, who were all riding in one truck on a road close to the town of Radda. The Washington Post reported that the Yemeni government tried to cover up the incident so as not to incite backlash against the US government. Yemeni officials had claimed that only militants were killed in the attack, but were forced to backtrack when families of the dead brought bodies to the gates of the presidential residence. “Their bodies were burning,” recalled Sultan Ahmed Mohammed, 27, who was riding on the hood of the truck and flew headfirst into a sandy expanse. “How could this happen? None of us were al-Qaeda.” The Post report notes that the attack has resulted directly in more militants joining existing groups in surrounding areas to fight the government. “Our entire village is angry at the government and the Americans,” Mohammed said. “If the Americans are responsible, I would have no choice but to sympathize with al-Qaeda because al-Qaeda is fighting America.” The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, has found that at least 171 civilians, ****including 35 children,*** have been slaughtered in Yemen by secret US drone strikes over the past ten years. Communications released by WikiLeaks in 2010 revealed that the US and Yemen have repeatedly attempted to cover up the use of US warplanes to bombard Yemen.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356704403219</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 09:20:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356704675774-11</Id><Topic><Title>Anti-gun Hypocrite Michael Moore’s Bodyguard Arrested for Unregistered Gun</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356664264977</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 22:11:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh my – the schadenfreude is just too delicious, here: Filmmaker Michael Moore’s bodyguard was arrested for carrying an unlicensed weapon in New York’s JFK airport Wednesday night. Police took Patrick Burke, who says Moore employs him , into custody after he declared he was carrying a firearm at a ticket counter. Burke is licensed to carry a firearm in Florida and California, but not in New York. See, Moore believes in 2nd Amendment rights for his well-heeled self, but in typical totalitarian-embracing left-wing fashion, he just doesn’t believe in 2nd Amendment rights for the less well off or less politically connected. For more on Moore’s famous hypocrisy, see Jeff Kuhner of the Washington Times: The hypocrisy of Michael Moore from 2/11: Michael Moore is a hypocrite. He embodies all that is wrong with Hollywood: He is a shameless, self-serving propagandist masquerading as an idealistic “artist.” This week the famous left-wing movie director filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against the producers of his 2004 anti-war, anti-Bush film, “Fahrenheit 9/11.” The reason: Mr. Moore is demanding $2.7 million in unpaid profits that he says are owed to him. He has already pocketed nearly $20 million in profits from the blockbuster documentary. In other words, he has reaped a huge financial windfall. But this is not enough for him.

Young “There is no legitimate exception to the Second Amendment for military-style weapons, because military-style weapons are precisely what the Second Amendment guarantees our right to keep and bear. The purpose of the Second Amendment is to secure our ability to oppose enemies foreign and domestic, a guarantee against disorder and tyranny.” Kevin D, Williamson, writing at National Review, is right on the money here. Mr. Williamson continues, “Consider the words of Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story—who was, it bears noting, appointed to the Supreme Court by the guy who wrote the Constitution.” Story wrote, “The right of citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of the republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of the rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.” Kevin Williamson follows up with a frightening look at the organized-crime activities of the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Williamson concludes, “Power corrupts.
