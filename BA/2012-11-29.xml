O'Neill said he tried to warn Vice President Dick Cheney that growing budget deficits-expected to top $500 billion this fiscal year alone-posed a threat to the economy. Cheney cut him off.

A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, asked intelligence agencies to write up some unclassified talking points on the episode. Reporters were besieging him and other legislators for comment, and he did not want to misstate facts or disclose classified information. More than 10 weeks later, the four pallid sentences that intelligence analysts cautiously delivered are the unlikely center of a quintessential Washington drama, in which a genuine tragedy has been fed into the meat grinder of election-year politics. In the process, the most important questions about Benghazi, where Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed on Sept. 11, have largely gotten lost: Were requests for greater security for diplomats in Libya ignored? Even if Al Qaeda’s core in Pakistan has been decimated, what threat is posed by its affiliates and imitators in other countries where they have taken refuge? How can crucial diplomacy be conducted amid the dangerous chaos that has followed the toppling of dictators across the Arab world? Instead, it is the parsing of the talking points — who wrote them, altered them, recited them on television or tried to explain them — that could decide the fate of a leading candidate for secretary of state, Susan E. Rice, currently the United Nations ambassador. Now the talking points could also affect the chances of a top candidate for C.I.A. director, Michael Morell, the agency’s acting director, who on Tuesday accompanied Ms. Rice to a briefing for some of her most vocal Senate critics and misspoke about changes in the original draft of the talking points. Intelligence officials said Wednesday that Mr. Morell’s flub, which prompted a sharply worded statement from three Republican senators, was an insignificant mix-up: He said the F.B.I. had taken out a specific reference to Al Qaeda, when in fact that change was made by the C.I.A. The F.B.I. had added another phrase to the same sentence. “This was an honest mistake, and it was corrected as soon as it was realized,” one official said. “There is nothing more to this.” But such earnest attempts to lower the political temperature have so far failed. As so often in Washington, the clashes over Benghazi have a semi-hidden personal element that adds to the emotion. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who led the initial lambasting of Ms. Rice, had been subjected to withering criticism by her in 2008 when he was running for president. And senators considering Ms. Rice’s future are quite aware that her main rival for the job of secretary of state is their colleague Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. The facts about the talking points, like those about the Benghazi attack itself, have dribbled out slowly and awkwardly from intelligence officials who generally do not relish airing their internal deliberations. But there is now a fairly clear account. The C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies rarely prepare unclassified talking points; more often, policy makers submit proposed public comments, and intelligence analysts check them for classified information or errors of fact. But in the storm of news media coverage after the killings in Benghazi, C.I.A. officials responded quickly to Mr. Ruppersberger’s request on Sept. 14. C.I.A. analysts drafted four sentences describing “demonstrations” in Benghazi that were “spontaneously inspired” by protests in Cairo against a crude video lampooning the Prophet Muhammad. (Later assessments concluded there were no demonstrations.) The initial version of the talking points identified the suspected attackers — a local militant group called Ansar al-Shariah, with possible links to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, an offshoot of the terrorist network in North Africa. But during a subsequent review by several intelligence agencies, C.I.A. officials were concerned that such specific language might tip off the malefactors, skew intelligence collection in Libya and interfere with the criminal investigation. So they replaced the names with the blanket term “extremists.”</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1354202794968</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 10:26:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354202925493-18</Id><Topic><Title>Fiscal Cliff is a Scam !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354121772845</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 11:56:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very apropos sickman.

According to the Center for Federal Tax Policy: The fiscal cliff is the culmination of a decade of "temporary" tax and budget bills that have postponed resolution of key policy differences. Should the tax code be used to heavily promote income distribution or aim instead to raise revenue in the least distortive manner possible? How large should federal spending be? Should [The Affordable Care Act] be modified or repealed? Should there be a federal estate tax and if so, at what level? Should the payroll tax be reduced and if so, how should we fund Social Security and Medicare? What should Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid look like as the population ages? Is that a cliff? Only if you call it one. And then keep repeating it until everyone uses your shorthand that puts an image in people's minds of a looming catastrophe. This "cliff" has been around for decades.

This plan would avoid the massive tax hikes and spending cuts lawmakers agreed to last summer. At this point in the fiscal cliff negotiations, some Republicans are warming to the idea of raising revenues but they haven't committed to higher tax rates. President Obama insists on raising income tax rates for those earning more than $250,000 annually. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett favors higher tax rates on incomes above $500,000, and many in Washington and elsewhere are calling for an overhaul of the tax code that would eliminate or reduce common tax breaks. Related: Why Warren Buffett is Right About Raising Taxes on the Rich Economist Daniel Altman is proposing something completely different on the tax front --- a system that taxes wealth rather than revenue. It's not intended to raise more revenues but rather to reduce inequality which, he says, threatens growth. "Wealth inequality is making the pie smaller for all of us," Altman tells The Daily Ticker. It limits opportunities, which reduces productivity, and ultimately lowers "living standards for all of us in the long term." Altman, an adjunct professor at New York University's Stern School of Business and author of four books, says wealth inequality in the U.S. has been rising steadily for the past 20 years. "It's at a crazy high level that you only see in very poor countries, and it's starting to threaten growth," he says. Related: Fixing the Fiscal Cliff: Is Hiking Taxes on the Rich the Answer? He proposes to replace income, capital gains, estate and gift taxes with a progressive wealth tax that "would do much more to reduce [wealth inequality] than any other tax plan being considered in Washington," according to his recent New York Times op-ed. Altman's plan would exempt the first $500,000 of wealth from taxes, which he says would affect about 80% of households (these individuals would continue to pay payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare). The next $500,000 of wealth would be taxed at about 1% followed by a 2% tax on assets valued above $1 million. That's enough to replace all the money collected from taxes on income, capital gains, dividends, estates and gifts, says Altman. He says says taxes would rise for those whose wealth is valued at $10 million or more but taxes might even decrease for those with $3 million or less in assets. All these changes would be phased in over time as new workers enter the workforce. Current assets including large nest eggs would not be subject to the new tax, says Altman, and he stresses that his proposal would replace the current tax regime, not add to it. "Maybe it's time to update our tax code for the 21st century," says Altman.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1354207142120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 11:39:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354208035918-26</Id><Topic><Title>Taxing Wealth Is the Answer for Boosting Long-Term Growth</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1354207142120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 11:39:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a stupid idea.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1354208035918</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 11:53:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354208384787-27</Id><Topic><Title>Taxing Wealth Is the Answer for Boosting Long-Term Growth</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1354207142120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 11:39:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>then how do you FEEL about Fleecing The Rich</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1354208384787</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 11:59:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354209476828-28</Id><Topic><Title>Taxing Wealth Is the Answer for Boosting Long-Term Growth</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1354207142120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 11:39:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fats, This is from an on-line article written by a Brit, entitled, "Wealth taxes simply don’t work": "The problems involved were fairly basic. Do you tax people’s worldwide wealth? If so, those much-needed businessmen will stay away. Do you tax only British wealth? Then people will move their investments abroad. The Treasury warned Healey that the proposed wealth tax was “political dynamite” – and not in a good way. At a time when Britain was in a desperate economic state, it risked dragging the country down further still. Healey gave up, saying he could not find any wealth tax that would be worth the political hassle. All around Europe, governments of Left and Right have drawn the same conclusion. The last German and Austrian wealth taxes were abolished in 1997; Finland’s and Iceland’s in 2006; Sweden tore up its wealth tax in 2007, hoping to persuade its rich to invest more money at home. All of these governments acted from a desire for more tax revenue, not less. And all realised that the notion of wealth tax had been defeated by one of the most persistent forces in human history: mankind’s ingenuity at avoiding taxes."

Hard to say now for those that occurred 30+ years ago. What we do know is the following: 1. al Qaeda conducted the attack at Benghazi and that was known by the White House within 24 hours. 2. The White House denied both preventative and immediate security assistance to those at the diplomatic compounds – despite the early warnings of stalking by terrorists (warnings from the Ambassador himself and the American security professionals). 3. The White House said for two weeks thereafter that it was a "spontaneous demonstration that went out of control" in sympathy with events in Egypt that were related to a video – despite the denials of the Libyan government. 4. Now the White House is saying that knowledge of the involvement of al Qaeda was considered sensitive - therefore, it was redacted - but the narrative of redaction would NEVER result in saying that it was "spontaneous demonstration" and "related to a video". 5. The fact of al Qaeda being involved in the Benghazi attack was contrary to the story (a real whopper) at the 2012 Dem Con theme that "al Qaeda is on the path to defeat" (Obama). Instead, it is very much active and growing in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Mali, Sudan, Syria, and Libya.

The conservative media has fueled this confusion by distorting scientific research, hyping faux-scandals, and giving voice to groups funded by industries that have a financial interest in blocking action on climate change. Meanwhile, mainstream media outlets have shied away from the "controversy" over climate change and have failed to press U.S. policymakers on how they will address this global threat. When climate change is discussed, mainstream outlets sometimes strive for a false balance that elevates marginal voices and enables them to sow doubt about the science even in the face of mounting evidence.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354226404536</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:00:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354227121480-85</Id><Topic><Title>A pair of sevens and the queen of spades</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1354222733772</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 15:58:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>three 7's ( palming/holding the fourth 7) wanna play again ante UP that wuz close relieve ewes of thewir cash</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1354227121480</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:12:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354227913333-86</Id><Topic><Title>Repubs Have No New Proposals to Fix Economy</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1354218365197</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 14:46:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Take my Irish Republicon Account when you can count to more than four three, two, one... i like to blow stuff UP 401k's are better 4 sparrtowgt's maneuver</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1354227913333</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:25:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354228114624-87</Id><Topic><Title>Repubs Have No New Proposals to Fix Economy</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1354218365197</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 14:46:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A BID FOR THE WINTER O0LYMPICS SASCHI</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1354228114624</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:28:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354229908833-88</Id><Title>Mystified again</Title><Msg>Why is it that Government wants to take away our guns but yet it's perfectly fine with them carrying assault weapons?

In the middle of our pension discussion, The Boeing Company stopped negotiating and recommended a federal mediator be brought in to assist our talks. The Boeing team then packed up and left. Employers often invoke federal mediation when they do not see a path to achieve their goals during negotiations. Boeing rejected SPEEA wage proposals without providing a counterproposal. Using their flawed methodology, Boeing negotiators restated their belief that technical workers and engineers are overpaid and above “market.” The Boeing negotiators said SPEEA members do not deserve higher increases or higher guaranteed minimum raises than included in their Nov. 20 revised compensation offer. “These below-inflation raise pools and medical plan takeaways mean techs will lose money during the life of the contract,” said Joel Funfar, technical team member. SPEEA’s proposals are designed to align members’ compensation to the value we bring to Boeing.

And, you didn't judge me, did you when you said, "you sought so zealously for proof for the verdict you had already arrived at"? When Obama was voted in office, you may imagine that I did not vote for him. It had everything to do with the traditional Democrat (liberal) vs. Republican (conservative) values thing. In fact, it was a difficult choice because I didn't care that much for McCain, but I believed that "conservative" values would be held fast with McCain. Further, almost nothing was known - perhaps still is not - about Obama. His "voting record" - if you can call it that - was devoid of any substance as was anything about the rest of his life. The birth certificate thing controversy, the flirting with communism in college, the indefinite personal beliefs and his radical pastor (his spiritual advisor) who blasphemed from his pulpit, and obscurity relative to his upbringing simply were icing on the cake. Fast forward four years. Obama's accomplishments are: kill bin laden (A+); get out of Iraq (B, no sustaining troop agreement); get out of Afghanistan (D+, increased troops instead of decreased, lengthened the time there without any added value); war on terror (C, massive use of drones inflames negative passions, killed a lot of terrorist "suspects" but made more in the end); truthfulness (D-, Benghazi massive inconsistent and simply untruthful statements, Fast and Furious hiding behind “executive privilege” while stating that F&amp;F was a lower level action gone bad); the economy (F+ for Obamacare’s incredible economic intrusion, feckless performance on working with industry to increase jobs, unemployment no different than when he came into office); and foreign policy (a generous D+, for Israel, Syria, Egypt, Libya, and Iran). Overall score is a “C-“, which is hardly an endorsement. The only thing that he has going for him is this inordinate, creepy, and blasphemous adoration, this worship thing that is heaped upon him. That is frightening. And that is why Acts 12:21-23 is applicable. I didn’t judge Obama, his performance did. He did not deserve another four years. As to this recent post, I looked at what he is trying to accomplish with this nation, therefore, I struggled to see that he desires anything other than harm to the economy and our nation’s demise. There is no other way to explain it – despite the oft-stated insistence that it is Bush’s fault. As far as security of Israel is concerned, like he said, he has “provided unprecedented support to Israel” (he could not have been more ambiguous in choice of words or “dark sentences”) by working to surround her with extreme hostility all around. Between what he has done to Israel and what it looks like he is doing to the United States – Israel’s only true ally – Obama appears to me to be the forerunner or the embodiment of the prediction of Daniel, chapter 8.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1354230292683</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 18:04:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354230982991-91</Id><Topic><Title>Mystified again</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1354229908833</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:58:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please tell us what law is trying to take away your ugh?</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1354230982991</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 18:16:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354231014420-92</Id><Topic><Title>Mystified again</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1354229908833</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:58:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gun!</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1354231014420</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 18:16:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354231218811-93</Id><Topic><Title>Taxing Wealth Is the Answer for Boosting Long-Term Growth</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1354207142120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 11:39:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For Fats: "Bulky wants me to read Acts before i go to bed tonight when I can barely recite the Lords Prayer asking for forgiveness and giving thanks..." Fats, is that because you don't like, as Shocked called it, "science fiction", or you are dog tired by the time you go to bed? Four out of five nights a week, I read my Bible for about a half hour, maybe longer. A few chapters a night. For "Shocked", note that what we thought of as science fiction one hundred years ago - going to the moon, satellites, "ray guns" - often becomes science fact. So too, Biblical prophecy has been shown for thousands of years to be true and accurate over and over. Belief (in Jesus) is a simple process in and of itself, but it is the most difficult one ever for any person as they must confess that they are sinners deserving of going to hell. Hard to embrace for most. More difficult will be standing before God in judgment where He asks, "and what did you do about belief in my Son, the only path to me?"

I totally agree. This seems to be the trend. Hard to say if this is good or bad. I retired three years ago, so all I know is that the young people that worked with seemed OK with the arrangement. They are wonderful enthusiastic workers who are excited to be working in the aerospace industry.
