Here is the info from pro Obama Think Progress. _______________________________ The African-American Unemployment Crisis Continues By Travis Waldron on Nov 3, 2012 at 9:30 am The American labor market continued its steady recovery in October, as the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the economy added 171,000 jobs last month. The nation’s unemployment rate is now 7.9 percent, and there is an unquestionable recovery taking place. Lost in the positive news, though, is that the unemployment rate for African-Americans rose nearly a full point to 14.3 percent, up from 13.4 percent in September. The black unemployment rate has fallen from its Great Recession peak of 16.7 percent, but it’s at the same level it was in October 2011, even though the nation’s overall unemployment rate has fallen more than a full point since then. As this chart from The Roosevelt Institute’s Mike Konczal shows, black unemployment averaged 8.6 percent before the recession:</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1359033624401</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 08:20:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359034946677-24</Id><Topic><Title>Colin Powell slams GOP for 'idiot presentations,' 'demonizing' the president'</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1358849078652</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 05:04:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Such a shame to see this man become such a back stabbing hypocrite..

He makes boatloads of money. Millions. What’s more, he makes boatloads of money for a lot of other people in the process, including generating massive contributions to charity. He’s a jobs creator and an engine of economic growth, as are many other pro golfers and athletes. So Mickelson takes a look at his income tax burden, and is displeased. First we have Obama and the Democrats riding roughshod over the GOP and enacting a 4.6% tax increase on the evil rich. Then we have the voters of California doing what the voters of California have been doing – shooting themselves in the foot – by passing a ballot measure to raise state income taxes on the dastardly rich by another 3.32%. Now Mickelson is facing an income tax burden somewhere between 62 and 63%. Mickelson is a smart guy, and he hires other smart guys to help him make economic decisions. These other smart guys undoubtedly told Phil to put his clubs in a bag and get the hell out of California. Do what most of the other pro golfers have done, more to Florida. No state income tax. Right there his tax burden goes down by 13.3%, not to mention the advantages in estate taxes and ad valorem property taxes. Trust me. I know. So Mickelson suggests that he is going to have to make some “drastic changes” due to “what’s gone on in the last few months politically” and being “targeted both federally and by the state.” And now – guess what? Phil Mickelson is the personification of evil for suggesting he’s going to do what tens of thousands of Californians have done … cast his next vote with his feet. Mickelson gets hammered by the ObamaMedia and finally sidles up to the microphone and apologizes. He apologizes --- please sit down for this – to anyone he might have “upset or insulted.” Whisky Tango Foxtrot! How upside down can things be in America? Mickelson is being called “greedy.” Really? So now we define “greed” as wanting to keep more of the money you earn? If that’s greed, what do you call the moochers who go to the poll to vote for the politician that’s going to take that money away from you and give it to them? Oh wait! I know! Obama voters! Well … since the proggies are demanding apologies from Mickelson, I think there are a few people I would like to see apologize my own self! Let’s start with Angel Adams. Maybe you don’t remember her. The lovely and quite fertile Angel was found living in a motel room in Tampa with 12 of her 15 children by three different fathers. When the child welfare folks showed up with TV news crews in tow, she looked into the camera and announced “Somebody needs to pay for all my children. Somebody needs to be held accountable, and they need to pay!” No … not kidding. Here’s the video. Angel, by the way, has now downloaded No. 16 and was charged last October for battery on a police officer. Maybe Angel should be the one to hold a press conference and apologize to America on behalf of every woman who became pregnant by a man to whom she was not married, and then had a baby she new she could not afford to raise. I’d like an apology as well from all of those people who have been studiously avoiding taking a job until their unemployment benefits run completely out. You’re bleeding the system dry. So apologize! An apology is also due from the leaches who have been scamming the IRS for their Earned Income Tax Credit checks. EITC fraud is the most prevalent type of tax fraud in the US, costing the taxpayers hundreds of millions a year. Just fail to declare all your income and claim some extra dependents and the checks come flowing in! We dare not pursue these cheats though, because that would be insensitive towards the poor. How about an apology you tax cheats! While we’re at it, maybe the wizened citizens of Boca Raton, Florida who have been shown to treat their weekly visits to their doctor – paid for by Medicare – as really nothing more than a regular social gathering would like to apologize. Those of you who chose drugs as your escape from reality … would you like to apologize for what you’ve cost society in terms of crime and social services? Oh yeah … this list could go on for quite a while. The trouble is, the folks who really should be apologizing are favored constituencies of leftist politicians, while the folks we should apologize TO for plundering their wealth are greedy and the objects of constant derision and ridicule. So, Phil. You’ve learned your lesson, right? Do what you have to do to escape the moochers, leaches and parasites --- but hush about it. The predators get outraged when the prey escapes.

The bad news is that they also have no intention of passing any legislation about the mentally ill, which would actually do something to reduce these mass shootings. Instead, the Democrats will jawbone about "assault weapons" and other meaningless gun laws for the sole purpose of scaring soccer moms into hating the National Rifle Association. Expect to hear a lot about Republicans preferring "the gun lobby" to "children." (Which is evidently not at all like preferring the teachers lobby to children.) Democrats are hoping to pick up another dozen congressional seats in 2014, so they need terrified women. Just don't expect a vote. Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid cannot afford a vote on any of these nonsense gun laws because he needs to protect the seats of Democrats who have to get re-elected in districts where voters know something about guns. Even the stupidest politician has to know how utterly meaningless "assault weapon" bans are. (In fairness, New York's Rep. Carolyn McCarthy and Gov. Andrew Cuomo may not know.) But Democrats need to gin up the most easily fooled voters. "Assault weapons" are defined as "whatever politicians say they are." The guns that are banned and the ones that aren't are functionally identical. They're all semi-automatics. Semi-automatics shoot one bullet per trigger pull -- that's the definition. Any handgun manufactured since the Civil War is a "semi-automatic." The most basic self-defense revolver for women is a "semi-automatic." An example of a gun that is not a semi-automatic is a musket. Also those guns where a "BANG!" flag pops out when the clown pulls the trigger. An automatic firearm -- what militaries and drug cartels have -- continuously fires when the trigger is pulled. They have been subject to a near-total federal ban in this country since the 1930s, so they're irrelevant to the discussion. The only differences in the semi-automatics the Democrats want to ban and the ones they don't are purely cosmetic details, such as bayonet mounts or pistol grips. When is the last time anyone was killed with a bayonet in this country? Bayonets were rarely used even during the Civil War. Obama mocked the idea of bayonets during one of his debates with Romney. Now he's terrified of them!

Fog and low cloud ceiling conditions have been plentiful. The postings on this board have been prolific regading the 787. Most posters seem to be either short the stock or just people with an axe to grind against boeing and their management and have little to no value. A few have shown some intelligent thought in thinking about what the problem might be. As time goes by we can expect the volume of negative rantings to increase as they get desperate as their short srategy goes south on them and the boeing haters become frustrated with no sign of a major problem emerges. The testing goes on. The answer will be found. Till then, the idiots will continue to speculate. If you are tired of the negativity, make good use of the ignore user function. I hapen to find those negative post quite amusing. They reveal the mental deficiency of the posters. And it gives me something to do while the thermometer here in New England hovers in single digit territory. Next week brings a heat wave in which the temperatures get up to almost 50 degrees.

"In 2006, a devastating lab fire in Arizona showed just how volatile Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner lithium-ion battery can be if its energy is not adequately contained. A single battery connected to prototype equipment exploded, and despite a massive fire-department response the whole building burned down. On the finished Dreamliner, however, Boeing is confident its engineers can safely harness and contain that energy. The 787’s battery-fire protection regime aims both to make a catastrophic blowout impossible through multiple independent controls and also to compartmentalize any less serious battery meltdown, venting smoke outside until the high-temperature reaction burns itself out.

Clinton: “With all due respect, the fact is we have four dead Americans was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they’d go kill some Americans. What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.” While the mainstream media has remained largely quiet on the callous remark, some in the mainstream and alternative media have voiced concern over the callousness of the remark. Erik Wemple of The Washington Post wrote, “The trustworthiness of the administration’s version of events — even the early one — makes a difference. Whether it was hard-core terrorism or a spontaneous attack or something else — that makes a difference too, with strong implications for intelligence accountability. Goodness gracious, in her very own statement, Clinton herself even seems to acknowledge that it makes a difference, when she says, ‘It is our job to figure out what happened.’” Carol Platt Liebau of Townhall noted, “Clinton’s frustrated question lets slip the familiar liberal contempt both for members of the other party and for the ‘regular Americans’ they represent. To her, all the folderol about a film and a spontaneous protest that mushroomed may seem like little more than bureaucratic confusion — or a stab at savvy ‘crisis control’ in the midst of a presidential campaign. But to regular Americans, how and why something like this could have happened makes a great deal of difference, indeed. — as does the issue of whether they were intentionally deceived for days. They are fair questions, and her efforts to dodge them by claiming a desire to prevent future attacks are specious. Nothing says a government can’t both prevent similar catastrophes in the future and simultaneously give a full and accurate accounting of what happened in the past. In fact, the latter is a prerequisite of the former. Surely someone who famously worked for the Watergate committee can understand how Americans might be curious about whether there was deliberate deception at the highest levels of their government.” Clinton’s remark is sure to haunt her in future years as the frustrated response, equipped with fists pounding on the table, signaled a desire to move on from discussions of culpability in this whole quagmire of governmental ineptitude and dishonesty. At a time when Americans are demanding answers from government and an administration that promised transparency, this Benghazi scandal is not going away and Clinton’s desire to gloss over details may have created more discussion than anything else.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1359040512289</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:15:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359040902659-44</Id><Title>They still don't know what caused Battery fire</Title><Msg>Bloomberg reports that top U.S. regulators still do not have a clear answer to what went wrong with the aircrafts' lithium-ion batteries, which overheated and caused an emergency landing.</Msg><Username>wallstsharks</Username><Timestamp>1359040902659</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:21:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359041520999-45</Id><Topic><Title>Lithium battery fire burned down building 06</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1359012858752</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 02:34:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...Read an article the batt is mfg by an Obama Green Energy company. wrong - its made in Japan by the third largest battery maker in the world !!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1359041520999</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:32:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359041667576-46</Id><Topic><Title>Lithium battery fire burned down building 06</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1359012858752</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 02:34:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing a;so has a problem that the flying public is beginning to not trust this aircraft.</Msg><Username>oldbuck56</Username><Timestamp>1359041667576</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:34:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359041714332-47</Id><Topic><Title>She Said What?</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1359040512289</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:15:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When you vote in liberalism, Progressivism, you vote in corruption period.

Each trust can then set up as many corporations and other trusts as you want. those corporations can buy as much of your property other assets as it wants.

Majorities from 88 to 65 percent favored background checks at gun shows and on ammunition purchases, creating a federal database to track gun sales and banning high-capacity magazines. That included, in each case, majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents alike. In this poll, asking about "Barack Obama's proposals for stricter gun control," partisan allegiances kick in. The president's proposals are seen favorably by 76 percent of Democrats but unfavorably by 72 percent of Republicans; most on each side feel strongly about their respective positions. Independents split 51-44 percent, favorable-unfavorable. What remains to be seen is whether the president can overcome those partisan predispositions in his efforts to encourage Congress to pass the legislation he seeks. Among other groups, Obama's proposals are viewed positively by 56 percent of women vs. 49 percent of men; 58 percent of seniors vs. 47 percent of young adults; 66 percent in the Northeast vs. 50 percent in the rest of the country; 72 percent of nonwhites vs. 43 percent of whites; and 73 percent of liberals vs. 36 percent of conservatives.</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359051554898</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 13:19:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359051960983-82</Id><Topic><Title>Most Americans See Obama's Gun Control Plan Favorably</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359051554898</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 13:19:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most Americans can favor what he put out, but view him as a fascist wanting to take away personal freedoms, and violate the constitution.

Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Transportation Department inspector general who remains outspoken on aviation safety as a lawyer in private practice, agreed with Goglia. "It does not sound like a quick resolution is in store for Boeing," the former watchdog said. "Boeing was very, very lucky there was no catastrophic event," said Schiavo. "But, the luckiest of all is Airbus ... now they can make the fixes [to the A350 XWB] without the public relations hit Boeing has taken." Boeing said Friday it will not deliver any Dreamliners to its customers as it works with the FAA over the battery concerns. "We need to get the bottom of this," said Goglia. "We need to get comfortable with flying these airplanes again."

Jefferies analyst Howard A. Rubel estimated that re-working the jet to fix electrical problems could cost anywhere from $250 million to $625 million. Fitch Ratings, said the grounding will hurt Boeing’s profits and cash flow. “Barclays analyst Carter Copeland predicted he grounding will have impact on Boeing’s finances or production. Boeing will have to pay airlines cash because of the problems, it may also have to offer services to mollify airlines, such as discounted or free pilot training or discounted spare parts, said Carter Leake, an analyst at BB&amp;T who downgraded Boeing quickly after the plane began having trouble. Those services are worth something to the airline but don’t show up as a cash expense for Boeing, so Boeing will try to use this tactic to hide the true expense to Boeing shareholders. The latest problems come just as Boeing is in contract talks with its unionized engineers.. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace indicated it would reject Boeing’s offer because the union believes it would put retirement benefits at risk. “Boeing’s actions reiterate the company’s growing disrespect for the engineers and technical workers who are essential to working issues and restoring confidence in the 787,” the union said. Because the 787 problems have arisen this late in the process, they could lead authorities to conclude that even tougher testing is needed. “If the authorities get more stringent and take more time to certify planes, this will affect Boeing bottom line,” said Sandy Morris, an aerospace analyst with Jefferies in London.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359054570106</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 14:09:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359054859179-94</Id><Topic><Title>Dreamliner jets will not fly again -U.S. Transportation Secretary</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358540329808</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 15:18:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>now these federal regulators are getting testy because they were so wrong about approving the 787 to fly in the beginning and now need to protect their own credibility for making those ok to fly the 787 in the first place .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359054859179</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 14:14:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359054965907-95</Id><Topic><Title>Mass shooters are white men !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358967891985</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:04:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rock, I think that we might agree that there are a lot of fundamental behavioral and attitude issues that play into this as well as many other problems in our society. Since we have decided to not punish folks for their bad behavior, from the early age in that both the school and parents are not allowed to "paddle" errant children to the adult murderer not being executed - or lack of "proof" that it does not deter other murders. I, of course, relish the discussion on capital punishment for murder and deterrence because it certainly does deter one from doing it again. Our society appears to be disintegrating. Now Spartacus is an ardent defender of the 2nd Amendment and so am I to a great extent, but every "right" carries with it a responsibility to oneself, to others, and to God to be worthy of that freedom. I include God because He declares that He establishes the institution of government for "our good". This is what it says in Romans 13:4: "For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer." That being said, the form of government that we have is wholly dependent upon our exercising responsibility to behave. The Israelites provided a perfect example of what I am saying. For about 500 years they had kings - at their request. God had preferred a "theocracy" (like Moses and Joshua, being ruled by a religious leader). God allowed it, but the various kings often did great evil and the people lost control of their own behavior and became too evil in the sight of God. Finally, God had them taken captive to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar, allowing most of them to be wiped out, and that was the end of being under a kingdom of their own, under the governance of their choosing. They failed in personal responsibility. And therefore God took away from them their freedom. They were under the domination thereafter by the Babylonians, the Persians, and then the Romans. We must look at this as a lesson and warning to ourselves. That we have a Bill of Rights and a constitutional form of government is completely dependent upon how we behave.

Murder is immoral because it violates private property. Rape and theft are also immoral -- they also violate private property. Here's an important question: Would rape become morally acceptable if Congress passed a law legalizing it? You say: "What's wrong with you, Williams? Rape is immoral plain and simple, no matter what Congress says or does!" If you take that position, isn't it just as immoral when Congress legalizes the taking of one person's earnings to give to another? Surely if a private person took money from one person and gave it to another, we'd deem it theft and, as such, immoral. Does the same act become moral when Congress takes people's money to give to farmers, airline companies or an impoverished family? No, it's still theft, but with an important difference: It's legal, and participants aren't jailed." -- Walter Williams Here's more...... "Now, legal plunder can be committed in an infinite number of ways. Thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it: tariffs, protection, benefits, subsidies, encouragements, progressive taxation, public schools, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed profits, minimum wages, a right to relief, a right to the tools of labor, free credit, and so on, and so on. All these plans as a whole—with their common aim of legal plunder—constitute socialism. But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime."

NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman said the grounding of the 787 fleet as an unprecedented event. “This is a very serious air safety concern.” The bottom line the NSTB has no idea what is wrong, that means a potential system wide problem very long grounding and a very costly fix to the shareholders of Boeing. Despite the Boeing Management enablers opinion, a grounding is not a normal occurrence, living in denial about Boeing Management can get you zero stock price gain in a year while the Dow is up 8.85%. Sunday's NTSB announcement "doesn't bode as well for a quick fix as Boeing would have liked," said John Goglia, a former member of the safety board, which investigates aviation and other transportation accidents. Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Transportation Department inspector general who remains outspoken on aviation safety as a lawyer in private practice, agreed with Goglia. "It does not sound like a quick resolution is in store for Boeing," the former watchdog said. "Boeing was very, very lucky there was no catastrophic event," said Schiavo. "But, the luckiest of all is Airbus ... now they can make the fixes [to the A350 XWB] without the public relations hit Boeing has taken." Boeing said Friday it will not deliver any Dreamliners to its customers as it works with the FAA over the battery concerns. "We need to get the bottom of this," said Goglia. "We need to get comfortable with flying these airplanes again." The stockholders with Boeing are not very lucky, the Boeing stock has been a dog for one year down .36% while the Dow Jones average is up 8.85%.

In both the All Nippon Airways flight that was forced to make an emergency landing in western Japan, and the Japan Airlines flight that was grounded before taking off at Boston’s Logan Airport, the overheated batteries hadn’t become overcharged, regulators explained. Japan’s Transport Safety Board Chairman, Norihiro Goto, noted the main battery on board the 787 had never exceeded its maximum voltage of 32 volts, Canada’s CBC News reported. The aircraft’s data recorded showed that the battery’s highest voltage had been 31 volts, adding that the lithium-ion battery then suffered a “sudden, unexplained drop” in voltage.</Msg><Username>wallstsharks</Username><Timestamp>1359059346417</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:29:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359059487055-128</Id><Topic><Title>End the War in Afghanistan !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359047341064</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 12:09:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>something about a road less traveled... and few take it</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359059487055</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:31:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359059860265-129</Id><Title>GOP Philosophy !</Title><Msg>' lets keep doing this same thing, over and over again, and eventually we'll have different results '</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359059860265</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:37:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359059882609-130</Id><Topic><Title>End the War in Afghanistan !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359047341064</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 12:09:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed..Obama is on the road less traveled.

(False) Experts told us Washington called for a trained militia to defend the new nation, not a citizens’ stand against their own government. "Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield." (False) Nope — try hunting and self-defense. The military did not embrace the weapons until decades after they were developed. Even today, gunmakers design some semi-automatic weapons specifically for consumers. Since 1968, "more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history." (True) We tallied about 1.4 million firearm deaths compared with 1.2 million in war. The number of gunfire deaths includes suicides. Gun (and hammer) violence In 2011, more people were murdered with knives, "hands or feet" or "clubs and hammers" than with any type of rifle. (True) FBI data backs this claim — though limiting it to "rifles" ignores a significant number of deaths from handguns. "Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns." (Mostly True) This stat is close, but the numbers have been declining. The average for 2010, the most recent year for which complete figures are available, was 30. Meanwhile, the latest rolling five-year average was 33. In 2010, 2,694 young people were killed by gunfire. 1,773 were victims of homicide; 67 were elementary school-age children. (Mostly True) It’s important to note that the number of children and youths killed by guns includes suicides and accidents. U.S. vs. The World "Last year, handguns killed 48 people in Japan, 8 in Great Britain, 34 in Switzerland, 52 in Canada, 58 in Israel, 21 in Sweden, 42 in West Germany and 10,728 in the United States." (Half True) The numbers are wildly out of date. They also omit important context, such as population size. But the odds of being murdered by a gun in the United States is far in excess of the risk in the listed countries. "Switzerland (where the government) issues every household a gun . . . has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world!!!" (Pants on Fire) A Swiss researcher told us claims like this are "absurd." The lowest gun-related crime rate? Not for homicide. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a gun being involved in a robbery or an assault in Switzerland is lower in several other countries. In short, this claim appears to be completely fabricated.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359065716523</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 17:15:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359065759178-159</Id><Topic><Title>Whistleblower and we go up.

The policy was implemented Monday and just five days later, the show has been cancelled after being scheduled to take place February 2-10 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. "Our original decision not to include certain products in the Eastern Sports and Outdoor Show this year was made in order to preserve the event's historical focus on the hunting and fishing traditions enjoyed by American families," said Chet Burchett, Reed Exhibitions President for the Americas. "In the current climate, we felt that the presence of MSRs [modern sporting rifles] would distract from the theme of hunting and fishing, disrupting the broader experience of our guests. This was intended simply as a product decision, of the type event organizers need to make every day. It has become very clear to us after speaking with our customers that the event could not be held because the atmosphere of this year's show would not be conducive to an event that is designed to provide family enjoyment. It is unfortunate that in the current emotionally charged atmosphere this celebratory event has become overshadowed by a decision that directly affected a small percentage of more than 1,000 exhibits showcasing products and services for those interested in hunting and fishing. ESS has long been proud to participate in the preservation and promotion of hunting and fishing traditions, and we hope that as the national debate clarifies, we will have an opportunity to consider rescheduling the event when the time is right to focus on the themes it celebrates." Although Reed's statement attempts to pin the show cancellation on disgruntled exhibitors and an "emotionally charged atmosphere," the company sealed it's own fate by caving to anti-gun political pressure. The "modern sporting rifles" policy prompted a boycott of the show by companies, celebrities, conservation groups, outdoor media and outfitters including Cabela's, Rough Country Outfitters, Ruger Firearms, Rough Country Outfitters, Ruger Firearms, International Bowhunting Organization, IScope, J &amp; M Traditions, Katahdin’s Shadow Outfitters, Keystone Country Store, Major League Bowhunter, Masterpiece Outdoors, Inc. and hundreds more. The policy was implemented after thousands of people and businesses registered and paid admission fees for the show. "This is a major major thing, this is the largest show anywhere in the region, in the country and it's fallen apart because of this," Tony Ruggeri, owner of the hunting consulting company Trophyseekers Worldwide tells Townhall. "I paid $3000 for a double booth. I won't be going, I'll be eating that. I'm not supporting any company that does not support the Second Amendment completely." Ruggeri wrote an email to Reed Exhibitions' Group Sales Director Steve LaRoche earlier this week explaining his decision to pull out of the show.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1359066694953</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 17:31:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359066878644-167</Id><Topic><Title>The TRUTH about Boeing Company (COULD BE A SCAM!)</Title><Username>ashley.haggerty</Username><Timestamp>1359055491457</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 14:24:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow! surprisingly good one, thanks</Msg><Username>johnbussell595</Username><Timestamp>1359066878644</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 17:34:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359067023075-168</Id><Title>The Gun Proposal would Ban the Sale, Transfer, Manufacturing or Importation</Title><Msg>.... of more than 150 specific firearms, including PISTOLS that can be used with a detachable or fixed ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds It EXCLUDES assault weapons lawfully owned before the law's enactment.

When they assemble parts in betwen even if properly sealed at the factory down the road when the airplane is flying parts can make microscopic moves between each other and then the seal between parts is corrupted, not visible to naked eye. The bad events I am talking about are occuring on ground not in flight. Just suppose the airplane arrives at 10 pm and the next flight is perhaps at 6 am the next day, but upon arrival there was heavy rain pouring on the aircraft on the tarmac, then after couple hours the rain stops and then we have clear sky with freezing temperatures, now the water that has penetrated not in parts but between parts will freeze and the ice will start to expand and nothing can stop that ice from expanding, nothing. With this process a dammage is done to the plane with composite materials and at the next flight it will only agravate the problem with vibrations. For an aluminum airplane this kind of event is a non event, no problem at all. I hope you can understand now one of the problems composite airplanes have. Boeing is aware of what I am telling you here and I know for a fact that this kind of scenario is scaring them a lot. At boeing they don't like to talk about this because they know that its reality and they don't have an answer for that kind of problem, they just pray for things to be ockay, but in aviation its not good enough. Strong lightning is another problem not 100% clarified.</Msg><Username>copyright_member</Username><Timestamp>1359069871648</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 18:24:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359070085486-185</Id><Topic><Title>End the War in Afghanistan !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359047341064</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 12:09:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The war IS (just about) over.

The information was complied by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which estimates that there have been approximately 399 to 500 strikes to-date. The research group has found that around three thousand individuals have been killed by these drones, many of them innocent civilians. In Pakistan alone, 891 civilians have been killed by U.S. drones since 2004. Western media, killed a further nine people. Two of those killed were children, according to witnesses. The CIA and Obama administration officials have declined to comment on the strikes. Yemeni Human Rights Minister Hooria Mashhour this week lambasted the strategy, criticized the lack of concern over civilian deaths, and said all Yemeni citizens deserve the right to a fair trial, rather than blanket assassination. Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, however, praised the operations when he visited Washington in September. “They pinpoint the target and have zero margin of error, if you know what target you’re aiming at,” Hadi said at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

Jan 172013 . “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” It’s extremely doubtful that millions of idiot Americans have any idea what the above quotation means, or even where it comes from. If this by chance describes you (my readers are smarter than this), I’ll give you a hint: It’s in the founding documents of this country. The big “C” in other words. You know, what created this modern nation after we stole it from the Indians. The U.S. Constitution. It’s short, sweet, and easily understood. Yet it is one of the most contested statements in the Constitution. It need not be. Any idiot should be able to understand it. It doesn’t say anything about hunting. Or target practicing. Or the Army. Or Internet sales. It doesn’t give the government, or liberals, or the media, or any idiotic do-gooder the right to restrict Arms (firearms), in any manner. That is what “shall not be infringed” means. Arms is even capitalized so we won’t misunderstand. It is the right of the people to keep Arms. Bear Arms. This right shall not be infringed. That means regulated, restricted, permitted, taxed, taken, or removed. All existing gun laws (all of them) are Constitutionally illegal. More gun laws are Constitutionally illegal. Why is this so damned important? Do we REALLY want to have Americans armed to the teeth with no restrictions? Yeah, we really do. There are just too many examples throughout history where a disarmed population was treated to things like genocide, tyranny, and torture once they were disarmed. And since the U.S. Government has now authorized genocide, tyranny, and torture of any civilian, including Americans, anywhere in the world, what exactly do you think is going to happen if we relinquish our firearms? Or are you so stupid to believe that “It can’t happen here”? Good God man, it already IS happening here! America is conducting push-button genocide against whoever the hell it wants. “Oh, but they’re a different people” (religion, race, skin color, they wipe with the left instead of the right), yada, yada, yada. They’re terrorists! Say’s who? Your government? Those lying sacks of #$%$ stuffed into a business suit? Those defense industries who are raking in billions upon billions of your dollars, enjoying each bomb drop? The same idiots that lied about 9/11, Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, and “yellow cake”? Wake the #$%$ up. America is on a fast-track to self-destruction. Let me get SPECIFIC. We are facing WAR on American SOIL. War against the American PEOPLE. Bombs and rockets and tanks and American blood in American streets. Get it? Every single one of you that intends to disarm Americans is COMPLICIT in this agenda. You are NOT making “America Safer”. This is a bald-faced LIE. How can I, or you, or anyone be “safer” when I have no means to defend myself against anyone? That is a factual impossibility. If you are concerned about criminals engaging in criminal acts, fine. Do something about it. But do NOT make me RESPONSIBLE for their actions by taking away my rights. I am not and never will be responsible for what they do. Criminals do not even CARE what laws are. Laws do not stop crime. There is ample proof of this fact. There are over a million laws on the books now. Crime has not decreased at all. The problem with crime and criminal activity is not a problem “in law” or will it be fixed “in law”. More laws will deter nothing. The gun-control agenda intends to make millions of Americans into criminals and then strip them of their rights and freedom. This agenda is stupid beyond belief, but par for the course in this country. We do a lot of very stupid things. I shouldn’t have to say it, but I do. Millions of Americans are brain-dead. Mindless, non-thinking zombies that obtain their opinions, beliefs, and attitudes from the idiot box and are utterly incapable of thinking for themselves. I do not care one bit if this statement makes me unpopular. This blog has never been about popularity, it’s always been about speaking the truth. If you mindless #$%$ continue to push this gun-control agenda, you are going to seriously #$%$ regret it, because your country and your children are going to fall to despotism. We are very close to full-blown dictatorship now. George Bush the Idiot laid down the foundation. Barak Obama is a thousand times smarter than that smirking monkey. He knows EXACTLY what he is trying to do. We cannot let this happen under ANY circumstances. Obama has issued illegal executive orders, which is what DICTATORS do. Get that FACT through your thick head. This is supposedly a country of LAWS and LEGISLATION, where Congressional DEBATE and REASON are undertaken before passing any new law. An executive order is not law. It is FIAT. Dictators rule by fiat. Republics do not. If the American people are disarmed by some magical means, then there is nothing whatsoever to stop anything else. This isn’t fear-mongering, which I absolutely hate. It is the simple fact that the people, having no other recourse at the soap box or ballot box, are only left with the cartridge box to preserve, protect, and restore their stolen rights and freedoms. To reiterate: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” It is the people that make up the free State. It is our right, the people, to keep and bear Arms, and this shall not be infringed. Like it or lump it, the fact remains that it doesn’t matter what you “think” or what your “opinion” is or whatever torturous interpretations you attempt to apply, our right as the people to bear Arms is forever ours. Unless you abolish this government and write a new Constitution, then you are stuck with the fact that we have this annoying Amendment that makes it very clear: we’re not going to be disarmed. Take our Arms away and you will face war. The government has already laid the foundation, passing into law and by executive order to abolish ALL your freedoms and liberties. This is NO ACCIDENT and was completely unnecessary if we truly were a free State. But we are not, and have not been a free State or a free People for a very long time. The ONLY way you are going to have Peace, Safety and Security is to RESPECT the rights of the PEOPLE, which includes the right to bear Arms. Leave us alone. We are not the problem and never have been. It is not the armed People that threaten the security of our society, it is a dictatorial government that threatens OUR society and the criminal elements within it. The armed People of our society enhance our security. A disarmed People increase our instability. History is replete with countless examples – including acts that have occurred within our own history. Not only are you then victimized by criminals, you are victimized by governments. This is exactly what we did to the Native Americans when we stole their land. We disarmed them all. Throughout the world, this has been the path followed in case after case. Do not try to disarm us. Do not take this path of despotism. Do not stupidly assume that your benevolent government intends you no harm. If that were true, NONE of these executive orders, acts, laws, or decrees would have ever been issued. They are using the path of incrementalism to browbeat brain-dead Americans into acceptance. Little by little they intend to keep pushing their Agenda. Wake the #$%$ up before it is too late. If you do not, you will see slaughter in the streets of America. In your neighborhoods. In your cities. And in your homes as tyranny advances and attacks Americans. This is a HISTORICAL FACT. It can happen here. Firearms in the hands of Americans prevent this and provide security to ALL the people. If you do not want a firearm in your home, fine. It is your right to be a victim. This however, does not give you the right to choose for me to be a victim. You do not have that right and never, ever will. The government does not have that right. Nobody does. My rights to self-defense will forever remain mine. They supersede any document. They are inalienable rights inherited by ALL people, worldwide. Countries which have stripped the people of these rights are wrong. No government and no legislature has the right to dictate to you how you can or cannot defend yourself. If they had such a right, then they have the right to dictate who lives and who dies. Does any thinking person believe that anyone in the world has such a right? If such a right existed, then they would also have to assume the responsibility to take care of me. To defend me at all times. But do they do that? The Supreme Court has ruled no less then eight times that the police have no obligation to protect you. Then who does? Who has the obligation and the right to protect me? I alone have that right and obligation. Therefore, if I lose that right, if I am somehow stripped of that right by fiat or law, then what does this really mean? It means that my right to exist, my right to live, my right to experience life itself, is gone. I would have no right to live at all. I would live only at the chance of not being victimized. There are hundreds of millions of people who did not get that chance, having been disarmed. I categorically refuse to join them under any circumstances. I have an obligation to my family to protect them. I alone am the only person who can do that. No other carries this responsibility and obligation. I often write about responsibility. Accountability. Let me make further mention of obligation. We have an obligation to humanity itself to not submit to disarmament. How is that? Because Americans, as #$%$ up as we are, still represent something absent in the rest of the world. That absence is personal liberty. If we somehow lose this (and we are very, very close) then this would extinguish the opportunity for personal liberty elsewhere. Americans represent something not found anywhere else. Our ideology. We believe we are “free”. We believe we have the right to say whatever we want. We believe we have the right to do whatever we want as long as it does not harm anyone else. This is unique in the world, once very briefly embodied by the U.S. government and enumerated in our Constitution. Clearly, we have lost many of those rights, but not our belief in them. This is what makes us unique. Kill that belief and you have killed the hope of humanity the world over. We are far from perfect. But we do have something that has been almost extinguished elsewhere. We are the last country to still embrace the rights of the people ABOVE their government. We yet still believe in the rights of the individual above all others. If we lose that, if we submit to tyranny, dictatorship, fiat or decree, if we tire and abandon our principles, if we relinquish this belief to media lies and distortions, liberal stupidity and government deception, we will have killed the hope of the individual the world over. I will die before I let that happen. I am not the pawn of government or the media. I am not their slave, their cog, their economic unit. I am not at all willing to submit to their tyranny in any way, shape or form. My liberty and my freedom is not subject to debate, decree or discussion. I am an American, but I am much, much more than that. I am a free man in my heart, a citizen of the world, a human being who has rights and responsibilities and obligations to life itself. I will not let you take this away from me under any circumstances. You do not have the right, and never, ever will.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359082108324</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 21:48:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359082284977-204</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary faces down the angry men</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1359077142354</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 20:25:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"But I can say with certainty: Clinton has a far better chance of becoming president than Rand Paul ever will, no matter what happens on Benghazi."

In case you’ve haven't heard, Boeing 787 Dreamliner passenger jets were grounded in the US by the FAA Wednesday, and now they are grounded globally over some battery problems linked to a fire in Boston and resulting in an emergency landing in Japan. The batteries in question were lithium-ion (Li-Ion) – and it appears as though the company that supplied the battery used a LiCoO2 cathode (this according to an article in MIT Technology Review). Now, stay with me here . . . Li-Ion batteries can be made from different cathode materials. LiCoO2 is used more than others because it can store a lot of energy. But, there are safety concerns with LiCoO2; it’s relatively unstable and overcharging could result in a fire. You might have heard about laptop batteries catching fire in the past. Is this what happened on the 787s? We don’t know yet. You wouldn’t think so because LiCoO2 has been used for a long time and, usually, there are some safety devices built-in to prevent overcharging. Still, there are alternatives to LiCoO2. One is LiMn2O4; it is safer and less expensive. But, it isn’t widely used because it tends to quickly lose energy after repeated charges and discharges, especially when it’s in hotter environments. Our nanoparticle coatings are aimed at solving this issue and allowing the use of LiMn2O4 instead of the less safe, and more expensive, LiCoO2. This is important stuff – the National Science Foundation (NSF) has given us two grants to develop this technology, and we’ve had multiple meetings with battery manufacturers about it. There’s a ton of interest in the industry regarding our solution. The success we’ve had with these nanoparticle coatings, and the fact that they could open the door to the widespread use of safer, less expensive Li-Ion battery materials, may be a game-changer in this area.
