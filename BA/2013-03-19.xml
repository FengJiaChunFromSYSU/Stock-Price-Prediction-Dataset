That’s because most of the people who will die will be societal leaches who’s very survival has become dependent on government theft. If you believe evolution is how we became so much more advanced than the rest of the animal kingdom then you will appreciate how beneficial this will be to mankind. The gene pool will be vastly improved, survival will once again depend personal responsibility and those in need will be helped by voluntary kindness and the charity of others rather than government theft. People needing this help will be forced to be responsible or lose it because it will not be a “right.” People who provide the help will be the ones who decide if they are being responsible not some government bureaucrat.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1363699221217</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 09:20:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363699649832-26</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and Democrat's Spending will Literally Kill Millions but That will be Good</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1363699221217</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 09:20:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Typical Nazzie fascisct view of evolution- Hitler reiterated the same feelings many times when the war was lost and he knew he was doomed</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1363699649832</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 09:27:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363699861690-27</Id><Topic><Title>I've told you for YEARS the Bankers are the New World Order</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363644007005</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 18:00:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>typical response of desperately poor illegal alien from the far north</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1363699861690</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 09:31:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363699961093-28</Id><Title>Boeing to warn for 1st Quarter</Title><Msg>Has anyone heard the rumor that BA will reduce guidance next week before the quarter-end for estimated losses and charges being incurred by 787-related issues?</Msg><Username>bankrdude10</Username><Timestamp>1363699961093</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 09:32:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363700059893-29</Id><Title>It’s not a ‘haircut’ – it’s THEFT when governments loot your private bank accounts</Title><Msg>Mike Adams Natural News March 19, 2013 This use of the term “haircut” to describe government theft of private banking accounts has got to stop. It’s not a haircut, it’s outright thievery. When a person breaks into your home with a gun and steals your jewelry or cash, do we call that a “haircut?” Of course not. It’s a criminal act, not a trip to the salon. I’m referring to the government bank raids in Cyprus, of course, where up to 10% of private accounts are simply being stolen by the government. It’s being called the great EU bank robbery, and there is a lot of speculation that this may set off bank runs across European nations. But the media calls it nothing more than a “haircut.” Why is everybody using the term “haircut” to describe this outright theft? The reason, of course, is because the term “haircut” is a mind game. Its purpose is to make it sound like it’s not outright theft. By calling it a “haircut,” it seems more polite, almost as if the government there is doing everybody a favor. But I’m pretty sure if you or I walked into a bank with an AK-47 and demanded everybody’s money, the evening news wouldn’t call it a “haircut.” They would call it “armed robbery,” as they should. Robbery is not a haircut. It’s theft, and when a government blatantly steals money right out of the checking or savings accounts of millions of people, that’s a criminal act. Sure, they can slap nice-sounding labels on it such as “haircut” or even a “tax,” but it’s still essentially the same thing as being mugged at gunpoint on the street. Consider this: If the government went door to door, confiscating everybody’s cash, gold and jewelry, would the media also call that a “haircut?” Notice who never takes a haircut? The globalist banks There’s so much hair cutting going on these days that it almost feels like we’re trapped in a demonic salon.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363700059893</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 09:34:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363700247804-30</Id><Topic><Title>I've told you for YEARS the Bankers are the New World Order</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363644007005</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 18:00:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The New World Order Bankers say you owe them over 400 trillion in Derivitives debt (that they themselves created)...they are too big to Fail...they wont pay it...they will ultimatly take it out of your bank account.

Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime. " But I also like the way Walter Williams explained it: "Once one accepts the principle of self-ownership, what's moral and immoral becomes self-evident. Murder is immoral because it violates private property. Rape and theft are also immoral -- they also violate private property. Here's an important question: Would rape become morally acceptable if Congress passed a law legalizing it? You say: "What's wrong with you, Williams? Rape is immoral plain and simple, no matter what Congress says or does!" If you take that position, isn't it just as immoral when Congress legalizes the taking of one person's earnings to give to another? Surely if a private person took money from one person and gave it to another, we'd deem it theft and, as such, immoral. Does the same act become moral when Congress takes people's money to give to farmers, airline companies or an impoverished family? No, it's still theft, but with an important difference: It's legal, and participants aren't jailed." -- Walter Williams</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1363703304696</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 10:28:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363703775718-44</Id><Topic><Title>BA rumored to be bought out!</Title><Username>smith.frank7</Username><Timestamp>1363260989034</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 07:36:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow, great news!</Msg><Username>macwalker55</Username><Timestamp>1363703775718</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 10:36:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363704378585-45</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and Democrat's Spending will Literally Kill Millions but That will be Good</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1363699221217</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 09:20:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Hitler was a socialist and a racist fascist" Nice try idiot, calling someone a "socialist" and a "fascist" is like saying they are a fat, skinny person.

Obama the Socialist Fascist Communist by Scott Lazarowitz A recent poll showed that 55% of Americans believe that Barack Obama is a "socialist," and many Americans believe that the nation is on the "road to socialism." The road to socialism? Where have these people been for the last 75 years? America has been a socialist – as well as fascist – nation for many decades, especially since FDR’s New Deal. Socialism primarily is public ownership of wealth, property and the means of production. So, of course Obama is a socialist. He has expressed that. For some reason, many people mistakenly believe that Social Security, an important outcome of the New Deal, is a program in which some of Americans’ earnings are taken and put into some kind of "savings account," to be available to them when they retire. In actuality, Social Security is a real-time redistribution of wealth scheme administered by the State, in which income is taken from producers and redistributed to non-producers, mainly retired persons and the elderly. LBJ’s Medicare program is an extension of this. Further examples to show that Obama is a socialist include his vote as a U.S. Senator in favor of the Wall Street Bailout, often mistakenly seen as an example of "capitalism," but which was actually an example of socialism: redistribution of wealth from the middle-class workers and producers to the already rich Wall Street bankers and financial executives. Obama also clearly supports the ongoing military socialism through the wars he has been continuing and strengthening abroad: redistribution of wealth from American workers and producers to defense contractors, consultants and lobbyists, oil executives and Wall Street bankers, which really has been a main objective for American wars throughout the last century. As the late USMC Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler would say, "War is a Racket." And as the late economist Murray Rothbard put it, regarding World War I: Woodrow Wilson's decision to enter the war may have been the single most fateful action of the 20th century, causing untold and unending misery and destruction. But Morgan profits were expanded and assured. Things have not changed in 100 years. Obama’s stated intention has been for redistribution of wealth as a means to help the poor, the underprivileged and so on. But his unstated intention is the same as all politicians of his ilk: to reach into as much private wealth as possible as a means towards expanding State power and control. Many people also mistakenly believe that Obama’s medical takeover is "socialized medicine," but we already have socialized medicine in Medicare as mentioned, and other similar programs. ObamaCare is actually a fascist program. Fascism is another major aspect of FDR’s New Deal, which gave us an untold number of regulations, mandates and enmeshments between business and government. Fascism primarily is State control over privately owned property, wealth and industry. All government mandates and regulation of private economies are examples of fascism. ObamaCare consists of one mandate and regulation after another of private doctor-patient relationships, patient/doctor-insurance company relationships, and a laundry list of medical related industries. In addition to ObamaCare fascism and Obama’s strengthening of his own executive dictatorial powers as president, some other examples of Obama’s fascism include his new financial regulations, and the environmental regulations that he used as a means of interfering with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s duty to protect the people of Louisiana from the oil spill that threatens their livelihoods. While allowing doctors’ practices, HMOs, and insurance companies to continue to be privately owned, the federal government will nevertheless dictate to them how their contracts and associations will be run. However, given a variety of factors, this dictatorial control over the medical industry will most likely lead these still privately owned interests into bankruptcy, much like what the federal government has done to the financial and mortgage lending industries, and the federal government will most probably take upon ownership, as well as control, of much of these industries. That is where Obama’s communism comes in. The "road to socialism"? No, already there. Fascism? Already there. But are we on the road to communism? You betchya! Communism is, by and large, complete State ownership and control of all industry, wealth and property, and the means of production. So far, we have seen this from Obama in his leading the charge of confiscation of much of the automobile industry, as well as the federal government’s ownership of much of the mortgage and finance industries. And eventually, most likely, the entire medical industry. Whether Obama is intentionally implementing a communist America by way of long-planned "stealth," as some people have suggested he is doing, or whether he has a communist agenda by way of his long-time partnership with admitted terrorist bomber and "small-c communist" Bill Ayers, or whether Obama follows the teachings of "radical community organizer" (or "communizer") Saul Alinsky, is actually not as important as Obama’s actual actions as president. So far, we have noted that Barack Obama is: A Socialist. He supports public ownership of the means of production, redistribution of wealth from some segments of society to others. A Fascist. He supports State control over private industries and the means of production, and just about every aspect of citizens’ daily lives. A Communist. He supports State ownership as well as control of industry and the means of production. But what isn’t Obama? A Capitalist. Barack Obama is not a capitalist because he opposes voluntary exchange, private property rights, voluntary contracts, associations and markets free of State intrusions, and under the Rule of Law. The true capitalist, voluntary exchange-private property system that coexists with individual liberty is exactly what the American Founders believed in, for which they fought a Revolution to have and preserve for their posterity. This capitalist system is the only system that exists under the Rule of Law that protects all individuals in such a society from the theft and trespass of others including agents of the State. In contrast, socialism, fascism and communism all institutionalize the violation of the Rule of Law as they institutionalize the violation of all individuals’ inherent rights to life, liberty and justly acquired property. In those totalitarian systems, the individual is a sacrificial animal for the collective, and a serf for the State. Alas, America has not actually experienced true capitalism, at least not since the U.S. Constitution was written and ratified, and especially not since the presidency of hardcore banking and monetary fascist and warmonger-business protectionist Abraham Lincoln. The choice for America is whether to continue on the road to communism, or to turn back, dismantle all of it, and restore our freedom and prosperity.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1363705309325</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:01:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363705674070-51</Id><Topic><Title>BA rumored to be bought out!</Title><Username>smith.frank7</Username><Timestamp>1363260989034</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 07:36:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you're FOS, mcdonnell douglas has bolstered their bottom line since the acquisition, with the F-18, F-15, Apache, C-17...the workhorses of the armed forces you're characteristics of left coast marxists...blaming others for your own failures / angst</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363705674070</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:07:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363705861019-52</Id><Topic><Title>Suddenly, Things Are Going “Terribly Wrong” for the Big Banks</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1363634216990</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 15:16:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes--what is happening in Cyprus is excactly what will happen here.

Other EU countries were held up against Ireland and measured against Ireland. Now Ireland [as others, Greece] is being setup for asset stripping. What the IMF criminals do is to promote growth by fiscal policy and money supply; they want the country to gain wealth - the more wealth, the more they make when the strip it. When they consider the time right, they change policy, call in loans and impose IMF conditions upon the governments; forcing the governments into the IMF policies of austerity, privatisation and deregulation. Sound familiar - it should do as it is happening all around the globe - even here in New Zealand! This economic terrorism, forces the people to riot; the rioting brings down the government and the IMF move to instigate their own controlled government [puppet government]. This puppet government, in order to dig itself and country out of the financial hole it finds itself in, sells off the nation's jewels. Nationally own assets, power generation etc [all paid for by taxpayers and owned by the people] are all sold by privatisation to "overseas" buyers". Industry is stripped, sold off and moved either off shore or closed down to prevent opposition to IMF controlled business. What they have done by sleight of hand is obtain all real assets for worthless monopoly money that they printed and forwarded as "Loans". How they do it is no real secret [how people keep falling for it is a mystery though] so I'll take the liberty here to simplify the process by outlining it.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1363707279740</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:34:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363707300164-58</Id><Topic><Title>Suddenly, Things Are Going “Terribly Wrong” for the Big Banks</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1363634216990</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 15:16:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the russian mob has a lot of their money/TAKE deposited in cyprus, i expect their useful idiot lib elites will re-think taking from their masters, or fear for their lives tune in wmal in DC, they're talking about it right now</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363707300164</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:35:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363707306132-59</Id><Topic><Title>How the World Bank, IMF Asset strip a Nation</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1363707279740</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:34:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A credit rating company [an IMF patsy] goes to a country and says "we're going to do a credit rating of your country". The country says great, we'll get a new rating. Later the credit rating company goes back to the country and says, "well, you've got good stable government, you've got democracy [that's important because without it they can't work their scheme], you are paying off debt, the country has good infrastructure and workforce and your GDP is growing. All things considered, we like what we see and award you AAA+ rating." Fantastic says the government - happy that their governance has been "rewarded". Then along comes the IMF/World Bank - "We see you have a very good credit rating - look, we can forward you 5 billion dollars at 3% PA on the strength of this credit rating - just think what you can do with that? - Build more infrastructure, maybe a new power station, water treatment plant etc - it will help you get re-elected.". The government quickly takes up this fantastic offer and sees the chance of re-election that much easier. But, reality sets in, the government finds that people actually have short memories and their expenditure is forgotten coming up to election year. No problem - the IMF/World Bank are there to help prop up their model economy - the one touted as an example for other to follow.

"That (Lion Air contract) was already in the numbers, we've been working on this for over six months," John Leahy said, referring to the order for 234 medium-haul jets worth $24 billion at list prices. "We're still targeting 700 to 750 (orders) so we should be there by the end of the year, and by Le Bourget (air show) a little of a half of that," he added. The Lion Air order follows a deal with Turkish Airlines for 82 planes last week and a contract to supply Germany's Lufthansa with 100 Airbus A320 and two A380 aircraft in a deal worth approximately $11.2 billion at list prices. The planemaker, which won 181 aircraft orders in the first two months of 2013, is also awaiting confirmation of a tentative $2.8 billion order for 16 A320neo revamped aircraft from Hawaiian Airways. Asked whether Airbus is going to ramp-up the production of its A320 medium-haul aircraft, Leahy said there was "no rush" to take such a decision. "A lot depends on our supply chain. Clearly the demand is there," he said.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363708143089</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:49:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363708268632-65</Id><Topic><Title>BA rumored to be bought out!</Title><Username>smith.frank7</Username><Timestamp>1363260989034</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 07:36:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>still strong report!</Msg><Username>jim_mgan</Username><Timestamp>1363708268632</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:51:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363708483382-66</Id><Title>GOP; Choking America with their Austerity Plan</Title><Msg>The repercussions of an austerity-induced double-dip recession in the U.S. could be global. “We were just beginning to feel that the Americans were pulling Europe out of austerity and now they’re going to plunge us all back in it,” says a gloomy Ann Pettifor, director of PRIME Economics and one of the few British economists to have predicted the 2008 financial crash. “The fact is that further [U.S.] contraction is going to crash the global economy.” Portes, a former chief economist at the UK government’s Cabinet Office and one of this country’s leading critics of austerity, adds: “Obviously, anything that chokes off the U.S. recovery is bad news for us Europeans –- both in the UK and in the eurozone.” It isn’t just the economic theory coming out of Capitol Hill that bewilders so many European policy-makers; it’s the politics. The sequester “confirms the view that the U.S. is incapable of dealing with [this problem], that the U.S. government is paralysed,” Portes tells The Huffington Post UK. From a European perspective, he says, the U.S. Republican Party “is no longer a responsible party of government in a basic, public finance sense, in terms of making things add up.” It is also far to the right of its European sister parties. Republicans may say they want austerity but they loathe and recoil from any and all tax rises as a means of bringing down deficits. It is a position that has raised eyebrows in conservative circles across the EU. But the most important lesson for the U.S. Republican right and its Tea Party outriders is that austerity is self-defeating – even from a deficit-hawk perspective.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1363708483382</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:54:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363708675354-67</Id><Topic><Title>787 fix, sounds like Boeing is dictating " Timely FAA approval of the fix."</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363633836490</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 15:10:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still no response from Wayne on the math facts?

The purchase contract for much of Ryanair's current Boeing fleet was agreed in the months following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when airlines struggled to place new orders, and later Ryanair regulatory filings in Dublin confirmed that it received a 53 percent discount off Boeing's list prices. In 2009, O'Leary noisily withdrew from talks to purchase more 737s and hinted that Ryanair might turn to Airbus. The CEO of the Ryanair company is probably the best person in the world at contract price discounts. So the good news for Boeing is they got the order but the price was not disclosed, so that means the CEO cut a deal that only he could do along the order of 60% discount in price. That means more give away no money for Boeing shareholders. The 737 MAX will be part ot the Ryanair orders and there is no reason to expect the MAX to be built on time and on cost given the failure of the Chicago management on everything they do Always late and over budget with way too many birthing issues due to out sourcing and lack of in hose Quality control. It may fly in the Chicago boardroom but it sure does not fly in Everett 787!.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363709992450</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 12:19:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363710094944-76</Id><Topic><Title>BA Insider Trading Reported !!!</Title><Username>doris.shealey</Username><Timestamp>1361811207875</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 11:53:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good report :)</Msg><Username>bermudez.dexter</Username><Timestamp>1363710094944</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 12:21:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363710814618-77</Id><Topic><Title>787 fix, sounds like Boeing is dictating " Timely FAA approval of the fix."</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363633836490</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 15:10:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spartacus99991, I have ron anderson on block so I cant read him, my math errors ? so your jealous of how well I do in the stock market I get that, but cnn money ytd and 3 years for boeing ba compared to eadsy is correct I did no math it is done on the cnn money computer. ron anderson is a boeing hack so he has nothing for me to read, he can only spin and you can be ignorant about that all you want it does not change the number boeing for the year to date is a loser stock and for 3 years a super loser stock in round numbers airbus is up 37 % boeing 13% for threee years Airbus stock is up 167% boeing shareholders are way behind at 17 and change percent nothing could be worse than holding your opinion on boeing and loseing 150% on your investment comparing Airbus to Boeing for three years . and yes while 176% is much better than most stocks for a buy and hold I do much better on day and swing trades , but I read a stock chart and not the Boeing hack reports you go ther boye take your math critic to the bank har har haa har haa</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363710814618</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 12:33:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363711502367-78</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus for 3 years is up 167% Boeing stock for three years up 17.59%</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363633031168</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 14:57:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>duffymagoo is that like the nearsighted man who is not aware of his surrounding then? sorry for your lack of knowledge about Gonzaga we are more informed in Spokane I guess.

You hound other posters when they ignore your factual data. Can you make $109M plus each year on a $1000 bankroll? That's what you're saying when you state you can make "at least 25 percent per week" trading stocks. You didn't say it was an average, you said "at least". Or, do you lose on some stocks each week and choose not to include those in your "at least 25 percent per week". Selective posting? And it shouldn't be about taking money off the table after a runup, because you say you trade many stocks and make "at least 25 percent per week" So, you just take that money and put it into the stock du jour and continue the upward movement with " at least 25 percent per week".

In recent years, a growing number of doctors have begun holding group appointments — seeing up to a dozen patients with similar medical concerns all at once. Advocates of the approach say such visits allow doctors to treat more patients, spend more time with them (even if not one-on-one), increase appointment availability and improve health outcomes. Some see group appointments as a way to ease looming physician shortages. According to a study published in December, meeting the country's health-care needs will require nearly 52,000 additional primary-care physicians by 2025. More than 8,000 of that total will be needed for the more than 27 million people newly insured under the Affordable Care Act. "With Obamacare, we're going to get a lot of previously uninsured people coming into the system, and the question will be 'How are we going to service these people well?' " says Edward Noffsinger, who has developed group-visit models and consults with providers on their implementation. With that approach, "doctors can be more efficient and patients can have more time with their doctors."</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1363728452134</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 17:27:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363728690459-109</Id><Title>California and Rhode Island tied for nation's highest unemployment rate...</Title><Msg>Wonder what Party their governors belong to?</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1363728690459</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 17:31:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363729248949-110</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes 500 Rich List Acquiring BA Shares!</Title><Username>james.tingle</Username><Timestamp>1362414215788</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:23:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good report, thanks!</Msg><Username>laneralph817</Username><Timestamp>1363729248949</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 17:40:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363729476626-111</Id><Topic><Title>BA rumored to be bought out!</Title><Username>smith.frank7</Username><Timestamp>1363260989034</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 07:36:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well prepared report!</Msg><Username>fclarkk4</Username><Timestamp>1363729476626</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 17:44:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363729487083-112</Id><Topic><Title>California and Rhode Island tied for nation's highest unemployment rate...</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1363728690459</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 17:31:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why not?...When corrupt liberal govts like California has continue to raise taxes, and then go deeper into debt?

You have a friend! So that is your spin and your sticking to it?. Even though you claim you can make "at least 25 percent per week" (not per day, I'm just quoting you, sorry) you would rather put that money in the bank. But you seem to be on this board bragging every week about your latest trades of stocks that are going thru the roof. Then if you took half the weeks off (but you don''t seem to) it would take you TWO years to amass $109M in profits. Why not just admit you can't make 25 percent every week. It's not a big deal to admit a little hyperbole on an anonymous message board. Nobody will think less of you. Well, maybe... P.S. Have your friend call you to read you this message if you've also put me on ignore. Soon, with all your "ignores", you'll be posting to yourself. Oh wait, I think that's already happening.

There are 2 other weapon bills in congress that are waiting to be voted on. Stop your hesitation and get busy calling and e-mailing your senators and representatives in Washington to tell them to VOTE NO on any anti gun legislation that will come before them.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1363744088052</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 21:48:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363745684157-128</Id><Topic><Title>787 fix, sounds like Boeing is dictating " Timely FAA approval of the fix."</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363633836490</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 15:10:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>alangonquin, apparently the facts are you have zero thumbs up and I stand as the winner of the bull pucklie Boeing Hack change the subject post. Once more the post is about the Boeing Company using is political power to press the FAA to cower under political pressure to make a quick and dangerous decision to allow the firestarter 787 to fly, without finiding a route cause, and a band aide fix, we will containe the next rire is suck a lame fix. it is not about the fact that Boeing shares oar only up 13 % yar to date while Airbus is up 37% or Boeing shares are only up 17% in three years while Airbus shares are up 167% in three years that post of mine is another fact and I did not make it up any more than how I trade day trades for as much as 25% the question is total cow puckie and an attempt by boeign hacks to change the subject the topic here is Boeing is attempting to bully the FAA into a quick approval without proper testing which should take many months or half a year to accomplish. Not to worry alangonquin I will add much more to proove Boeing is using its political power to endanger flying passengers instead of doing the right thing and fixing the problem. So no worries I will continue to make the money I do and you can attempt to make a excuse for it while you trade your opinion on boeing instead of using the stock charts you go boye !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363745684157</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 22:14:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363745889639-129</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus for 3 years is up 167% Boeing stock for three years up 17.59%</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363633031168</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 14:57:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow duffymagoo, you really think I did not know you were yanking my chain and I slammed you good too eh !
