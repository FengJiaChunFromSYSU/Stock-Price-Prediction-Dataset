So you implied I would sabotoge a airplane,au.kingfish, you said"Sounds to me by your way of thinking you could throw a monkey wrench sabotage a plane like a Boeing union worker did during one strike) in Boeing's business plan by not going on strike. au.kingfish that is a bold statment do you have any proof that I am going to or am thinking about sabotoge of Boeing or any other Company? If not then you are making a felony charge against me and you are also harassing me , against Yahoo user policy. Next, au.kingfish, you call my point of view a ditribe, au.kingfish, you claim your point of view is whimsical, but factually your point of view is at least Misdemeanor if not felony harassment. So au.kingfish, I am going to ask you to please, stop now, this constant harassment is against Yahoo message board standards of behavior. au.kingfish, please stop this trouble, torment, and confusing dialog by your continual persistent attacks, and harassment. You need to obey the yahoo message board standards. I have not nor ever Contemplated sabotoge of a Boeing airplane. I am not, nor have I ever engaged you in a diatribe, or the Boeing company in sabotage, nor have I been suspected or investigated or charged with sabotoge of Boeing or any other company. ua.kingfish, this is not whimsical, Rooney comment,it is harassment and false felony accusations, aukingfish , in fact you agreed with me on the union policy which is not do wildcat striking. . but you then continue to harass me, is that whimsical Andy Rooney style commtary? you said"As for the rest of your diatribe, I consider it nothing more than a refresher lecture of an undergraduate business management class but given with a heavy bias against Boeing's management by a pro-union malcontent." I am sorry if you think responding to your statment that you hoped the union workers would go on a unauthorized strike was a undergraduate college class. . BTW are you saying the Boeing Managmenthires less than the best? If so,are you aware that the union does not hire the Boeing employee's the Boeing Company has 100% control over the hiring process. You say I am pro union, I am for the smartest working people in the world, Boeing selects them and the union represents them. Boeing and the union have a contract. The workforce works to that standard. Next au.kingfish you said "From a management perspective it only makes good and sound business sense, if you have to deal with unions, to make plans to use down time during a strike in a useful manner. No sense sitting on your thumbs. I can recall my grandfather, a head millwright for a Weyerhaeuser plant, using down time during a strike to upgrade and service equipment. Of course he had to concern himself about a Molotov cocktail crashing through his window." au.kingfish, a question for you, if there was downtime in a non union plant would your grandfather not use the downtime? au.kingfish, once more you attempt to plant a story about your grandfather using down time to work on the equipment. He was not put on strike so the company could work on the equipment he was being paid as a union millwright to do his job. Once more you ignor what I said, it is unethical for the Boeing Company to refuse to negotiate in good faith so the Boeing company can force union workers to go on a strike and then allow the Boeing contractors time to catch up on out of stock airplane parts. Boeing is self insured so Boeing wants to keep the experience rating low, and the unethical way to do this is to take advantage of contract time to force a unpaid leave for the workforce while the Boeing contractors try to keep pace with the smart and best workers in theworld Boeing union represented workers, hired by the Boeing Company. au.kingfish please show me anything that indicates to you that my way of thinking equates to sabotoge of a Boeing airplane. All I said was no worker would go on a unauthorized strike and the Boeing union workers were the best in the world, how does that make you think my way of thinking is (something you just made up) would mean that I would sabotoge a Boeing airplane? I also havesaid that Boeing workers are loyal to Boeing. au.kingfish is this your whimsical Andy Rooney style? It comes out as false and felony harassment, maybe you should tone down or better yet stop you false charges against me.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1354598152259</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 00:15:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354598439219-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama plays dirty politics $240 to $200k Killing job growth Libdems make excuses for a loser</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1354594877318</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 23:21:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm tellin you, Obama wants the govt to go off the fiscal cliff.

Dear Colleagues, As we all know, these are financially challenging times. While our digital subscription plan has been successful, the advertising climate remains volatile and we don’t see this changing in the near future. Given this, I have asked Scott, Jill and Andy to identify significant cost savings - including buyouts - throughout The New York Times Media Group. While we will continue to invest where needed to ensure our role as a global leader in news and information, we must make some difficult decisions to lower our costs. Our business-side colleagues will continue their efforts to find staff reductions and other efficiencies, but it is now impossible not to look also within the ranks of our news operations. None of this is easy in these difficult times. Thank you all for your courage, your talent and your commitment to fulfilling our mission. You will be hearing more from your managers.

They have in common low amounts of debt per capita, low unemployment rates, business-friendly tax structures, and several of them are home to hydraulic fracturing and other energy booms. There’s also a high correlation between a well-run state and a high percentage of residents with high-school diplomas. And one more thing. What is it? Ah, yes, they all have Republican governors. I’m sure it’s just a coincidence. What does a governor have to do with running a state’s affairs, after all? The worst-run: California, Rhode Island, Illinois, Arizona and New Jersey, making the bottom five home to two Democratic governors, two Republicans, and one Lincoln Chafee. Let’s hear just why California is at the bottom of the heap: Debt per capita: $4,008 (18th highest) Budget deficit: 20.7% (17th largest) Unemployment: 11.7% (2nd highest) Median household income: $57,287 (10th highest) Pct. below poverty line: 16.6% (18th highest) California is 24/7 Wall St.’s “Worst Run State” for the second year in a row. Due to high levels of debt, the state’s S&amp;P credit rating is the worst of all states, while its Moody’s credit rating is the second-worst. Much of California’s fiscal woes involve the economic downturn. Home prices plunged by 33.6% between 2006 and 2011, worse than all states except for three. The state’s foreclosure rate and unemployment rate were the third- and second-highest in the country, respectively. But efforts to get finances on track are moving forward. State voters passed a ballot initiative to raise sales taxes as well as income taxes for people who make at least $250,000 a year. While median income is the 10th-highest in the country, the state also has one of the highest tax burdens on income. According to the Tax Foundation, the state also has the third-worst business tax climate in the country. Despite its sunny shores and mountain heights, glorious vineyards and gloriouser weather, Hollywood and Silicon Valley, the Golden state has become—how you say?— kind of a crapfest. Since California’s is the righteous path our liberal betters so long for us to take as a nation, let’s do check in and see how it’s working out for them. The state passed a ballot amendment hiking taxes on the rich in November. California already had the most progressive state tax system in the nation and has been deficit spending out the wazoo throughout the recession. By my Keynesian calculations, the California economy should be booming, its unemployment rate low, its deficit and debt problems solved, and all of its “investments” should be yielding great results for those in need and in public schools. California’s new “temporary” tax hike on the wealthy is expected to bring in $6 billion a year, according to the LA Times (estimates vary slightly). What is California’s debt? The task force estimated that the burden of debt totaled at least $167 billion and as much as $335 billion. Its members warned that the off-the-books debts tended to grow over time, so that even if Mr. Brown should succeed in pushing through his tax increase, gaining an additional $50 billion over the next seven years, the wall of debt would still be there, casting its shadow over the state. Yes, I should say so. California has already pledged the equivalent of the entire tax hike and more to a high-speed train boondoggle. Proponents of tax increases will brag that this hike has come close to fixing California’s annual deficit, but let’s see how much California spends on debt service alone, to get an idea of how far this $6 billion a year will go. The 2012-2013 California state budget projection: General Fund debt service expenditures will increase by a net of $24.6 million (0.46 percent), to a total of $5.4 billion, as compared to the revised current year estimate… While General Fund debt service is estimated to increase only slightly in the budget year, General Fund debt service has been a fast‐growing area of the Budget. In 2002‐03 General Fund debt service was $2.1 billion, or 2.9 percent of revenues, versus $5.4 billion, or 5.6 percent of estimated revenues, in 2012‐13. This trend is expected to continue through the end of this decade, with debt service projected to peak at $7.5 billion in 2019‐20 It should also be noted, the promise of maybe closing this year’s deficit is predicated on whether “lawmakers can resist more spending and the economy continues to improve.” I present to you, a supermajority Democratic legislature. Also, this delicious paragraph from the L.A. Times: The election wasn’t even over Tuesday when state Treasurer Bill Lockyer’s phone started ringing. Activists of all stripes had the same message for him: With voters apparently poised to approve billions of dollars in tax hikes, it was time to spend more money. “They had to be reminded the money has already been spent,” Lockyer said. As for the economy, California has the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation, well above 10 percent. Texas— bizarro California, being close in size and population and nearly opposite in political disposition— is a little over 6 percent. As Conn Carroll noted in the Washington Examiner: There are fewer private-sector jobs in the state (California) today, 11.9 million, then there were in 2000, 12.2 million. And thanks to liberal welfare requirements, a third of all the nation’s welfare recipients live in California despite the state only containing one-eighth of the national population. Contrast those numbers with Republican-controlled Texas, where private-sector jobs have grown from 7.8 million in 2000 to 9 million today. Carroll also notes California poverty is high as is that most important of liberal priorities— income inequality (higher than in Texas)—while test scores remain low: Meanwhile, California eighth-graders finished ahead of only Mississippi and District of Columbia students on reading and math test scores in 2011. Texas, on the other hand, showed test scores for eight-graders above California and often above the national average across its white, black, and Hispanic populations in mathematics, reading, and science. Maybe that’s why everyone’s leaving California, according to a Manhattan Institute study: Since 1990, domestic migration to California has flipped to a deficit. In the last two decades, the state lost nearly 3.4 million residents through migration to other states. In other words, it lost about four-fifths of what it had gained through domestic migration in the previous 30 years. Foreign immigration filled the gap only partially. Inflows from overseas peaked at 291,191 in 2002 and sank to just 164,445 in 2011. Meanwhile, net domestic out-migration has averaged 225,000 a year over the past ten years.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1354600530776</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 00:55:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354600796694-5</Id><Title>The GOP Gang of 5 are Ruining the Country</Title><Msg>We should all know who the GOP gang of 5 are.

Answer: Eight days, and that does not account for a change in behavior.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1354635629603</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:40:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354635937686-17</Id><Title>Manufacturing in this country “unexpectedly” contracted in November......</Title><Msg>....to its lowest level in more than three years.

Independents remain particularly sour on the law, the worst bits of which are slated for implementation over the next two years. In Jeffrey Anderson's write-up of CNN's poll, he explains why voters didn't unequivocally embrace Obamaism on November 6th (via Mary Katharine Ham): According to polling by CNN, registered voters oppose Obamacare by a margin of 10 points — 52 to 42 percent. Independents like Obamacare even less, opposing it by a margin of 22 points — 57 to 35 percent. Clearly, voters didn’t think they were ratifying Obamacare when they pulled the lever for Obama. I say the worst elements are slated to be implemented in 2013 and 2014 because implementation itself is proving to be a truly jaw-dropping nightmare of astonishing proportions. The Wall Street Journal noted a major component of the coming dysfunction: The current rumpus is over ObamaCare's "exchanges," the bureaucracies that will regulate the design and sale of insurance and where 30 million people (and likely far more) will sign up for subsidized coverage. States were supposed to tell the Health and Human Services Department if they were going to set up and run an exchange by October, but HHS delayed the deadline to November, and then again at the 11th hour to December. Sixteen states have already said they won't participate. Another 11 are undecided, while only 17 have committed to doing the work on their own. Six have opted for a "hybrid" federal-state model. That means HHS will probably be responsible for fallback federal exchanges in full or in part in as many as 25 or 30 states. The opposition isn't so much political as practical. Or rather, the vast logistical and technical undertaking to build an exchange helps explain why so many Governors resisted ObamaCare in the first place. States have regulated the small business and individual insurance markets for decades (some well, others less so). Now they're supposed to toss everything out for a complex Washington rewrite, which is still being rewritten.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1354638137693</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:22:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354638809516-21</Id><Topic><Title>Confirmed: Obamacare is an Unpopular, Shoddy Trainwreck</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1354638137693</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:22:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Doesn't take much of a poll to realize how braindead the bulk of liberal voters are.

Au.kingfish, are you able to explain away the continued harassment of me and the union worker, au.kingfish, you were not done with the plane felony comment,next you continued and mention your grandfather au.kingfish worked for Weyerhaeser during a strike, and au.kingfish, you stated that grandfather au.kingfish was afraid because the "union" workers were armed with" molotov coctails "and your grandfather was scared for himself and the company. So au.kingfish, I have also asked you after I did a review of that company history and searched for any indication that a union or any other group like management made use of molotive cocktails. au.kingfish, I found nothing like that. au.kingfish please note both groups were treated with respect and the only complaint or charge is yours,. au.kingfish, nothing in history substanciates your continued "union" felony reports. au.kingfish you are using your time to harass me and you are also making false felony reports against union workers and union organizations. au.kingfish, please correct me if I missed any story or charge or felony conviction of any union worker who tossed a molotov coctail at grandfather au.kingfish. or of a union attack on any Weyerhaeser building and the damages that resulted. au.kingfish, this would be easy to find in any historical account of Weyerhaeser, police reports and would have been carried by the news organizations and it would be studied in a "undergraduate college class lecture" on union-management organizations. BTW to earn a MBA at Gonzaga that was a required class. Maybe Gonzaga experts in labor relations and labor history, are wrong , but they discussed union activities in Washington State and the world and if your right, I need to know . au.kingfish, I will contact the Gonzaga University MBA department and share this story they missed. au.kingfish you have stated that my coments were like a undergraduate class, au.kingfish, please educate me here. au.kingfish, you have also stated your the best at stock market trades. au.kingfish, so please share your knoweledge about armed union workers and all your best stock picks , after all this is the Boeing financial message board. au.kingfish, if you feel the need to qualify yourself as the best at any other skill set , after you proove your report about armed union strikers at Weyerhaeser, and the specific weapon is a molotov coctail, then please, aukingfish, contine to impress me as only you seem able to do. au.kingfish, you have my attention now. I am listening for any and all of your felony comments especially. But au.kingfish, any other comment you wish to make will be considered too. au.kingfish, remember, any other reports that you have for me and the rest of the world and we will only to glad to share them. . so once more au.kingfish was this just another of your felony charge report, about unions, or more mistakes on your part, or a simple failure to type what you really meant about the unions. What you said was a union , or a union member who was related to or working for Weyerhaeser was a armed terrorist or that the union was a armed terrorist organization, they were armed , armed with molotov coctails. So au.kingfish , a false and felony charge against unions and a personal harassment attck on me it that really the fact? au.kingfisher, or is this just another false and harassing behavior on your part. What is it , I want to know. au.kingfisher please report on any Weyerhaeser building being destroyed or caught on fire by a molotov coctail , then please post it here for me and any other hard working loyal Boeing employees to read. As I stated Boeing workers are the best and smartest workers in the world they are loyal to Boeing. Boeing has 100% control over the hiring interview , the job application, the job requirements, and any pre employment and hire process.. Once the Boeing Company hires a worker, the Union is required to represent them. In fact when Boeing Company refuses to sit down and plays games instead of negotiating for the next labor agreement on time and on budget the Boeing Company contiues to fail, just like with the 787 being late by 3 years and over budget by at least 32 billion dollars. This is due to poor Boeing Company managment practices . the Boeing company had years to negotiate a new contract , it started one second after the old contract was signed by both organizations. Now is not the time to walk out at the 11th hour. The shareholders and the Beoing team workers deserve a on time and not a outsourcing type contract, the one that caused all the 787 problems. I do not have any stories about my grandfather or any false union stories , those things are illegal and harassment .Stop this harassing and illegal behavior please, and abide by the user agreement you had to accept to be a user on this forum with Yahoo.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1354643992307</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 12:59:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354644551804-29</Id><Topic><Title>Tax Facts for Victims of Socialized Government Education</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1354635629603</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:40:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're right - my bad.</Msg><Username>oldbuck56</Username><Timestamp>1354644551804</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 13:09:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354645658347-30</Id><Topic><Title>Let the fiscal cliff come</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1354642390830</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 12:33:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed, the fiscal cliff is a better deal than anything Obama is proposing.</Msg><Username>fredjones801</Username><Timestamp>1354645658347</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 13:27:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354645787418-31</Id><Topic><Title>7 States with no Income Tax</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1354630981868</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 09:23:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>However Washington State DOES pay the highest gas tax in the nation.

Unfortunately, the President refuses to take responsibility for avoiding the debt-fueled crisis before us. Instead, his policies have put us on the path to debt and decline. The President and his party's leaders refuse to take action in the face of the most predictable economic crisis in our nation's history. The President's budget calls for more spending and more debt, while Senate Democrats – for over 1,000 days – have refused to pass a budget. This unserious approach to budgeting has serious consequences for American families, seniors, and the next generation. We reject the broken politics of the past. The American people deserve real solutions and honest leadership. That's what we're delivering with our budget, The Path to Prosperity. House Republicans are advancing a plan of action for American renewal. Our budget: Cuts government spending to protect hardworking taxpayers; Tackles the drivers of our debt, so our troops don't pay the price for Washington's failure to take action; Restores economic freedom and ensures a level playing field for all by putting an end to special-interest favoritism and corporate welfare Reverses the President's policies that drive up gas prices, and instead promotes an all-of the-above strategy for unlocking American energy production to help lower costs, create jobs, and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Strengthens health and retirement security by taking power away from government bureaucrats and empowering patients instead with control over their own care; Reforms our broken tax code to spur job creation and economic opportunity by lowering rates, closing loopholes, and putting hardworking taxpayers ahead of special interests. At its core, this plan of action is about putting an end to empty promises from a bankrupt government and restoring the fundamental American promise: ensuring our children have more opportunity and inherit a stronger America than our parents gave us.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354656736117</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 16:32:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354657289123-45</Id><Topic><Title>Russia's Putin said Obama the clown was elected by illiterate MOOCHERS !!!!</Title><Username>sizzlin2day</Username><Timestamp>1354386570287</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 13:29:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most of the Moochers can read and know how the game is played!

Ron, have you been talking with Dell again? ( since you have harassed me asking me if I was Dell) Did Dell tell you that au.kingfisher's apology is ironic? Apparently Wayne pointed out, just a few days ago to au.kingfisher that in spite of his claims that he was being whimsical like Any Rooney, actually Wayne suggested that au.kingfisher was actually being sarcastic and harassing and was making false felony reports. Wayne pointed out that the result for Andy Rooney was that he was suspended for exactly the same sarcastic hate behavior that au.kingfisher was doing. Wayne also suggested that in the end, Andy Rooney made a public apology like au.kingfisher just did. How ironic that is ! Here is my reply to au.kingfisher who justa few days ago was claiming he was only an Andy Rooney style Yahoo message board user. . "au.kingfish, Rooney typically offered satire on trivial everyday issues, such as the cost of groceries, annoying relatives, or faulty presents. It’s when he crossed over into less trivial topics like Boeing labor relations, or a labor contract or Boeing Company Management or late and failed 787 outsourcing, expectations and more serious issues that Rooney got suspended. He learned not to make light of some topics and he was sorry. Mr. Rooney was liked for his satire, not for sarcasm, or any other behavior dressed up as satire. Au.kingfisher, I think the same thing willhappen to you, eventually you will be suspended from Yahoo message board and you may realize everything you have been saying is harassment and a felony false charge. Au.kingfisher, This is part of Mr. Rooney’s apology for one of his less trivial, non whimsical, sarcastic comments”There was never a writer who didn't hope that in some small way he was doing good with the words he put down on paper and, while I know it's presumptuous, I've always had in my mind that I was doing some little bit of good. Now, I was to be known for having done, not good, but bad.”…. I'd be known for the rest of my life as … someone who had made life more difficult ….. I felt terrible about that and I've learned. Au.kingfish, it Seems to me you are more sarcastic than you are whimsical, more braggadocios’ than you are really the best stock trader, and slightly too self centered for me.

On Monday, under pressure from the White House, Republicans finally released their opening position in the negotiations — a remarkably shallow one that demonstrated a lack of seriousness in negotiations, or farsightedness in policy. In a letter signed by Speaker John Boehner and six other House leaders, Republicans didn’t even bother to assemble their own package of spending cuts and revenue increases; they did a simple copy and paste of a few proposals made extemporaneously at a hearing last year by Erskine Bowles, the Democratic co-chairman of a deficit reduction committee. The proposal, which Mr. Bowles quickly disavowed on Monday, purports to raise $800 billion in revenue over a decade by ending deductions and loopholes, while allowing the Bush-era tax cuts for the rich to continue. It would cut $1.2 trillion in spending, half of which would come from Medicare, Medicaid, and other health programs, including an increase in the Medicare eligibility age to 67. Another $600 billion would be cut from other unspecified spending. Which programs would be cut? The letter doesn’t say, and Republicans don’t seem to care, as long as they blindly achieve their goal of cutting a big chunk out of government. The offer was a transparent attempt to appear responsive to Mr. Obama’s detailed proposal from last week, without doing any actual math or hard work. If Mr. Boehner had used a calculator, for example, he would have discovered it is impossible to produce $800 billion in revenue from eliminating deductions without severely curtailing the deduction for charitable donations, which is vital to the nonprofit sector. Doing so without limiting the charitable deduction would inevitably raise taxes on the middle class, as nonpartisan analysts have concluded, and would have a much greater effect on the upper middle class than on the very rich. The only way to produce the necessary revenue is to combine some limits on deductions with an end to the Bush tax cuts on the rich, and Mr. Obama, fortunately, has been adamant he will not consider any plan that does not do so. The Boehner letter, by contrast, actually advocates lowering rates, suggesting that Republicans are still clinging to the notion, rejected by voters, that was put forward by Mitt Romney. Raising the Medicare eligibility age hurts working-class Americans unable to work to 67, and it is likely to increase health care costs. But when you are simply tossing out random ideas, as Republicans seem to be doing, those kinds of long-term implications don’t matter. Monday’s offer may simply be intended to show the most conservative Republicans that their leaders fought before the compromises to come. For everyone else, they show a party unwilling to approach the bargaining with responsibility.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_555</Username><Timestamp>1354666510563</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 19:15:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354666682406-59</Id><Title>The House Makes an ‘Offer’</Title><Msg>Since last month’s election, Republican leaders in Congress have been demanding that President Obama come up with a detailed plan to cut the deficit and solve the upcoming fiscal deadlines without feeling any need to prepare a plan of their own.

GOP leaders remove 4 from plum House committees WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker John Boehner decided to take plum committee assignments away from four conservative Republican lawmakers after they bucked party leaders on key votes. The move is underscoring a divide in the Republican Party between tea party-supported conservatives and the House GOP leadership. All four lawmakers had voted against the summer 2011 deal negotiated between Republican leaders and President Barack Obama for extending the government's ability to borrow money in exchange for $1 trillion in spending cuts and the promise of another $1 trillion in reduced deficits. Three of the four, the exception being Schweikert, voted against the Ryan-written GOP budget blueprint that the House passed last March. Their removal from key committees with jurisdiction over the two issues was viewed by some as a signal to other Republican lawmakers to look favorably on whatever final deal Boehner and Obama put together to avert a "fiscal cliff" combination of automatic tax increases and spending cuts in January.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1354673503837</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 21:11:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354673672250-73</Id><Title>Boeing 787 in emergency landing - that;s what non union work will do for ya'll</Title><Msg>NEW YORK (Reuters) - On the same day that one of its new 787 Dreamliners made an emergency landing because of a mechanical problem, Boeing said that U.S. regulators would require the entire fleet of 787 jets to be inspected...

While Obama's America is becoming more Socialist Putin's Socialist Russia is becoming less Socialist and more Free Market Capitalist. Putin has openly stated that Communism does not work. Putin should know because he's lived through Communism. Obama should know but he can't except the facts of Free Market Capitalism because of his upbringing between himself and his Communist Activist father Frank Marshall Davis. Frank Marshal Davis took Barack's clean slate and filled it with the Communist nonsense view of an unachieveable world view of fairness where everyone succeeds equally. Even Karl Marx didn't really believe that was possible without negative consequences. Karl Marx's musings were nothing more than theory. This President is a fool for allowing himself to be duped.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1354674849652</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 21:34:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354675227524-76</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing 787 in emergency landing - that;s what non union work will do for ya'll</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1354673672250</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 21:14:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like it an issue with a lot of 787's, so who would that be?</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1354675227524</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 21:40:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354675480267-77</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP Gang of 5 are Ruining the Country</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1354600796694</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 00:59:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Phantom, Isn't it odd that voters of those states that voted for Obama (Ohio, Wisconsin, and Virginia) would also vote for three of those five you say are "ruining" the country.
