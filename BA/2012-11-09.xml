I grew up in a scientific world, the son of a neurosurgeon. I followed my father’s path and became an academic neurosurgeon, teaching at Harvard Medical School and other universities. I understand what happens to the brain when people are near death, and I had always believed there were good scientific explanations for the heavenly out-of-body journeys described by those who narrowly escaped death. The brain is an astonishingly sophisticated but extremely delicate mechanism. Reduce the amount of oxygen it receives by the smallest amount and it will react. It was no big surprise that people who had undergone severe trauma would return from their experiences with strange stories. But that didn’t mean they had journeyed anywhere real. Although I considered myself a faithful Christian, I was so more in name than in actual belief. I didn’t begrudge those who wanted to believe that Jesus was more than simply a good man who had suffered at the hands of the world. I sympathized deeply with those who wanted to believe that there was a God somewhere out there who loved us unconditionally. In fact, I envied such people the security that those beliefs no doubt provided. But as a scientist, I simply knew better than to believe them myself. In the fall of 2008, however, after seven days in a coma during which the human part of my brain, the neocortex, was inactivated, I experienced something so profound that it gave me a scientific reason to believe in consciousness after death. I know how pronouncements like mine sound to skeptics, so I will tell my story with the logic and language of the scientist I am. Very early one morning four years ago, I awoke with an extremely intense headache. Within hours, my entire cortex—the part of the brain that controls thought and emotion and that in essence makes us human—had shut down. Doctors at Lynchburg General Hospital in Virginia, a hospital where I myself worked as a neurosurgeon, determined that I had somehow contracted a very rare bacterial meningitis that mostly attacks newborns. E. coli bacteria had penetrated my cerebrospinal fluid and were eating my brain. When I entered the emergency room that morning, my chances of survival in anything beyond a vegetative state were already low. They soon sank to near nonexistent. For seven days I lay in a deep coma, my body unresponsive, my higher-order brain functions totally offline. Then, on the morning of my seventh day in the hospital, as my doctors weighed whether to discontinue treatment, my eyes popped open. ‘You have nothing to fear.’ ‘There is nothing you can do wrong.’ The message flooded me with a vast and crazy sensation of relief. (Photo illustration by Newsweek; Source: Buena Vista Images-Getty Images) There is no scientific explanation for the fact that while my body lay in coma, my mind—my conscious, inner self—was alive and well. While the neurons of my cortex were stunned to complete inactivity by the bacteria that had attacked them, my brain-free consciousness journeyed to another, larger dimension of the universe: a dimension I’d never dreamed existed and which the old, pre-coma me would have been more than happy to explain was a simple impossibility. But that dimension—in rough outline, the same one described by countless subjects of near-death experiences and other mystical states—is there. It exists, and what I saw and learned there has placed me quite literally in a new world: a world where we are much more than our brains and bodies, and where death is not the end of consciousness but rather a chapter in a vast, and incalculably positive, journey. I’m not the first person to have discovered evidence that consciousness exists beyond the body. Brief, wonderful glimpses of this realm are as old as human history. But as far as I know, no one before me has ever traveled to this dimension (a) while their cortex was completely shut down, and (b) while their body was under minute medical observation, as mine was for the full seven days of my coma. All the chief arguments against near-death experiences suggest that these experiences are the results of minimal, transient, or partial malfunctioning of the cortex. My near-death experience, however, took place not while my cortex was malfunctioning, but while it was simply off. This is clear from the severity and duration of my meningitis, and from the global cortical involvement documented by CT scans and neurological examinations. According to current medical understanding of the brain and mind, there is absolutely no way that I could have experienced even a dim and limited consciousness during my time in the coma, much less the hyper-vivid and completely coherent odyssey I underwent. It took me months to come to terms with what happened to me. Not just the medical impossibility that I had been conscious during my coma, but—more importantly—the things that happened during that time. Toward the beginning of my adventure, I was in a place of clouds. Big, puffy, pink-white ones that showed up sharply against the deep blue-black sky. Higher than the clouds—immeasurably higher—flocks of transparent, shimmering beings arced across the sky, leaving long, streamerlike lines behind them. Birds? Angels? These words registered later, when I was writing down my recollections. But neither of these words do justice to the beings themselves, which were quite simply different from anything I have known on this planet. They were more advanced. Higher forms. A sound, huge and booming like a glorious chant, came down from above, and I wondered if the winged beings were producing it. Again, thinking about it later, it occurred to me that the joy of these creatures, as they soared along, was such that they had to make this noise—that if the joy didn’t come out of them this way then they would simply not otherwise be able to contain it. The sound was palpable and almost material, like a rain that you can feel on your skin but doesn’t get you wet. Seeing and hearing were not separate in this place where I now was. I could hear the visual beauty of the silvery bodies of those scintillating beings above, and I could see the surging, joyful perfection of what they sang. It seemed that you could not look at or listen to anything in this world without becoming a part of it—without joining with it in some mysterious way. Again, from my present perspective, I would suggest that you couldn’t look at anything in that world at all, for the word “at” itself implies a separation that did not exist there. Everything was distinct, yet everything was also a part of everything else, like the rich and intermingled designs on a Persian carpet ... or a butterfly’s wing. It gets stranger still. For most of my journey, someone else was with me. A woman. She was young, and I remember what she looked like in complete detail. She had high cheekbones and deep-blue eyes. Golden brown tresses framed her lovely face. When first I saw her, we were riding along together on an intricately patterned surface, which after a moment I recognized as the wing of a butterfly. In fact, millions of butterflies were all around us—vast fluttering waves of them, dipping down into the woods and coming back up around us again. It was a river of life and color, moving through the air. The woman’s outfit was simple, like a peasant’s, but its colors—powder blue, indigo, and pastel orange-peach—had the same overwhelming, super-vivid aliveness that everything else had. She looked at me with a look that, if you saw it for five seconds, would make your whole life up to that point worth living, no matter what had happened in it so far. It was not a romantic look. It was not a look of friendship. It was a look that was somehow beyond all these, beyond all the different compartments of love we have down here on earth. It was something higher, holding all those other kinds of love within itself while at the same time being much bigger than all of them. Without using any words, she spoke to me. The message went through me like a wind, and I instantly understood that it was true. I knew so in the same way that I knew that the world around us was real—was not some fantasy, passing and insubstantial. The message had three parts, and if I had to translate them into earthly language, I’d say they ran something like this: “You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever.” “You have nothing to fear.” “There is nothing you can do wrong.” The message flooded me with a vast and crazy sensation of relief. It was like being handed the rules to a game I’d been playing all my life without ever fully understanding it. “We will show you many things here,” the woman said, again, without actually using these words but by driving their conceptual essence directly into me. “But eventually, you will go back.” To this, I had only one question. Back where? The universe as I experienced it in my coma is ... the same one that both Einstein and Jesus were speaking of in their (very) different ways. (Ed Morris / Getty Images) A warm wind blew through, like the kind that spring up on the most perfect summer days, tossing the leaves of the trees and flowing past like heavenly water. A divine breeze. It changed everything, shifting the world around me into an even higher octave, a higher vibration. Although I still had little language function, at least as we think of it on earth, I began wordlessly putting questions to this wind, and to the divine being that I sensed at work behind or within it. Where is this place? Who am I? Why am I here? Each time I silently put one of these questions out, the answer came instantly in an explosion of light, color, love, and beauty that blew through me like a crashing wave. What was important about these blasts was that they didn’t simply silence my questions by overwhelming them. They answered them, but in a way that bypassed language. Thoughts entered me directly. But it wasn’t thought like we experience on earth. It wasn’t vague, immaterial, or abstract. These thoughts were solid and immediate—hotter than fire and wetter than water—and as I received them I was able to instantly and effortlessly understand concepts that would have taken me years to fully grasp in my earthly life. I continued moving forward and found myself entering an immense void, completely dark, infinite in size, yet also infinitely comforting. Pitch-black as it was, it was also brimming over with light: a light that seemed to come from a brilliant orb that I now sensed near me. The orb was a kind of “interpreter” between me and this vast presence surrounding me. It was as if I were being born into a larger world, and the universe itself was like a giant cosmic womb, and the orb (which I sensed was somehow connected with, or even identical to, the woman on the butterfly wing) was guiding me through it. Later, when I was back, I found a quotation by the 17th-century Christian poet Henry Vaughan that came close to describing this magical place, this vast, inky-black core that was the home of the Divine itself. “There is, some say, in God a deep but dazzling darkness ...” That was it exactly: an inky darkness that was also full to brimming with light. I know full well how extraordinary, how frankly unbelievable, all this sounds. Had someone—even a doctor—told me a story like this in the old days, I would have been quite certain that they were under the spell of some delusion. But what happened to me was, far from being delusional, as real or more real than any event in my life. That includes my wedding day and the birth of my two sons. What happened to me demands explanation. Modern physics tells us that the universe is a unity—that it is undivided. Though we seem to live in a world of separation and difference, physics tells us that beneath the surface, every object and event in the universe is completely woven up with every other object and event. There is no true separation. Before my experience these ideas were abstractions. Today they are realities. Not only is the universe defined by unity, it is also—I now know—defined by love. The universe as I experienced it in my coma is—I have come to see with both shock and joy—the same one that both Einstein and Jesus were speaking of in their (very) different ways. I’ve spent decades as a neurosurgeon at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in our country. I know that many of my peers hold—as I myself did—to the theory that the brain, and in particular the cortex, generates consciousness and that we live in a universe devoid of any kind of emotion, much less the unconditional love that I now know God and the universe have toward us. But that belief, that theory, now lies broken at our feet. What happened to me destroyed it, and I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the true nature of consciousness and making the fact that we are more, much more, than our physical brains as clear as I can, both to my fellow scientists and to people at large. I don’t expect this to be an easy task, for the reasons I described above. When the castle of an old scientific theory begins to show fault lines, no one wants to pay attention at first. The old castle simply took too much work to build in the first place, and if it falls, an entirely new one will have to be constructed in its place. I learned this firsthand after I was well enough to get back out into the world and talk to others—people, that is, other than my long-suffering wife, Holley, and our two sons—about what had happened to me. The looks of polite disbelief, especially among my medical friends, soon made me realize what a task I would have getting people to understand the enormity of what I had seen and experienced that week while my brain was down. One of the few places I didn’t have trouble getting my story across was a place I’d seen fairly little of before my experience: church. The first time I entered a church after my coma, I saw everything with fresh eyes. The colors of the stained-glass windows recalled the luminous beauty of the landscapes I’d seen in the world above. The deep bass notes of the organ reminded me of how thoughts and emotions in that world are like waves that move through you. And, most important, a painting of Jesus breaking bread with his disciples evoked the message that lay at the very heart of my journey: that we are loved and accepted unconditionally by a God even more grand and unfathomably glorious than the one I’d learned of as a child in Sunday school. Today many believe that the living spiritual truths of religion have lost their power, and that science, not faith, is the road to truth. Before my experience I strongly suspected that this was the case myself. But I now understand that such a view is far too simple. The plain fact is that the materialist picture of the body and brain as the producers, rather than the vehicles, of human consciousness is doomed. In its place a new view of mind and body will emerge, and in fact is emerging already. This view is scientific and spiritual in equal measure and will value what the greatest scientists of history themselves always valued above all: truth. This new picture of reality will take a long time to put together. It won’t be finished in my time, or even, I suspect, my sons’ either. In fact, reality is too vast, too complex, and too irreducibly mysterious for a full picture of it ever to be absolutely complete. But in essence, it will show the universe as evolving, multi-dimensional, and known down to its every last atom by a God who cares for us even more deeply and fiercely than any parent ever loved their child. I’m still a doctor, and still a man of science every bit as much as I was before I had my experience. But on a deep level I’m very different from the person I was before, because I’ve caught a glimpse of this emerging picture of reality. And you can believe me when I tell you that it will be worth every bit of the work it will take us, and those who come after us, to get it right.</Msg><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1352440886426</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 01:01:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352442355205-3</Id><Topic><Title>When Obama Won, So Did America’s Future</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1352434556299</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 23:15:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One more time: Rewarding failure thru handouts and punishing success by taxation does not work.

You're too busy loving him to evaluate him in an objective manner. You can't possibly understand his ineffective lack of leadership. We have a pop culture celebrity for president rather than an effective leader. By any accepted business parameters the president is an outright failure as an exectuive and would have been fired in the private sector. The reason he's crying in disbelief is because deep down in his heart he knows he's a failure but all these people that love him gave him 4 more years. I'll give you that he is a more secret, more manipulative and more dishonest than any politician before him. He relys on character assassination and divisiveness as his primary tools but he has zero leadership qualities and zero executive skills. It is disheartening to those who take risk to build things to have an ineffective executive in charge and you'll never get a silk purse from a sow's ear like Obama.</Msg><Username>hooschtick_hertz</Username><Timestamp>1352463042115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 07:10:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352463563599-9</Id><Title>A.

She had pledged after Romney’s unsuccessful 2008 bid that she would never do it again, but was the biggest advocate for his 2012 attempt. “Ann was quite sad. She was teary-eyed,” he said. Romney “was very thankful for everything people had done and he was remarkably gracious and not bitter.” The source said although Romney intends to spend time with his family in the aftermath of the loss, he is unlikely to remain out of public view for long. Romney would end up on the speaking circuit and on corporate boards, he said. “He’ll spend time with his family and recharge his batteries, and then he’ll go after a lot of things,” this person said. He and others who were in the campaign’s war room Tuesday said it became clear by mid-evening that the night was slipping away from them. But in a clear contrast to John McCain’s campaign in 2008, there is little evidence of finger-pointing and back-biting. ~ LA Times</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1352474702112</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 10:25:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352475024548-50</Id><Title>Obama will do fine if Republican House will get past partisan ranchor and work for the people</Title><Msg>The House of Representatives failed to pass ANY meaningful bills once the republicans took over in 2006.

Producing wealth is what we do. Unfortunately consuming wealth and punishing those who produce it is the choice of the majority of voters. That's stupid of course and wealth producers aren't stupid, so they will take their skills and their wealth elsewhere. I told the board this the first time Obama was elected and $10 trillion moved off shore. Far more will go now. For those looking for good places to protect your wealth I have my own personal preferences list below. Remember tax avoidance is legal, tax evasion is criminal but there is a plethora of ways to avoid taxes and keep more of the wealth you produce while enjoying high respect for property rights. Panama: “The resurgence of Panama’s stature as a tax haven was helped by more than a billion dollars of aid and the repatriation of hundreds of millions of dollars of refugee funds. . . a 20-year exemption from income tax and exemption from restrictive clauses of the Labour Code are some of the benefits being offered . . “Luxembourg is an attractive place for foreigners to stash excess wealth, as the entire country (said to be among the richest in the world – in per capita terms) seems to have a rather lax attitude toward tax collection. According to one website one that profiles tax havens: “although they have taxes, nobody seems to work too hard on collecting them.”Amenities: No tax on bank interest, investment dividends, or capital gains for non-residents. Cayman Islands – Great climate and Beautiful Beaches. High quality medical care for those who can’t get in countries with socialized medicine. Amenities: No income, capital gains, gift, or estate taxes on individuals or offshore corporations. Vanuatu - An important consideration in choosing a tax haven is whether the country in question will share information with governments or investigators. This is where the Micronesian Pacific island of Vanuatu shines, as it shares no account information whatsoever with law enforcement. Amenities: Highest level of secrecy, no income, capital gains, or inheritance taxes. The Cook Islands have much to offer prospective tax dodgers, including the sheer natural beauty of its beach climate. Amenities: No capital gains taxes, income taxes, or death taxes levied on investors. Andorra - A small, landlocked country in Western Europe that is one of only three countries remaining on OCED’s blacklist of “uncooperative” tax havens. While Andorra recently instituted a small capital gains tax, the overall tax savings still far outweighs it’s liability. Amenities: No personal income tax. Belize - Openly writes its laws with an eye toward tax avoidance, further noting that Belize “learned from the successes and mistakes of other tax havens around the world and designed its legislation carefully so that it would become THE most attractive tax haven globally.” Singapore - Doing everything it can to take over Switzerland's mantle. Is Singapore the new S in UBS? Hong Kong - Yet another former British tax haven. Low taxes, high secrecy and vast amounts of real trade help hide the illicit flows its secrecy surely assists. Luxembourg - An aggressive small state government defending tax secrecy from within the European Union for all it is worth--and attracting massive inflows of funds through its low-tax corporate structures at the same time. Bermuda - The favorite location for U.S. corporate inversions, or companies that move their headquarters to a tax haven while retaining their material operations in higher-tax America, and any offshore insurance company.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1352478361507</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 11:26:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352478673662-61</Id><Topic><Title>All Sane Americans Were Shell Shocked</Title><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1352471259042</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 09:27:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post Rover - It is the same insanity you can see in Greece.

The best thing is that she is able to get the idiots she's screwing to imagine that they are being treated as equals and that she is a beacon of fairness.</Msg><Username>hooschtick_hertz</Username><Timestamp>1352485861656</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 13:31:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352486368508-89</Id><Title>Magic Underwear Does Not Prevent Shellshock</Title><Msg>The Vulture/Voucher ticket promised they'd give the pathologically greedy everything they ever wanted and stick it to everyone else.

Permalink Stick, I would like to share something with you - though I doubt many will understand it. I actually woke up Wednesday “post election” morning in a very good mood. In fact, it surprised me. A conservative. Go figure! I was certainly aware that Obama won. Not that his winning was a good thing, but because it is as I predicted and it is necessary and the Lord is still in control. I have told you guys before that I have spent the past year and a half studying biblical prophecy in earnest. It is clear that for the proverbial "end" to come, that the United States must either be non-existent, irrelevant, or complicit in the work of the anti-Christ. What Obama has done in the past four years is to place Israel in the position of being compelled to make a "peace treaty" with the anti-Christ (who has not yet been revealed) (Daniel, chapter 9). It cannot be denied by anyone who treasures truth that Obama has participated in surrounding Israel with more hostile neighbors - Egypt and Libya who have been taken over by radical Islamists. In the case of Egypt, it was by U.S. coercion; in the case of Libya, it was by destruction through U.S. military force. He has also protected Iran and Syria with his tepid and ineffectual responses to their human and political rights abuses. To Israel, Obama has told them that they need to go back to the indefensible '67 borders and he has shunned and denigrated the Israeli Prime Minister. At some point, with the United States no longer supporting Israel, and her being surrounded by open and notorious hostility, and with Iran’s soon to be nuclear bomb capability, the anti-Christ will force Israel into a compact. And then the end will come. Obama will have played his part and for the United States, Obama will have, in a negative way, reaffirmed the promises made in Genesis 12:3.

The biggest single donor in political history, the casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, mingled with other Romney backers at a postelection breakfast, fresh off a large gamble gone bad. Of the eight candidates he supported with tens of millions of dollars in contributions to “super PACs,” none were victorious on Tuesday. And as calls came in on Wednesday from some of the donors who had poured more than $300 million into the pair of big-spending outside groups founded in part by Karl Rove — perhaps the leading political entrepreneur of the super PAC era — he offered them a grim upside: without us, the race would not have been as close as it was. The most expensive election in American history drew to a close this week with a price tag estimated at more than $6 billion, propelled by legal and regulatory decisions that allowed wealthy donors to pour record amounts of cash into races around the country. But while outside spending affected the election in innumerable ways — reshaping the Republican presidential nominating contest, clogging the airwaves with unprecedented amounts of negative advertising and shoring up embattled Republican incumbents in the House — the prizes most sought by the emerging class of megadonors remained outside their grasp. President Obama will return to the White House in January, and the Democrats have strengthened their lock on the Senate. The election’s most lavishly self-financed candidate fared no better. Linda E. McMahon, a Connecticut Republican who is a former professional wrestling executive, spent close to $100 million — nearly all of it her own money — on two races for the Senate, conceding defeat on Tuesday for the second time in three years. “Money is a necessary condition for electoral success,” said Bob Biersack, a senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending. “But it’s not sufficient, and it’s never been.” Even by the flush standards of a campaign in which the two presidential candidates raised $1 billion each, the scale of outside spending was staggering: more than $1 billion all told, about triple the amount in 2010. Mr. Obama faced at least $386 million in negative advertising from super PACs and other outside spenders, more than double what the groups supporting him spent on the airwaves. Outside groups spent more than $37 million in Virginia’s Senate race and $30 million in Ohio’s, a majority to aid the Republican candidates. The bulk of that outside money came from a relatively small group of wealthy donors, unleashed by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, which allowed unlimited contributions to super PACs. Harold Simmons, a Texas industrialist, gave $26.9 million to super PACs backing Mr. Romney and Republican candidates for the Senate. Joe Ricketts, the owner of the Chicago Cubs, spent close to $13 million to bankroll a super PAC attacking Mr. Obama over federal spending. Bob Perry, a Texas homebuilder, poured more than $21 million into super PACs active in the presidential race and the Senate battles in Florida and Virginia, where Democrats narrowly prevailed. A donor network marshaled by Charles and David Koch, the billionaire industrialists and conservative philanthropists, reportedly sought to raise $400 million for tax-exempt groups that are not required to disclose their spending. Mr. Adelson’s giving to super PACs and other outside groups came to more than $60 million, though in public Mr. Adelson did not seem overly concerned about the paltry returns on his investment. “Paying bills,” Mr. Adelson said on Tuesday night when asked by a Norwegian reporter how he thought his donations had been spent. “That’s how you spend money. Either that or become a Jewish husband — you spend a lot of money.” Flush with cash, Republican-leaning groups outspent Democratic ones by an even greater margin than in 2010. But rather than produce a major partisan imbalance, the money merely evened the playing field in many races. In several competitive Senate races, high spending by outside groups was offset to a large extent with stronger fund-raising by Democratic candidates, assisted at the margins by Democratic super PACs. For much of the fall, Mr. Obama and Democratic groups broadcast at least as many ads, and sometimes more, in swing states than Mr. Romney and his allied groups, in part because Mr. Obama was able to secure lower ad rates by paying for most of the advertising himself. Mr. Romney relied far more on outside groups, which must pay higher rates. Haley Barbour, a former Mississippi governor who helped Mr. Rove raise money for American Crossroads and its sister group, Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, said that without a blitz of coordinated anti-Obama advertising in the summer, the campaign would not have been as competitive. “I believe that some of that money actually kept Romney from getting beat down by the carpet-bombing he underwent from the Obama forces,” Mr. Barbour said. “I did look at it more as us trying to keep our candidates from getting swamped, like what happened to McCain.” Some advocates for tighter campaign financing regulations argued that who won or lost was beside the point. The danger, they argued, is that in the post-Citizens United world, candidates and officeholders on both sides of the aisle are far more beholden to the wealthy individuals who can finance large-scale independent spending. “Unlimited contributions and secret money in American politics have resulted in the past in scandal and the corruption of government decisions,” said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a watchdog group. “This will happen again in the future.” But on Wednesday, at least, the nation’s megadonors returned home with lighter wallets and few victories. As the morning wore on at Logan Airport, more guests from Mr. Romney’s election-night party at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center trickled in, lugging garment bags and forming a small line at the security checkpoint. “It’s going to be a long flight home, isn’t it?” said one person, who asked not to be identified. The investor Julian Robertson, who held fund-raisers for Mr. Romney and gave more than $2 million to a pro-Romney super PAC, arrived with several companions. Mr. Robertson spotted an acquaintance: Emil W. Henry Jr., an economic adviser and a fund-raiser for Mr. Romney, to whom Mr. Robertson had offered a ride on his charter. “Aww, group hug,” Mr. Henry said.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1352488923759</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 14:22:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352489426355-95</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is Gods plan for America !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1352488627039</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 14:17:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not that this matters, stick; but I accidentally gave you a thumb-down, because I scrolled from the bottom up, so I thought this post was from Bucky Blob.

FRIEDMAN In October 2010, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, famously told The National Journal, “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.” And that’s how he and his party acted. Well, Mitch, how’s that workin’ out for ya? No one can know for sure what complex emotional chemistry tipped this election Obama’s way, but here’s my guess: In the end, it came down to a majority of Americans believing that whatever his faults, Obama was trying his hardest to fix what ails the country and that he had to do it with a Republican Party that, in its gut, did not want to meet him halfway but wanted him to fail — so that it could swoop in and pick up the pieces. To this day, I find McConnell’s declaration appalling. Consider all the problems we have faced in this country over the last four years — from debt to adapting to globalization to unemployment to the challenges of climate change to terrorism — and then roll over that statement: “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.” That, in my view, is what made the difference. The G.O.P. lost an election that, given the state of the economy, it should have won because of an excess of McConnell-like cynicism, a shortage of new ideas and an abundance of really bad ideas — about immigration, about climate, about how jobs are created and about abortion and other social issues. It seems that many Americans went to the polls without much enthusiasm for either candidate, but, nevertheless, with a clear idea of whom they preferred. The majority seemed to be saying to Obama: “You didn’t get it all right the first time, but we’re going to give you a second chance.” In a way, they voted for “hope and change” again. I don’t think it was so much a ratification of health care or “Race to the Top” or any other Obama initiative. It was more a vote on his character: “We think you’re trying. Now try even harder. Learn from your mistakes. Reach out to the other side, even if they slap away your hand, and focus like a laser on the economy, so those of us who voted for you today without much enthusiasm can feel good about this vote.” And that is why Obama’s victory is so devastating for the G.O.P. A country with nearly 8 percent unemployment preferred to give the president a second chance rather than Mitt Romney a first one. The Republican Party today needs to have a real heart-to-heart with itself. The G.O.P. has lost two presidential elections in a row because it forced its candidate to run so far to the loony right to get through the primaries, dominated by its ultraconservative base, that he could not get close enough back to the center to carry the national election. It is not enough for Republicans to tell their Democratic colleagues in private — as some do — “I wish I could help you, but our base is crazy.” They need to have their own reformation. The center-right has got to have it out with the far-right, or it is going to be a minority party for a long time. Many in the next generation of America know climate change is real, and they want to see something done to mitigate it. Many in the next generation of America will be of Hispanic origin and insist on humane immigration reform that gives a practical legal pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The next generation is going to need immigration of high-I.Q. risk-takers from India, China and Latin America if the U.S. is going to remain at the cutting edge of the Information Technology revolution and be able to afford the government we want. Many in the next generation of America see gays and lesbians in their families, workplaces and Army barracks, and they don’t want to deny them the marriage rights held by others. The G.O.P. today is at war with too many in the next generation of America on all of these issues. All that said, my prediction is that the biggest domestic issue in the next four years will be how we respond to changes in technology, globalization and markets that have, in a very short space of time, made the decent-wage, middle-skilled job — the backbone of the middle class — increasingly obsolete. The only decent-wage jobs will be high-skilled ones. The answer to that challenge will require a new level of political imagination — a combination of educational reforms and unprecedented collaboration between business, schools, universities and government to change how workers are trained and empowered to keep learning. It will require tax reforms and immigration reforms. America today desperately needs a center-right G.O.P. that is offering merit-based, market-based approaches to all these issues — and a willingness to meet the other side halfway. The country is starved for practical, bipartisan cooperation, and it will reward politicians who deliver it and punish those who don’t. The votes have been counted. President Obama now needs to get to work to justify the second chance the country has given him, and the Republicans need to get to work understanding why that happened.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1352500710537</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 17:38:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352500725575-105</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S 332 LANDSLIDE VICTORY OVER ROMNEY'S 206</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1352495948691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 16:19:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Carter got 49 total electoral votes and Mondale got a whopping 13.

After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair. Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours. This afternoon, the President graciously accepted my resignation. As I depart Langley, I want you to know that it has been the greatest of privileges to have served with you, the officers of our Nation’s Silent Service, a work force that is truly exceptional in every regard. Indeed, you did extraordinary work on a host of critical missions during my time as director, and I am deeply grateful to you for that. Teddy Roosevelt once observed that life’s greatest gift is the opportunity to work hard at work worth doing. I will always treasure my opportunity to have done that with you and I will always regret the circumstances that brought that work with you to an end. Thank you for your extraordinary service to our country, and best wishes for continued success in the important endeavors that lie ahead for our country and our Agency.

You have been at least willing to digest and not immediately mock what I wrote - though mocking me is OK, just not God. There are a few parts to your response that I think deserve some consideration: 1) That I have conjectured what Obama is doing relative to Israel. Well, yes, that is basically true since I cannot divine what goes on in his head. All I can do is look at the observables and formulate an opinion. What we know as facts are these: 1) Obama embraced the "Arab Spring" with great enthusiasm and involved himself in the removal of Hosni Mubarak of Egypt – only to have that nation be taken over by the Muslim Brotherhood; 2) Obama further embraced the Arab Spring and destroyed the sovereign nation of Libya's military and government over the issue of 300 deaths – and we know (almost) what happened later in Benghazi; 3) Obama came up with some excuse, or was simply mute, on Iran's version of the Arab Spring, i.e., the Green Movement - nary a peep – so no change there; and 4) Obama is doing who knows what relative to Syria - even though more than 30,000 people have died there so far. The excuse for Syria had something to do with not being able to effectively set up a "no fly zone" (DefSec Gates). This is specious to say the least because with Turkey calling for NATO to do something, Syria really has no one to help them. Iran? Iran would have to go thought Iraq and Turkey to help Syria. This begs the question why Obama is inconsistent, basically hypocritical about the "Arab Spring". So, I have "conjectured", as you state, that Obama’s intention is to surround Israel with hostility – as there is no other logical conclusion. That is, Libya/Egypt moves towards hating Israel and Syria/Iran remain Israel haters. Then there is the personal interaction with Prime Minister Netanyahu. In an open Mike, Obama told President Sarkozy of France that Netanyahu was “a liar”. And Obama “dissed” Netanyahu at the White House in 2010. For the Jewish vote, he conducted a more friendly meeting with the Prime Minister this year – for votes. 2) As to the “bible scholars” comments. Well, the Bible is not for any private interpretation – it says so. “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of one's own interpretation.” (2 Peter 1:20) To that end, I don’t strictly depend upon what others have to say about the Bible, about prophecy, though I read and study what many say. While what scholars have to say is useful and interesting, they do not have a patent on understanding the Bible. Don’t be fooled. 3) The whole point of the post was this: if you understand what is supposed to happen during Daniel’s “seventieth week” (Daniel chapter 9) what we are told is the anti-Christ makes a “peace pact” with Israel. Preceding this prophecy, by definition, Israel had to have been restored as a nation (check). Also, Jesus, in the Olivet Discourse pointed to that time as when the Gospel would have been preached in all the world (check). Now, this is where the United States comes in – or really, it doesn’t. Today, even with Obama in office, the President would be compelled to defend Israel against all enemies. He at least gets that – I think. It would be impossible for Israel to be forced to make a “peace agreement” with the devil (anti-Christ) if the United States is there to otherwise defend her. The so-called “peace pact” is a farce and a coercion. The United States, obviously, has to either: a) not exist; b) be unwilling to or incapable of helping; or c) is complicit. In other words, the United States is not in the picture – in the sense of frustrating the work of the devil and his surrogate, the anti-Christ. If one does not believe the Bible, then there is no point of discussion; but if one believes what the Bible says, then I am suggesting that the path, witting or unwitting, that Obama is heading down – the undermining of Israel’s security and the likely demise of the United States as a super power – is that preparation necessary for the anti-Christ to be revealed and uninhibited. Indeed, I am at peace with knowing that it is in God’s control, but am dismayed, nevertheless.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1352520080230</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 23:01:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352520779256-127</Id><Topic><Title>Obama won because Americans love doubled gas prices, well more then doubled.
