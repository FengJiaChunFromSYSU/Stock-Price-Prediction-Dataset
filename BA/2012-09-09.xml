False. Nearly 400 economists, including several Nobel laureates, publicly urged Obama to following the path President Reagan pursued -- cut taxes, slow the growth of domestic spending and continuing deregulation. Most business economists think Obama's "stimulus" plan accomplished little, if anything, with some academic economists, like Stanford's John Taylor, believing that stimulus actually made things worse: "I just don't think there's any evidence. When you look at the numbers, when you see what happened, when people reacted to the stimulus, it did very little good." TARP, begun under President George W. Bush, supposedly prevented financial institutions from collapsing. But Neil Barofsky, in his new book called "Bailout: An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street," argues that TARP completely failed in its mission: to increase liquidity to jump start lending. The reason for intervention in the first place is that banks had become "too big too fail." Not only did the banks park the money and make risk-free profits off the spread, but banks became bigger than ever after TARP.</Msg><Username>jetstream_2010</Username><Timestamp>1347172303194</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 02:31:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347173134445-6</Id><Topic><Title>Why didn't George "Dubya" Bush...</Title><Username>cloroxcowboy</Username><Timestamp>1347127981735</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 14:13:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He may have just gotten back from Africa where he is helping set up medical clinics for women's cancer screening, the BBC was covering it.

I think he kinda shut himself down, tryinig to answer my simple and timely question with another question, a stupid and irrelevant one at that. By his logic -- going 30 years back to Carter -- the GOPig should have invited Gerald Ford or Ronnie Raygun to speak. But with them both deceased and unavailable, why not choose a more recent GOPig to address the RNC? There are only Bushes to choose from: are 51 and 54/55. 51 is too senile to hold such a speech. You and imacomm both know, and aren't willing to admit, that an endoresment by Bushleague 54/55 would have the opposite effect.

Why? They get big salaries, big bonuses, fancy digs and cars, piles of stocks, etc... I suppose they believe the 787 was a model of how you can offload Engineering and reap lots of rewards? Offloading 787 Engineering almost killed this company. I suppose you can say what didn't kill you only toughed you up? I say stockholders better keep an eye out. If Boeing refuses to acknowledge they're picking a fight with the Engineers because they think they'll just take it - I say contrair. This company relies on the best Engineers money can buy. Push them aside and you lose out on future tanker programs, 777x, 737max and new adventures. I'm not about to pull out a shovel and dig Boeings grave but we'll be here to dig them out again just like we did with the 787.</Msg><Username>ev3044</Username><Timestamp>1347221688707</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 16:14:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347221791287-39</Id><Topic><Title>The World Loves Obama...</Title><Username>sir_paul_mccartney55</Username><Timestamp>1347132099080</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 15:21:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The American people were mislead by Obama!
