The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with the government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced activities in Oahu, the Japanese ambassador to the United States and his colleagues delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed complicated to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of workplace violence. It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the activity was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese government has deliberately sought to communicate with the United States, despite our nation’s provincial inability to understand or respect Japanese culture and its expressions of hope for continued peace. The workplace violence yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused some bad feelings among our naval and military forces. Allegedly, some American lives have been lost. In addition, American ships may have been inconvenienced on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu. Yesterday, the Japanese government also initiated workplace violence in Malaya and several other locations. Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise workplace offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already come to understand our culpability in these matters and now seek to understand what happened. As commander in chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken to understand why we have angered the Japanese and determine how to best make amends. Always will we remember the character of the superior, peace-loving Asians. No matter how long it may take us to overcome this alleged instigation of workplace violence, the American people in their righteous shame will win through to absolute understanding of how to better our relations with The Empire of Japan. I believe I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only better ourselves to the uttermost, but will make very certain that this form of justifiable outrage from Japan shall never trouble us again. Mistakes were made. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory and our interests have much to apologize for. With confidence in our armed forces - with the unbounding determination of our people - we will gain the inevitable betterment of ourselves as we shed the shameful, false belief of “American exceptionalism.” I ask that the Congress declare that since the unfortunate incident at Pearl Harbor, a new era of understanding will commence between the United States and the Japanese empire. I am, therefore, asking Congress to appropriate the sum of one hundred billion dollars to jump-start this effort.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351311199141</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 00:13:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351315564003-3</Id><Topic><Title>what the spectre gunship could have done</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351305950401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:45:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don, The new message board format does not allow for hyperlinks, but for those that want to see the video, take the words, "AC-130 Toasts Iraqi Terrorists", and Google them, they will then find the video. It was reported today or yesterday by the White House that the reason that the military did not take action was that they could not tell what was going on. Perhaps they also wanted the public to believe that the AC-130 was too imprecise to be certain of who they would be hitting - which this video completely debunks. Let's see: let the Americans die because they could not tell if they might hit one of the Americans. In the mean time, the AC-130 is based in Italy. And, by the way, the AC-130 was used by Obama to decimate the Libyan government and military. And, being based in Italy, it is theoretically available within about two hours. No excuses, just incompetence.

The attack took place starting 2:40PM EST on Tuesday 11 Sept. (9:40 PM in Benghazi). Where was Obama? According to what I found on the internet, by newsfolks that keep track of his public schedule, Obama had a meeting planned with Sec Defense Paneta in the Oval Office at 5 PM EST. That would be about two hours after the attack started. Now, what is the liklihood that Obama and Panetta did not know what was going on? What is the liklihood that they did not go down to the situation room in the White House - where all of the emails regarding the attack were sent? Where they could have seen the drone video in real time? Listened to the conversations in real time? What is the liklihood that the President did not know that three requests from the men located at the Annex were made to their CIA leadership to support Ambassador Stevens and were told to "stand down"? Who told them to stand down and why did they do that? This goes beyond confusion and is more of a prosecutable offense. What is Obama up to? He massively and casually uses drones in the Muslim world inflaming hatred and passions - killing very few key terrorists, mostly by-standers - yet he apologizes and offers olive branches, showing weakness. It would not be surprising to find that this, along with the massive debt, is part of a plan to bring down this country. His efforts (Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iran) to drive Israel's neighbors towards more radicalism and place her in a position of insecurity is icing on the cake.

It is rotting your brain. Yes, theoretically, we could have sent an AC-130 gunship from Italy to Benghazi in two hours if the unfolding situation there warranted it given the intel at the time, but then the intial attack was over in two hours. What happened six hours later at the annex might well have been brought on by the actions of those at the annex. Your monday-morning quarterbacking is exactly that, nothing more. Condi Rice Pours Cold Water On ‘Benghazi-Gate’ Former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice broke with the majority of her party last night on Fox News, as she tried to hit the brakes on the right wing’s politicization of the recent attack in Libya. RICE: But when things are unfolding very, very quickly, it’s not always easy to know what is really going on on the ground. And to my mind, the really important questions here are about how information was collected. Did the various agencies really coordinate and share intelligence in the way that we had hoped, with the reforms that were made after 9/11? Throughout the interview, Rice highlighted the difficulty that comes in a “fog of war” situation, with multiple stories coming in which need to be processed and verified. Her statements strongly align with the evolution of the Obama administration’s understanding of what happened in Benghazi. If only you would have put as much effort into investigating the Bush administration about 9/11 or their rush to invade Iraq when the UN inspectors had found no WMD's, as this, then the whole country nee the world would be a much better place. We warned you about the neo-con Bush in 2000 and again in 2004 but you didn't listen. We have warned you about Willtard, but again you won't listen.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1351355263288</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:27:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351355605419-22</Id><Topic><Title>Obamer Is Like Jeff Spicoli</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351350397555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 11:06:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Harry - Everyone that I know that has worked with the president, and I know several, were not impressed with his knowledge base.

Limbaugh set the table several days before the inauguration by telling his audience: So I'm thinking of replying to the guy, "Okay, I'll send you a response, but I don't need 400 words, I need four: I hope he fails." (interruption) What are you laughing at? See, here's the point. Everybody thinks it's outrageous to say. Look, even my staff, "Oh, you can't do that." Why not? Why is it any different, what's new, what is unfair about my saying I hope liberalism fails? Liberalism is our problem. Liberalism is what's gotten us dangerously close to the precipice here. Why do I want more of it? I don't care what the Drive-By story is. I would be honored if the Drive-By Media headlined me all day long: "Limbaugh: I Hope Obama Fails." Somebody's gotta say it. The prevailing worry here was that America faced a worsening crisis, with a failing economy and a financial meltdown, and if liberal policies succeeded in resolving the crisis, liberalism would become further entrenched as the best means of stewarding the economy. Subsequently, if the president's center-left policies succeeded, he'd be re-elected and the Republicans would have to wait until 2016 for another stab at the White House. The only way to prevent this eventuality was to stonewall the president's legislative agenda. All of it. Such an objective is nearly unprecedented. Usually an opposition party is driven to occasionally work with the majority party on the off-chance the majority party's legislation succeeds. This way, the opposition party can claim partial credit for the achievement. Not this time. Instead, the Republicans banked on their mighty bumper-sticker marketeering machine whereby, irrespective of Democratic successes, the Republicans would simply tell voters that those successes were actually failures and that it was President Obama who stubbornly refused to reach across the aisle. Up is down, white is black. Opposite Day politics. With the execution of this "everything has failed" strategy, they were freed up to vote against everything that came down the pike. And so the Republicans proceeded to rack up the highest number of filibusters in American history. During the president's first two years in office, the 111th Congress, there were 137 cloture motions filed to end Republican filibusters. During the president's second two years, the 112th Congress, there were 109 motions filed to end Republican filibusters and we still have a few more months to go. 246 total cloture motions. Compare this to George W. Bush's first term when there were a total of 133 cloture motions filed. Not even a handful of "sensible" Republicans had the guts to break ranks and vote with the Democrats. Meanwhile, on the House side, the Republican majority has voted in near-lockstep against almost everything. What bills have the Republicans filibustered? To name a few: H.R. 12 - Paycheck Fairness Act H.R. 448 -- Elder Abuse Victims Act H.R. 466 - Wounded Veteran Job Security Act H.R. 515 - Radioactive Import Deterrence Act H.R. 549 -- National Bombing Prevention Act H.R. 577 - Vision Care for Kids Act H.R. 626 - Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act H.R. 1029 - Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act H.R. 1168 -- Veterans Retraining Act H.R. 1171 - Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program Reauthorization H.R. 1293 -- Disabled Veterans Home Improvement and Structural Alteration Grant Increase Act H.R. 1429 -- Stop AIDS in Prison Act H.R.5281 -- DREAM Act S.3985 -- Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act S.3816 -- Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act S.3369 -- A bill to provide for additional disclosure requirements for corporations, labor organizations, Super PACs and other entities S.2237 -- Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act S.2343 -- Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act S.1660 -- American Jobs Act of 2011 S.3457 -- Veterans Jobs Corps Act What else? Here's an astonishing one. The Republicans filibustered the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act -- basically, healthcare for 9/11 heroes. Every Republican senator voted to filibuster this bill. I suppose the Republicans are only interested in 9/11 heroes when they're used as political props. On the House side, every single Republican, including Paul Ryan, voted against the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act, which forces Congress to pay for new legislation through either budget cuts or revenue increases. You'd think that by helping to pass these bills, Republicans could boast a solid record on fiscal responsibility, job creation, veterans affairs, anti-terrorism, senior citizens and, hell, 9/11 workers. Instead, they blocked all of it. Jobs for military veterans, tax cuts for small businesses -- you name it. Why? So President Obama and the Democrats could be accused of failure. And it's working. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell famously told the National Journal, "The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president." Not economic growth, jobs, healthcare or military strength. A failed Obama presidency was the primary -- and I would argue the only goal of the last two Republican congresses. The Romney campaign is busily playing the endgame on this strategy by projecting Republican obstructionism onto the president and accusing him of refusing to work with Congress, even though the president and the Democrats have dished out heaping piles of legislation that Republicans could reasonably get behind. Not only that, but the president has gone out of his way to incorporate Republican ideas into his major agenda items. The individual mandate is a Republican idea devised and supported by people like Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and Chuck Grassley. The Affordable Care Act is more or less modeled after Mitt Romney's healthcare law in Massachusetts. Many marquee aspects of the ACA ("Obamacare") were jettisoned in an effort to gain Republican votes, including the public option. Cap-and-trade is a Republican idea. The president even sided with Republicans on extending the Bush tax cuts -- a move that angered many liberals, along with the signing of the NDAA. But if you take Romney's word for it, the president is a lazy, do-nothing chief executive who's been stonewalling the Republicans. Not the other way around. I'm not sure how he doesn't pull a muscle or dislocate a shoulder by twisting himself into a pretzel like this, but it's an amazing feat of through-the-looking-glass deception. The reason Romney was able to get anything done in Massachusetts was because the Democrats in the state legislature weren't anywhere near as obstructionist as today's congressional Republicans. And, if he's elected, the only way Romney will be able to pursue his agenda is if the Democrats are less motivated to obstruct and filibuster than the Republicans.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1351355723666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:35:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351355776389-24</Id><Topic><Title>Obamer Is Like Jeff Spicoli</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351350397555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 11:06:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I should have qualified that last sentence and said that I've never witnessed anything like this in the United States because I have witnessed something like this in the Soviet Union.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351355776389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:36:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351355990285-25</Id><Topic><Title>what the spectre gunship could have done</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351305950401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:45:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fats, "Yes, theoretically, we could have sent an AC-130 gunship from Italy to Benghazi in two hours if the unfolding situation there warranted it given the intel at the time, but then the intial attack was over in two hours. What happened six hours later at the annex might well have been brought on by the actions of those at the annex." Let me get this straight, because it is presumed that Ambassador Stevens is "toast" within the first two hours, what happened at the Annex did not merit support from an AC-130? The brain that is being rotted is the one that believes what Obama says. Some are given over to believing his "riddles" and "dark sentences"; others are not. As to Rice opining about a "fog of war" does not justify doing NOTHING. And this DO NOTHING (GOOD) President has to go.

Then screw your head on correctly, not just right. Obama: "What's true is that the intelligence was coming in and evolving as more information came up. "And what is true," he continued, "...This is something that the American people can take to the bank—is that my administration plays this stuff straight. We don't play politics when it comes to American national security," the president said. "As information came in we gave it to the American people. And as we got new information, we gave that to the American people." The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Obama's presidential daily brief from the CIA tied the assault to a spontaneous protest linked to the video—despite intelligence contradicting that scenario. The attacks on the consulate and hours later on the annex were over before an AC-130 gunship could have got there from italy, or by additional security forces from Tripoli. Rmoney was also getting intelligence briefings. So what did he know and when? Rmoney certainly understood that when our diplomats are still under fire—not just in Benghazi but around the world, in Cairo, in Pakistan, etc.—that if you aspire to be commander in chief you don't release a political press release, Obama said. "You don't have a political press conference that tries to take advantage of that opportunity that is so reckless that even members of your own party criticize you for it." 2:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (8:30 p.m. Benghazi time): U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens steps outside the consulate to say goodbye to a Turkish diplomat. (“Everything is calm at 8:30,” a State Department official would later say at an Oct. 9 background briefing for reporters. “There’s nothing unusual. There has been nothing unusual during the day at all outside.”) 3 p.m.: Ambassador Stevens retires to his bedroom for the evening. (See Oct. 9 briefing.) Approximately 3:40 p.m. A security agent at the Benghazi compound hears “loud noises” coming from the front gate and “gunfire and an explosion.” A senior State Department official at the Oct. 9 briefing says that “the camera on the main gate reveals a large number of people – a large number of men, armed men, flowing into the compound.” About 4 p.m.: This is the approximate time of attack that was given to reporters at a Sept. 12 State Department background briefing. An administration official identified only as “senior administration official one” provides an official timeline of events at the consulate, but only from the time of the attack — not prior to the attack. The official says, “The compound where our office is in Benghazi began taking fire from unidentified Libyan extremists.” (Six of the next seven entries in this timeline — through 8:30 p.m. EDT — all come from the Sept. 12 briefing. The exception being the 6:07 p.m. entry, which comes from Reuters.) About 4:15 p.m.: “The attackers gained access to the compound and began firing into the main building, setting it on fire. The Libyan guard force and our mission security personnel responded. At that time, there were three people inside the building: Ambassador Stevens, one of our regional security officers, and Information Management Officer Sean Smith.” Between 4:15 p.m.-4:45 p.m.: Sean Smith is found dead. About 4:45 p.m.: “U.S. security personnel assigned to the mission annex tried to regain the main building, but that group also took heavy fire and had to return to the mission annex.” About 5:20 p.m.: “U.S. and Libyan security personnel … regain the main building and they were able to secure it.” Around 6 p.m.: “The mission annex then came under fire itself at around 6 o’clock in the evening our time, and that continued for about two hours. It was during that time that two additional U.S. personnel were killed and two more were wounded during that ongoing attack.” 6:07 p.m.: The State Department’s Operations Center sends an email to the White House, Pentagon, FBI and other government agencies that said Ansar al-Sharia has claimed credit for the attack on its Facebook and Twitter accounts. (The existence of the email was not disclosed until Reuters reported it on Oct. 24.) About 8:30 p.m.: “Libyan security forces were able to assist us in regaining control of the situation. At some point in all of this – and frankly, we do not know when – we believe that Ambassador Stevens got out of the building and was taken to a hospital in Benghazi. We do not have any information what his condition was at that time. His body was later returned to U.S. personnel at the Benghazi airport.” About 10:00 p.m.: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issues a statement confirming that one State official was killed in an attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Her statement, which MSNBC posted at 10:32 p.m., made reference to the anti-Muslim video.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1351356981946</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:56:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351357053747-28</Id><Topic><Title>Early Voting - Romney getting waxed in Iowa, Wisconsin &amp; Ohio</Title><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1351343262154</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 09:07:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep it up - don't need another Republican led disaster</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1351357053747</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:57:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351357085258-29</Id><Topic><Title>Early Voting - Romney getting waxed in Iowa, Wisconsin &amp; Ohio</Title><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1351343262154</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 09:07:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Vulture /Voucher ticket has flat-lined and starting to recede.

Even if someone decided at the very first gunshot on our consulate in Beghazi to send an AC-130 gunship, the attack there would have already been over by the time it got there. That is even disounting the time it would take to get a crew and gunship off the ground. What was the gunship supposed to do then, just circle around for awhile, hours, until something might have happened, in your imaginary and theoretical world? Remember the response time on 9/11 by the inept and corrupt republicon adminitration on 9/11 when the facts were much more clear,?

Even if it was too late in the end? Now, it may be that readying an AC-130 is a two day event or maybe it is not. Probably not as ready as fighter jets but very unlikely that it is not days, but hours. Aren't they running misions all the time in Afghanistan? On non-specific surveliance, tracking, and targeting missions? The AC-130 was used to destablize Libya. The crews are theoretically supposed to be at the ready - all the time. That is their job. Like all military units. On 9-11? Certainly, fighter jets which are able to be scrambled in minutes could have been there in one hour. And nothing was done. Nothing.

The White House (at least the State Department) was following it in real time (testimony to the Congress by the State Department) 3. There was confusion (evidenced by conflicting White House statements over the ensuing weeks) 4. Nothing was done by virtue of preparation or reaction to the event (at least by definition) There, no opinions, no conclusions.

Yes and no. I refer you back to the so-called "good" thief on the cross with Jesus. The one that believed. Spent perhaps his entire life living a raucous and vile life. Jesus said he (the one that believed) would be with Him in paradise that very day - because the thief recognized that he was a sinner, that Jesus was Lord, and believed in His resurrection (Romans 10:9,10). Jesus did not say anything to the one that mocked Him. But, clearly, the Bible teaches us that we are saved by faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8,9). That is how it works. But the danger for a person that thinks he can ignore salvation and belief in Jesus up until his end of life ignores the truth of the uncertainty of his mind and safety at that time.

Francis “Bing” West, who served as an assistant secretary of defense under President Ronald Reagan, told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren that the president’s explanation about his actions when the U.S. mission in Benghazi was attacked should be easily verifiable. “President Obama today said that he gave an order to everyone while the attack was going on to do everything they could to secure the personnel,” West said. “Now that’s really big because that means that those who were turning down [former Navy SEAL] Ty Woods when he was asking for the help were going against the orders of the president of the United States.” Woods was one of four Americans killed in the Libya assault. Obama on Friday wouldn’t answer directly whether pleas for help on the ground were denied during the attack, telling KUSA-TV, “the minute I found out what was happening, I gave three very clear directives. Number one, make sure that we are securing our personnel and doing whatever we need to.” “A chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff doesn’t take an order from the president when he says ‘do everything’ and not put that in writing and send it out to the chain of command,” West said. “If that actually happened the way President Obama today said it happened, there’s a paper trail and I think people reasonably enough can say, ‘well can we see the order?’ because hundreds of others supposedly saw this order.” “But if there is no order then people have to ask some very basic questions, ‘what the heck happened?’” he said. ++ So the disaster in chief now has no way out except to continue an ' investigation" to find the guily party- which should only take say four or five years- meanwhile he will remove all mirrors from the whitehouse- and hunt down all the whistleblowers who WILL eventually surface. Chairman Issa said the ONLY credible info they have received is from said whistleblowers - sort of like fast and furious ..</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351384937513</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 20:42:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351386157619-70</Id><Topic><Title>what the spectre gunship could have done</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351305950401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:45:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>search on shocking-findings-from-benghazi maybe the former head of cia ben laden unit has credibility ?? probably not on this board</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351386157619</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 21:02:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351389217461-71</Id><Topic><Title>what the spectre gunship could have done</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351305950401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:45:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don, you're starting to sound like Spartapussy.
