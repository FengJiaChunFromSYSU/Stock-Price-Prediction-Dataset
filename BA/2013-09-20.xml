Kennedy assassinated as the first presidential victim of the emerging “New World Order” championed by former CIA directors Allen Dulles and George H. W. Bush? Armed with recently declassified documents, New York Times bestselling author Jerome Corsi tackles that question in “Who Really Killed Kennedy” as the 50th anniversary of the assassination approaches. Corsi points out Kennedy had refused to authorize the Navy to launch a military strike from an aircraft carrier to save the faltering U.S.-backed invasion of Cuba known as the Bay of Pigs attack. Kennedy also refused to authorize the use of U.S. military force in Laos and, just before he was assassinated, he had decided to pull out of Vietnam. Hot war in Vietnam On Sept. 2, 1963, Labor Day, at Hyannis Port, Mass., JFK had a relaxed interview outdoors with CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite, who that sunny day was inaugurating a new television news program. About midway into the interview, Cronkite asked about Vietnam: “Mr. President, the only hot war we’ve got running at the moment is of course the one in Vietnam, and we have our difficulties there, quite obviously.” Kennedy answered directly, careful to set the stage for explaining why a military withdrawal from Vietnam was beginning to make sense to him. “I don’t think that unless a greater effort is made by the government [of South Vietnam] to win popular support that the war can be won out there,” Kennedy explained. “In the final analysis, it is their war. They are the ones who have to win it or lose it. We can’t help them, we can give them equipment, we can send our men out there as advisers, but they have to win it, the people of Vietnam, against the communists.” In the interview, notes Corsi, Kennedy distanced himself from saying the U.S. should withdraw from Vietnam, insisting it would “be a great mistake.”</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379678475081</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 08:01:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379680977414-14</Id><Title>Boeing and GE Capital finaliza $2.9 Billion dollar award for 10 787-10 Dreamliners</Title><Msg>This firms up a deal started in June.

The company is also in discussions for hundreds more A320neos with potential Chinese buyers, Chen was quoted as saying. An Airbus spokesman confirmed the remarks.

The facts indicate that Captain Obonzo has navigated the USS Economy onto the rocks and he is the worst captain ever. Only a mutiny can return our bounty now. Economy: Household incomes are still down 4.4% since the recession ended four years ago. Meanwhile, the unemployment picture may be even worse than we think. The Obama "recovery" continues to impress. According to a report released this week by Sentier Research, the inflation-adjusted median household income remains $2,380 below where it stood when the Obama "recovery" officially started in June 2009 — a drop of 4.4%. Sentier's monthly data, derived from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, show that incomes fell more in the year after the recovery started than it did during the recession itself. And household incomes have basically flat-lined ever since. "As the unemployment rate and the duration of unemployment remained high," the authors note, "median annual household income continued its decline." The picture gets even grimmer the deeper you dive into the data. The most vulnerable groups — blacks, Hispanics, female-headed families and the young — have fared far worse under Obama than everyone else. Black households' median income has plunged 11% since the "recovery" started. Hispanic households are off 4.5%. For single moms, median household income dropped 7.5%. For those households with three or more children, it fell even more — 9.2%. When Sentier broke its data down, every age group lost ground — except senior citizens. Those aged 65 to 74 saw median income climb 5.1% from June 2009 to June 2013. Those 75 and older enjoyed a 2.1% gain. Creating an economy where only retirees collecting government checks are getting ahead is not exactly a recipe for increasing prosperity.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1379694498570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 12:28:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379694922051-51</Id><Topic><Title>Finally Represented</Title><Username>censored53</Username><Timestamp>1379693589352</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 12:13:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It law passed by corrupt sources who lied to the public and presented false evidence.

JJOVAZ , the 737 wires come to Boeing from a vendor or are made in a Boeing wire shop, and are covered with insulation and wire bundle protective insulation in and along the wire run. so in many cases , inspection can not pick up any flaw until the wires are installed and a functional test is done. JJOVAZ by broad brushing Boeing workers as saboteurs after the investigation was completed without any culprit found or charged , you have slapped every past, present and future Boeing worker in the face.

(CNN) - Boeing Co. inspectors have discovered intentional wire damage on at least seven Boeing 737s at a company assembly plant in Renton, Wash., the company confirmed to CNN Thursday. The damage was found during routine service testing over the past two weeks. Boeing says it notified the FAA of the sabotage Tuesday. The company also said an additional three aircraft also may have had sabotaged wiring, but evidence is not conclusive. A 737 jet is assembled at the Boeing plant in Renton, Wash. The company is investigating sabotage of wiring on 7 jets under construction there. There are no suspects at this time. "No airplane is delivered until it has met rigorous testing starting with Boeing, the FAA, and the airlines," spokesman Sandy Angers told CNN. "The fact that we found the damaged wires proves our quality system works." The Federal Aviation Administration said it is looking into the matter, but could not elaborate on details. The agency recently referred the case to the FBI, which is the only law enforcement agency working on the case. The FBI did not comment on possible suspects or motives, saying only it has just started investigating.�� Boeing (BA: down $0.22 to $65.88, Research, Estimates) employs about 12,000 people at the Renton plant, where the narrow-body 737 jet is assembled along with the 757, another narrow-body jet, and the Boeing business jet. It makes about 24 of the 737 jets a month. The world's largest aircraft manufacturer announced in March that some of the 757 assembly work now done in the Renton plant would be shifted to its plant in Wichita, Kan., although the fuselages of the planes will still be shipped by rail from Wichita back to Renton for final assembly.</Msg><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1379699750659</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 13:55:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379701635976-63</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing status compared to Airbus and tesla Airbus up 61% year to date tesla up 445%, Boeing up 58%</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1379690188764</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 11:16:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More bad math (misinformation?) from you know who.

They're helping President Obama make the case that they were the problem all along. Republican leaders, under threat from their most conservative members, have offered a plan to keep the government operating through December that is conditioned on defunding Obama's unpopular health care plan. The worry among a large group of Republicans is that the gambit will lead to a government shutdown, which will be a political disaster for the party, weaken their leverage in the budget fights, and upend the worthy goal of dismantling Obamacare. “People are not going to blame the president for shutting down the government," says Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. "The White House and Democrats have the upper hand here." Johnson is no squish. He was elected in 2010 by running against Obamacare. He even spent millions of his own dollars to do it. Johnson is also hardly an Obama administration pal. He has had public confrontations with Hillary Clinton and John Kerry when they’ve come before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He's not alone in thinking the GOP is making a colossal mistake. Conservative Sens. Tom Coburn, Richard Burr, and Kelly Ayotte also think it is a foolhardy idea.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1379707421629</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 16:03:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379707940155-76</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Committing Suicide !!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1379707421629</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 16:03:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Repugs are playing 11-dimensional chess and you kneejerk goose-steppers are marching right where they want you.</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1379707940155</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 16:12:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379711983002-77</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing status compared to Airbus and tesla Airbus up 61% year to date tesla up 445%, Boeing up 58%</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1379690188764</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 11:16:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>since he won't explain the reason for the calculations in his post, go to U-Tube and watch the 14 second video title .Pee Wee Herman: "I meant to do that!" .</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1379711983002</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 17:19:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379712836385-78</Id><Topic><Title>Imagine, a Christian who lives like... well, Jesus</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1379681179677</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 08:46:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Were you really saying much there?

"For just as through the disobedience of the one man [Adam] the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man [Jesus] the many will be made righteous." (Romans 5:19) While Jesus was God made flesh as a man, He did not sin, even though He was tempted in ways above all others (by Satan). Being perfect and without sin, which was never achieved by any other human (Romans 3:23), Jesus was the only sacrifice that would satisfy as a prescription for all of our sins. This is what is described by the Apostle Paul as "imputed righteousness" by faith - i.e., "counted as being righteous" by believing in what Jesus did for us (read Romans, chapter 4).</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1379716735913</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 18:38:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379717486516-86</Id><Topic><Title>O'Reilly Blasts GOP Effort To Defund Obamacare As 'Fanaticism'</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1379714033857</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 17:53:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GOP wins!

While you custerisus if you have Boeing stock, at best is a 54% return year to date, and Airbus has 60% return So no math skills needed . Use cnn money stock chart , 200 k I also only gave my stock comparable for two years so the comparison was equal , not misinformation as the bigot, spartacus99991 forgets to mention. Any way your spam is not wanted Remember custerisus,, no one, and I mean no one, has any interest in your crappola. When are you going to get it? So, just go away!! Your meaningless drivel is just taking up bandwidth. I don't believe a word you have said about your issue with math skill being unacceptable for my MBA at Gonzaga. . People who are stock traders don't spend all their time on a message board, so if I said two or three years the pattern and the percentage actually get better for my TSLA and Airbus compared to Boeing over 3 years. I am out enjoying the fruits of my success. And, yes, it is quite obvious that you are a bigot, from the inability to make any point other than a tormentor criticism over two or three years It actually worked better for Boeing on a two year comparison than a 3 year comparison . Custerisus , so you are so angry with me that you have fallen into the bigot definition. . Pathetic!! So, .
