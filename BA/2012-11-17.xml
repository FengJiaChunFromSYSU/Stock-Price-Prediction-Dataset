NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Hostess Brands -- the maker of such iconic baked goods as Twinkies, Drake's Devil Dogs and Wonder Bread -- announced Friday that it is asking a federal bankruptcy court for permission to close its operations, blaming a strike by bakers protesting a new contract imposed on them. Hostess' nearly 18,500 workers will lose their jobs as the company shuts 33 bakeries and 565 distribution centers nationwide, as well as 570 outlet stores. The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union represents about 5,000 Hostess employees. "We deeply regret the necessity of today's decision, but we do not have the financial resources to weather an extended nationwide strike," said CEO Gregory Rayburn in a statement.

Until recently, Patty Murray's name hasn't really rung out inside the Beltway but over the past twelve months her visible clout has increased enormously. She took over the seemingly thankless job of running the DSCC, she steered the Democratic effort on the "supercommittee," she then triumphed in the November Senate elections and now is poised to take the gavel and chair the Budget Committee now that Kent Conrad's retired. *****At any rate, back in July she made some wise remarks at the Brookings Institution (PDF) about the extent to which this will all get easier if we go over the fiscal cliff first: ****** I also think many Republicans are starting to realize something very important. On January 1st if we have not gotten a deal, Grover Norquist and his pledge are no longer relevant to this conversation. A name, by the way, that I heard repeatedly by Republicans over and over in the Super Committee will no longer be a part of this debate. We will have a new fiscal and political reality. If the Bush tax cuts expire, every proposal will be a tax cut proposal, and the pledge will no longer keep Republicans boxed in and unable to compromise. If middle class families start seeing some money coming out of their paychecks next year, are Republicans really going to stand up and fight for new tax cuts for the rich? Are they going to continue opposing the Democrat’s middle class tax cut once the slate is wiped clean?</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1353187191705</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 16:19:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353187474374-18</Id><Topic><Title>Why Rove Failed to Deliver Ohio on Election Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_72</Username><Timestamp>1353116536134</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 20:42:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rove is toast.

This is stunningly tone deaf, to say the least. I'm sure all these newly SPEEA represented employees are absolutely furious at being handed thousands of dollars in back pay, with interest. ********************************************************************************** About 800 current and former Boeing employees, most of them in California, are to receive cash settlements from Boeing to resolve a decade-long dispute about representation of workers by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), at two Air Force bases there. After years of litigation, Arbitrator Michael Beck on Nov. 1 ruled largely in favor of the union. On Thursday, SPEEA spokesman Bill Dugovich traveled to Southern California to meet with the workers. In his award, Beck said Boeing violated the 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008 collective bargaining agreements by refusing to recognize SPEEA as the exclusive representative of Boeing employees assigned to Edwards Air Force Base in Edwards and Palmdale, Calif. The arbitrator ordered Boeing to “make whole” all employees “injured as a result of the violations,” and ordered the company to “‘make whole the union for lost dues and fees.” The payments are to include interest. The issue arose during the merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, and had to do with Boeing declining to recognize union membership for some workers who came into the programs as part of the merger. “Some of these people will receive a substantial check from Boeing, of tens of thousands of dollars,” Dugovich emailed. “The size of “make whole” awards will vary greatly from employee to employee depending on a how long they were here and what benefits were in place and more.” In a statement, Boeing said: "Boeing is disappointed by the arbitrator’s decision which in effect means Palmdale/EAFB employees will be forced to join SPEEA without having the opportunity to vote on whether or not they want to be a part of a labor union. The company is committed to employee self-determination; we believe that every employee should have the right to determine whether they will be represented by a union and not have that decision made for them by a third party."
