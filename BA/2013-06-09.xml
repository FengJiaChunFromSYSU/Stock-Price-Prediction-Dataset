Every old gas sucking plane is going down the sheeter. If the airlines want to stay in business they need to buy the new fuel efficient models. The airlines no longer have a choice. Boeing is advancing their fuel efficiency in every model and competitive in every airline deal. Airbus won't have a REAL competitor against the 777 until 2017.

It's really very simple to explain. The twisted values of the left are actually the product of the evil controlling them, and when evil encounters good, evil becomes mindlessly enraged. This is not a politically correct explaination. Unfortunately it's absolutely true. Even some on the left understand this, but they are facinated by power and control and have no moral compass to direct them. Of course some on the right also have this same problem.

He turned toward peace. When the enemy is seen as human, everything changes. This conversion locked Kennedy into a death spiral with the military industrial complex and the CIA. They now considered JFK a traitor because he reached out to Khrushchev in peace, and because the CIA and the military industrial complex were fanatically committed to what General Curtis E. LeMay described as, “Pax Atomica,” the annihilation of America’s enemies through nuclear war. Kennedy showcased his new vision in June 1963 during a speech at American University in Washington, D.C., by advocating the absolute necessity for nations to choose peace. “What kind of peace do I mean?” asked Kennedy. “Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living …” He spoke of his intentions to establish a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and he acknowledged the Russian people wanted peace as much as the American people. It was this speech, Mr. Douglass says, that prompted “The Unspeakable” in the form of people within the U.S. inttelligence and the military industrial complex to act.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1370797241357</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 13:00:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370797756757-44</Id><Topic><Title>Bilderberg (the group that does not exist) Meeting in UK to decide Worlds fate</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1370794769541</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 12:19:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Bilderberg Group is not all that shadowy and secretive, Sparty boy.
