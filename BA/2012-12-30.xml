With the deadline for negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff looming in the backdrop, the president took to NBC's "Meet the Press" to defend his efforts to find common ground. He noted that he had moved off his initial demands for revenue (once $1.6 trillion, now $1.2 trillion), agreed to entitlement reforms (reduced Social Security benefits) and already signed hefty spending cuts ($1 trillion as part of the Budget Control Act in 2011). For all that, he added, he was still waiting for Republicans to come closer to halfway. "We have been talking to the Republicans ever since the election was over. They have had trouble saying yes to a number of repeated offers," said the president, according to an advance transcript of the interview. He added later, "[S]o far, at least, Congress has not been able to get this stuff done. Not because Democrats in Congress don't want to go ahead and cooperate, but because I think it's been very hard for Speaker Boehner and Republican Leader McConnell to accept the fact that taxes on the wealthiest Americans should go up a little bit, as part of an overall deficit reduction package." The tone was tougher than usual from the president. In the past, he's been hesitant to directly rebuke congressional Republicans, choosing instead to attack the legislative body as a whole. But the last few weeks of negotiations have clearly frustrated both him and his staff. White House aides were particularly piqued at Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) for shelving negotiations over a larger fiscal cliff deal in pursuit of a tax-rate-only option. That ended the legislative progress in the House and forced the Senate to pick up talks. With just days before tax rates rise on all income levels and $1 trillion in decadelong spending cuts go into effect, Senate leaders met on Saturday to find a way through the impasse. One knowledgeable aide said a deal didn’t look likely as of Saturday afternoon. A Republican aide said it would be impossible to know for sure until Sunday afternoon, when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will brief their respective caucuses. Even as they talked, preparations were being made to manage the public relations fallout over failure to meet the deadline. Part of that involved the president hitting the Sunday talk show circuit, where he urged the press not to resort to false equivalencies when assigning blame. The only thing I would caution against, David, is I think this notion of, "Well, both sides are just kind of unwilling to cooperate." And that's just not true. I mean if you look at the facts, what you have is a situation here where the Democratic Party, warts and all, and certainly me, warts and all, have consistently done our best to try to put country first. And to try to work with everybody involved to make sure that we've got an economy [that] grows. Make sure that it works for everybody. Make sure that we're keeping the country safe. And does the Democratic Party still have some knee-jerk ideological positions and are there some folks in the Democratic Party who sometimes aren't reasonable? Of course. That's true of every political party. But generally if you look at how I've tried to govern over the last four years and how I'll continue to try to govern, I'm not driven by some ideological agenda. I am a pretty practical guy. And I just want to make sure that things work. And one of the nice things about never having another election again, I will never campaign again, is I think you can rest assured that all I care about is making sure that I leave behind an America that is stronger, more prosperous, more stable, more secure than it was when I came into office.</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1356891338381</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 13:15:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356892408197-14</Id><Topic><Title>*****IMAGINE*****</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356878544054</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 09:42:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Seven Aims of the SLA, DeFreeze/Cinque explained the significance of the SLA's seven-headed cobra symbol: "The emblem of the Symbionese Liberation Army is 170,000 years old, and is one of the first symbols used by people to signify God and life." Later on in the manuscript he says, "The seven memberships of our federation are men and women who are black, brown, yellow, red, white, young and old." I guess that being both yellow and old gets you a double membership. Finally, in The Seven Principles of the SLA, DeFreeze gives the meaning of each head in Swahili, Spanish, and English.

(Rehired employees--other than rehired annuitants--are treated like new employees if their break-in-service was more than a year.) 2) Employees of the legislative branch who were not participating in the CSRS system were mandatorily covered, regardless of when their service began. Those who were in the CSRS system were given the same one-time choice as employees in the executive and judicial branches. 3) All federal employees hired on or after January 1, 1984 are mandatorily covered under Social Security--the CSRS system is not an option for them. So there are still some Federal employees, those first hired prior to January 1984, who are not participants in the Social Security system. All other Federal government employees participate in Social Security like everyone else.</Msg><Username>opiespa</Username><Timestamp>1356895099322</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 14:18:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356895119191-18</Id><Topic><Title>Box-cutters Responsible for 9-11...Lets ban all Boxcutters</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356745924930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 20:52:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who mfg'd the 'guns'...??? ?</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1356895119191</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 14:18:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356895753379-19</Id><Topic><Title>Government Dependents Outnumber Those With Private Sector Jobs In 11 U.S. States</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356841615041</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 23:26:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For example, the number of Americans on food stamps grew from about 17 million in 2000 to more than 47 million today.

Pelosi, John Kerry Heinz, the Clintons, the Kennedys, the Obamas, Michael Moore, the Bidens, AlGore, numerous Hollywood celebs, etc., etc., etc. all have WAY too much money, yet they make so much of it trying to sucker the middle class and the poor into thinking the rich are bad people. If being rich is so bad, then Pelosi, John Kerry Heinz, the Clintons, the Kennedys, the Obamas, Michael Moore, the Bidens, AlGore, and numerous Hollywood celebs should give their money to the poor and become part of the middle class. Then they would become more believable.
