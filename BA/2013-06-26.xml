"Today, about 40% of America's carbon pollution comes from power plants. But there are no federal limits to the amount of carbon pollution those plants can pump into our air… for free.

Bad management and a lack of oversight is being blamed for the transactions. We identified almost $4,000 in improper decorative and give-away items that were approved through the required IRS process. When these improper transactions were presented to IRS management, they did not concur with our assessment that these items were inappropriate. The IRS does not have an oversight process currently in place to identify potentially inappropriate items purchased, such as items purchased for personal use or cardholders who may be abusing the purchase card. This represents a control weakness because it is the CCS Branch’s functional responsibility to identify and refer instances of inappropriate use. And how did IRS employees get away with this? One woman made 38 transactions totaling $2,655 for what appeared to be personal purchases covered up with fake receipts. Taxpayers paid for her purchases of diet pills, romance novels, steaks and a smartphone, which the report said were falsely categorized as "reference books and office supplies." And the government credit cards of two other employees, one of them still with the IRS, bought pornography online, the inspector general said. Both of them reported that their cards had been stolen or compromised, which the report said it hadn't been able to verify or discredit — although it noted that one of the cardholders had reported at least five cards as having been lost, stolen or counterfeited, something the report said the IRS might want to consider a red flag in the future. The House Oversight Committee is holding a hearing today on Capitol Hill about the improper relationship between the IRS and Strong Castle, Inc. Strong Castle received help landing sweetheart contracts and deals from someone inside the IRS.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1372250170145</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:36:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372250473244-21</Id><Title>Fascist Occupier Continues Assualt on Military</Title><Msg>"The Army announced a massive restructuring of its force Tuesday, slashing 12 combat brigades and affecting military communities from Georgia to Washington state, as it prepares to cut 80,000 active-duty soldiers from its ranks over the next four years.

The move will reduce the number of brigades from 45 to 33 and cut about 17,300 active-duty personnel in the United States and roughly 11,700 from Germany. Thousands of other jobs across the service in units that support the brigades also will be cut. Most soldiers in deactivated brigades will be transferred to other units.

Obama Sends U.S. Troops to Prop Up Morsi By Arnold Ahlert (Bio and Archives) Wednesday, June 26, 2013 In yet another remarkable display of Obama’s determination to secure the Middle East for Islamofascists, 400 U.S. troops will reportedly be deployed to Egypt to augment the police force of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. They will be part of a 13-country force stationed in Egypt in anticipation of protests, scheduled for June 30th, calling for the removal of Morsi. Curiously, whereas Obama readily threw former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak under the bus in 2011, the White House is now eager to defend the regime of Morsi, who, like his Muslim Brotherhood sponsors, is well on his way to imposing the Saudi Arabian model of governance on Egypt.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372250827554</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:47:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372252421565-24</Id><Title>June deliveries update</Title><Msg>Looks like another good month for deliveries.

They believe in strong private property right laws and believe the exercise of one's rights should not come at the expense of another person's rights. They believe the "greater good" can only be achieved when individuals are free to pursue their own good in their own way, so long as they do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it." Left wingers are collectivists who think the greater good is whatever benefits the majority of people and that the "greater good" should trump individual rights. They tend to believe that all private property rights should be used in ways that contribute to the greater good. They believe it's perfectly alright to use the force of government to confiscate and distribute or redistribute private property in an effort to achieve a more balanced equality of property ownership and that this redistribution will contribute to the "greater good." To them it is logical for the exercise of one person's individual's rights to come at the expense of another person's individual rights. .</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1372252832032</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:20:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372253032253-26</Id><Topic><Title>June deliveries update</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1372252421565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Q1 delivery count was 136.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1372253032253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372253989671-27</Id><Topic><Title>Fascist Occupier Continues Assualt on Military</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372250473244</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:41:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what are you whining about ?</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372253989671</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:39:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372254062090-28</Id><Topic><Title>June deliveries update</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1372252421565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Morning Falmouth, Looks like its hitting the wires as you Posting should be another Good Q$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1372254062090</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:41:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372254257533-29</Id><Topic><Title>NSA Gone Wild</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1372212720992</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 22:12:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he's having a senior moment - he'll back to sleep shortly</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372254257533</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:44:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372254713516-30</Id><Topic><Title>Do Dead People Have a Right to Vote for Democrats?</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1372249347289</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:22:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep they get to vote early- vote often.

Now the name change advocates are turning to the political arena and intimidation. The NCAA has already banned the University of North Dakota from calling its football team the "Fighting Sioux." This is the classic method of busybodies and tyrants; they start out with something trivial or small and then magnify and extend it. If these people are successful in banning the use of Indian names for football teams, you can bet the rent money that won't end their agenda. Our military has a number of fighting aircraft named with what busybodies and tyrants might consider racial slights, such as the Apache, Iroquois, Kiowa, Lakota and Mescalero. We also have military aircraft named after animals, such as the Eagle, Falcon, Raptor, Cobra and Dolphin. The people fighting against the Redskins name might form a coalition with the PETA animal rights kooks to ban the use of animal names. Another example of the strategy of starting out small is that of the tobacco zealots. In 1965, in the name of health, tobacco zealots successfully got Congress to enact the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. A few years later, they were successful in getting a complete smoking ban on planes, and that success emboldened them to seek many other bans. The issue here is not smoking, but tyrant strategy. Suppose that in 1965, the tobacco tyrants demanded that Congress enact a law banning smoking in bars, in workplaces, in restaurants, in apartments, within 25 feet of entrances, in ballparks, on beaches, on sidewalks and in other places. Had they revealed and demanded their full agenda back in 1965, there would have been so much resistance that they wouldn't have gotten anything. By the way, much of their later success was a result of a bogus Environmental Protection Agency study on secondhand smoke. I'd like to hear whether EPA scientists are willing to declare that people can die from secondhand smoke at a beach, on a sidewalk, in a park or within 25 feet of a building. During the legislative and subsequent state ratification debates over the 16th Amendment -- which established the income tax -- the political task of overturning the Constitution's prohibition of such tax was considerably eased by political promises that any income tax levied would fall upon only the wealthiest 3 to 5 percent of the population. Most Americans paid no federal income tax, and those earning $500,000 or more paid only 7 percent. In 1913, only 358,000 Americans filed 1040 forms, compared with today's 140 million. That's the rope-a-dope strategy. To get the votes of the masses, politicians start out small and exploit the politics of envy by promising that only the rich will be taxed. In 1898, Congress imposed a temporary federal excise tax on telephones as a revenue measure during the Spanish-American War. At that time, only the rich owned phones. Soon nearly all Americans owned phones. Both the rich and the poor paid the telephone excise tax. Congress repealed this "temporary" Spanish-American War tax in 2006. Nobel laureate Milton Friedman had it right when he said, "Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program." The Tax Reform Act of 1969, called the alternative minimum tax, was created to raise revenue from 155 "rich" Americans who legally avoided federal income taxes by buying tax-free municipal bonds. Today more than 4 million Americans are hit by the AMT, and most of them hardly qualify as rich. Here's another rope-a-dope just beginning. The National Transportation Safety Board recently recommended that states reduce the allowable blood alcohol content by more than a third -- to 0.05 percent, as opposed to today's 0.08 percent. The NTSB is calling it a recommendation just to test the waters. If the board doesn't see resistance, its next move will be to threaten noncomplying states with a cutoff of highway construction funds. Setting the legal limit at 0.05 percent is not these people's end objective. Their end objective is to outlaw any amount of alcohol in the blood while one is driving.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1372258423846</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:53:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372258447437-43</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Outsourced 787 Oil System to Botswanna Poison Dart and Quick Lube Co.</Title><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1372108948586</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 17:22:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh yes dey did</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1372258447437</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:54:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372258850675-44</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Outsourced 787 Oil System to Botswanna Poison Dart and Quick Lube Co.</Title><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1372108948586</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 17:22:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>low bidder got the work, then they hired engineers.

So with that in mind foulmoutharbor that makes you a Boeing stock salesman , you really don't care about any investor , your attempting to lift a persons money from their account and convince them to invest in Boeing foulmoutharbor, let them decide Airbus is a better stock than boeing to hold , Airbus is better all the way this year and better by over 100% than Boeing over three years that is a fact cnn money, look it up on the stock charts ! Now yesterday the continued more seller than buyer was confirmed go to your stock market account and put up boeing and read there was a huge shortage of buyer for Boeing compared to sellers , when this happens the market maker is required within 15 minutes of the stock market close to make a posting indicating that there is a order imbalance of any thing over 50000, and yesterday for the 4th time in 6 trade days no buyer for boeing stock to cover the greater sellers yesterday it ws 123400 shares . This means any open sell order at the end of the day from 15 minutes to close would most likely be covered by the market makers personal account, so he would fill but at less than yesterdays close if you fored him to cover yoru open sell order at less than market like 85 dollars. per Tom O'Brien boeing stock is "dead on the vine" now and the last time it was 107 was in 2007 it is a dead cat .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372262806736</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:06:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372262968159-69</Id><Title>What does Equality mean to a Liberal?</Title><Msg>Just wondering.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1372262968159</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:09:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372263077761-70</Id><Title>Year target goes up every week, No seller remorse, no more.</Title><Msg>You want to be Jim Crxmer?</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1372263077761</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:11:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372263403130-71</Id><Title>Surprise Shock.....er ho hum....First-Quarter GDP Growth Revised Down...</Title><Msg>U.S. economic growth was more tepid than previously estimated in the first quarter, held back by a moderate pace of consumer spending, weak business investment and declining exports.

Cramer is paid to pimp a stock that is his job . He will say what a great man jim Mcnerney is that is a barker comment , Mcnerney was told to leave GE by Jack Welch and he was hired at Boeing by Lewis Platt who was a temporary CEO, with zero aerospace experience. Boeing needed window-dressing CEO to replace Condit who was shown the door for buying MD and other bad management decisions . Jmes Mcnerney and his plane , the 787 is a failure and all on James Mcnerney. Now , Jim Cramer is paid to say what a great plane the 787 is , not true it is a 4 year late, and counting , over 30 billion dollar over the original SPEEA union offer to build it in house for 5 billion, just like they did with the 777 which was a great plane in its day. But the 787 , cost and constantly making emergency landings and unscheduled stops due to the terrible outsourcing problems . The customer and the flying public have serious issues with the 787, the only reason it is still flying is there is only one competitor, Airbus and their composite A350 is being built right the first time, and not rushed into production. Boeing like the comet is the leader but Airbus like Boeing to BOAC will inherit the majority of the Airplane business. like Airbus stock, Airbus company betters Boeing company , over time now, and for that last decade Airbus is number one and beat Boeing at Paris too. Boeing in business for over 100 years beat by a upstart company in a matter of 30 years by a socialistic company that speaks volumes for how bad the Boeing has been since frank, phil, harry and James got ahold of Boeing .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372263604616</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:20:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372263757520-74</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus up 3% today Boeing not so good less than 1% the trend continues</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372195818816</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 17:30:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You could be up 60% today on RSOL, which I mentioned before, if you truly knew how to day trade but you're just a hack and a loser.</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1372263757520</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:22:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372263861011-75</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing market maker has reported 3 times in five days that he has a order imbalance-he is warning market on close traders</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372159749475</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 07:29:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>update , on the 25th , yesterday the market maker reported that another day of too many sellers to buyers of Boeing stock existed by 123400 " order imbalance" shares within 15 minutes of the stock market close as required by NYSE rules .

I got censored by one climate scientist who apparently didn't want to discuss the scientific impacts and one has been able to offer an answer. At the Washington Post I offered data that showed the reporter to be in error and asked how someone that reports on energy and climate for a living would not know the correct information. He acknowledged I was right and apologized to his readers. Obonzo is making a monkey out of those that are buying into his rhetoric without assessing the cost/benefit aspects of his plan. If we don't look at policy impact in measurable ways and we don't do cost/benefit analysis on Obonzo's plan, we are just accepting a new form of anarchy. At Andy Revkin's Dot Earth blog at the New York Times, Obonzo got hammered by a Yale Professor who pointed out that Obonz's plan would have an insignificant impact on climate and that the speech was all rhetoric. Lastly Joe Manchin a Democrat called Obonzo a flat earther for being unaware of the failed climate models and pause in warming in the last 15 years. Censored, this Obonzo climate charade is going to blow up on the Dems 1) because it will hurt the economy/jobs and 2) because it will anger environmentalists who wanted far more regulation.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372265005532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:43:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372265035177-86</Id><Topic><Title>What does Equality mean to a Liberal?</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1372262968159</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:09:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As your grandpah Willie would say, "if that shoe fits then it must be your shoe" doyeeeeeeeee, dah, dah, er ah, dah, ?????</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1372265035177</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:43:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372265059523-87</Id><Title>alerts on stocks that actually RUN</Title><Msg>Wanted to get started trading and joined their free Text the word service.

Do you mean thermodynamics? Which law is your favorite? Lets start with the Zeroth law of thermodynamics: If two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law defines the notion of temperature. But wait, it gets better: First law of thermodynamics: The law of conservation of energy. Heat and work are forms of energy transfer. Energy is invariably conserved, The flow of heat is a form of energy transfer. In other words, a quantity of heat that flows from a hot body to a cold one to warm it up until equlibrium is reached. How about some physics now dummy: Conservation of mass and energy The concept of mass–energy equivalence connects the concepts of conservation of mass and conservation of energy, which continue to hold separately in any isolated system (one that is closed to loss of any type of energy, including energy associated with loss of matter). Oh, my where is all that heat energy going we eagar humans are producing. Do you suppose the heat is being transfer to the cold? Which would keep you cooler in summer, a white shirt or a dark shirt? Consider this: light-colored objects reflect more solar energy (heat), and stay cooler as a result. In contrast, dark-colored objects absorb more solar energy, becoming warmer. When light from the Sun strikes Earth surface, some of the energy is absorbed as heat and some is reflected back into space. .The fraction of radiation that is reflected back into space is known as albedo. A darker sky decreases the albedo affect. The vast stretches of polar ice covering much of the planet’s top and bottom reflect large amounts of solar radiation falling on the planet’s surface, helping regulate Earth’s temperature. As light is absorbed, the environment is heated, thus intensifying a feedback loop: a warmer planet yields more ice melting and thus an even warmer planet. You figure out man's affect on climate change genius.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1372269254158</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:54:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372269354301-109</Id><Title>Defending Racial Slurs</Title><Msg>Conservative commentator Glenn Beck ran to the defense of celebrity chef Paula Deen's right to use racial slurs without fear of being fired from her lucrative deals with the Food Network, QVC, and others. Deen came under fire after she admitted to using the racial slur on several occasions. Beck claimed her critics were engaging in "McCarthyism" and described Deen's words as "violations of political correctness, nothing more." On his June 24 web show, Beck used the backlash against Deen as a platform to rant about what he believes is the active destruction of Constitutional principles, arguing that attacks on Deen over the content of her speech are symptomatic of the nation's decline. Remarkably, Beck invoked the name of African-American civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. to defend Deen's use of racial slurs and attack the use of public boycotts -- a tactic King and others utilized to great effect during the civil rights movement.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372269354301</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:55:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372269528709-110</Id><Topic><Title>Defending Racial Slurs</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372269354301</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:55:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sounds like she was set up on hearsay by double standard "get rich quick" employee</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372269528709</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:58:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372269587719-111</Id><Topic><Title>"787" IS the next big thing..</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1372265679214</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:54:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is the greatest thing since Al Gore invented information super high way... $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1372269587719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:59:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372269795991-112</Id><Topic><Title>Fascist Occupier Issues New Decree</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372250001019</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:33:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Personally, I like the 2d Law because it shows that the molten steel at Ground Zero could not have have been caused by long heating in the debris pile--because it doesn't matter how long you boil an egg, it will never get hotter than the boiling water.

One week later, yesterday, Julia Gillard was defeated and will not be the Labor Party's PM candidate in the upcoming Australia elections. Julia won the PM election a few years ago promising never to pass a carbon tax . After she was elected she immediately imposed a carbon tax. Now she's out as her opponent vows to kill the carbon tax. Gillard is nuttier than Obonzo and was pushing for an internet ban on any site that criticized her global warming policy. People ultimately see zealots for what they are and get rid of them. Obonzo and the Dems will likely experience the same backlash as Gillard. In the last 6 months, every major country has announced that they will scale back on fighting CO2. Several pulled out of the Kyoto renewal process. Over 1200 new coal plants will be built in India China and Germany by 2017. The loans are approved the deals are done. Obonzo has decided to kill coal just as Australia is on the pathway to kill their carbon tax and expand coal production. I'm sure Australia will be happy to supply India and China with all the coal they want. The US consumption of coal has been in decline due to cheap NG since 2005. In 2005 coal use peaked and produced 2.182Gt of CO2 and has dropped every year since to 1.657Gt in 2012. Obonzo has duped the uninformed in that his goal of reducing CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 17% by 2020, has already been happening long before Obonzo opened his lying yap. We are already 12% lower in 2012 due to market forces and this will continue. Another 5% by 2020 is already a done deal so Obonzo is a non-factor. He just jumped on the bandwagon as it came by. It's all a stunt and only idiots are excited about what he said. Obonzo can only continue to fool the fools, and the # of fooled fools is declining.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372270487183</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:14:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372271079835-118</Id><Topic><Title>COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVISM!

Pierce Brogressives who fell madly for Senator Aqua Buddha who, as we know, stood bravely alone against the forces of a president bent on droning us all into small piles of ashes, are going to have to have a long chat with the fellow now that he's unlimbered himself on the topic of marriage equality. "I think this is the conundrum and gets back to what you were saying in the opening -- whether or not churches should decide this. But it is difficult because if we have no laws on this people take it to one extension further. Does it have to be humans? I dunno, Rand. Is there a comely ruminant that's caught your eye? "You know, I mean, so there really are, the question is what social mores, can some social mores be part of legislation? Historically we did at the state legislative level, we did allow for some social mores to be part of it. Some of them were said to be for health reasons and otherwise, but I'm kind of with you, I see the thousands-of-year tradition of the nucleus of the family unit. I also see that economically, if you just look without any kind of moral periscope and you say, what is it that is the leading cause of poverty in our country? It's having kids without marriage. The stability of the marriage unit is enormous and we should not just say oh we're punting on it, marriage can be anything." "The stability of the marriage unit is enormous..."?

If they had they would have quoted Claude Frédéric Bastiat who did have a clue and said: Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain. Now, legal plunder can be committed in an infinite number of ways. Thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it: tariffs, protection, benefits, subsidies, encouragements, progressive taxation, public schools, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed profits, minimum wages, a right to relief, a right to the tools of labor, free credit, and so on, and so on. All these plans as a whole—with their common aim of legal plunder—constitute socialism. But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.</Msg><Username>carlosslimrichguy</Username><Timestamp>1372291169801</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 19:59:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372291248210-216</Id><Topic><Title>A330 engine explodes during takeoff roll</Title><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1372280165665</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:56:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmm, it was a RR Trent 772, Trent 900 series powers the A380 and one of those blew up in flight.

But yesterday’s voting rights call was one of the worst SCOTUS ones ever Paul Campos Update: Sure enough, four of the Roberts Five cast dissenting votes in the DOMA case that are completely impossible to reconcile with the legal principles they asserted in Shelby County. Original post: Later this morning, the Supreme Court is expected to hand down its decisions in the key marriage equality cases. After yesterday’s performance by the Court, we can no longer be surprised by historically bad jurisprudence. The voting rights ruling it issued yesterday, Shelby County v. Holder, is one of the very worst Supreme Court decisions of all time. Leaving aside the practical effects of the Court’s holding, which are likely to be awful (Texas has already won the race for “first state to enact a change to its voting laws that wouldn’t have been approved by the federal government if the Voting Rights Act could still be enforced”), the opinion is a travesty as a matter of basic legal reasoning. The easiest way to explain Justice Roberts’ opinion to non-lawyers is by analogy. Suppose, hypothetically speaking, that in 1965 the drinking age in 41 states had been 21, while in nine states it was 18. Suppose further that alcohol-related traffic deaths involving teenage drivers were three times higher in the states with the lower drinking age. Now suppose Congress passed a statute requiring any state that had an unusually high percentage of traffic deaths involving teenage drunk drivers to raise its legal drinking age to 21. Not surprisingly, the nine states in which the drinking age is 18 would all fall into this category. Now imagine this hypothetical legislation is remarkably successful. Alcohol-related traffic deaths involving teenagers plunge in all nine of the affected states. Congress therefore renews the law on several occasions, and on each occasion the Supreme Court assures Congress, in decisions dealing with challenges to the law, that the law is perfectly constitutional. But then something remarkable happens: Suddenly the Supreme Court announces that the law is unconstitutional after all. Its reasoning: The law was constitutional when it was passed, because experience has shown that requiring a higher drinking age was a rational legislative response to the problem of alcohol-related deaths involving teenaged drivers. Yet it is no longer constitutional, because the law has worked so well! It’s “unfair,” you see, to “discriminate” against the nine states that had lower legal drinking ages, because those states now have roughly the same rate of alcohol-related traffic deaths involving teenagers as the states that voluntarily enacted higher legal drinking ages. So the former states should be able to lower their legal drinking ages, since the problem the legislation addressed has been solved. Some of you must suspect that I’m exaggerating. Surely no one could make such an obviously absurd argument. Is this not like arguing that a vaccine that protects against an illness is no longer necessary, because those who have been given the vaccine do not develop the illness? The decision in Shelby County is actually more nonsensical than even this outlandish hypothetical suggests. What the Roberts Five actually held is that it’s not merely a bad idea, but actually irrational, for Congress (by a combined vote of 488 to 33) to reenact a law that is working so well, because since it is working so well it’s no longer necessary to have such a law. But this decision is yet more outrageous. The Constitution was specifically amended in the most explicit possible terms to allow Congress to pass precisely this sort of law, for this precise purpose. The 15th Amendment was enacted to give Congress the power to stop states from discriminating against racial minorities in regard to the right to vote. So what we have here is a situation in which a war was fought in which 600,000 soldiers died, in large part so that the Constitution could be amended in such a way as to give Congress the power to force the slave states to treat black people like human beings. A century later, Congress gets around to actually using this power, and the law it passes is a remarkable success. But according to the Roberts Five, it’s unconstitutional for Congress to enforce legislation specifically mandated by the Constitution, because it has carried out its legislative responsibilities too well. It’s impossible to predict, of course, what the Court’s rulings on marriage equality will be later today. But it undoubtedly will trigger many arguments about the meaning of “judicial activism,” and “legislating from the bench.” Conservatives supposedly deplore these things. Yet many of them are celebrating Shelby County v. Holder, even though it’s difficult to imagine a more grotesque abuse of judicial power than this abomination of a case. I don’t know whether this says more about such people’s intelligence, or their honesty.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372293408402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 20:36:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372294519006-224</Id><Title>787 Payments to Airlines do to grounding-"In Kind" Payments</Title><Msg>Saw an interview on-line today with McNerny and he says alot of the payments to the 787 operators are "in-kind" payments, Doesn't that mean they are donating money to these airlines instead of paying penalties?.</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1372294519006</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 20:55:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372294708350-225</Id><Topic><Title>Fascist Occupier Issues New Decree</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372250001019</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:33:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chemical Ali's pals in "science" represent these as well: Mercury isn't that bad--after all it's in nature.

Five thousand, twenty thousand, 250,000 – even half a million jobs would be created by one pipeline, according to the American Petroleum Institute. The API and US Chamber of Commerce are making KXL seem like the best chance of single-handedly lifting our country out of recession. According to the only independent analysis (by Cornell University’s Global Labor Institute) these claims don’t hold water. The fact is, TransCanada’s job claims are complete fabrications, and the Cornell report concludes that “KXL will not be a major source of US jobs, nor will it play any substantial role at all in putting Americans back to work.”i The State Department’s own study suggests that far fewer jobs will be created and most of them will be non-local and temporary. MYTH #3: Keystone XL will improve America’s energy security FACT: The Keystone XL pipeline is designed for one thing—to send oil from Canada to the Texas Gulf coast, and from there to overseas markets. According to retired General Steven Anderson the pipeline “would set back our renewable energy efforts for at least two decades, much to our enemies’ delight. It would ensure we maintain our oil addiction and delay making the tough decisions regarding energy production, management and conservation currently pursued.” And as Anderson makes clear, “Canadian oil won’t replace imports from hostile countries because Texas refiners are serving global demand rather than domestic need” MYTH #5: Keystone XL will reduce our energy prices. FACT: According to its own secret documents submitted to the Canadian government, TransCanada expects the pipeline to increase gas prices in the Midwest by up to 15 cents per gallon. Currently, a surplus of gas in the region means that our prices stay stable. If the pipeline is built oil companies will be able to send their product to the Gulf coast for export, which will reduce surplus and drive up cost.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1372300921724</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 22:42:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372300948473-238</Id><Topic><Title>737MAX to have composite fuselage and wings</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1372297702728</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 21:48:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is what I remember also.
