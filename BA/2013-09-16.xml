If obama wasn't spending all the $$ on guns for Islamic terrorists, we would have $$ to fix the dams. If obama didn't have the navy locked up in the Med protecting terrorists, the navy could sail right up and fix the dams.

If so, with one partner, multiple partners or same-sex partners?” Be ready to answer those questions and more the next time you go to the doctor, whether it’s the dermatologist or the cardiologist and no matter if the questions are unrelated to why you’re seeking medical help. And you can thank the Obama health law. “This is nasty business,” says New York cardiologist Dr. Adam Budzikowski. He called the sex questions “insensitive, stupid and very intrusive.” He couldn’t think of an occasion when a cardiologist would need such information — but he knows he’ll be pushed to ask for it. The president’s “reforms” aim to turn doctors into government agents, pressuring them financially to ask questions they consider inappropriate and unnecessary, and to violate their Hippocratic Oath to keep patients’ records confidential. Embarrassing though it may be, you confide things to a doctor you wouldn’t tell anyone else. But this is entirely different. Doctors and hospitals who don’t comply with the federal government’s electronic-health-records requirements forgo incentive payments now; starting in 2015, they’ll face financial penalties from Medicare and Medicaid. The Department of Health and Human Services has already paid out over $12.7 billion for these incentives. Dr. Richard Amerling, a nephrologist and associate professor at Albert Einstein Medical College, explains that your medical record should be “a story created by you and your doctor solely for your treatment and benefit.” But the new requirements are turning it “into an interrogation, and the data will not be confidential.”</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379329782008</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 07:09:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379329984944-6</Id><Topic><Title>Under Obamacare you will be asked to report on your sex life</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379329782008</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 07:09:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Brownshirt Ernst Roehm Brigade at Hot Tub 3 at the Kent Bathouse are giddy with delight</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379329984944</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 07:13:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379331186868-7</Id><Topic><Title>Why Is Obama still bowing to Saudi king?</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379241036794</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 06:30:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes ..its all part of the "Story of O"</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379331186868</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 07:33:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379331556713-8</Id><Title>112.98</Title><Msg>How is that short trade elon,,,,,,LOL</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1379331556713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 07:39:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379331765961-9</Id><Topic><Title>Under Obamacare you will be asked to report on your sex life</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379329782008</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 07:09:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why does B.O. want to collect data on everyones sex life ?........

We build dams and then we build communities in areas where flash flooding has occurred since the time before White men came to America. Yes that's right in a 9/13/13 "Live Science" article the USGS admitted that they have documents from long ago provided by American Indians who knew and warned that Boulder was at risk for flash floods before anyone built in the area. Anyone with 1/2 of a functioning brain figured out that it was fast moving water from the mountains that washed giant boulders down into Boulder in the first place. As is typical of arrogant and irresponsible humans, people still built their homes in flood plains and harms way. Instead of admitting to their arrogance and stupidity these idiots blame imagined climate change, even though such rain and flooding has been documented to be frequent in the area in the paleoclimate science or they find someone else to blame like whiney little brats who #$%$ up in life and then blame others for their mistakes. If it weren't for government meddling and compassion for the stupid, such idiots would succumb to Darwinian Natural Selection and the world would contain fewer idiots.

At least two have some form of connection to President Obama: Jeri L. Wright, daughter of the controversial Reverend Jeremiah Wright whose church Obama attended; and Quinshaunta R. Golden, former Department of Public Health chief of staff to President Obama’s longtime friend Eric E. Whitaker. Golden is also the niece of U.S. Congressman Danny K. Davis (D-IL). The Chicago Sun-Times has compiled a run-down of all 13 cases filed so far. The charges range from money laundering, mail fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering. The charges revolve around the fraudulent use of state health and commerce department grants and contracts. Six of the 13 accused have already pleaded guilty and are scheduled to be sentenced in October and November. The remaining seven, including Wright’s daughter and Davis’s niece, have trials set through the beginning of December. Jeri L. Wright is charged with money laundering and making a false statement before a grand jury. She is described as a “close associate and friend” of Regina and Ronald Evans (also indicted) and “accused of aiding the Evanses in their money-laundering scheme.” Golden is accused of “pocketing about $433,000 in kickbacks on health department contracts and grants that she oversaw. Her boss at the time, Obama’s friend Whitaker, has said he is cooperating with the investigation.” The Times reports Whitaker “had no first hand knowledge” of the alleged activities.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379341280935</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 10:21:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379341368874-30</Id><Title>Dreamliner 787 crash when not if...

They have abandoned putting an earnings multiple on it here and are going with 12x 2015 free cash flow projections in this Stern Agee note. The talk is always about how great cashflow is going to be yet their inventory just keeps going up and the cash never comes home. They also keep taking these charges against earnings and allowing their earnings to skip right over their pension issues. Their book value was about $12 in 2007 and they've done $20 in earnings since them, paying out $8 in dividends. That's great, but there should then be retained earnings of $12 extra bucks. But the book value is $9. Why is that. Not a huge increase in debt. They have simply been taking billions and billions of charges and we are constantly looking the other way since the story and company is so cool. I'm starting a short position here. I happen to think the 787 is pretty sweet, I simply don't like the accounting surrounding it. Also what are they going to do with all the 747s they are buying back and holding them on the books at trade in value? Sell them as scrap and then take a charge. Everyone will say, "don't worry that is a backward looking charge, no problem." These aren't a problem until they are and start to get to obvious. I my mind they are already obvious and should scare even the biggest bull.

Meanwhile, the abortion battle has gone digital as more states ban abortions by telemedicine. CT has examined the new pro-life surge in-depth. ----- (BP) For Abby Johnson, the closing of a single Planned Parenthood center demonstrated her dramatic reversal from abortion clinic director to leading pro-life advocate. But for pro-lifers throughout the United States, it marked another exhibit in a hopeful trend—abortion centers are shutting down at an unprecedented rate. The total so far this year is 44, according to a pro-life organization that tracks clinic operations. None was more telling for Johnson than the mid-July closing of the Planned Parenthood center in Bryan, Texas. It came less than four years after Johnson, burdened by her involvement with abortion, walked out of that clinic as its director and into the offices of the Coalition for Life. "Knowing that the former abortion clinic I once ran is now closing is the biggest personal victory of my life," Johnson said in a written statement after the announcement of the shutdown. "From running that facility, to then advocating for its closure, and now celebrating that dream ... it shows that my life has indeed come full circle." Since her celebrated conversion from Planned Parenthood director, Johnson has started a ministry to help workers leave the abortion industry. She has pledged, as she said in July, to "fight until every abortion clinic in this country has shut its doors." This year, 42 clinics that provided surgical abortions have shut their doors, and two that offered chemical abortions by drugs also have closed, according to Operation Rescue, which monitors closings and health and safety violations by clinics nationwide. That number far surpasses the 25 surgical clinics shutdown last year and the 30 in 2011, by Operation Rescue's count. While others estimate a smaller number of closings, the pattern is clear. Some of the shutdowns have been of major clinics. For instance, Virginia's No. 1 abortion provider closed, The Washington Post reported in July. NOVA Women's Healthcare in Fairfax, Va., shut down after state and local governments enacted regulations the abortion provider appeared unable to meet. The northern Virginia clinic performed 3,066 abortions in 2012 and 3,567 in 2011. The reasons given for the upswing in closings are varied even among pro-lifers. They include: -- the increasing state regulation and oversight of clinics; -- a growth in pro-life opinion and activity, and -- a significant decline in the abortion rate. In some cases, clinics have shut down when abortion doctors retired or were no longer licensed.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1379351441300</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 13:10:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379351881633-64</Id><Title>Congress gets sneaky exemption from Obamacare....</Title><Msg>Prostitution. Bribery. Blackmail. Thuggery. Hypocrisy. Those were just some of the incendiary words thrown around the U.S. Senate last week, and that doesn’t count what people said in private. The Senate may still have a reputation as a genteel club, but lawmakers seemed to abandon rules of decorum completely last week in arguments about whether Congress should be treated like the rest of the country when it comes to Obamacare. Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, has demanded a floor vote on his bill to end an exemption that members of Congress and their staffs are slated to get that will make them the only participants in the new Obamacare exchanges to receive generous subsidies from their employer to pay for their health insurance. Angry Senate Democrats have drafted legislation that dredges up a 2007 prostitution scandal involving Vitter. The confrontation is a perfect illustration of just how wide the gulf in attitudes is between the Beltway and the rest of the country — and how viciously Capitol Hill denizens will fight for their privileges.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1379351881633</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 13:18:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379352155080-65</Id><Title>ME LOVE YOU LONG TIME BA ;-)</Title><Msg>JUST KEEP GOING UP !!!!!!</Msg><Username>cutthemoffnow</Username><Timestamp>1379352155080</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 13:22:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379352283541-66</Id><Title>Obama: We Dont Have . . .

A White House official said the Treasury Department has concluded that such an exemption is not possible under the Affordable Care Act. The labor unions have been asking that their union plans, known as Taft-Hartley plans, be eligible for premium subsidies the way plans on the new insurance exchange will be. A senior administration official said the White House looked at several ways to make the union plans eligible for subsidies but couldn’t find one. A special union carve-out isn't permitted under the legislative language, and would increase the law's costs by an estimated $200 billion over the next decade. But since when have legal niceties and price tags deterred this group? The administration has axed provisions cynically designed to "reduce costs" on paper in the past, and the president personally intervened to orchestrate a legally-dubious exemption on Obamacare subsidy rules for members of Congress and their staff. Avik Roy explains why groups like the AFL-CIO are incensed over the White House's decision: Here’s the issue that was at stake. A number of labor unions participate in multi-employer health plans, also known as Taft-Hartley plans. These plans allow unions to organize, say, all the restaurant workers in a particular county, taking advantage of the economies of scale that come from a larger insurance pool. The problem is that, thanks to Obamacare’s employer mandate and its subsidized insurance exchanges, businesses with fewer than 50 employees now have an incentive to drop health coverage for their employees and let those workers get coverage on the exchanges...it’s a big blow to the labor unions who organize the plans, because workers no longer need unions to negotiate or obtain their health coverage. Thus, at least temporarily, the increasingly-acrimonious rift between the White House and Big Labor will deepen. Much attention has been paid to Republican disagreements over how best to oppose Obamacare, but the more significant divisions exist on the Left; some elements of the Democrats' coalition unwaveringly support the law, while others aren't pleased with what they're seeing.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1379352696741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 13:31:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379353299038-69</Id><Topic><Title>Obama to Unions: Take a Hike, I don't Need you Anymore.</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1379352696741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 13:31:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's a socialist to do?

(2) GE and IBM is punting thousands of retirees off of the companies' longstanding healthcare plans. Bloomberg reports that this "historic shift" could "push more costs onto US taxpayers." (3) In an incident that will be sure to spark more discussion about the fraud risks inherent in Obamacare, Minnesota's state exchange accidentally leaked the highly sensitive private data of nearly 2,500 insurance agents in the state: A MNsure employee accidentally sent an e-mail file to an Apple Valley insurance broker’s office on Thursday that contained Social Security numbers, names, business addresses and other identifying information on more than 2,400 insurance agents. An official at MNsure, the state’s new online health insurance exchange, acknowledged it had mishandled private data. A MNsure security manager called the broker, Jim Koester, and walked him and his assistant through a process of deleting the file from their computer hard drives. Koester said he willingly complied, but was unnerved. “The more I thought about it, the more troubled I was,” he said. “What if this had fallen into the wrong hands? It’s scary. If this is happening now, how can clients of MNsure be confident their data is safe?” Obamacare's deadline for full implementation is two weeks from tomorrow. According to Congressional testimony heard last week, not a single state is completely ready.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1379354062494</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 13:54:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379354321364-77</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: We Dont Have . . .

Norwegian had to briefly ground both of its Dreamliners earlier this month due to various technical faults, including brake and power issues. The Dreamliner was expected to be a game-changer for the aviation industry as its use of lighter materials and new engines promised 20 percent savings in fuel consumption. But the program has been troubled by more than three years of delays in getting the planes into service and several problems since then, including the temporary grounding of all planes because of overheating batteries.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1379354922950</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-16 14:08:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379354968673-80</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Fought To Cut Dam Maintenance Budget In Colorado – Now The Dams Are Breaking</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_the_third</Username><Timestamp>1379280739637</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-15 17:32:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Flash floods put the boulders in Boulder?

This is not to say that Vail isn’t an unprecedented contestant in her own right: she’s spent five years in the Kansas Army National Guard and is double-majoring in chemistry and Chinese at Kansas State University. But, according to Starnes on Facebook, she lost because “the liberal Miss America judges were not interested in a gun-toting, deer-hunting, military veteran.” But at least, from Starnes’s perspective, she was a lady, “although I’m sure the gender-neutral crowd is plotting.” _____________________________________ Hoodz is in PMS mode. It is fair to discuss the political correctness of the judges in choosing between a "cultural diversity" platform and a true blue American military veteran that likes to hunt.
