Are you on drugs? Obama Escalates the War in Afghanistan — End the Occupation - Bring the Troops Home Now! Dec 2, 2009 By Dan DiMaggio Barack Obama has decided to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, on top of the 21,000 additional soldiers he ordered there earlier this year. This will bring the total number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to over 100,000. Millions in the U.S. and around the globe are undoubtedly asking why Obama, who was elected with what many viewed as an anti-war mandate, has decided to escalate what is an increasingly unpopular and seemingly unwinnable war. Opposition to this decision has already begun to mount. As popular filmmaker (and Obama supporter) Michael Moore wrote on his website, “If you go to West Point … and announce that you are increasing, rather than withdrawing, the troops in Afghanistan, you are the new war president. Pure and simple.”</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351830194682</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 00:23:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351830665843-2</Id><Topic><Title>Do you trust Romney with your pension?</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1351827844705</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 23:44:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wuwu - I don't need romney to manage my pension and he doesn't want to whereas Obama wants to end the privatization of retirement finances.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351830665843</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 00:31:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351830864495-3</Id><Topic><Title>Staten Island Residents Beg for Food and Clothes...

Major players in the Obama White House have been targeted in a law suit by Spire Law Group who is responsible for recovering 43 trillion in laundered funds and racketeering that has been linked to major banks, crony capitalists, and government officials. This scheme based in New York will be party to the biggest federal government lawsuit in history. The government will attempt to recover 43 trillion in taxpayer’s funds disbursed during the 2009 bailout that totaled 787 billion to supposedly save the US financial markets from a massive collapse while funding infrastructure projects through out the US such as roads and bridges that were badly in need of repairs, yet only 6% of the money was ever used for such purposes. Corrupt bailout evidence never acted upon As many such as Rush Limbaugh had charged, the massive bailouts used for AIG, General Motors, Chrysler Corporation, a number of banks, even broadcasting companies, was apparently disbursed for other clandestine purposes such as slush funds for Democrat election campaigns. Yet, that’s not all. A slick operation that didn't plan on getting caught Plaintiffs have now identified a number of individuals who were running a racketeering enterprise linked to the following individuals, who participated in and profited from the illegally deposited money. Those named as defendants in the lawsuit are: Attorney General, Eric Holder, California Attorney General Kamala Harris, Jon Corzine, former New Jersey Governor, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, current Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, former chairman of the board for Citigroup, Vikram Pandit, who recently resigned under disgustingly unethical disclosures, Senior White House advisor, Valerie Jarret, former communications director for the White House, Anita Dunn, chief legal counsel for Obama re-election campaign, Robert Bauer, including bankers and other associated parties who participated in the violation of the laws. This lawsuit alleges criminal violations of the Patriot Act, the policy of embargo against Iran and other foreign nations hostile toward the United States, as well as the RICO statute, which involves Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act. There are additional federal and state laws also violated and represented under the record federal government lawsuit.

Those same sources also say former President Bill Clinton has been “urging” his wife to release official State Department documents that prove she called for additional security at the compound in Libya, which would almost certainly result in President Obama losing the election. Appearing on TheBlazeTV’s “Wilkow!” on Wednesday night, Klein told host Andrew Wilkow that Bill and Hillary Clinton have been having “big fights” for “two or three weeks” about the issue, according to his two sources on Clinton’s legal counsel. While Bill Clinton wishes his wife would “exonerate” herself by releasing the documents that show she wasn’t at fault for the tragic security failure in Libya, the secretary of state refuses to do so because she doesn’t want to be viewed as a traitor to the Democratic party. On Glenn Beck’s radio show earlier on Wednesday, Klein said his information comes from two “very good” sources. Wilkow pointed out the obvious, that the Obamas and the Clintons have a “very behind the scenes, tense relationship” — to put it lightly. “I said to you last night, and I think I stand corrected, that it seemed like Obama out-Clintoned the Clintons,” Wilkow said. “But Clinton seems to have gone along with all of this because he knew that Hillary would be exonerated in the end.” Hillary holding back for the sake of Obama's chance at re-election?</Msg><Username>commishfree1</Username><Timestamp>1351857133211</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 07:52:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351857281371-27</Id><Topic><Title>‘GOP bloodlust’ over Benghazi</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1351817361524</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 20:49:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PROVE IT</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1351857281371</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 07:54:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351858138090-28</Id><Topic><Title>Ah, that Nate Silver</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1351834145591</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 01:29:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree.

The words come in response to President Obama's leadership in the past four years, but specifically in response to his handling of the 9/11 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi known to the Review-Journal as Obama's "blunder." This administration is an embarrassment on foreign policy and incompetent at best on the economy - though a more careful analysis shows what can only be a perverse and willful attempt to destroy our prosperity. Back in January 2008, Barack Obama told the editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle that under his cap-and-trade plan, "If somebody wants to build a coal-fired power plant, they can. It's just that it will bankrupt them." He added, "Under my plan ... electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket." It was also in 2008 that Mr. Obama's future Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, famously said it would be necessary to "figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe" - $9 a gallon. Yet the president now claims he's in favor of oil development and pipelines, taking credit for increased oil production on private lands where he's powerless to block it, after he halted the Keystone XL Pipeline and oversaw a 50 percent reduction in oil leases on public lands. These behaviors go far beyond "spin." They amount to a pack of lies. To return to office a narcissistic amateur who seeks to ride this nation's economy and international esteem to oblivion, like Slim Pickens riding the nuclear bomb to its target at the end of the movie "Dr. Strangelove," would be disastrous. Candidate Obama said if he couldn't fix the economy in four years, his would be a one-term presidency. Mitt Romney is moral, capable and responsible man. Just this once, it's time to hold Barack Obama to his word. Maybe we can all do something about that, come Tuesday. Ouch. Harsh words, but oh so true. Although the Journal used the most jabbing words against Obama, at least 21 other major papers who endorsed the President in 2008 have switched to Romney this time around with the five biggest being The Houston Chronicle, The Forth Worth Star-Telegram, The Orlando Sentinel, The Tennessean and The Des Moines Register. Two things here. 1) Mitt Romney is a much better candidate in 2012 than John McCain was in 2008 b) Obama's record has caught up to him and editorial boards across the country have finally admitted he hasn't earned a second term.

In a campaign speech yesterday, Barack Obama told the crowd that “some of the businesses we encourage will fail.” I guess we need to add “encourage” to our list of Washington-speak. It’s just another word for “prop up with tax dollars.” Businesses will be a lot more encouraged if Barack Obama and our imperial federal government got the hell out of the way. That’s the first way to encourage businesses. And instead of demonizing companies like Bain Capital which provide capital to “encourage” businesses, we should celebrate their place in our capitalist system. Instead, the Bain Capitals of the world are demonized and government gambling with your tax dollars is somehow considered noble. I blame this notion that anything government does is better to generations of government education.

His long campaign’s bilious tone — scurrilities about Mitt Romney as a monster of, at best, callous indifference; adolescent japes about “Romnesia” — is discordant coming from someone who has favorably compared his achievements to those of “any president” since Lincoln, with the “possible” exceptions of Lincoln, LBJ and FDR. Obama’s oceanic self-esteem — no deficit there — may explain why he seems to smolder with resentment that he must actually ask for a second term. Speaking of apologies, Syracuse University’s law school should issue one for having graduated Joe Biden. In the 2008 vice presidential debate, he condescendingly lectured Sarah Palin that Article I of the Constitution defines the executive branch. Actually, Article II does. In this year’s debate, he said that overturning Roe v. Wade would “outlaw” abortion. Actually, this would just restore abortion as a subject for states to regulate as they choose. Biden, whose legal education ended well before he was full to the brim, was nominated for his current high office because Democrats believe compassion should temper the severities of meritocracy. It is, however, remarkable, and evidence of voters’ dangerous frivolity regarding the vice presidency, that Biden’s proximity to the presidency has not stirred more unease. To forestall that, Biden should heed Alexis de Tocqueville: “To remain silent is the most useful service that a mediocre speaker can render to the public good.” Two economic themes of Obama’s campaign have been that outsourcing jobs is sinful and that he saved GM, which assembles 70 percent of its vehicles on lines outside America. He thinks that ATMs and airport ticket kiosks cause unemployment but may understand that buying an iPhone involves outsourcing to China the jobs of assembling it. Although his campaign slogan is “Forward!” he evidently wants America to compete with China in the manufacture of T-shirts and toasters. His third economic theme — that he will “invest in” (spend on) this and that — has been inaudible amid the clatter of crashing companies he has invested in. G.

It’s just another piece of evidence to prove what most of us have known all along: The U.S. Mission in Benghazi convened an “emergency meeting” less than a month before the assault that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, because Al Qaeda had training camps in Benghazi and the consulate could not defend against a “coordinated attack,” according to a classified cable reviewed by Fox News. Summarizing an Aug. 15 emergency meeting convened by the U.S. Mission in Benghazi, the Aug. 16 cable marked “SECRET” said that the State Department’s senior security officer, also known as the RSO, did not believe the consulate could be protected. “RSO (Regional Security Officer) expressed concerns with the ability to defend Post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound,” the cable said. According to a review of the cable addressed to the Office of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Emergency Action Committee was also briefed “on the location of approximately ten Islamist militias and AQ training camps within Benghazi … these groups ran the spectrum from Islamist militias, such as the QRF Brigade and Ansar al-Sharia, to ‘Takfirist thugs.’”</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1351863540315</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 09:39:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351863656139-37</Id><Title>Just look what Obama has done for American houeholds</Title><Msg>Federal per-household debt has increased by nearly $43,000 to $133,869 in the three and a half years since Senate Democrats last passed a budget.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1351863656139</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 09:40:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351864578527-38</Id><Title>UPDATE: New Poll Gives Love 12-Point Lead</Title><Msg>For 12 years, Jim Matheson has been a political escape artist, managing to wiggle free from every trap the Utah Republicans have thrown his way.

The president smiled and continued walking. Perhaps he couldn’t hear the question over the din of the chopper’s blades, but either way the smile and wave – almost Reagan-esque in style – underline the apparent strategy the president specifically and his administration in general have seemed to adopt when it comes to the myriad inquiries about the decisions that led to the deaths of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens: they are deferring detailed answers to the investigation and – critics say –running out the clock until Election Day. As of now, the White House has disclosed that President Obama was informed about the attack on the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi at roughly 5pm by his National Security Adviser Tom Donilon as he was in a pre-scheduled meeting with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey. At that meeting, senior administration officials say, the President ordered that the U.S. begin moving military assets into the region to prepare for a range of contingencies. But beyond that, the White House has punted, saying the Accountability Review Board established by the State Department is investigating the matter and what went wrong. No detailed tick-tock, no information about the president’s involvement in decision-making. In addition, they’re preparing for a closed-door hearing of the Senate’s Select Committee on Intelligence on November 15.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1351865816761</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:16:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351866076797-44</Id><Title>There were no orders to anybody to stand down</Title><Msg>Intelligence officials have disclosed a new detailed timeline of the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. A senior U.S. intelligence official also insisted that "There were no orders to anybody to stand down in providing support". The official's comments appeared to be a direct rebuttal of a Fox News report that CIA teams on the ground had been told by superior officers to "stand down" from providing security support to the consulate. According to the timeline the annex received a call at 9:40 p.m. local time that the consulate was coming under attack. At 11:11 p.m., an unarmed U.S. military surveillance drone arrived over the compound. By 11:30pm, all of the Americans, with the exception of the missing Stevens, had left the compound in vehicles. At around 1 a.m. an additional CIA team of about six security officers from the embassy in Tripoli had arrived at Benghazi. Upon learning that the situation at the annex had calmed down, the team that came in from Tripoli initially wanted to focus their attention on locating Stevens, who had been taken to a local hospital. When the team finally managed to secure transportation and an armed escort into Benghazi, they learned that Stevens "was almost certainly dead and that the security situation at the hospital was uncertain." At that point they headed to the annex to help evacuate the Americans located there . They arrived at the annex at 5:10 a.m. At 5:15 a.m., mortar rounds begin to hit the CIA security Annex. The new attack on the annex lasted only 11 minutes. The attack killed two security officers, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, who were located on the annex's roof. By 6 A.M., everyone at the annex was evacuated with the help of "a heavily armed Libyan military unit.

To that end, the Romney campaign trotted out a roster of well-known business leaders Thursday who are backing the Republican presidential nominee. Supporters include Charles Schwab, Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers and Bernie Marcus, the co-founder of Home Depot. The newest name on the list belongs to Intel CEO Paul Otellini, a member of President Barack Obama’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. Mr. Otellini’s relationship with the president has been hot-and-cold since Mr. Obama took office. In 2010, he criticized the administration for failing to generate more robust job growth. He was particularly critical of the stimulus. But the Intel CEO joined the president’s so-called jobs council to much fanfare the following year as Mr. Obama embarked on a very public – if short-lived – courtship of big business. The president lauded Intel for investing in the U.S. during a trip last year to one of the chipmaker’s advanced manufacturing facilities in Oregon. During the visit, Mr. Otellini announced plans to build a $5 billion production facility in Arizona that would employ thousands of workers in the U.S. The Intel chief also made two high-profile trips to the White House, including a state dinner with Chinese President Hu Jintao. But the jobs council has not held an official meeting since January – a fact Republicans like to highlight. The Intel chief has called for lowering corporate tax rates and scrapping some tax loopholes – a priority shared by Messrs. Obama Romney – but he told Charlie Rose in 2010 that the administration was slow to embrace ideas offered up by the business community to spur job growth.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1351866220779</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:23:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351866346265-48</Id><Topic><Title>Gingrich: Romney WIll Win 53-47</Title><Username>jetstream_2010</Username><Timestamp>1351865658399</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:14:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fortunately for the mentally-impaired RWNJ's they are covered by Obamacare for their pre-existing conditions.

I know, I lived under a Marxist regime. He is a statist and a collectivist and his policies reflect that. Most Democrat don't have a clue what Marxism is and and deadly it can get. Obama has shown over and over again he will throw anyone under the bus if they get in his way of accumulating more and more power....his preacher of 20 years, his good friends like Bill Ayers, even his Grand mother. This is not a new mentality, it is the mentality of most Marxists. It is the same mentality that caused communist leaders in the USSR to kill more than 20 million of their own countrymen, it is the same mentality that caused Che Guevara and Fidel Castro to murder more than 6 million Cubans and it is the same mentality that caused Mao to kill more than 90 million of his fellow countrymen. Many of those dead souls thought that it was “cool” to have “change” that fed off of poverty, class warfare, hatred, jealousy and envy. Only too late, did they discover the “cool guys” offering change, were far worse than the people they replaced. The really shocked ones were the ones that thought they were safe because they were in with the “cool guys” and part of the change force. These were the useful idiots of which Stalin spoke. But their property was taken too and their relatives were killed and sent to gulags too. And when these “useful idots” objected they were killed too. They were simply a means to an end with dictatorial totalitarianism being the end. Obama supporters don’t think they won’t come for you, if you get in their way. And don’t think the good guys who will have the task of taking back the country from these animals will have any sympathy for you who empowered the elitists who want to rule health care, your businesses and your lives. I know, I grew up in Russia and came to this country 48 years ago. Ask any immigrant from a communist country and they will tell you the same thing. Those of us who came from such environment see the same thing happening here. Just watch how violent, vulgar and uncivilized Obama supporters are getting.

ABC News' Jake Tapper describes the succession of appalling revelations as a slow drip, but the stream is picking up. The motherload, from CBS News: CBS News has learned that during the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi, the Obama Administration did not convene its top interagency counterterrorism resource: the Counterterrorism Security Group, (CSG). "The CSG is the one group that's supposed to know what resources every agency has. They know of multiple options and have the ability to coordinate counterterrorism assets across all the agencies," a high-ranking government official told CBS News. "They were not allowed to do their job. They were not called upon." Information shared with CBS News from top counterterrorism sources in the government and military reveal keen frustration over the U.S. response on Sept. 11, the night ambassador Chris Stevens and 3 other Americans were killed in a coordinated attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya. Counterterrorism sources and internal emails reviewed by CBS News express frustration that key responders were ready to deploy, but were not called upon to help in the attack ... Another senior counter terrorism official says a hostage rescue team was alternately asked to get ready and then stand down throughout the night, as officials seemed unable to make up their minds. "The response process was isolated at the most senior level," says an official referring to top officials in the executive branch. "My fellow counterterrorism professionals and I (were) not consulted." "The process was isolated at the most senior level." These "senior level" officials are the ones clinging to the investigation excuse. It's now completely obvious why. An absolute disgrace.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1351871325624</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:48:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351871433145-110</Id><Title>WoW, Romney Closing Agruement Speech Fantastic...

But not as big an idiot as the retarded imacon penny-per-post rawmoney supporter. Three stories from Thomas Peterffy Sr's life as a trader: Story #1: When Peterffy was a kid growing up in communist Hungary in the 1950s his buddy went to Austria and brought back a pack of Juicy Fruit gum. Peterffy bought the pack, broke the sticks of gum up into little pieces, and sold them at a profit. The principal at his school was not amused. "Where's your communist conscience?" the principal asked. Not surprisingly, given story #1, Peterffy moved to the U.S. as a young man. Story #2: By the 1970s, Peterffy was working at a company trying to use computers to make money on Wall Street. (This was a novel idea at the time.) Peterffy figured out how to use computers to calculate when financial instruments called options were overpriced or underpriced. But he had a problem. It was 1977, and people weren't yet using computers to buy and sell options. They were still standing in trading pits, waving their arms and yelling to do trades. Peterffy tried bringing binders of computer printouts to the trading floor to guide his buying and selling. But this was slow and inefficient. So he and some engineers tried to build an early tablet computer — a proto-iPad — to bring to the trading floor. The tablet worked, though one burst into flames on the trading floor. Story #3: It wasn't until 1987 that Peterffy was able to take people out of the loop entirely. With the world's first electronic stock exchange, the NASDAQ terminal, traders could type in orders directly into a computer. Peterffy didn't want to type in the orders. He and his engineers hacked into the NASDAQ terminal and wired it up to their own computer, which traded automatically based on algorithms. A senior NASDAQ official saw Peterffy's setup and said Peterffy was breaking the rules: All orders had to be entered through the keyboard. He gave Petterfy's group one week to fix the problem. Peterffy and his engineers came up with a solution. They built a robot with rubber fingers that typed entries into the keyboard. It satisfied the NASDAQ rules. And on active trading days, the robot typed so fast it sounded like a machine gun. In the 1990s, over a decade after Peterffy dreamed up computerized trading, exchanges start to let people plug their computers directly into the markets. 'Absolutely No Social Value' Today, Peterffy is one of the big players. The company he started, Interactive Brokers, does electronic trades on a mind-boggling scale. Forbes estimates his net worth is now over $5 billion. Peterffy says automation has done some very good things for the world. It's made buying and selling stocks much much cheaper for everyone. But Peterffy thinks the race for speed is doing more harm than good now. "We are competing at milliseconds," he says. "And whether you can shave three milliseconds of an order, has absolutely no social value." Peterffy is in favor of more regulation. He'd like to see rules that slow things down. The challenge of course: People will try to find ways around the rules. There is always someone willing to build a robot that types.

The decision, made in late September against the advice of the agency’s economic team leadership, drew almost no notice at the time. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, cited the study a week and a half after it was withdrawn in a speech on tax policy at the National Press Club. But it could actually draw new attention to the report, which questions the premise that lowering the top marginal tax rate stimulates economic growth and job creation. “This has hues of a banana republic,” Mr. Schumer said. “They didn’t like a report, and instead of rebutting it, they had them take it down.” Republicans did not say whether they had asked the research service, a nonpartisan arm of the Library of Congress, to take the report out of circulation, but they were clear that they protested its tone and findings.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1351877161193</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 13:26:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351877207874-152</Id><Topic><Title>Nonpartisan Tax Report Withdrawn After G.O.P.

Anyone who's been awake the last 30 years should already know this. Clinton raised taxes on the wealthy and job creation took off. Bush lowered taxes on the wealthy and job creation ground to a halt. But it's no surprise that Repubs still think cutting taxes for the wealthy creates jobs. These cretins still believe in creationism and still refuse to believe in climate change. They're the party of sore losers who can't handle being told they're wrong.</Msg><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1351878238008</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 13:43:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351878303902-162</Id><Topic><Title>My vision for America</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1351854958027</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 07:15:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Real Progress?

We mourn those who were lost. And we pledge to stand with those whose lives have been turned upside down for as long as it takes them to recover and rebuild. Because when hardship hits, America is at its best. The petty differences that consume us in normal times quickly melt away. There are no Democrats or Republicans during a storm -- only fellow Americans. That's how we get through the most trying times: together. Four years ago, we were mired in two wars and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Together, we've battled our way back. The war in Iraq is over, Osama bin Laden is dead, and our heroes are coming home. Our businesses have created more than 5 million new jobs in the last two and half years. Home values and 401(k)s are rising. We are less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last 20 years. And the American auto industry is back. We're not there yet. But we've made real progress. And on Tuesday, America will get to choose between two fundamentally different visions of what makes America strong. I believe America's prosperity was built on the strength of our middle class. We don't succeed when a few at the top do well while everyone else struggles to get by -- we're better off when everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules. When Bill Clinton was president, he believed that if America invested in the skills and ideas of its people, good jobs and businesses would follow. His economic plan asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more so we could reduce our deficit and still invest in job training and education, research and technology, better health care and a dignified retirement. And what happened? By the end of his second term, our economy created 23 million new jobs. Incomes rose. Poverty fell. Deficits became the biggest surplus in history. The path Governor Romney offers is the one we tried for eight years after President Clinton left office -- a philosophy that says those at the very top get to play by a very different set of rules than everyone else. Bigger tax cuts for the wealthy that we can't afford. Encouraging companies to ship jobs and profits overseas. Fewer rules for big banks and insurance companies. They're the policies that caused this mess in the first place. In the closing weeks of this campaign, Governor Romney has started calling himself an agent of change. And I'll give him one thing -- offering another $5 trillion tax cut weighted towards the wealthy, $2 trillion in defense spending our military didn't ask for, and more power for big banks and insurance companies is change, all right. But it's not the change we need. We know what real change looks like. And we can't give up on it now. Change is an America where people of every age have the skills and education that good jobs require. We took on banks that had been overcharging for student loans for decades, and made college more affordable for millions. Now we'll recruit 100,000 math and science teachers so that high-tech, high-wage jobs don't end up in China, and train 2 million workers at community colleges for the skills local businesses need right now. Change is an America that's home to the next generation of manufacturing and innovation. I'm not the candidate who said we should "let Detroit go bankrupt," I'm the president who bet on American workers and American ingenuity. Now I want a tax code that stops rewarding companies that ship jobs overseas, and starts rewarding companies that create jobs here; one that stops subsidizing oil company profits, and keeps supporting clean energy jobs and technology that will cut our oil imports in half. Change is an America that turns the page on a decade of war to do some nation-building here at home. So long as I'm commander-in-chief, we'll pursue our enemies with the strongest military in the world. But it's time to use the savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to pay down our debt and rebuild America -- our roads and bridges and schools. Change is an America where we reduce our deficit by cutting spending where we can, and asking the wealthiest Americans to go back to the income tax rates they paid when Bill Clinton was president. I've worked with Republicans to cut a trillion dollars of spending, and I'll do more. I'll work with anyone of any party to move this country forward. But I won't agree to eliminate health insurance for millions of poor, elderly, or disabled on Medicaid, or turn Medicare into a voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut. The folks at the very top don't need another champion in Washington. The people who need a champion in Washington are the Americans whose letters I read at night; the men and women I meet on the trail every day. The cooks and cleaning staff working overtime at a Las Vegas hotel. The furniture worker retraining for a career in biotechnology at age 55. The teacher who's forced to spend less time with each student in her crowded classroom. Her kids, who dream of becoming something great. Every small business owner trying to expand and do right by his or her employees -- all of these Americans need a champion in Washington. When these Americans do well, America does well. That's the change we need right now. It's time to finish what we've started -- to educate our kids, train our workers, create new jobs, new energy, and new opportunity -- to make sure that no matter who you are, where you come from, or how you started out, this is the country where you can make it if you try. The America we believe in is within our reach. The future we hope for is within our sights. That's why I'm asking for your vote this Tuesday.</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1351884194071</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 15:23:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351884306634-206</Id><Topic><Title>Quit trashing President Obama's accomplishments</Title><Username>dm60010</Username><Timestamp>1351871181915</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:46:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's quite a record!

The voters in question realized the error and were able to cast ballots for their actual choice. "I don't know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me," said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens. Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney. "I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney's name," Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House. She said that the first time she pushed "Romney," the machine marked "Obama." So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time. "Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times," she told Fox News. Marion County Board of Elections Director Sophie Rogers, though, said: "My personal opinion is that she hit it too hard." "We've noticed people just punch on them. She might not have hit the square that she wanted," Rogers said. Rogers insists there are no problems with the touch-screen machines in Marion County and that after learning of Stevens' complaint she took the machine out of circulation and had it reexamined and recalibrated. She says there was nothing wrong with the machine to begin with. But in response to the growing number of complaints, the Republican National Committee has sent a letter to election officials in six states -- Ohio, Nevada, Kansas, North Carolina, Missouri and Colorado -- demanding tighter controls on touch-screen machines. The RNC wants the machines to be re-tested, more technicians added to fix any problems, and verbal reminders given by election workers telling voters to double check their ballots. Multiple voters from several states wrote Fox News to report problems similar to what Stevens reported. One voter asked: "I wonder how many voters just hit the 'Cast Ballot' without reading the machine?" "How can we be sure our votes are not being stolen electronically?" asked another. One expert warns it can happen.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1351885952436</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 15:52:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351886697658-215</Id><Topic><Title>Obama use powers to create hurricane Sandy</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1351869491150</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:18:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... i wouldn't be surprised !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1351886697658</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:04:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351887041190-216</Id><Title>Disgusting Democratic Tatics Exploiting the Mentally Ill...

The 57-year-old is mentally disabled, and Green said she doesn't understand the concept of casting a ballot. But this week, she called her parents to say she had voted for President Obama. The care home in Fayetteville where she lives registered its residents to vote and drove them to the polls, Green said. "My concern is that somebody told her who to vote for," he said. "She didn't even know there's two different parties." Complaints of uncomprehending voters being ferried to cast ballots surface every election. And in a presidential race as close as this year's, with huge levels of early voting, any perceived irregularity is falling under intense scrutiny. But federal and state laws are very clear - there is no competency test for voting.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1351887041190</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:10:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351887428506-217</Id><Topic><Title>We was supposed to maneuver to the JRTC roadshow training site in AZ to fight the rooskies in the desert</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1351881153894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 14:32:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>caught a ride off-training site into Ft.

Mr. Romney, the second-oldest son of Mitt Romney, met with Russians whom he hoped to convince to invest in his company, Excel Trust, which owns shopping centers across the United States, the firm said. Although the company’s focus has been solely domestic, it said it has begun exploring international opportunities to raise funds. Mr. Romney’s trip a week before the presidential election underscored the complex relationship between his family’s business and the political campaign. Mitt Romney has criticized President Obama for being too soft on Russia, calling it “our No. 1 geopolitical foe” and promising to confront President Vladimir V. Putin’s government with “more backbone” if elected on Tuesday.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1351889605569</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:53:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351889734211-228</Id><Title>The HWY of death fleeing out Kuwait out back to Iraq</Title><Msg>oh, about between about 100,000 to 500,000 crispie-critters</Msg><Username>repugsareliars</Username><Timestamp>1351889734211</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:55:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351890368165-229</Id><Topic><Title>The HWY of death fleeing out Kuwait out back to Iraq</Title><Username>repugsareliars</Username><Timestamp>1351889734211</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:55:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And then our economic sanctions cost the lives of 300,000 to 500,000 Iraqi children.

Death Throws for Obama!</Title><Msg>In Shift, Romney Campaign Approaches Pennsylvania With a New Urgency By JEREMY W. PETERS Published: November 1, 2012 PHILADELPHIA — First there was quiet. Then came the “super PACs.” Now the candidate is on his way. Enlarge This Image Women for Romney volunteers made calls last week at the campaign’s Chester County headquarters in Paoli, Pa. In a striking last-minute shift, the Romney campaign has decided to invest its most precious resource — the candidate’s time — in a serious play to win Pennsylvania. Mr. Romney’s appearance here on Sunday could be a crafty political move to seriously undercut President Obama, or it could be a sign of desperation. Either way, his visit represents the biggest jolt yet in a state that was until recently largely ignored in the race for the White House. Over the last several days, with polls showing Mr. Obama’s edge in the state narrowing, Republicans have sprung into action and forced the Democrats to spend resources here that could have gone toward more competitive battleground states. Conservative super PACs dusted off old advertisements that had not been shown in weeks and shipped them to local television stations from Scranton to Pittsburgh. They ordered millions of dollars in airtime. And overnight the race here became the most expensive test yet of whether Republicans and their armies of cash-flush outside groups could unsettle the race at the last minute. The super PACs helped create an opening that paved the way for the Romney campaign to start making its move. The campaign has already invested $1 million in television advertising across the state, and on Thursday it bolstered that effort even further with a new round of commercials that will ensure a heavy and continuous presence through Election Day. This came as the Republican National Committee made one of its largest commitments of the race so far, dropping $2.5 million into the state. Forced to respond, the Obama campaign has put more than $1.5 million into an ad campaign here and is planning even more. Democrats are saying that the race is much closer than they would have guessed just a week ago. “It’s a little tighter than I would have expected,” said Jef Pollock, a pollster for Priorities U.S.A. Action, a Democratic super PAC. “But the question is whether this is just the natural tightening that’s going to happen.” Pennsylvania has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in every election for the last 20 years. Independent pollsters have called it the Republicans’ white whale. Indeed, polls show Mr. Obama ahead, albeit by a shrinking margin. And his senior political strategist, David Axelrod, even joked this week that he would shave off his mustache of 40 years if they lose here. But there is a tangible sense — seen in Romney yard signs on the expansive lawns of homes in the well- heeled suburbs, and heard in the excited voices of Republican mothers who make phone calls to voters in their spare time — that the race is tilting toward Mr. Romney.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1351899219595</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:33:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351900453806-257</Id><Topic><Title>Many People That I Know Are Preparing For A Second Obama Term</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1351821148775</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:52:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...

He could have then chosen to sock his after tax money away, doing nobody but himself much good, but instead chose to invest (i.e., gamble) part of that by putting money into start-ups or ongoing concerns that needed additional funds to grow or survive. Investing is like starting a restaurant. Some work and make a profit. Most fail within the first few years, and an investor loses his/her money. An investment loss gives you a deduction, which is different from a tax credit. According to IRS definitions, a credit comes diectly off the taxes you owe, while a deduction reduces the income subject to taxes. If you owe $12,000 in income taxes and receive a $5,000 tax credit, you reduce your taxes due by $5,000, to $7,000. However, if your income equals $50,000, a deduction of $5,000 reduces your taxable income by $5,000, to $45,000. The actual tax savings in this case depends upon your tax bracket. A capital loss provides the second type of reduction because it reduces your taxable income. In any tax year when your CAPITAL LOSSES are larger than your gains, you have a NET LOSS. You can deduct a MAXIMUM of $3,000 on your annual tax return, or up to $1,500 if you pay taxes as married filing separately. Transfer your net loss from Schedule D to Form 1040, line 13. This excess loss then reduces other forms of taxable income, such as salaries or wages. Translation: If you invest (gamble) with money (yes, even millions) on which you have already paid regular taxes, if you win you deserve to be "rewarded" for helping start/save a business (and to keep its current or hire additional employees) by paying a lower tax rate on that 'AFTER TAX MONEY" you risked. If for no other reason, again, there is no practical limit on how much you can lose but, regardless, the most you can deduct is $3,000. Doesn't sound fair? You conveniently fail to tell both sides of the story. Continue living in your socialistic dream world.</Msg><Username>dm60010</Username><Timestamp>1351903117080</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 20:38:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351903319005-261</Id><Topic><Title>I wish Life could be this easy</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351902856404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 20:34:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it';s only about 2:29 long iam is wanted man in tx the entire thing Passaic NJ 11-24...</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351903319005</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 20:41:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351903727868-262</Id><Topic><Title>Many People That I Know Are Preparing For A Second Obama Term</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1351821148775</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:52:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another massive falsehood.
