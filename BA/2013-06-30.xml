On the Aviation Herald - a website that lists all the aviation incidents around the world - the accident is listed as a "rejected takeoff". But it's much more scary than that. Take a look at Mr Lowe's video below. It is very lucky this accident happened on the ground. There is some debate on his YouTube page over whether the Thomas Cook A330 engine exploded or whether it was just a compressor stall. Still, the fact remains that a huge ball of fire engulfs one of the plane's engines as it taxis down the runway. Either way, that's not good. Mr Lowe continued to film, capturing the response from emergency vehicles. He says it took them two minutes and 46 seconds to arrive on the scene.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1372565750368</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 00:15:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372569510811-2</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer satr pumping BA near 52 week high???</Title><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1372427749889</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 09:55:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>probably good advice.

The California Air and Resources Board (CARB) has published a complete assessment of CO2 impacts for various energy sources. It is comprehensive in that it assesses impacts for all aspects of how a fuel emits CO2. Here is what their data shows for corn ethanol vs. gas for CO2 intensity in grams of CO2 equivalent released per MJ of energy produced. Miidwest corn ethanol 105.1 Gasoline 95.86 There is also the impact to all food prices as corn grown for ethanol reduces supply for food and feed which increases all food costs. Yet Obonzo wants to increase the amount of corn ethanol in gas to 15% from 10% which puts older gas engines at risk of failure and would be worse for the planet than gasoline. People burning E85 are in reality the worst CO2 emitters. Yet we subsidize corn ethanol at the rate of $0.45/gallon.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372598055654</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 09:14:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372601649666-8</Id><Title>US Aviation dmages climate at a level that is 1/4 of all US coal use and it is growing while coal use shrinks</Title><Msg>The science is clear that CO2 released at high altitude cause twice the damage of CO2 released at ground level. There is also scientific evidence that contrails also do damage. When all direct and indirect climate change contributions are calculated for US aviation emissions and contrails, aviation impacts the climate at a level that is minimally 1/4 that of total coal use in the US. While almost everyone benefits from coal use, a necessity which prevents people from freezing to death in winter, a wealthy minority benefit from aviation which is a convenience and not a necessity. In fact if the EPA were to evaluate the per person emissions/benefit profile for aviation vs. coal, aviation on a per person basis is far more damaging to the climate than coal. Obonzo isn't interested in such analysis and chooses instead to mount a war on the poor while protecting the rich who can afford to fly or have private aircraft. The Republicans are the same as Obonzo and will avoid targeting aviation too since they also benefit. So as usual the burden of unfair government climate policy only hurts the poor.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372601649666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 10:14:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372601867347-9</Id><Topic><Title>Crackers, please…</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372549670145</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 19:47:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, These losers only have thier racism to give meaning to their sorry worthless existance.

For the military- it was bad news making it easier to track and fire primative missles. The cure was to raise combustion temperatures, which helped in efficiency ( milage ) . but of course higher temperatures caused significant disassociation of nitrogen- and results in nitrous oxides. When combined with moisture- a very weak nitrous acid is formed- resulting in a partial portion of ' acid rain'. Breathing nitrous fumes as from jet exhaust is also not good. But acid rain is not always as bad as made out- nor is the black smoke all that bad ( except in dense quantities) Point is everything is a trade re the environment- and the results long term are not always as expected. And as for CO2 being ' bad" - not necessairily By the way- contrails are simply ' steam' due to friction- air temperature- and moisture content- and pressure differences- they can be surpressed by chemicals- but the easier way is to avoid certain localized conditions at certain altitudes.- Contrail " steam' is no more hazardrous then true steam from your steam iron ( except for the temperature). assuming you were standing outside at 30K feet- it woud not burn you- any more than a white cloud. Of course- breathing at 30 k would be a problem- but thats another story ;-PP</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1372602628581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 10:30:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372602882501-12</Id><Title>Bugging US Allies</Title><Msg>My Sunday op ed piece: Based on news reports, tts not only everyday US citizens the NSA German gov't leaders are claiming the NSA is bugging European governments.

My intent is to show that determinations as to how to reduce climate impacts is being done on a political basis rather than a cost/benefit economic basis. 600,000 German Households could not afford to heat their homes last winter because of rising energy prices. It is insensitive and offensive for the president to announce that he will arbitrarily raise energy costs to curb CO2 and then get on a jet and emit 850 short tons of CO2 for his vacation. By the time you add in the damage caused by the contrails Obonzo is a one man wrecking crew to the planet compared to anyone using coal. The necessity of coal which provides life saving heat and comfort justifies its CO2 emissions more than the convenience of air travel justifies its CO2 emissions. A per capita cost benefit analysis would show that coal damages the climate far less than aviation. So the wealthier people in society get to skate and the burden of Obonzo's plan falls mostly to the poor. So much for Obonzo's claims of fairness. Atmospheric researchers documented US surface temperature changes after the 911when all aviation was grounded. This led to further research and this............ _ 'Airplane contrails worse than CO2 emissions for global warming: study' (Physics.Org.) In a recent study published in Nature Climate Change, Dr. Ulrike Burkhardt and Dr. Bernd Karcher from the Institute for Atmospheric Physics at the German Aerospace Centre show that the contrails created by airplanes are contributing more to global warming that all the CO2 that has been caused by the entire 108 years of airplane flight. Airplane contrails are the white clouds that we see in the sky spreading behind jets. These cirrus clouds are created when the hot, moist air released from the plane freezes in the colder and drier air. These clouds then trap the long-wave radiation from Earth and create a warming of the atmosphere.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372605460743</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 11:17:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372606854602-18</Id><Topic><Title>US Aviation dmages climate at a level that is 1/4 of all US coal use and it is growing while coal use shrinks</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372601649666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 10:14:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ZO - Economic analysis excludes use of skin color the last I checked.

Let me reference an academic study from Princeton that was reported by progressive bastion NPR. ______________________________________ Searchinger and his colleagues looked globally to figure out where the new cropland is coming from, as American farmers produce fuel crops where they used to grow food. The answer is that biofuel production here is driving agriculture to expand in other parts of the world. "That's done in a significant part by burning down forests, plowing up grasslands. That releases a great deal of carbon dioxide," Searchinger says. In fact, Searchinger's group's study, published online by Science magazine, shows those actions end up releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide. The study finds that over a 30-year span, biofuels end up contributing twice as much carbon dioxide to the air as that amount of gasoline would, when you add in the global effects. "Right now there's little doubt that ethanol is making global warming worse," Searchinger says. _________________________________________ It's even worse than I thought and wrote in my first post. If it wasn't for you Zo I would have missed the fact the corn ethanol is twice as bad as gasoline.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372613242487</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 13:27:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372613453544-29</Id><Topic><Title>US Aviation dmages climate at a level that is 1/4 of all US coal use and it is growing while coal use shrinks</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372601649666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 10:14:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Airplane contrails are the white clouds that we see in the sky spreading behind jets.

My guess is that contrails rarely form at less than 20K feet- which leaves out most prop planes.

That’s what the comedian told Aisha Tyler about Maher, who he says has no business announcing he claims “to know how black someone is”. Here’s what Wayne Brady had to say about HBO’s Bill Maher: “I’ve heard Bill Maher twice now when referencing Obama, he’s like: ‘Yeah, you know with your Wayne Brady’. Well, so that means it’s a diss to Obama to be called me because he wants a brother-brother. He shouldn’t claim to know how black someone is just cause you #$%$ black #$%$. I’ll gladly slap the #$%$ out of Bill Maher in the middle of the street if he wants to know how black Wayne Brady is. Now, Bill Maher would call the cops and he would have his lawyer – I’d get sued and lose my house and it’s not worth it for me.

Holder overturned Section 4(b) of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which mandated federal oversight of changes in voting procedure in jurisdictions that have a history of using a “test or device” to impede enfranchisement. Here is one example of such a test, used in Louisiana in 1964. After the end of the Civil War, would-be black voters in the South faced an array of disproportionate barriers to enfranchisement. The literacy test—supposedly applicable to both white and black prospective voters who couldn’t prove a certain level of education but in actuality disproportionately administered to black voters—was a classic example of one of these barriers. The website of the Civil Rights Movement Veterans, which collects materials related to civil rights, hosts a few samples of actual literacy tests used in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi during the 1950s and 1960s. In many cases, people working within the movement collected these in order to use them in voter education, which is how we ended up with this documentary evidence. Most of the tests collected here are a battery of trivia questions related to civic procedure and citizenship. (Two from the Alabama test: “Name the attorney general of the United States” and “Can you be imprisoned, under Alabama law, for a debt?”) But this Louisiana “literacy” test, singular among its fellows, has nothing to do with citizenship. Designed to put the applicant through mental contortions, the test's questions are often confusingly worded. If some of them seem unanswerable, that effect was intentional. The (white) registrar would be the ultimate judge of whether an answer was correct.

When you lose an engine on the takeoff roll you have to apply a bunch of rudder to compensate for the yaw. There is a speed below V1 (rotation speed) that the rudder has the least amount of effectivity for differential thrust (going slower you have nose gear steering and differential braking). Planes are tested for this by doing a rejected takeoff by cutting fuel to one engine at VMCG, pilot counts one potato, two potato, and then reacts (two seconds is the standard reaction time), applies rudder to compensate and hits the brakes. It's one test that's more fun to watch from the outside than in the plane. If the engine had gone when past V1, they would have taken off, dumped fuel and landed. That is the easier version. If it had let go while airborne it's no beg deal at all (assuming a contained failure and not like the Aussie A380) Been there done that.

It is about the same as the radiative forcing of CO2 without positive feedbacks. Also from ARS Technica: "But water vapor is also a strong greenhouse gas. In fact, compared molecule for molecule, water vapor absorbs 100 times more outgoing infrared (or "longwave") radiation than does carbon dioxide. That means increasing evaporation will cause temperatures to increase even more. That’s a positive feedback—it acts to exacerbate rising temperatures." More work needs to be done on water vapor emissions from jets as it is poorly understood with uncertainty that at this point so too high to warrant a further discussion as it can't be settled yet. However my CO2 emissions are based on EIA data on 2012 jet fuel consumption and the scientifically supported doubling of climate impact it has when burnt at high altitude. I haven't taken the time to plot future aviation growth to determine future impact but I will when I have time/desire. US coal consumption only contributed 1.657Gt of global CO2 of 33Gt of global emissions. Coal represents 31% of US emissions and falling. Attacking US coal is purely political as US consumption peaked in 2005 and has been reduced from that peak level by 24% in 2012. For every 0.1Gt the US cuts in coal based CO2, the Asian Pacific countries will increase by 1.0Gt as they are build coal plants at a rate of one per week. Obonzo's war on coal is a canard that will do little to reduce global CO2 because he plans to only reduce CO2 5% or 0.27Gt by 2020. All this needs to out in open testimony which is what the CBO will be doing soon.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372621283212</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 15:41:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372623205783-44</Id><Topic><Title>Corn ethanol is worse than gas yet Obonzo wants to increase it to 15% as fuel in our cars</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372598055654</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 09:14:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am wondering what you are arguing about.

I previously addressed two of the oil industry’s go-to myths here and here. In this post, I’ll address the false notion that ethanol does not reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to gasoline. Incredibly, the American Petroleum Institute’s anti-RFS “training center” (yes, Big Oil has a “training center” apparently intended to spawn an army of certified RFS haters) has the audacity to claim, “If you thought ‘at least ethanol is environmentally friendlier than gasoline,’ think again.” The module goes on to raise the specter of biofuels-induced land conversion and “ecosystem disruption.” API's recent comments to the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee also made the claim that the RFS is not reducing GHG emissions. The irony of ethanol’s environmental impacts being called into question by the purveyors of tar sands, shale oil, benzene and other toxics, MTBE, petroleum coke, and other not-so-environmentally-friendly products would be downright laughable if it weren’t so disgusting. Myth #3: Ethanol and the RFS are not leading to reduced greenhouse gas emissions from transportation Prior to 2008, there was broad consensus among the scientific and regulatory communities around the fact that modern corn ethanol generates considerably lower GHG emissions than gasoline. Much of the GHG benefit associated with ethanol stems from the fundamental difference between the carbon cycle of biomass and the carbon cycle of fossil fuels. As eloquently explained in a recent paper by scientists from Duke University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the University of Minnesota (note: this is a fascinating paper that compares, head-to-head, the potential lifecycle environment impacts of ethanol and gasoline): A critical temporal distinction</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1372631721083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 18:35:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372631939652-67</Id><Topic><Title>Big Oil = Big Lies abourt CO2 and ethanol</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1372631721083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 18:35:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A critical temporal distinction exists when comparing ethanol and gasoline life-cycles. Oil deposits were established millions of years in the past. The use of oil transfers into today’s atmosphere GHGs that had been sequestered and secured for millennia and would have remained out of Earth’s atmosphere if not for human intervention. While the production and use of bioenergy also releases GHGs, there is an intrinsic difference between the two fuels, for GHG emissions associated with biofuels occur at temporal scales that would occur naturally, with or without human intervention. …Hence, a bioenergy cycle can be managed while maintaining atmospheric conditions similar to those that allowed humans to evolve and thrive on Earth. In contrast, massive release of fossil fuel carbon alters this balance, and the resulting changes to atmospheric concentrations of GHGs will impact Earth’s climate for eons. [1] In other words, biofuels essentially recycle atmospheric carbon. In the case of corn ethanol, for instance, the same amount of CO2 released when the fuel is combusted in an engine has been previously removed from the atmosphere via photosynthesis during growth of corn plant. Although there may be temporary shifts between atmospheric and terrestrial stocks of carbon within the active carbon cycle, the carbon released into the atmosphere during this process is not “new” carbon being introduced into the earth’s carbon cycle. Biogenic carbon emissions then are considered “carbon neutral” based on the feedstock’s carbon uptake. For annual crops like corn, this carbon cycle occurs rapidly (i.e., every year with each new harvest). While CO2 emissions from fuel ethanol combustion are carbon neutral, there are some GHG emissions associated with the production and distribution of the fuel. These supply chain emissions are the primary focus of well-to-wheels “lifecycle analysis.” In the case of corn ethanol, lifecycle analysis includes the emissions related to: the production a</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1372631939652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 18:38:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372632334039-68</Id><Topic><Title>Big Oil = Big Lies abourt CO2 and ethanol</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1372631721083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 18:35:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While CO2 emissions from fuel ethanol combustion are carbon neutral, there are some GHG emissions associated with the production and distribution of the fuel. These supply chain emissions are the primary focus of well-to-wheels “lifecycle analysis.” In the case of corn ethanol, lifecycle analysis includes the emissions related to: the production and use of fertilizers, seed, and other inputs; fuel use by farm machinery; fuel use by trucks/trains hauling corn to ethanol plants; energy use by the ethanol plant (typically natural gas and electricity); and fuel use by trains/trucks to distribute ethanol to blending terminals, and eventually to consumers. Most lifecycle GHG analyses conducted from the mid-1990s through 2007 (including a seminal 2001 study executed by General Motors, Shell, ExxonMobil, BP, and Argonne National Laboratory) concluded that corn ethanol offered well-to-wheels GHG savings in the range 20-30% compared to gasoline. But the understanding of ethanol’s GHG benefits was substantially (and strategically) muddled in early 2008. That’s when former Environmental Defense Fund attorney Timothy Searchinger published an article claiming that corn ethanol expansion in the U.S. would induce “indirect land use changes” (ILUC) in the Amazon rainforest, and that when the emissions from land clearing are allocated to ethanol’s lifecycle, its total GHG profile would be worse than that of gasoline. In essence, Searchinger’s theory posited that increased demand for U.S. corn (for ethanol) would displace U.S. soybean acres, and that farmers in South America would respond by clearing rainforest and expanding soybean acres there. Searchinger’s assumption-driven scenario analysis and slapdash, opaque methods suggested corn ethanol would reduce GHG emissions by 20% compared to gasoline if ILUC is not considered, but would increase GHG emissions by 93% when his hypothetical ILUC scenario was included.

The Searchinger paper sparked significant controversy about the actual occurrence and magnitude of ILUC. It also launched a contentious debate about whether ILUC could be appropriately simulated with existing methodologies and economic modeling tools, all of which were designed for other purposes. Unfortunately, the debate over ILUC was not confined to the ivory towers of academia—it quickly bled into the regulatory sphere as rules for the federal RFS2 and California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) were being drafted. Despite the high uncertainty of modeling simulations, the unsettled debate over estimation methods, and a complete lack of validation or ground-truthing, ILUC penalties prematurely found their way into the RFS2 and LCFS regulations (due in no small part to the relentless lobbying of Big Oil and environmental NGOs). In the five years since Searchinger’s paper was published, more sophisticated models and methodologies have been developed for examining potential ILUCs, more robust input data s</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1372632402368</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 18:46:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372632445731-70</Id><Topic><Title>Big Oil = Big Lies abourt CO2 and ethanol</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1372631721083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 18:35:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Based on newer data and improved methodologies, the independent estimates of corn ethanol LUC produced in the last several years have generally trended in the range of 7-15 grams CO2 equivalent/Mega joule (g/MJ), compared to Searchinger’s outrageous 104 g/MJ, and estimates of about 30 g/MJ by both EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The most recent lifecycle analysis of corn ethanol, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, found that corn ethanol produced in the 2008-2012 timeframe reduced GHG emissions by an average of 34% compared to baseline gasoline. [4] Importantly, that figure includes hypothetical ILUC emissions. If ILUC emissions are excluded from the calculation (i.e., if an equitable comparison of only direct emissions is made), today’s average corn ethanol reduces GHG emissions by 44% relative to gasoline, according to the paper. These results are consistent with several other independent lifecycle analyses of corn ethanol. For example, Liska et al. (2009) in Yale’s Journal of Industrial Ecology found modern corn ethanol reduces direct GHG emissions by 48-59% compared to gasoline. [5] Meanwhile, a report by O’Connor for the International Energy Agency found 2005-era corn ethanol reduced direct GHG emissions by 39% compared to gasoline, with reductions of up to 55% expected in the near future. [6] Further, CARB has certified individual pathways for nearly 30 grain ethanol plants that serve the California market for the state’s Low Carbon Fuels Standard (LCFS). The ethanol produced by these plants reduces direct GHGs by an average of 40-45% relative to baseline gasoline, according to CARB. Incidentally, CARB recently reported that ethanol has provided 80% of the GHG emissions reductions required under the LCFS to date—despite the application of a punitive an indefensible ILUC penalty.

Any unbiased and impartial review of the lifecycle GHG studies and predictive ILUC scenario analyses conducted over the past several years could only lead to the conclusion that corn ethanol undoubtedly reduces GHG emissions relative to petroleum fuels. This is especially true when one considers the increasing GHG intensity of the petroleum fuels used in the U.S. today and in the future, like Canadian tar sands and tight oil from fracking. Consider that CARB recently estimated that the carbon intensity of California gasoline increased from 95.9 g/MJ in 2006 to 99.2 in 2010—an increase of 3.4% in just four years! The carbon footprint of producing and using crude oil will continue to worsen, as unconventional sources make up a larger share of the crude oil slate. Meanwhile, the GHG impacts of ethanol will only get better as crop yields increase, energy inputs decrease, ethanol plants continue to adopt new technologies and efficiencies, and new cellulosic feedstocks are commercialized.

By Mary Elizabeth Williams Rachel Jeantel is a 19-year-old Florida woman. On Facebook and Twitter, she’s been known to post photos of her nails and talk about drinking. She is also the last person to have spoken with Trayvon Martin before George Zimmerman shot him to death last year, the woman who was on the phone with him when his fateful encounter unfolded. She is known in the justice system as Witness #8 in Zimmerman’s trial. She is, in fact, the prosecution’s key witness. But you’d be forgiven if you’d gotten the impression recently that she was sitting up there to defend herself. Jeantel does not fit the comfortable image of the grieving girl. As Rachel Samara wrote Wednesday in Global Grind, “A predominantly white jury is not going to like Rachel Jeantel,” a girl “who has no media training and who is fully entrenched in a hostile environment.” There is confusion over whether or not she was Martin’s girlfriend, which eradicates her chances of being depicted as a devastated young quasi-widow. On the stand, she has been blunt, hostile and at times seemingly confused. Online, she has a documented history that includes partying. She is not thin or blond or demure. So there goes her credibility. This week, the Smoking Gun carefully picked through her social media history, uncovering such bombshells as a recent image of what she described as her “court nails.” She has posted photos of liquor bottles and declared that “wowww I need a drink” and tweeted “party time let get high” [sic]. The Smoking Gun also reports that she’s posted “a sexually suggestive series of photos,” “made references to Martin’s death, referred to acquaintances as #$%$’ and #$%$,’ and wrote about having ‘jack#$%$ lawyers on my #$%$.’” She has in recent days deleted several dozen of her more damning tweets. And so Smoking Gun commenters have, in their turn, declared that she’s not just a “thug” but “proof the gene pool NEEDS more chlorine!” … “and maybe some arsenic too.” Funnily enough, there’s no mention on the site that on Monday she also posted, “I’m a friend #$%$ it,” or that she loves Jill Scott and Janet Jackson. Here is what is true about Jeantel. She has publicly admitted to underage drinking and getting high. She is a poor speller (at least on social media). Her way with words is not calculated to win favor – she has testified that Martin told her “a creepy-#$%$ cracker” was following him. She has responded to the defense’s line of questioning with an icy “You got it?” and “That’s #$%$, sir.” The Daily News describes her diction as “often difficult-to-understand” and says it’s “cringe-worthy” and “humiliating” that she couldn’t read a letter out loud on the stand because she says, “I don’t read cursive.” Jeantel has also admitted to law enforcement that she lied about her initial claim that she didn’t attend Martin’s funeral because she was hospitalized at the time; she now says that she felt too “guilty” to face his parents and “didn’t want to see the body.” She admits that at the beginning of the investigation, she said she was under 18, because she didn’t want to get involved. She is unpolished and emotional. So is she a reliable witness? That’s yet to be determined. And watching her struggling to articulate “the sound of wet gr#$%$” to the jury, you can see not just her frustration but defense lawyer Don West’s undisguised exasperation. But when outlets like MSN gleefully seize upon the fact that she’s posting photographs of her nails, they invite exactly the kind of troubling and deeply offensive conclusions about what a #$%$,” what “ghetto trash,” what an “ugly ho” “buffalo” she is, that they have been racking up ad nauseam. Of course it’s the job of the defense to question her and cast doubt on her testimony. And of course it is significant that her version of events has varied. There’s a lot at stake. George Zimmerman decided Trayvon Martin’s fate on Feb. 26, 2012, and now a jury will decide his. A jury that, by the way, is part of a justice system that is not supposed to exclusively serve the best educated and most articulate of our citizenry. So now would be a good time to point out that Jeantel’s weight, her nails, her sex, her color – these things have precisely jack to do with her account of what happened the night Travyon Martin died. Justice is supposed to serve teenagers too, and people who party and who don’t hide it when they’re angry or flustered, and women who can’t read cursive. It’s supposed to serve people whose dialogue wasn’t written for them by David E. Kelley. Remember that. Remember that Rachel Jeantel is not the one on trial.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372636328689</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 19:52:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372636696085-85</Id><Title>It's A Wendy Davis Nation Now</Title><Msg>It’s a Wendy Davis nation, now For years, Democrats' pro-choice stance was blamed for losing "values" voters. Today, that's all changing fast By Irin Carmon The shouting came, like water bursting from a broken levee, just before midnight. The hundreds, maybe thousands, of orange-shirted activists camped out in the Texas Capitol had done everything they could to stall a vote on an abortion-restricting bill — from staging a citizen’s filibuster late last week, to cheering on the 13-hour one by Sen. Wendy Davis that Tuesday night. “At what point must a female senator raise her hand or voice to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room?” demanded an exasperated Sen. Leticia van de Putte, who had come from her father’s funeral and was trying to prevent the filibuster from being dismantled on procedural grounds. Her words were what did it. Minutes to the deadline for the end of the special session, Senate Republicans seemed to be calling a vote, and shouting was all that was left. For years, observers have said the enthusiasm and mobilization is on the antiabortion side, but not that night. It was still a game of defense, but pro-choice politicians and activists were pushing back harder than ever seen before. Cecile Richards — president of Planned Parenthood and daughter of legendary Texas Gov. Ann Richards — was there, shouting too. ”My mother would have said, I hear America singing,” Richards told Salon after leaving the Capitol. “It was literally an explosion of participatory democracy that I haven’t seen the likes of in Texas in my memory.” The official Twitter account for Barack Obama agreed, tweeting a link to the livestream with, “Something special is happening in Austin tonight.” When the shouting began, pro-choice activist and writer Jessica Luther, who had been prodigiously tweeting, saw her followers outside Texas, who were watching the livestream, say to keep it going, that it was working. In the end, “The yelling was how it was defeated,” said Luther. “They couldn’t get the votes done because they couldn’t talk to each other.” The Texas fight is by no means over: On Wednesday evening, Perry announced he would call another special session, one too long to filibuster, and the probable vote count remains in his favor. But this time, no one will be surprised when opponents — likely hundreds more — put up a massive fight.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372636696085</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 19:58:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372636758957-86</Id><Topic><Title>Crackers, please…</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372549670145</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 19:47:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe McCartney is pretending to be Chris Genna.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372636758957</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 19:59:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372637255836-87</Id><Topic><Title>Union Wages</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1372626998354</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 17:16:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the other four hours was: a. flipping three gallon cans of hot steaming baked beans AFTER they had been passed throughtthe Labeling Machine on a 100 degree day and passing the six gallon-can carton down the roillers to b. b.flip three gallon (or 18 lbs) cans of steaming hot baked beans into the first row of the six gallon can carton, fold the tops of the carton over and send it down some more rollers to ther glue the top of the catrton down machine,,, before the the cartyon was whisked off...probabyl to south carolina,,,,becuase...afterall... ony theM RWNJ souther crakered would want so many Gallon cans of baked beans</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1372637255836</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 20:07:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372638205721-88</Id><Topic><Title>Wii all yo RWNJ do-gooders</Title><Username>spartaloon</Username><Timestamp>1372630966121</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 18:22:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>RWNJ do-gooders... now that is something you do not hear very often in the same sentence unless...</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1372638205721</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 20:23:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372638797436-89</Id><Topic><Title>103.03 1.20(1.18%) 4:00PM EDT|After Hours : 103.38 0.35 (0.34%)</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1371529436075</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 00:23:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nibble ?

One quarter later the ship is righted and with it the deliveries have re-commenced. Boeing had several Dreamliners waiting for delivery when the FAA had lifted the grounding. Boing delivered 7 aircraft in May and 9 in June with delivery later in the summer poised to be at higher rates. Production did slow down as Boeing had spent most of this month in reconfiguring and reconstructing the main 787 final assembly line in building 40-26. Because of this and the Temporary Surge Line in 40-24 being used exclusively for 787-9 final assembly, 787-8 production from Everett was essentially stopped. Aircraft still rolled off the line as these were loaded prior to June but there won't be too many 787s rolling out in Everett during July. Still, we should see the 1st 787-9 rolling off the line in July and most 787s coming out of 40-26 or 40-24 were ones that were already assembled but needed to finish some minor assembly tasks during the next one month. To date Boeing has delivered 17 787s to customers. They have 29 post-L/N 66 Dreamliners waiting for delivery as well which I believe they should deliver by the end of September. Boeing should be able to assemble 27 more 787s through mid November from all three lines. It takes Boeing about 6 weeks from roll out to deliver the aircraft in to the customer though this varies from customer to customer. Additionally, Boeing should be able to deliver 9 787s from EMC in the next 6 months. This would total 65 787s delivered in the second half of the year. Combined with the 17 already delivered and the total project 2013 787 deliveries should be around 82. This total would not include the 787-9 built this year.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1372641981631</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 21:26:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372642059727-105</Id><Title>What do Liberals look for</Title><Msg>in the utopian society? Is Switzerland the nearest country to a utopian society? If you live in a utopian country, is their any need for a military? If not, how do you protect yourself from foreign invasion? Are there workers or does everyone just lie around smoking dope? The perfect society is, what? Do crimes still happen against the innocent? What do you do to criminals? What do you do to murderers? Can a sociopathic narcissist be cured? In a utopia society is everyone of the same level of mentality? It sounds like humans pretending to be perfect in a world that is in chaos! Chaos is perpetual. Perfection is unattainable. Liberal utopians are only perfect in their mind because that is where it can only exist, in your head!
