Fascist ideology consistently invoked the primacy of the state.... Fascism borrowed theories and terminology from socialism but applied them to what it saw as the more significant conflict between nations and races rather than to class conflict, and focused on ending the divisions between classes within the nation. It advocates a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky to secure national self-sufficiency and independence through protectionist and interventionist economic policies. Fascism opposed socialist and communist ideology but was also critical of some aspects of capitalism, arguing for what is sometimes called a Third Position between capitalism and Marxist socialism. Fascist movements emphasized a belligerent, virulent form of nationalism (chauvinism) and a fear of foreign people (xenophobia), which they frequently linked to an exaggerated ethnocentrism. The typical fascist state also embraced militarism, a belief in the rigors and virtues of military life as an individual and national ideal, meaning much of public life is organized along military lines and an emphasis is put on uniforms, parades, and monumental architecture.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362062024085</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:33:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362062038489-23</Id><Topic><Title>Well, The Asteriod Missed by 17,000 Some Miles</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1360983644903</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 22:00:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ford invented Detroit, Ford was is no danger of going bankrupt due to competent management, and took no gubbermint bail-out money .

Boeing on Thursday presented the Japanese government with its plan to address battery problems on its new 787 Dreamliner, stressing that added protections against possible battery fires and overheating are more than enough to allow its planes back in the air. Japanese investigators, however, have maintained that there is still not enough evidence to show that the batteries themselves are the cause of fires, and that a shock could have caused them to overheat. That could complicate Boeing’s efforts to get regulators around the world to approve their fixes, because they focus only on containing any problems that might arise in the batteries. The Japanese assertions have put Japan’s transport safety board at odds with American investigators The pilots Reuters spoke to said the 787 is easy to fly, though one was wary about any quick fix to the battery problems. And what do the pilots of the 787 say about Boeing proposed fix, not good, if the pilot does not want to fly, a passenger might consider that over a CEO in a board room! "Personally, I'm not satisfied by Boeing's proposals as the fundamental cause has not been identified," he said. "I want to fly, but I won't until it's certain the aircraft is safe."</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362064722448</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:18:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362065105065-29</Id><Topic><Title>The Front Man</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1362060931491</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:15:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's really funny how you leftys throw the word Fascist at others when you are the real Fascists.</Msg><Username>zombiegrunt</Username><Timestamp>1362065105065</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:25:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362065312868-30</Id><Topic><Title>Does the President have the Power to kill on US soil with Drones with no trial ?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1362054861257</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 07:34:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a very sad time for our country and that won't change anytime soon.</Msg><Username>zombiegrunt</Username><Timestamp>1362065312868</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:28:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362065509102-31</Id><Title>New Tactic by longs......</Title><Msg>Filling the board with political discussions that overwhelm any discussions on Boeing.

The full ramifications of the banking collapses, ensuing government bailouts and cripplingly high levels of public indebtedness that have resulted have only slowly become apparent.

Officials in the FAA office near Seattle that certifies new planes as safe for flight are reviewing a Boeing proposal to revamp the 787's lithium ion batteries to prevent them from catching fire, or to protect the plane in case of fire, Administrator Michael Huerta said. Once he receives their evaluation, it's still up to Huerta to decide whether to accept the plan. He declined to say when he might make that decision, or how long it might be before the planes are back in the air. "It's a very long proposal (with) a lot of technical detail in it," Huerta said. "I'm reviewing it myself, as well as relying on the teams that are reviewing it."</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362071527407</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:12:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071527652-52</Id><Topic><Title>Does the President have the Power to kill on US soil with Drones with no trial ?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1362054861257</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 07:34:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It’s plausible in certain extraordinary circumstances he could legally order a drone strike in the UN during an extraordinary event. It would involve a scenario akin to a police sharpshooter taking out a person who has taken hostages and is threatening to kill them. For example, intelligence reports it has a credible report someone in a rural area is making nerve gas, and it is decided the only safe way to observe without detection this person is via drone. When the drone is on location the subject is observed in full chemical protective gear wiring explosive charges on barrels in the back of a truck, and on some of the barrels markings indicate at one time they contained the precursors for making nerve gas. Now here are the choices, send in the police and hope they get there before he leaves to a populated area and kills thousands, and if they get there in time risk having all of the officers killed by the subject blowing up the barrels, or take him out with the drone with little or no collateral damage? The only issue I can see with this scenario is the person who presses the fire button should be a valid law enforcement officer, like an FBI agent, which in an incident like I am theorizing about would without doubt be on the site of the drone operations. As a matter of fact, in such an incident the FBI agent could lawfully fire the drone’s weapons without presidential authority, but to get to this point it would likely involve the president to authorized the joint military law enforcement mission.</Msg><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1362071527652</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:12:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071605493-53</Id><Topic><Title>BA CEO Buying Shares!</Title><Username>tasha_cook</Username><Timestamp>1361981972208</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 11:19:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>willis.bachmann</Username><Timestamp>1362071605493</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:13:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071825278-54</Id><Topic><Title>BA Insider Trading Reported !!!</Title><Username>doris.shealey</Username><Timestamp>1361811207875</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 11:53:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful information! thanks for sharing!</Msg><Username>gore_colleen</Username><Timestamp>1362071825278</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:17:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071881820-55</Id><Topic><Title>Rising Again!</Title><Username>grady.devos</Username><Timestamp>1362064569519</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:16:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DANGEROUS SCAM REPORTED !</Msg><Username>alphonite</Username><Timestamp>1362071881820</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:18:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362071987148-56</Id><Topic><Title>BA CEO Buying Shares!</Title><Username>tasha_cook</Username><Timestamp>1361981972208</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 11:19:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful information! thanks for sharing!</Msg><Username>gore_colleen</Username><Timestamp>1362071987148</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:19:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362073547586-57</Id><Title>787 faces extensive tests to return to air, FAA chief says</Title><Msg>787 faces extensive tests to return to air, FAA chief says Michael Huerta says FAA will require extensive testing of proposed fix for 787’s lithium-ion battery problem. Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta said Wednesday that Boeing won’t get its 787 Dreamliners back into passenger service without extensive testing and recertification of its proposed fix for the jet’s lithium-ion battery problem. In testimony before a congressional subcommittee, Huerta said he expects a report from his technical staff next week that will offer an assessment of the fix Boeing formally proposed last Friday. But he said FAA approval for Boeing to develop its fix will only be the start. “Once we approve the plan, then we have to go through the process of actually implementing the plan, which will involve a great deal of testing, a great deal of further analysis and re-engineering before these planes are back in the air,” Huerta said. He did not cite any potential time frame, but the requirement for extensive testing, analysis and re-engineering suggests a long time .

The proposed fixes are designed to reduce the likelihood that a fire would spread, to better contain such a fire, and to better vent the smoke and fumes. It is time to re-build Boeing. The good starting point would be bringing the Boeing headquarters back to Seattle. This should be followed with acknowledgement, that engineers and not managers should have the final say in technical aspects of Boeing operations. Those engineers who lost their jobs because they would not falsify reports as demanded by their managers will be watching with great interest inevitable, premature fatigue damage on major structural components. One can only regret, that the culprits will still continue their arrogant march towards the next 787 grounding.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362073690201</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:48:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362074316506-59</Id><Topic><Title>February delivery update</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362071237367</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:07:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks, I guess thats great news KUDOS to all the workers who built them</Msg><Username>santac001</Username><Timestamp>1362074316506</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:58:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362074334416-60</Id><Topic><Title>FAA's Lead man HUERTA is short BA</Title><Username>genesisautos</Username><Timestamp>1362014520188</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 20:22:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I knew it was a good trade, BA moves into the 25th spot as the most shorted dow stock bahahahbhahaha. remember i will put my money where my mouth is and literally eat my hat and post it on you tube if this ends up being a losing trade. looking for a little spike to short another 50 shares. http://www.forbes.com/sites/dividendchannel/2013/02/28/boeing-becomes-25-most-shorted-dow-stock-replacing-cisco-systems/?partner=yahootix</Msg><Username>genesisautos</Username><Timestamp>1362074334416</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:58:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362074463034-61</Id><Title>Boeing PR, 787, and change is corporate policy</Title><Msg>We can only hope Boeing management sees the light and realizes that a flaming 787 falling out of the sky would be 'bad PR' because clearly they don't care that hundreds of lives are endangered. Boeing lost the gamble on this one - it proved out-sourcing is a total failure. It's time to give the machinists and engineers what they want to get the rest of the programs back on track. The Firebird/Phoenix is a total loss. Once upon a time you could find this Boeing Technology Philosophy on the Boeing web page. "Boeing has been building safe airplanes since 1916. The Boeing technology philosophy is a time-proven design guide-line that helps ensure the safety of all Boeing commercial airplanes. Boeing will not use new technologies, or the capabilities they make possible, unless they provide a distinct safety, operational, or efficiency advantages and do not compromise existing safety. Advancements that fail this simple test simply do not fly aboard Boeing jetliners. Why? Because the ill-considered appliation of new technologies can lead to unintended consequences that compromise the safety already achieved." This was removed from the Boeing website early in the 787 program. Another Boeing quote has also been problematic for many of us. "Managers are responsible for creating an open and honest environment in which employees feel comfortable in bringing isses forward. Retaliation against employees who raise genuine concerns will not be tolerated." In practice, a concern that identifies inevitable outcomes is not "genuine" when measured against "business" imperatives. Upon questioning, it was impossible to find a policy that would actually apply a punishment if this directive was violated. This concept has been totally missing from Boeing for many years.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362074463034</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 13:01:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362074659450-62</Id><Topic><Title>Rising Again!</Title><Username>grady.devos</Username><Timestamp>1362064569519</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:16:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree.

The second it completes a test cycle it can restart. This alone will gather data faster than you can with real flights and get it would out any danger to anyone, but is isn’t the only way you can speed up getting the data the FAA wants, you can run multiple tests in unison. Put a dozen batteries in test at the same time and in a month you could accumulate 3 years, or more of simulated flight data. Add enough batteries and in a month you could generate decades worth of test data, so in the end this doesn’t mean it is going to take a long time, jus that it is going to take a lot of testing, which won’t be cheap just because it can be done quickly.</Msg><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1362076445730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 13:34:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362076538357-71</Id><Title>When the 787 is canned is the plastic shell going to be expensive to scrap ?</Title><Msg>Can they take it to any junk yards or is it toxic.?</Msg><Username>art.constantine</Username><Timestamp>1362076538357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 13:35:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362076566922-72</Id><Topic><Title>A description of the Republican Party</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362062024085</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:33:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Repubs are annihilating themselves with one extremist position after another and none as despicable as rigging elections and working to prevent every American from “most evident of truths – that all of us are created equal,” because part and parcel of fascism is reserving equality for a privileged few elite; a particularly fascist Republican tenet of authoritarian rule.</Msg><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1362076566922</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 13:36:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362076590237-73</Id><Title>787 will need to be cut-up before sent to junk yard</Title><Msg>It can not fly, can not fit on a train or truck. #$%$ are they goiing to do with them</Msg><Username>art.constantine</Username><Timestamp>1362076590237</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 13:36:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362076593677-74</Id><Topic><Title>Well, The Asteriod Missed by 17,000 Some Miles</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1360983644903</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 22:00:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow!

"Still, the Journal adds that Boeing's "aggressive timetable" for test flights easily could slide if regulators need to be further convinced about the jet-maker's battery tweaks."9 hours ago . A better indicator is the customer , read "Most airlines that have Dreamliners say they have removed the 787 from their flight schedules through the end of spring. One carrier - Polish carrier LOT - has taken the Dreamliner out of its schedules through October." Testing can be done after the FAA give the ok, but that does not mean certification, and if any problems come up in testing that schedule can be extended testing is not certification to produce or sell or deliver the 787 it is experimental examination of a problem that as yet has not been identified. So what makes you thing the problem can be fixed soon/ the problem symptom is known fire and that is unacceptable. Any fire contained or not is an emergency grounding and emergency landing .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362082382158</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 15:13:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362082943375-96</Id><Topic><Title>787 faces extensive tests to return to air, FAA chief says</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362073547586</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:45:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let me remind you that you said flaming 787s or have you forgotten?</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1362082943375</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 15:22:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362083025250-97</Id><Topic><Title>Dow close to new high up 7.4% YTD and 14.86% for 5 years Boeing up 2.2% YTD and 4.4% for 5 years hummm</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362064722448</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:18:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>freeveritas, so the DOW Jones has 30 stocks, and one of them is Boeing, so freeveritas that is more like comparing 30 oranges and picking one that is not rotten ! freeveritas can you pick a good orange out of 30 and not the rotten one? freeveritas, it is easy just compared the 30 stock like you would 30 oranges if the average Dow Jones stock gained 7.14% and Boeing only 4.4% then Boeing would be the rotten orange, get it oranges to oranges.

However, the real damage being done to the mediocre class is self inflicted. It's like they have some kind of masochistic desire to self destruct by by digging in their heels in a trench of denial about the insane policies that Obama and the Democrats are using to pile debt upon debt on themselves, their children and their grand children. It's as though they just can't grasp the reality of the fact there are real consequences to this insanity. I realize most people will never experience the liberty of living debt free like myself but believe me, it's a goal worthy of aspiration. It's the key to becoming a rich guy like me. The mediocre class seems to have resigned its self to never being anything but mediocre failures in life.....never truly excelling in anything worth wile in life. I call it the chris_genna syndrome because he's an example most people on this board will recognize. Denial will not erase the consequence of spending money we don't have any more than maxing out your credit cards in your personal life will.

This is a charming and salutary Japanese custom that we should adopt. I’m waiting for the Jim McNerney apology tour in America. It might go something like this: “To Boeing’s shareholders, customers, vendors and, especially, employees, I’m deeply sorry that we — and I regret to say this includes my predecessor, St. Alan Mulally — attempted to build the world’s most advanced airliner on the cheap, with an untested and reckless outsourcing program that led to repeated delays, finally grounding, and putting the very future of the company at risk. I deeply regret the weak corporate governance that allowed this, and as a result I will give up the title of chairman to an independent director. I will ask all the directors to resign and appoint only those who pass a medical exam that shows they have a spine. I will give up all of my compensation for the past five years and if the 787 isn’t flying flawlessly this year, I will resign as chief executive… “To our employees in the Puget Sound, I owe a special apology. I’m sorry we moved the headquarters to Chicago. The hot dogs are superior, but otherwise the company’s top executives are too far removed from the critical commercial airplane business and from Asia. I’m sorry we made a hash of the outsourcing that you now have to fix. I’m sorry we tried to deflect accountability that rightly rests with management decisions by blaming our unionized workers and set up an assembly in South Carolina to punish and intimidate them…” (bows deeply here toward machinists, engineers and technical workers, whispering reverently, “No nerds, no birds” several times.) “The perfectly legal but morally reprehensible tax dodging? Sorry. We’ll pay our share to the country that has given us everything. I’m also sorry about McDonnell Douglas. I wasn’t around to keep them from using Boeing’s money to take over Boeing, but I could have stopped the McDonnell bean-counter culture from swamping Boeing historic and successful dominance by engineering excellence. Finally, I want to apologize to Jack Welch, whose backside I smooched lo those many years and still didn’t get the top job at GE. Jack, I’m sorry I listened to a word you ever said. Your methods may be good for looting the wealth of corporations and sending it to people who are already rich, but they’re no way to run a great American company. One more thing: I’m sorry to have been hiding in the bunker, following the advice of lawyers and flacks to ‘keep a low profile.’ As events have shown, this is a counterproductive, even stupid, approach. I’m getting paid to be Boeing’s leader and I intend to lead out front, with transparency and accountability starting right now.” It will never happen. If it did, it would shake corporate America to its bones. Who would play McNerney in the movie? George Clooney? Or Bryan Cranston?</Msg><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1362098624997</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 19:43:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362099497027-143</Id><Topic><Title>Well, The Asteriod Missed by 17,000 Some Miles</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1360983644903</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 22:00:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't it some kind of miracle that cluck head 00 and ticolow50 SOMEHOW write exactly, precisely like jumbosca**ski?

The cuts, which chiefly target contract workers, are not uncommon as productivity improves on a new airplane program and were conceived before major problems with the 787s battery surfaced, the Journal said. Two high-profile battery malfunctions led to international aviation regulators grounding the jetliner in mid-January. The cuts could account for up to 20 percent of the workforce in some teams at the plant in North Charleston, South Carolina, the Journal reported, citing an unnamed source familiar with the plan. Overall, the plant employs more than 6,000 people. Boeing did not confirm the layoffs, but did tell Reuters it plans to reduce reliance on contract workers at the South Carolina plant. "Boeing regularly uses contract labor and 'industry assist' to supplement its workforce during surge activities and on development programs that require a production ramp up - that's standard practice in the aerospace industry," said Marc Birtel, a Boeing spokesman. "As we progress in improving efficiencies in our processes, training our entry-level employees and growing the experience of our team in South Carolina, we expect to continue to reduce reliance on contract labor/industry assist to meet our production objectives." The South Carolina plant is the second Boeing facility where 787s are assembled after the larger Everett, Washington, facility north of Seattle. Between them, Boeing turns out five Dreamliners per month. So far, the plane maker has said production has not been slowed by the grounding of the 787 and it aims to fulfill its plan to ramp up to 10 787s per month by the end of 2013.
