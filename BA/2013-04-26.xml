Military is even worse. The learning curve concept was formally introduced by T.P. Wright (Wright, 1936) through his pioneering empirical study on the productivity trends of the production of aircraft. Since that time, and especially following World War II, the learning curve concept has been extensively researched and applied in numerous settings. While the most publicized applications are related to the production of aircraft and defense products, other products have also experienced similar learning trends. The most popular learning curve model that is used today is the same one that was proposed by Wright, i.e., that production costs decrease by a certain percentage each time the quantity produced doubles. It is sometimes referred to as the cumulative average cost model, or simply as the Wright model.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1366951856027</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:50:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366960862866-2</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing nice jump today in stock price</Title><Username>fred.white72</Username><Timestamp>1366820844312</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 12:27:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still waiting for Wayne to spin how (in his world) the BA bottom was 55 and not 29.36 on March 3, 2009.

Analysts have been saying for years that ObamaCare wil increase, not decrease costs. Just recently we learned the average healthcare plan for a family of four under ObamaCare will cost a minimum of $20,000 annually. When ObamaCare was upheld by the Supreme Court in June 2012, Speier praised the ruling and released the following statement. "In short, today marks a turning point in America’s long struggle to make a dream into reality - the dream of affordable health coverage for every American. Work remains, but the goal line is in sight." Yesterday POLITICO reported both Republicans and Democrats on the Hill are in talks to exempt politicians and their staff from ObamaCare.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1366981233646</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:00:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366983465875-12</Id><Topic><Title>Whe do Liberals hate the TEA Party so much?</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1366743222076</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 14:53:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The TEA Party is for Congress Obeying the Constitution.

The second huge financial scandal of the year reveals the real international conspiracy: There's no price the big banks can't fix Rolling Stone April 25, 2013 by Matt Taibbi Conspiracy theorists of the world, believers in the hidden hands of the Rothschilds and the Masons and the Illuminati, we skeptics owe you an apology. You were right. The players may be a little different, but your basic premise is correct: The world is a rigged game. We found this out in recent months, when a series of related corruption stories spilled out of the financial sector, suggesting the world's largest banks may be fixing the prices of, well, just about everything. You may have heard of the Libor scandal, in which at least three – and perhaps as many as 16 – of the name-brand too-big-to-fail banks have been manipulating global interest rates, in the process messing around with the prices of upward of $500 trillion (that's trillion, with a "t") worth of financial instruments. When that sprawling con burst into public view last year, it was easily the biggest financial scandal in history – MIT professor Andrew Lo even said it "dwarfs by orders of magnitude any financial scam in the history of markets." That was bad enough, but now Libor may have a twin brother. Word has leaked out that the London-based firm ICAP, the world's largest broker of interest-rate swaps, is being investigated by American authorities for behavior that sounds eerily reminiscent of the Libor mess. Regulators are looking into whether or not a small group of brokers at ICAP may have worked with up to 15 of the world's largest banks to manipulate ISDAfix, a benchmark number used around the world to calculate the prices of interest-rate swaps. Interest-rate swaps are a tool used by big cities, major corporations and sovereign governments to manage their debt, and the scale of their use is almost unimaginably massive.

The convenience of this claim is that it directs attention away from examining the connections of these two individuals, including their relations with US intelligence agencies. There are a number of possible explanations for the actions of the Tsarnaev brothers. One is that they were driven by hostility to US foreign policy. Indeed there are some reports that the younger brother, Dzhokhar, has told interrogators that he is deeply opposed to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Another, and not mutually exclusive, possibility is that the brothers, and particularly Tamerlan, were being developed as assets or potential assets of US imperialism’s machinations in Chechnya and neighboring Dagestan. The region is critical to Russian geo-strategic interests because it is central to Russia’s access to the energy-rich Caspian Sea. US intelligence agencies have a long and sordid relationship with Islamic fundamentalist groups operating in Chechnya. The US also has close ties to neighboring Georgia and in 2008 supported Georgia in a war with Russia over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. According to the Russian newspaper Izvestia, during his time in the Caucasus, Tsarnaev attended seminars organized by the Fund of the Caucasus, which is tied to the US-backed Jamestown Foundation. The Jamestown Foundation, which supports Chechen separatism, was established with the assistance of former CIA Director William Casey and includes on its board of directors a bipartisan group of top figures in the intelligence, military and political establishment.....</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1366996987384</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:23:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366997111967-60</Id><Topic><Title>Everything Is Rigged: The Biggest Price-Fixing Scandal Ever</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1366996983550</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:23:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>read the rest at Rolling Stone Free Markets my #$%$</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1366997111967</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:25:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366997159145-61</Id><Topic><Title>George W.

If attacked Americans seem to be willing to go to war without regrets. Otherwise we don't want to spend the money even if the loss of life is not that high by past standards. I think that is true. I think that most people know this. As far a debt us concerned, it is debt to GDP that matters. If you grow debt at a slower rate than GDP growth then the country can afford to service it and thus it is sustainable. If you grow debt at a faster rate than GDP then it is unsustainable. I don't think I have to explain to anyone who has grown debt at unsustainable rates. We all know who done this. I think the two most significant problems we have in this country is too many people trying to get for themselves at the expense of others and a government who is not strict enough with our trading partners when other countries suppress their currency valuations such that it results in trade deficits for us and thus our jobs to get exported to them. Government unions intimidate politicians into buying their vote with unsustainable benefits and salaries or they can't get elected. What does a union do? If you give everyone in the country a 10% raise then prices go up 10% and no one gets the raise in the end. What a union does is that they get more raises for a select few so they come out ahead of others who don't get as high of raises but at who's expense? And then they restrict membership to those in the select club and their friends who they help get jobs when there are openings. Yet the people who pay the cost of their inflated wages are not in their club and thus they make less. Of course if everyone was in a union then it would be pointless because the higher wages would get inflated away. It has been corrupted into a mechanism for exploitation.</Msg><Username>raybans2</Username><Timestamp>1366997159145</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:25:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366997587180-62</Id><Topic><Title>Comparing the TEA Party and it's Policies</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1366991424329</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 11:50:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You bet we find him likeable for many reasons- he isn't a white supremacist like you guys- and he defied your anachronistic thinking about national health care and gave us Obama care.

Barry has been doing his best to present the Republicans as the extremists that need to be feared in the US and if he draws attention to Islamojihadist terror, it distracts form the messaging he wants. His tactic is to create propaganda that this was lone wolf activity shut down any further investigation into the strong possibility that it was more than a lone wolf attack and refocus the press on helping him paint Republicans as the domestic terrorists again. The MSM was soooooo on board with assisting Barry with creating the meme that Republicans are the extremist threat to the USA, that you could see the disappointment when they discovered a right wing extremist was not involved in the bombings. To have Tom Brokaw suggesting that Barry was to blame due to his drown strikes is a nightmare for Barry as this creates a fissure for him on the left.

One could argue that New Orleans is a city that should not even exist any longer because of its precarious situation of being below sea level. By helping them rebuild we are perpetuating the myth that they have a viable situation given their unwillingness to ensure that their own levies are reliable. The upkeep of which is an expense that they should have incurred, not us. And if they had done what they should have done then there would be no need for federal help. What happens when global warming causes the entire state of Florida to need dikes to keep them from being submerged when a single breach could put the entire state under water and thus create a national financial crisis? Is the rest of the country supposed to build those as well simply because they want them? And since higher temperatures mean more frequent and more violent hurricanes, isn't it logical for people to move out of these regions to places where there would be no need to help them anymore? Aren’t we just postponing decisions that individuals would have logically made on their own absent such help simply so that politicians can win votes from grateful people who want it because they don’t want to incur personal financial losses because they built in a place where it was unwise to do so?

Eliot Engel, D-New York, said the U.S. government -- which currently supplies "nonlethal aid" to Syrian rebels -- must start "to immediately arm vetted elements of the Syrian opposition." _____________________________________________ I keep telling some fanatical types on this board that Dems were for the Bush war before they were against it and like farts just followed political winds of dwindling public support for the war. Dems including Barry kept voting for more funding and more troop surges. Now Dems are talking about weapons of mass destruction and sound a lot like Bush in their willingness to get further involved in promoting a war in Syria. Remember how we armed funded the Kurds first before we went in? To most of us non-fanatics it sure looks and sounds like the same war mongering rhetoric that Bush was accused of with Feinstein's 'red line' eerily similar to Bush41's "line in the sand" and 'weapons with the ability to kill tens of thousands' eerily similar to Bush43's "weapons of mass destruction".

Barry didn't know squat in 2002 but once in congress Barry voted to support every request to fund the Iraq war including the surge. Against the advice of his attorneys Barry continued the Bush war without seeking congressional review. That's about as good of an endorsement as you will see for the Bush policy Hooz. The reason I find you so clueless is that you are swayed by words and passion. Only emotionally undeveloped political neophytes are stirred by the empty words of Barry's speeches. I can see high school and college kids being unsophisticated and being fooled by Barry's BS but I judge people not on empty politicized rhetoric but rather on their actions. Barry was always a big talker like his big talk about being a reformer in Illinois. Hundreds of "present" votes later he was still doing nothing but taking up space in the Illinois Senate no better than a bump on a log not doing a damn thing to reform Illinois. Barry wasa the brunt of jokes about being the "unreformer" and an empty suit. I'm amazed you're still fooled by this empty suit. You're still acting like a 14 year girl with a crush but no brain.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367015419832</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 18:30:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367018105034-95</Id><Title>Republicans Lead the Best-Run States in America, Democrats Dominate the Worst</Title><Msg>The annual Best and Worst Run States in America survey by 24/7 Wall St. came out today, revealing that the top 5 states are led by Republicans while the bottom five are dominated by Democrats. The list is based on a review of data for financial health, standard of living and government services. While noting that current situations may stem from decisions made years ago and that external factors like weather can be as much to blame as poor governance, 24/7 Wall St. also points out that all of the high-ranking states have “well-managed budgets” and the worst states have “high debt relative to both income and expenditure.” Here’s how it breaks down at the top and bottom of the list cross-referenced with details on party control based on this map from Americans for Tax Reform: Best run: 1. North Dakota 2. Wyoming 3. Nebraska 4. Utah 5. Iowa Bottom % 46. New York 47. W. Virginia 48. Illinois 49. Rhode Island 50.

Egypt is being run by a terrorist enabler. Do you see that as an Obama win? 'The chameleon is finally showing his true colors.' From SF Gate Since taking office in June, Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's not-so-new president, has been equivocating, trying to balance Egypt's long-standing diplomatic and financial relationship with the West with his true self: a Muslim Brotherhood fundamentalist who is contemptuous of the West, hates Israel and wants to turn Egypt into a fully Islamic state. "He speaks of moderation for the West," Perihan Abou-Zeid, a 28-year-old Egyptian officer for a media-production company in Cairo, told me. "But then when Salafists blow up churches, there are no arrest warrants." And Egypt experts agree: You can't be a Muslim Brotherhood officer without holding as your goal the imposition of Shariah law nationwide. When Hamas began firing hundreds of missiles at Israel this month, and Israel understandably responded, Morsi's deceptive duality fell away. He gave himself away.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367018136507</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 19:15:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367018332468-97</Id><Topic><Title>Everything Is Rigged: The Biggest Price-Fixing Scandal Ever</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1366996983550</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:23:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's called the Middel Way, and it works a lot better than anger.

Barry said, "Let's fight to wean ourselves off Middle East oil through an energy policy that doesn't simply serve the interests of Exxon and Mobil." What an #$%$ and a liar Barry has been on this issue. He has done everything to prevent the USA from becoming independent of Mideast oil. He slowed drilling in the Gulf and Atlantic and he has not allowed any new drilling on government land where huge reserves exist. He spouted all that nonsense that you bought into about peak oil and we have scince found enormous new reserves in North America, so much so that in spite of every effort for Obama to keep us dependent on Arab oil we will become a net exporter of oil and gas by 2020.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367019198829</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 19:33:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367020411173-100</Id><Topic><Title>Comparing the TEA Party and it's Policies</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1366991424329</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 11:50:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And the hard-core racists you mention are nearly 100% loyal Republican voters.

The building will be expanded by 14,000 square meters (150,000 square feet) to a total of 62,000 square meters (665,000 square feet) of manufacturing space. It will be used mainly to construct the one-piece composite acoustic inner barrel on the newly designed engine nacelle inlet for the 737 MAX. The inner barrel is one of the latest quiet engine technologies that will be employed on the 737 MAX to help reduce the operational noise of the airplane by up to 40 percent. "Boeing Canada Winnipeg has a great future ahead in support of unprecedented production rates," said Kevin Bartelson, general manager, Boeing Canada Winnipeg. "Earlier this year, we negotiated a successful contract extension with our local Canadian Auto Workers union. This contract ensures we have the stable workforce, skills and now the manufacturing space we need to take on exciting new production for the 737 MAX." The expanded building, which includes two bays about the size of 12 Olympic-sized swimming pools, will house the 737 MAX and some 787 Dreamliner production. Construction will begin immediately on the west side of the existing Murray Park facility, with an estimated completion by the fourth quarter of 2014. Today's event was held in conjunction with Stantec and Graham Construction, the design-builders of the facility.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1367021696913</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 20:14:56
