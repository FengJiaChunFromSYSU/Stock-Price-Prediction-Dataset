This company is going the way of Hostess, the executives will be paid millions of dollars in bankruptcy golden parachutes and the stockholders and rank and file workers will get nothing .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359975256646</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 05:54:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359975613855-32</Id><Topic><Title>FIRE HAZARD ON BOARD...What did Boeing know and When did they know it?</Title><Username>snthsnth1</Username><Timestamp>1359559418338</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:23:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hold4triple, you comment tis looking good now with all the batteries that were replaced and the Boeing engineers talking about short and radio shack outsourced level parts being used on a 200 million dollar plane to save costs .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359975613855</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 06:00:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359975853311-33</Id><Topic><Title>Down Again???</Title><Username>reorrr</Username><Timestamp>1359418357350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:12:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so far the plane is certainly on the ground the 787 is grounded 600 million dollar lawsuit, 1.5 billion dollar pension shortfall, SPEEA striek most likely, the idea of outsourcing did fly inthe board room but not for the customers.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359975853311</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 06:04:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359976807879-34</Id><Title>When did Boeing know that the fire on a 787 could not be put out in flight?</Title><Msg>In 2006, a devastating lab fire in Arizona showed just how volatile Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner lithium-ion battery can be if its energy is not adequately contained. A single battery connected to prototype equipment exploded, and despite a massive fire-department response the whole building burned down. Unless such events will occur only very rarely, Boeing’s engineering solution won’t be tenable as a practical matter. Two 787 battery incidents in quick succession out of 18,000 in-service flights so far isn’t close to rare enough. That’s why the jet fleet is grounded worldwide as investigations continue.The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) raised concerns about Boeing’s battery-fire-protection plan in the course of the FAA certification process. During the public-comment period in 2007, the pilots union stressed that “a fire from these devices, in any situation, is unacceptable.” if an internal cell shorts and overheats, “the electrolyte can catch on fire and that can self-sustain.” “Something like that is very difficult to put out,” Sinnett said. “Because the electrolyte contains an oxidizer, fire suppressants just won’t work.”</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359976807879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 06:20:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359977283930-35</Id><Topic><Title>BA has no idea how to make 787 safe</Title><Username>olderdud</Username><Timestamp>1359390226749</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 11:23:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>olderdud, Hopefully the Boeing board is doing their own root cause review on how that came about so they can take corrective actions - like removing certain executives from their posts.

James Pohl. Pohl’s comments came after an unknown censor cut off a live media feed to the court proceedings as David Nevin, a lawyer defending Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, began discussing his request for information on his client’s case. *** A court security officer positioned next to the judge has the ability to dump the feed if anything secret arises. That officer didn’t activate the censorship button on Monday. *** “I would like to know who has the permission to turn that light on and off, who is listening to this, who is controlling these proceedings, or controlling that aspect of these proceedings,” Nevin said. This is just one of a series of outrages regarding investigation and trial of alleged 9/11 terrorists. In 2008, the former chief prosecutor for Guantánamo’s military commissions disclosed that the trials have been rigged to prevent the possibility of acquittal. Specifically, the head of the Guantanamo tribunal — who is actually in charge of both prosecuting and defending the suspects — told the former chief prosecutor: Wait a minute, we can’t have acquittals. If we’ve been holding these guys for so long, how can we explain letting them get off? We can’t have acquittals, we’ve got to have convictions. In addition, three other Guantanamo prosecutors — Maj. Robert Preston, Capt. John Carr and Capt. Carrie Wolf — “asked to be relieved of duties after saying they were concerned that the process was rigged. One said he had been assured he didn’t need to worry about building a proper case; convictions were assured.” Another former Guantanamo prosecutor resigned, saying in a sworn declaration that the government pulled all sorts of shenanigans in one case. The head of the tribunal also said that — even if the defendants are somehow acquitted — they may not be released from Guantanamo. No wonder the American Bar Association, “which the Pentagon had said would help arrange such representation, has refused to participate because it objects to the trial procedures.” And no wonder the defense attorneys who have agreed to represent the defendants say that the process is completely unfair.

MSNBC speculated that the U.S. put a “stun belt” on alleged terrorist Moussaoui during his trial to keep him in line: 9/11 Commissioners Slam Blatant Obstruction of Justice The 9/11 Commissioners publicly expressed anger at cover ups and obstructions of justice by the government into a real 9/11 investigation: The Commission’s co-chairs said that the CIA (and likely the White House) “obstructed our investigation” 9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey said that “There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version . . . We didn’t have access . . . .” 9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said “We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting” 9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission, stating: “It is a national scandal”; “This investigation is now compromised”; and “One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America. But this White House wants to cover it up” The Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission (John Farmer) – who led the 9/11 staff’s inquiry – said “At some level of the government, at some point in time…there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened“. He also said “I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described …. The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years…. This is not spin. This is not true.” And the Co-Chair of the official Congressional Inquiry Into 9/11 – and former head of the Senate Intelligence Committee – has called for a new 9/11 investigation. Some examples of obstruction of justice into the 9/11 investigation include: An FBI informant hosted and rented a room to two hijackers in 2000. Specifically, investigators for the Congressional Joint Inquiry discovered that an FBI informant had hosted and even rented a room to two hijackers in 2000 and that, when the Inquiry sought to interview the informant, the FBI refused outright, and then hid him in an unknown location, and that a high-level FBI official stated these blocking maneuvers were undertaken under orders from the White House. As the New York Times notes: Senator Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who is a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused the White House on Tuesday of covering up evidence ….The accusation stems from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s refusal to allow investigators for a Congressional inquiry and the independent Sept. 11 commission to interview an informant, Abdussattar Shaikh, who had been the landlord in San Diego of two Sept. 11 hijackers. The chairs of both the 9/11 Commission and the Official Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 said that Soviet-style government “minders” obstructed the investigation into 9/11 by intimidating witnesses The 9/11 Commissioners concluded that officials from the Pentagon lied to the Commission, and considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements The tape of interviews of air traffic controllers on-duty on 9/11 was intentionally destroyed by crushing the cassette by hand, cutting the tape into little pieces, and then dropping the pieces in different trash cans around the building as shown by this NY Times article (summary version is free; full version is pay-per-view) and by this article from the Chicago Sun-Times As reported by ACLU, FireDogLake, RawStory and many others, declassified documents shows that Senior Bush administration officials sternly cautioned the 9/11 Commission against probing too deeply into the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 Both the 9/11 Trials and the 9/11 Commission Investigation Were Based on Unreliable Evidence Produced by Torture The CIA videotaped the interrogation of 9/11 suspects, falsely told the 9/11 Commission that there were no videotapes or other records of the interrogations, and then illegally destroyed all of the tapes and transcripts of the interrogations. 9/11 Commission co-chairs Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton wrote: Those who knew about those videotapes — and did not tell us about them — obstructed our investigation. The chief lawyer for Guantanamo litigation – Vijay Padmanabhan – said that torture of 9/11 suspects was widespread. And Susan J. Crawford, the senior Pentagon official overseeing the military commissions at Guantánamo — the novel system of trials for terror suspects that was conceived in the wake of the 9/11 attacks — told Bob Woodward: We tortured Qahtani. His treatment met the legal definition of torture. Moreover, the type of torture used by the U.S. on the Guantanamo suspects is of a special type. Senator Levin revealed that the the U.S. used Communist torture techniques specifically aimed at creating false confessions. (and see this, this, this and this). And according to NBC News: Much of the 9/11 Commission Report was based upon the testimony of people who were tortured At least four of the people whose interrogation figured in the 9/11 Commission Report have claimed that they told interrogators information as a way to stop being “tortured.” One of the Commission’s main sources of information was tortured until he agreed to sign a confession that he was NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ The 9/11 Commission itself doubted the accuracy of the torture confessions, and yet kept their doubts to themselves</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359978630639</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 06:50:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359978686070-39</Id><Topic><Title>HARSH COMMENTS FROM A MOTLEY FOOL ANALYST TODAY ABOUT BOEING</Title><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1358466409228</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 18:46:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing's’ has turned into nothing more than a outsourcer.

Example: the cheapest and lightest batteries available will work and be safe. This is one of the many catastrophic assumptions that enginnering and manufacturing were forced to make by the McDonnell/St. Louis crowd to bring the 787 home for the cut-rate non-reccuring costs that the McDonnell Mob insisted upon. AND, IT IS ONLY THE FIRST THAT WILL PROVE TO BE FATALLY FLAWED!!! Stay tuned for MANY more catastrophic flaws on the 787 as thes delusional assumptions are proven to be just that - delusional.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359981239850</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 07:33:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359981993422-53</Id><Title>There is only ONE reason for Gun Registration.....</Title><Msg>There is only one purpose for the government knowing where all the guns are and that is so they know where to confiscate them.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359981993422</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 07:46:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359982193015-54</Id><Topic><Title>Tang on outsourcing on the 787</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359954972661</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 00:16:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Christopher Tang, sure is spot on about the 787 outsourcing problems !the decisions are ultimately made by the managers/executives as to what gets used.

What is sad is that McNerny actually thinks he has everything under control. He holds two status meetings on the 787 battery issue everyday. See I am managing. The only analogy I can think of is when my kids were young they would splash around in the swimming pool and claim "I am swimming, I am swimming." This is my view of most of Boeing management. They hold lots of meetings and have lots of status reports and they actually think they are managing. They look outside for silver bullets to solve all their problems, but they never use common sense to figure anything out for themselves. The mantra, "If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it" is their myopic view of the world. They would never think of asking a lowly engineer, "What do you think we should do?" To do that would mean their bloated salary and benefits were unjustified. So they blindly move forward "managing" the company. Fail or success they will get their unjustified benefits, bonus, and wages and in the end they will blame all their problems on somebody else. The unions caused us to fail. The city, state, gov, taxes us to much. You would think that being paid millions and millions of dollars they would figure out how to make their company more efficient, more productive, and get rid of unnecessary waste in the management ranks. Can they do that? No, but they can sure renege on contracts their predecessors signed. Can they manage to the contracts they have agreed to? What would they do if the BOD told them their contracts (CEO) were too expensive and we (BOD) were going to cut their pay in 1/2. They would haul their lawyer in and scream to the high heavens. Yet that is what they are asking SPEEA to do. Renegotiate their contract so Boeing can move pension money to the bottom line. Hypocrites everyone of them. Do as I say not as I myself do.</Msg><Username>zevach</Username><Timestamp>1359987221365</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 09:13:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359987562100-63</Id><Topic><Title>BY PUTTING 787 WINGS ON WINDMILL'S BOEING CAN BECOME AN ENERGY PRODUCER</Title><Username>speaker_737</Username><Timestamp>1359923832604</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 15:37:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are right on.</Msg><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1359987562100</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 09:19:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359987705348-64</Id><Topic><Title>BY PUTTING 787 WINGS ON WINDMILL'S BOEING CAN BECOME AN ENERGY PRODUCER</Title><Username>speaker_737</Username><Timestamp>1359923832604</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 15:37:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How about Obama forcing New Orleans to run the stadium lights on green energy yesterday.....how'd that work out?</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1359987705348</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 09:21:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359987952924-65</Id><Topic><Title>BOEING SHOULD REMOVE THE WINGS OF THE 787 AND THEY WILL HAVE A PLASTIC BUS READY FOR SALE</Title><Username>communicator_777</Username><Timestamp>1359832246774</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:10:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Children have a problem with that idea, they refuse to ride on a plastic bus.</Msg><Username>pierre_from_geneva</Username><Timestamp>1359987952924</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 09:25:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359988630506-66</Id><Topic><Title>BY PUTTING 787 WINGS ON WINDMILL'S BOEING CAN BECOME AN ENERGY PRODUCER</Title><Username>speaker_737</Username><Timestamp>1359923832604</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 15:37:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With Boeing's 787 wings on windmill's the CEO wants first to recharge his car batterie and only then he would consider selling the rest of the energy.</Msg><Username>copyright_member</Username><Timestamp>1359988630506</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 09:37:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359989013291-67</Id><Title>Wy don't Democrats want a foolprof elections.</Title><Msg>The technology exists for quick, easy and positive ID.

'I don't think the issue right now is raising rates," Obama said. The goal now is to find "smart spending cuts," "reduce health care costs," and "close loopholes and deductions."

Yes, but they can make some nice shiny charts. Here is the progression: 1. find about an airplane problem 2. schedule a meeting to talk about it--lots of chart boys attending 3. chart boys work on nice charts about the meeting (typically takes about 2 weeks) 4. call another meeting to look at the charts 5. argue about who made the best charts 6. make some more charts about the meeting that was about the charts 7. whoever's "team" made the nicest, shiniest charts gets to call the other guys a name 8. by now, nobody at any meetings remembers the original problem.

Kennedy on being a liberal... "I believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose, in human liberty as the source of national action, in the human heart as the source of national compassion, and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas. It is, I believe, the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith. For liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart, a faith in man's ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves I believe also in the United States of America, in the promise that it contains and has contained throughout our history of producing a society so abundant and creative and so free and responsible that it cannot only fulfill the aspirations of its citizens, but serve equally well as a beacon for all mankind. I do not believe in a superstate. I see no magic in tax dollars which are sent to Washington and then returned. I abhor the waste and incompetence of large-scale federal bureaucracies in this administration as well as in others. I do not favor state compulsion when voluntary individual effort can do the job and do it well. But I believe in a government which acts, which exercises its full powers and full responsibilities. Government is an art and a precious obligation; and when it has a job to do, I believe it should do it. And this requires not only great ends but that we propose concrete means of achieving them. Our responsibility is not discharged by announcement of virtuous ends. Our responsibility is to achieve these objectives with social invention, with political skill, and executive vigor. I believe for these reasons that liberalism is our best and only hope in the world today. For the liberal society is a free society, and it is at the same time and for that reason a strong society. Its strength is drawn from the will of free people committed to great ends and peacefully striving to meet them. Only liberalism, in short, can repair our national power, restore our national purpose, and liberate our national energies. What do our opponents mean when they apply to us the label "Liberal?" If by "Liberal" they mean, as they want people to believe, someone who is soft in his policies abroad, who is against local government, and who is unconcerned with the taxpayer's dollar, then the record of this party and its members demonstrate that we are not that kind of "Liberal." But if by a "Liberal" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people -- their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights, and their civil liberties -- someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a "Liberal," then I'm proud to say I'm a "Liberal."

In fact, according to a new study conducted by two distinguished education scholars in the District of Columbia, school choice bolsters public high school graduation rates, reduces crime, and even creates new taxpayers: The District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) produced $2.62 in benefits for every dollar spent on it. In other words, the return on public investment for the private-school voucher program during its early years was 162 percent. … In our study we combined the increased-graduation results from the rigorous government evaluation with the work of labor, health, and public-policy economists who have at various times estimated the value of a high-school diploma to get an overall estimate of the impact of the program. Combining the increased income and financial benefits of longevity and quality of life, a high-school diploma is worth almost $350,000 to an individual. Because a high-school diploma makes an individual less likely to commit crimes, it therefore decreases both the costs incurred by victims of crimes and those borne by the public in administering the justice system. Coupled with the increased tax revenue made on the increased income, this yields an extra benefit for society of over $87,000 per high-school graduate. Multiplying the number of additional graduates by the value of a high-school diploma yields a total benefit of over $183 million. Over the time of our study, the OSP cost taxpayers $70 million, so dividing the benefits by the cost yields an overall benefit-to-cost ratio of 2.62, or $2.62 for every dollar that was spent. Programs that perform better and save money are the most sought-after of public policies. The District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program was and is such a program. We see no reason why the current group of 1,584 low-income DC students participating in the program won’t realize the same benefit of higher high-school graduation rates that their predecessors did. Given these findings, it’s hard to construct a convincing argument for why anyone, let alone the president of the United States, would oppose -- and try to de-fund -- such a successful program. Not only is the OSP and other similar voucher programs a smart investment, which over time will reduce our long-term federal deficit and grow the economy, it’s also making a real difference in the lives of inner-city children. Virtually every study ever conducted in the United States shows that students who graduate from high school lead significantly better and more productive lives. Thus, education leaders nationwide should look to our nation’s capital (never thought I’d say that in print) for innovative and groundbreaking ways to fix our broken education system.

Can't get all their Sheet in One Bag</Title><Msg>Someone's Wrong: CIA and State Dept. Accounts of Benghazi Contradict Gen. Dempsey’s Explanation for Why DOD Sent No Help (CNSNews) - The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is telling a different story about Benghazi than the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency. If the story Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, is telling is correct, then the story the State Department Accountability Review Board (ARB) and the Central Intelligence Agency have told is not. If the story the State Department and the CIA have told is correct, than Gen. Dempsey is telling an inaccurate story to explain why the Defense Department sent no help to the State Department and CIA personnel who were attacked by terrorists in Libya on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11. On CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Dempsey said the reason the Defense Department sent no aid to the Americans under attack by terrorists in Benghazi on the night of Sept. 11-12, was because the attack did not last seven hours but was really two 20-minute attacks six hours apart. However, both a CIA timeline provided last fall by a senior U.S. intelligence official and the report published by the State Department ARB, published in December, contradict Gen. Dempsey’s claim that the Benghazi terrorist attack was two discrete 20-minute battles separated by six hours. Additionally, an account presented by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in its report on Benghazi also does not comport with General Dempsey's version of events. According to these accounts, the first phase of the battle against the Benghazi terrorists lasted roughly three hours and 20 minutes, during which time the terrorists fired at U.S. State Department and CIA personnel at the State Department's compound in Benghazi, on the road between the State Department compound and the CIA Annex, and at the CIA Annex itself.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1360012584195</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:16:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360012746970-219</Id><Topic><Title>There is only ONE reason for Gun Registration.....</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359981993422</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 07:46:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Although the photo-op of president obama skeet shooting from the poop-deck of the uss raygun looked pretty-good for the grandson of a bona-fide ww ii vet, eh... when do i get your money for a fact finding proof-positive trip to hi...</Msg><Username>spartaloon</Username><Timestamp>1360012746970</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:19:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360012756874-220</Id><Topic><Title>Will BA Bounce?

"Because of its shortcomings--driving range, cost and recharging time--the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars," said Uchiyamada. "We need something entirely new." Uchiyamada’s comments come as the U.S. Department of Energy announced Thursday that the government is backing off President Barack Obama’s promise to put one million electric cars on American roads by 2015. As Breitbart News reported last September, there are just 30,000 electric cars on American roads. "Whether we meet that goal in 2015 or 2016, that's less important than that we're on the right path to get many millions of these vehicles on the road," said an Energy Department official. President Obama made promotion of electric vehicles a key component of his green initiative. Last September, the Congressional Budget Office reported that federal policies to prop up and promote electric cars will cost taxpayers $7.5 billion through 2019. Several of the electric car companies Obama has funneled taxpayer funds to have floundered. U.S. electric battery maker A123 Systems, which received a $249 million taxpayer-funded government loan, announced last year its decision to sell a controlling stake to Wanxiang, a Chinese company, for $450 million. Similarly, lithium-ion battery manufacturer Ener1, Inc., which received a $118.5 million taxpayer-funded grant, filed for bankruptcy. And another company, Aptera Motors, has already folded. “The electric car, after more than 100 years of development and several brief revivals, still is not ready for prime time--and may never be,” concludes Reuters.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1360013224564</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:27:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360013346508-223</Id><Title>If wermacht buld a fortress around the RWNJ and their enemies hearts</Title><Msg>\can we return to the life we made before...</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1360013346508</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:29:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360013843335-224</Id><Topic><Title>If wermacht buld a fortress around the RWNJ and their enemies hearts</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1360013346508</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:29:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How long you been a Democrat?

Pre or post tribulation rapture? I have always believed in pre. But there are lot of folks that seem to have convinced themselves for post. The logic for pre is the following: Jesus says that the "day and the hour" of His return are not known by anyone (Matthew 25:13). If the rapture is "post" trib, that would contradict what Matthew 25:13 is saying since the entire sequence of the tribulation is laid out in Revelation and by Daniel (in his "seventieth week of years") in terms of exact number of days (2520, i.e., 7 Jewish calendar years of 360 days) - with the mid-period (1260) being the advent of the "abomination that causes desolation" (the anti-Christ standing in the temple). The first half (1260 days) starts with the anti-Christ making a coerced "peace pact" with Israel. In the second half (after the "abomination") brings about the judgement of God in terms of of plagues, wiping out a "third of the sea", etc. and finally, at the end of the second 1260 days, the conquest and destruction of those that reject Jesus. So, with respect to "post trib" belief, just count down the days (1260) from when the anti-Christ is standing in the temple declaring himself to be God, and then you "would" therefore know the day of the rapture. Thus, that does not make sense. Logic tells me that the rapture takes place before the seven year trib because it follows the "unknown" day and hour premise. Further, with all believers in Jesus removed from the earth and thus the work of the Holy Spirit, Satan is given the freedom to do whatever he chooses. Folks left behind will wonder at the disappearance of so many of those "annoying" Christians. Many will celebrate, and the anti-Christ will formulate an explanation of what happened (further enhancing his celebrity) so that folks who have demonstrated a "willingness to believe a lie" will simply be duped. "For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie" (2 Thessalonians 2:11) BB</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1360014687049</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:51:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360014785705-230</Id><Topic><Title>Using #$%$ Analogies</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1360014463963</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:47:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>......Neocon ......A. holes lazyZ. .......Idiots</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1360014785705</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:53:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360015033641-231</Id><Title>Nobody cares</Title><Msg>about gang bangers killing each other in Chicago or any other inner city that`s why not much is done about it and you don`t read about it everyday in the news.

Given his life in Indonesia, Hawaii, and Chicago, the availability and influence of gun ownership and use (legal) is at a minimum. Indonesia, Hawaii and Chicago require and impose a strict permit and registration process to buy and own a rifle and/or handgun. Indonesia statistics are 0.5 guns/100 people. 9.7% for Hawaii. Chicago is 4.5% (for legal weapons). And Nationwide, in the Untied States, gun ownership is about 35%. So, unless Obama was simply a "natural", the likelihood that he EVER shot a weapon, before becoming President, or before he commented on his skill with a rifle just the other day, is, to put it mildly, unlikely.

So queen_of_fartz if you can't read my user comments that is your problem,and if you chose not to buy it you missed 15% until today and you missed another 1.4% today that is your problem .Complaining about it is not my resposibility . BTW Boeing is not up 1.40% today is is still a flat dead cat Bounce stock today .45% up a nothing as usual. for the year Boeing is now down 1.45% if you continue to own Boeing stock your missing the DOW average for a year at up 7.91% queen of farrtz every day when you look at any tock market review you can look a the DOW or the S and P or the NASDAQ all better than Boeing , why do you continue to own Boeing stock move out make some money.

One flight and most hope they never have to fly another plane that isn't a 787. Most people remember the issues when they first started using LI batteries in cell phones, and laptop computers. There were some fires and battery meltdowns early on, buy no one even thinks about that any longer when buying a phone or laptop. This is because hundreds of millions of these devices out there using LI batteries safely and only a handful of them have yearly have a battery failure that ends up causing a fire. The fact is just because BA got it wrong the first time, doesn't mean LI battery use in aircraft is fatally flawed. Just like the cell phones and laptop manufactures did, BA will find a solution and fix the LI battery issue to the point rolling out another aircraft with LI batteries won't be considered any risk at all.</Msg><Username>send_this_pig_to_hell</Username><Timestamp>1360024425660</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 19:33:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360024578622-270</Id><Topic><Title>QUESTION FOR BULKY BOB</Title><Username>generaljackripper</Username><Timestamp>1360003458247</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 13:44:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Word "Rapture" is not even mentioned but the latest TREND at Bible Schools among evangelicals is to SAY there is. there are several theories about the timing of the Rapture. Pre-tribulational rapture: When John ascends to heaven (Revelation 4:1-2). In this theory, Christians will be taken up before the Great Tribulation (Daniel 9:24-27, Revelation 7:14) and will be spared its suffering. Mid-tribulational rapture: When the two prophets ascend to heaven (Revelation 11:11-12) Post-tribulational rapture: At the end of the seven bowls (Revelation 16:17-21) However, for the purposes of my post it is salient to discuss only what the Secular authorities are imposing through craft and artiface.

The newspaper reported that the FAA might grant permission as soon as Monday night, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Boeing would test a potential fix for the problem that caused two batteries to burn on 787s last month, the paper said. But passenger flights would still be weeks if not months away, the paper said, citing two sources.

The debate of timing is over the "pre", "mid", and "post" tribulation as to when that takes place. I believe it is answered by the statement that the Day of the Lord will come "as a thief in the night" (1 Thess 5:2). It is not totally clear if the rapture and the Day of the Lord are one and the same or that the rapture begins the Day of the Lord - essentially to mark the period of final judgment against this dispensation. Again, in my original post, there is no "surprise" ("comes like a thief in the night") if the "rapture" or Day of the Lord takes place following events that are clearly stated in the Bible as part of a specific sequence of exact days. That is: 1. Covenenant made with Israel and the anti-Christ defines the start of the 7-year trib 2. Half-way through (after 1260 days), the anti-Christ enters the temple (needs to be rebuilt!) and declares himself to be God 3. Thereafter great plagues and judgments commence and conclude after 1260 days Then..... 4. Thousand year ("millenium") rule by Christ on earth commences with Satan and demons chained 5. Satan loosed "for a little season", starts trouble all over again, and God brings it all to an end 6. New Heaven and a new earth. So, it may be "wishful thinking" on my part, say, that I will avoid the tribulation because I get "raptured" just beforehand, but there is Biblical precedence for God clearly demarking the various dispensations (periods or "ages"). The period of "law" and "animal sacrifices" under Moses was terminated at Jesus crucifixion (recall the veil of the temple being torn at that moment). My logic is this: today, a person can receive Christ as Savior, and salvation resulting from that is irrevocable, which has been true since Jesus death and resurrection. Not apparently true during the tribulation. At that time, believers may have to hold fast to their "faith" unto their death in order to remain saved. And the tribulation will be such a time as has never before been known to man where believers are martyred right and left. Two thirds of humanity will be wiped out. From my point of view, it makes sense that the tribulation start "fresh" consisting only of folks that have not yet believed, who are on the "fence post", or they rejected Christ as Savior, bringing on the horrible judgments that compel folks to make a clear and unambiguous decision. In Revelation 7, 144K from the 12 tribes of Israel become believers in Jesus and are sealed to be the witnesses during that time period. In other words, the focus of the message of salvation of God goes back to the Jews, whether or not those folks are living in Israel at the time is not clear. But it appears to be marking a different dispensation.

Boeing would test a potential fix for the problem that caused two batteries to burn on 787s last month, the paper said." by foulmouthharbor..</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360029856289</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 21:04:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360030054044-300</Id><Title>If I represent the US Armed Forces on my spare-time</Title><Msg>Egyp[t/Israel the Brits seemed to have ,well, ya know. f888cked = batuka +/- view repliesw f rom el f888'd o'</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1360030054044</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 21:07:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360030216116-301</Id><Topic><Title>President Obama can out shoot any Republican</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1360015296261</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 17:01:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes I get the Democrats in the city of Chicago are using guns to commit crime and kill and the Republicans in the Suburbs aren't.

All they have asked for is BA to cover the loss of revenue for the planes being out of service, which is fair. Fortunately for BA this expense will be manageable since not a lot of planes have gone out the door, and it has not halted production. It will delay deliveries this year, and that will incur late delivery penalties, but with production of only about 5 planes a month, they should be able to handle that without major impact to the bottom line.</Msg><Username>advisor2000</Username><Timestamp>1360039050028</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 23:37:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
