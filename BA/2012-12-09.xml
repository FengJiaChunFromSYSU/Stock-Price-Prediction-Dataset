I like this guy who golfed through Detroit -that old historic home of organized labor is pretty much falling down. Great read FOX 2's Charlie LeDuff takes on an epic challenge of golfing his way from 8 Mile Road to Belle Isle... literally. It's a par 3,168, 18-mile, single hole course. The 46-year-old Pulitzer Prize winning writer carries only four clubs in his bag while facing extraordinary hazards that took years to form. He strokes his way through grassy fields, abandoned houses and crumbling landmarks. The half-way houses on this course are real. On the loop, Charlie interacts with the gallery, capturing the spirit of the people of Detroit. No Mulligans here, you play it as it lies. Why golf the length of the city? Play the video to find out, but here are a few clues to offer you a better handicap. Think: Why are we still here? Who still cares? How can we be better? What do people need? Has anybody asked them? And - what other city in America allows the room to take a full swing with a golf club? If you're curious about the track, expand the photo to see the "I Heart the D Golf Invitational" course map. A few places to point out: Charlie tees off at the old Michigan State Fairgrounds. He hacked his way south, going though where the Halloween Party commune "Theater of the Bizarre" used to rage, before it was shut down. He chops through the rough near Woodward, past the old Dutch Girl Doughnut Shop, then east through the neighborhoods of Robinwood, then 6 Mile and Nevada. He swings through Dequindre and Minnesota. He gets a lesson in city golf course etiquette from Deadline Detroit columnist Bill McGraw, who tells Charlie about the 289.6 acre I-94 Industrial Project. This is an area of land that used to be comprised of neighborhoods until the city bought the land to re-purpose it into a place for new industries to build. Instead the area has returned to nature. Next, the famous abandoned Packard Plant adds several strokes to Charlie's scorecard. If Augusta has "Amen Corner," this course offers the 'Wailing Wall' to where industry used to thrive. Charlie spends more time with the gallery in neighborhoods around the plant, and then it's off to Belle Isle to make a putt. He croquet's the Detroit River on the famous MacArthur Bridge, perhaps less famous than Hogan's, but a lot more people have crossed it. Finally, he sinks his putt at the Belle Isle Golf Club, a 9-hole course which you can still play.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1355031558987</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 00:39:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355031727774-3</Id><Topic><Title>The Truth abpout Benghazi</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1355003607189</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 16:53:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1962 Alcatraz one of three things happened... -all were machine-gunned to death -they closed alcatraz -busted out with a spoon alert the fez/in/casablanca</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1355031727774</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 00:42:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355039468228-4</Id><Title>The California Taxquake</Title><Msg>By Chriss W. Street California State Controller John Chiang has announced that total state revenue for the month of November 2012 fell $806.8 million, or 10.8%, below budget. Democrats thought they could hammer “the rich” by convincing voters to pass Proposition 30 to create the highest state income tax in the nation. But it now appears that high income earners have already “voted with their feet” by moving themselves and their businesses out of state, resulting in over $1 billion shortfall in corporate and income taxes last month and the beginning of a new financial crisis. Passage of Proposition 30 set off euphoria and expectations of higher spending for public employees. The California Teachers’ Association (CTA) trumpeted: "California students and working families won a clear victory today as voters clearly demonstrated their willingness to invest in our public schools and colleges and also rejected a deceptive ballot measure aimed at silencing educators, other workers and their unions.” Once again, the voterbots have listened to the ObamaPiper and fooled themselves into thinking that they can vote to tax others - and not themselves. New income tax rates increased from 9.3% max to 10.3% to 13.3%, retroactive to Jan 1, 2012. We may have to resurrect the "Moonbeam" name for Gov. Brown, with California Democrats as the New Moonies.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1355039468228</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 02:51:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355043776738-5</Id><Topic><Title>In Michigan, A Righteous Rage At Lame-Duck, Middle-of-the-Night Anti-Union Maneuvers</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1355013745226</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 19:42:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Suggest you read the article by Steve Fraser that comes up when you search (with quotes) "the national museum of industrial homicide".

Pension funds that were billions in the red before this nonsense will all of a sudden appear on the news as a cliff issue. It doesn't matter that for the past thirty years that many corporations, financial institutions, state, local and federal governments and individuals ran on deficit financing, it will all collapse or the fear of collapse will happen due to the cliff. It all makes good theater and will serve as a great excuse and cover up to the real show that has been going on for years. Sort of gets everyone involved off the hook. Then maybe the government should run a reality show where senators can sing or dance what taxes they want raised or what spending they want cut. Like american idol or one of those other shows. Americans can then text their votes or twitter their responses and their votes will actually be counted. It can lighten up the situation, keep americans more involved, maybe offer a few different views other than what fox news offers, and minimize the influence of the lobbyists.</Msg><Username>flyininmytaxi</Username><Timestamp>1355053555061</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 06:45:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355054225409-9</Id><Topic><Title>Monstrous Statistics</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1355022905345</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 22:15:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you an Ignorant Pissant, or a Repressed Homosexual?

The unemployment rate under gw was in the 4-5% rate until the Frank/Dodd crash kicked in. After the Bush tax structure kicked in (2004), the deficits gradually decreased to $187 Billion in 2007. Then the 2006 elected democrat house and senate budgets kicked took hold in 2008, which Obama called "unpatriotic"-- Obama Called Smaller Bush Debt Rise “Unpatriotic” President Obama quietly notified Congress that the government needs another $1.2 trillion to continue operating. That’s both irresponsible and unpatriotic of him. How do I know? A presidential candidate named Obama told us. The new borrowing requested by the CURRENT president would raise the debt ceiling to $16.4 trillion. The debt stood at $10.6 trillion when Obama took office. That’s an increase of $5.8 trillion, nearly $2 trillion more than the “unpatriotic” figure cited by Obama. Sure, a portion of the new debt is carryover from the Bush administration and the democrat House /Senate And he has actually worsened the deficit with a feckless $800 billion stimulus bill and a new $1 trillion health care entitlement. So this is not the Bush deficit. It is the Obama deficit, and it’s threatening to ruin the country. This is an accurate summation of events.</Msg><Username>greedyoilbastards</Username><Timestamp>1355056928615</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 07:42:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355061534843-12</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP is dying</Title><Username>spartacus778899</Username><Timestamp>1354884997085</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 07:56:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Talk like that got Romney to the white house.....for a bowl of soup and a "don't let the door hit you in the back on your way out" visit with our President</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1355061534843</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 08:58:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355064726963-13</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP is dying</Title><Username>spartacus778899</Username><Timestamp>1354884997085</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 07:56:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Liberty movement?

According to the IRS, no one ever paid 91% - presumably because of available write-offs that were eventually eliminated in the 1980's along with going to the lower rates. It is no mystery, except to the willingly ignorant, that tax revenues are and will continue to go "down" in California as a result of higher tax rates.

The taxing the rich/fair share meme is a political distraction perpetuated by Obama and progressive propagandists to offer hope to those who are struggling in this horrible Obama economy. This is necessary because Obama has no plan to fix the economy. If taxing the rich was the answer, wouldn't California would be the #1 state for fiscal strength in the nation? The fact is that it is dead last and Obama's economic thinking mirrors that of California. Those of us that are successful learn early that when you fail you must change the behavior that led to failure. This is genetically pre-wired into our subconcious because at one time when we were primitive man nature punished failure often with death. Progressive thinking ignores this reality and constantly dismisses failure and the need to correct failed behavior. They use magical thinking guided by emotion to replace logic and scientific application of measurement or outcomes when problems arise. This is what leads them to find satisfaction in failure like we see in California. This is self-destructive behavior which is fine as long as they don't force it on others. Progressive California is a failed model and will continue to decline. Fortunately the rest of us can watch from afar and teach our children the lesson that magical thinking leads to failure and failure still has consequences.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355073129945</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 12:12:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355073519456-29</Id><Title>Taxing the rich will not happen</Title><Msg>I said it once and I will say it again.

All charged with repairing the company. NONE DID. Instead this stuff happened"Defendants Condit and Givan( Boeing CFO since 1966) unloaded more than 34,000 shares after the merger but before the massive financial charges and production setbacks were announced Oct. 22. Then this happened "The first top executive let go was Boyd Givan, Boeing's longtime chief financial officer.Industry analysts had often complained that Givan provided them little financial guidance. replaced Givan with Debby Hopkins, an executive from General Motors". Then Debby Hopkins placed the OT on the 747-400 posted to the next quarter to make the Boeing Company appear to be making money and poof she was gone, but the story was she jumped ship from Boeing to a much smaller company, right, a down move. Let's not forget Mike Sears the jailbird and Boeing CFO. It should be illegal to not have a working SPEEA-Boeing contract, it probably will be too. Next, Remember, With all of the National Labor Relations Board complaints against Boeing , everytime Boeing looses a complaint, they establish themselves as a company that does NOT abide by Federal Labor Law. Right now, SPEEA has multiple complaints against Boeing. If any of them are found to be with merit, this whole thing goes very badly for Boeing. Why, you ask??? The strike then becomes a federally protected strike. And with that then, no employee can be terminated by Boeing.I don't believe I would like to fly on an airplane built by anyone other than skilled experienced craftsmen and women who are getting paid a living wage with provisions for life after work. When you put these things in front of a person and they understand that keeping these benefits only requires that they diligently do their work you get quality airplanes. On the other hand the amount of money the CEOs make has no bearing on airplane build quality. And for the Union haters , I will give you this, I do agree with the negative commenter’s that unions can promote laziness, but I believe they still do more good than not. In this day and age where the disparity between the top earners and the middle class is growing at an alarming rate, we may need now more than ever.I worked at Boeing for years, , and I sure saw some lazy Boeing union protected time waster employee's, who I wanted fired. But I'm thankful every day for the protections and benefits a union gave me. I got to build some great airplanes for a long time, and I didn't have to worry as much about being fired because I was employment at will, I got a contract like Mcnerney, and he is another union contract guy I would love to see fired.

All Boeing CEO's were charged with repairing the company. NONE DID. What did happened, “Boeing officials named in the suit are Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors Philip M. Condit, Chief Financial Officer Boyd E. Givan and Ronald Woodard, president of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. You might read up on both Scott Carson and Jim Albaugh too. Retired is the nice way of saying Boeing shareholder fail and 787 fail. Givan,Hopkins and Sears more fail retirement, jail and move on actions is the nice way of saying it. All of these employee’s had a labor contract and executive golden parachute is part of it too. Loaded with payola and stock options and million dollar pay raises and medical and retirement labor contracts. ... Defendants Condit and Givan unloaded more than 34,000 shares after the merger but before the massive financial charges and production setbacks were announced . Then , The first top executive let go was Boyd Givan, Boeing's longtime chief financial officer. Industry analysts had often complained that Givan provided them little financial guidance. Boeing hired a short timer, Debby Hopkins, an executive from General Motors.( she took a downgrade to a smaller company, hummmm). Also CFO Mike Sears was terminated and sent to jail. Now shareholders have James McNerney another GE-MMM drop out. Boeing is the place to go for second string CFO and CEO workers. Not a good recommendation for a place to put your shareholder dollars if you want gains. A reason that we are having this series of labor disputes is that the St. Louis McDonnell Douglas management team decided that they want to emulate other corporate businesses without understanding that aerospace is a unique business.Areospace workers know that the business is one where the financial benefit of your individual work may not be evident in the short term. We know that the financial results of our work are only evident decades after a program is completed. We also know that it takes decades for skill to be developed in aerospace and that knowledge cannot be outsourced easily.( see 787 fail) National Labor Relations Board complaints against Boeing (and one should really keep an eye on that), everytime Boeing looses a complaint, they establish themselves as a company that does NOT abide by Federal Labor Law. Right now, SPEEA has multiple complaints against Boeing. If any of them are found to be with merit, this whole thing goes very badly for Boeing. Why, you ask??? The strike then becomes a federally protected strike. As such; when coupled with the messages of replaceabilty, Boeing has created a schizoid Engineering corps, which is both professionally arrogant, and yet, personally insecure. I'm thankful every day for the protections and benefits a union gave me. I got to build some great airplanes for a long time, and I didn't have to worry about being fired at will . For the union haters, yes, every day I had to put up with lazy union protected workers who I would love to see gone, like the best union contract protected worker James McNerney, but he too is protected by his professional labor contract. Get rid of CEO managment contracts first eh ! We need to be competitive so cut management pay and benefits and retirement .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355098459950</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 19:14:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355099115784-72</Id><Topic><Title>Is Romney Still Ahead?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1355079911102</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 14:05:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HoozdikHertz does not talk about issues.

Carter, who served as US president from 1976 to 1980, also criticized incumbent American policy makers for violating the country’s “long-standing policy” of “preserving the privacy of US citizens.”</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1355115093264</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 23:51:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355115453594-95</Id><Title>Mediator hits pause button between BA and SPEEA</Title><Msg>The mediators “pressed the ‘pause’ button. But nothing’s changed,” Goforth said. “When we hit the ‘play’ button in January, we’ll be plunged right back in the same situation, which is a pretty bad spot.” He said negotiations likely won’t resume until the second week of January. He expects that a deadlock will be apparent, and “very soon in January” the union will call a vote to authorize a strike. Assuming union members provide that authorization, another period of negotiation would follow, with an expectation that Boeing might improve its latest offer. If that fails to bridge the divide, Goforth said, a strike could begin as early as Feb. 1.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355115453594</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 23:57:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
