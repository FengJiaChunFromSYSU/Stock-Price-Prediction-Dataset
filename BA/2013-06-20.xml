Obamacare is blowing through cash. Administrators shut down enrollment for the law's interim pre-existing conditions program when resources were exhausted sooner than expected, and HHS has been caught trying to scrounge up "donations" from the industry it regulates in order to aid under-funded implementation efforts. But even if the government mounts a miraculous comeback and somehow gets everything up and running on time, premiums are still rising, coverage is being dropped, workers' hours are being cut back, deficits are rising, and tens of millions will still be uninsured. All for the low, low price of $2 trillion. No wonder Americans would eagerly accept turning back the clock to 2009, before this unwanted behemoth became law. Meanwhile, the administration and outside collaborators are launching their umpteenth "let's sell Obamacare" push. This latest effort alone is expected to cost millions. Sen. Mitch McConnell took to the floor yesterday to ridicule Democrats' enduring, blind insistence that the real problem is that they just need to explain the law better:</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1371744304821</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:05:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371744440175-70</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus beat Boeing in the orders at the Paris Airshow and Boeing stock price</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371744155511</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:02:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>notice I posted this and in less than a few minutes a self proclaimed barker hit me with a thumbs down , they monitor the message board all day long ha ha just the facts no barking</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371744440175</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:07:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371744503948-71</Id><Topic><Title>Damn... why down so much !!!</Title><Username>cutthemoffnow</Username><Timestamp>1371735767870</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 09:42:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cutt, come on now its down but not that much Plus get ready for the rise up next week when everybody wakes up that the WORLD is not going to END$$$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1371744503948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:08:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371744939389-72</Id><Topic><Title>the truth about TWA flight 800 No2</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1371617834753</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 00:57:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You asked ""what good would revenge be" and I told you.

They are at the Paris Airshow and working to get Airbus to do work in Washington State, and use the great workers and system located in Puget Sound of Washington State cultivated over 100 years with Boeing. The governor pointed out that the "Chicago" company, not the Washington State company only has 17% of the Seattle jobs and will be going to a right to work state as soon as possible . The Washington residents need to move on. So the lawmakers finally get it, stop giving Boeing hand outs like the 3 billion in tax incentives to build 100% the 787 at Everett and then get backstabbed. Airbus and several contractors said they will be working in Washington State now and good riddance to Boeing Chicago. Too bad it took from Condit buying the bankrupt MD company to today to finally, officially, figure it out. McNerney is leaving Washington State as fast as he can, to continue the bankruptcy by outsourcing failure that he thinks is the way to go ! Read Hart-Smith !Washington will never go right to work aka slavery .Boeings own figures show the average Boeing job pays 53000 in Carolina and the average worker in china makes $4500 per year so how is going to a right to work state really cost effective answer it is not . If Mcnerney outsourced all jobs to China he would be outsourced immediately for being way to expensive a CEO.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371745355082</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:22:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371745856206-80</Id><Topic><Title>Damn... why down so much !!!</Title><Username>cutthemoffnow</Username><Timestamp>1371735767870</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 09:42:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so what? if you are insecure and worried than sell.</Msg><Username>thisgameistooeasy</Username><Timestamp>1371745856206</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:30:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371745910998-81</Id><Topic><Title>Damn... why down so much !!!</Title><Username>cutthemoffnow</Username><Timestamp>1371735767870</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 09:42:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BA down 1.53% SP500 1.42% DJ30 1.33%</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1371745910998</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:31:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371746185051-82</Id><Topic><Title>Paris Air Show- Vote on Boeing vs Airbus Stock Price</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371247771854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 18:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As of Thursday 9:30, Boeing down 1% and airbus down 5% since airshow started.</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371746185051</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:36:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371746400290-83</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus beat Boeing in the orders at the Paris Airshow and Boeing stock price</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371744155511</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:02:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>notice the Boeing advertisement team on their user comment "Damn... why down so much !!!

This is a Boeing salesman and he forgets the trend, Airbus would have made you more than 100% more money over 3 years than the total gain for Boeing in 3 years so a very nice attempt at sales ,a very colorful bark for Boeing ha ha , As a trader you move to what makes you money do not stay in a loss position and you do not watch for 3 years while Airbus makes over 100% more than Boeing stock. If you read the Boeing financial message board be prepared to listen to Boeing peddle Boeing as better , while down for two days, the trend if your a long term holder is airbus much better than Boeing . . Frankly the Boeing sales man should be short on both Boeing or Airbus if he was not a Boeing salesman for Boeing stock .

Again this stems from a belief in infallibility that Zo possesses as I have written about Progressives in other posts. His comment that pain isn't felt until the last week of pregnancy is one of his most ignorant comments in recent memory. 'Nevertheless, unlike other scientific claims put forward by the anti-abortion movement—about the putative connection between abortion and breast cancer, for example—there is a genuine empirical debate about these issues. After all, according to Mark Mercurio, a professor of pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, neonatologists broadly accept that extremely premature babies feel pain. Mercurio has cared for babies born as early as 23 weeks and says, “Based on the data I have seen and based on what I see clinically, I treat every baby in my intensive care unit as if they were capable of experiencing pain.”'' 'The most well-known proponent of the fetal-pain hypothesis is Kanwaljeet J.S. Anand, a professor of pediatrics, anesthesiology, and neurobiology at the University of Tennessee. His argument is essentially that the cerebral cortex, the seat of consciousness that doesn’t fully develop until late in pregnancy, is not necessary to experience pain. Other mechanisms that develop earlier, he says, are sufficient. Thus, testifying before Congress in 2005, he said, “We cannot dismiss the high likelihood of fetal pain perception before the third trimester of human gestation.”' It’s possible that Anand is right, and his research is certainly worthwhile. As Mercurio, who holds him in high regard, says, “I don’t think we should slow scientific inquiry because we’re concerned about what legislators might do with it.” Nevertheless, it’s a minority view.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1371749630881</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 13:33:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371750304646-105</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Sets Future 787 Freighter to Fend Off Airbus Jets</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1371731752935</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 08:35:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let Boeing build freighters and Airbus passengers plane.</Msg><Username>jackrip_eu</Username><Timestamp>1371750304646</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 13:45:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371750485224-106</Id><Title>dividend comparison Boeing to Airbus the truth</Title><Msg>Boeing pays 4 dividend's per year, now at .48 times 4 equals $1.94 to get dividend yield , divide dividend by stock price and move decimal two places.

Inslee’s Aerospace Office, as the trade portion of the show ended Thursday. “There’ll be deals that come out of this that we’ll realize in the years to come. It was really exciting.” Pietsch said more than a dozen companies, mostly European, either approached the delegation or came to one of about 500 pre-arranged meetings “looking for access to the Boeing supply chain and the skilled workforce in the state of Washington.” “We’ll be helping them to match up with partners,” said Pietsch. Several expansions or investments by foreign companies in Washington state that were in the works at various points over the past year were announced at the Air Show. Airbus expanded an existing supply contract for aluminum plates and sheets with Kaiser Aluminum of Spokane. Airbus supports the good taxpayer of Washington State and Boeing now only 17% of Seattle economy is welcome to take Boeing to Carolina as fast as possible it is a great day for Washington State . Washington does not want to deal with a bankrupt MD-BA failure like the 787 4 years late 30 billion over budget and still having problems on a regular outsource expected plan READ HART-SMITH Airbus out selling Boeing 70 billion to 66 billion as usual still Airbus number one Airbus stock better than Boeing stock by over 1005 in three years time .

Jeff Sessions, and from left-wing politicians, such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Populist conservatives who oppose the immigration bill, and some progressives who back the bill, also have long bemoaned the declining percentage of new wealth earned via blue-collar wages and professionals’ salaries. President Barack Obama strongly backs the immigration rewrite, but has complained about the trend. “In all countries around the world, you’re seeing growing inequality, and so we have to find ways to make sure that ladders of opportunity exist for those at the bottom, and that profits and increased productivity all does not just benefit those at the top,” Obama told a German audience in Berlin. Last September, those worries were buttressed by a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, which showed that labor’s share of income has dropped by roughly 10 points since the early 2000s. In turn, the share of income earned via capital has increased by the same percentage. The federal Bureau of Economic Affairs estimates that labor’s share fell from roughly 67 percent to 58.2 percent. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the share fell from 75 percent in 1979 to 67 percent in 2007. The result of this economic shift is that economic inequality widened, according to the report,</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1371759623487</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 16:20:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371760087702-159</Id><Topic><Title>Wayne's World</Title><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1371753231166</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 14:33:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just a likely that some one reads your paranoid rants and thinks they are sane, or that they matter.</Msg><Username>freedumber</Username><Timestamp>1371760087702</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 16:28:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371760426185-160</Id><Topic><Title>Washington State said goodbye to Boeing chicago and good riddance hellow contractors and Airbus</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371753608208</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 14:40:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like yourcalling names and pounding the table again.</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1371760426185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 16:33:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371761211119-161</Id><Title>poor thought Obozocare was going to be free. ha ha its so funny.

Mr. O'Brien covered Boeing , and pointed out that Boeing stock price now is just about "dead on the vine" saying the volume is going down over time. Mr. O'Brien indicated the last time Boeing was a 107 dollar stock was in 2007 and it will now ring the bell at the previous high and maybe get some more but then Boeing stock price will retreat over time to the 71 dollar range . For any user of the Boeing financial blog, as you can see there is a core of six Boeing barkers, the doggy, bow wow self proclaimed , Boeing advertisement salesmen, for Boeing who are selling Boeing stock to potential customers. These six people are loud and colorful and like a circus barker stand at the Boeing financial page all day long barking come on in and get some Boeing stocks. Showing news stories and dogging any other opinion with personal attacks For the year to date the competition between the two major competitors, Airbus stock is better .When you have the facts on your side you argue facts, , when you do not have the facts on your side, you pound the table and call names. Airbus is better stock gain for their investors by over 100% for three years Airbus bettered Boeing a the Paris Airshow and the Airbus stockholder will continue to pull away for the loser Boeing shareholders over time . .

He also said that Airbus, which has U.S. engineering centers in Wichita, Kan., and Mobile, Ala., is likely to add two more in the next decade, and will seriously consider locating one in Washington state. “We are attracted to Washington state for the same reason we were attracted to Wichita. That’s where the talent is,” he said. “If you want to have access to the talent that developed over the last 100 years of aviation, Washington is very fertile ground.” Airbus Americas chairman Allen McArtorAirbus Americas chairman Allen McArtor Those startling ideas came from Airbus’s top man in America, who has probably the most exceptional aviation resume of any aerospace executive in the U.S. A highly decorated combat fighter pilot in Vietnam, he was an associate professor of engineering at the Air Force Academy, then flew as a pilot in the Air Force Thunderbirds flying display team. Afterwards, he headed air operations at FedEx, and under President Reagan he was head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for two years. Immediately before joining Airbus, he was chief executive of Legend Airlines, a regional carrier out of Dallas. Airbus has already broken ground in Mobile to construct a final assembly plant, its first airplane factory in the U.S., for the single-aisle A320 jet family. It is scheduled to deliver the plant’s first plane to JetBlue in January 2016. He said that presence will reshape U.S. views about Airbus.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371776794989</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 21:06:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371776853647-190</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing and the stock price and the expert opinion and Paris win for Airbus</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371774682914</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 20:31:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"you pound the table and call names".

Treat employees with more respect than McNerney and Delaney, ( not hard to do ). 4. Be the same as they are in Europe in terms of working with unions, Yes Airbus has unions sitting on Board of directors, and listens to them. Also mine the wealth of ideas from your union and non union employees. (see item 3) 5. Give a thought to utilizing WA. state subsidies, yes anti union and Dem posters here, the subsides say just any large aircraft maker...so AIRBUS could open a fabrication plant and reap benefits. Consider Moses Lake with cheapest power in the world and a great airport with lots open space. 6. Don't be so anti WA. and union that aerospace experts say your CEO hates WA. and Unions. 8.
