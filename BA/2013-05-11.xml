What was it that proceeded out of Biden's mouth the other day: "As all of you know, we must, we need to do even better. I'm here to tell you that man who picked me up on that train on January 17th in that freezing cold day in 2008 is as committed as any man who has served in that office to do just that. That’s why the first thing he did was re-establish the White House initiative on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders Because you know too well, we have to make sure everyone has equal access to federal services. They deserve food stamps, housing aid, healthcare programs, access to quality education and so much more!” Were they clamoring for assistance? Or is it that the liberals are consternated that there remains one ethnic group that collectively still believes in hard work and personal responsibility? Which is a complete violation of "liberal" principles.

Carbon dioxide was measured at 400 parts per million at the oldest monitoring station in Hawaii which sets the global benchmark. The last time the worldwide carbon level was probably that high was about 2 million years ago, said Pieter Tans of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That was during the Pleistocene Era. "It was much warmer than it is today," Tans said. "There were forests in Greenland. Sea level was higher, between 10 and 20 meters (33 to 66 feet)." Other scientists say it may have been 10 million years ago that Earth last encountered this level of carbon dioxide. The measurement was recorded Thursday. The number 400 has been anticipated by climate scientists and environmental activists for years as a notable indicator, in part because it's a round number — not because any changes in man-made global warming happen by reaching it. When measurements of this chief greenhouse gas were first taken in 1958, carbon dioxide was measured at 315. Levels are now growing about 2 parts per million per year. That's 100 times faster than at the end of the Ice Age. "What we see today is 100 percent due to human activity," said Tans, a NOAA senior scientist. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal for electricity and oil for gasoline, has caused the overwhelming bulk of the man-made increase in carbon in the air, scientists say. At the end of the Ice Age it took 7,000 years for carbon dioxide levels to rise by 80 parts per million, Tans said. Because of burning of fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, carbon dioxide levels have gone up by the same amount in just 55 years. READ IT AGAIN At the end of the Ice Age it took 7,000 years for carbon dioxide levels to rise by 80 parts per million, Tans said. Because of burning of fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, carbon dioxide levels have gone up by the same amount in just 55 years.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1368286752824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 11:39:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368287069344-26</Id><Topic><Title>Jesus Christ was an arch liberal and would have been a Democrat</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368279707997</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 09:41:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ali, only a moron would listen to you.

But they matter. Two such developments have come together recently, both reported in the New York Times. The first is the collapse of intellectual support for the notion that immediate austerity can boost economic growth. The second is a growing consensus that health-care-cost inflation is slowing for deep structural reasons, rather than having undergone a mere temporary dip from the recession. These trends have something in common: They blow to smithereens the intellectual foundations of the Obama-era Republican policy agenda. During the last four years, the hoary Republican nostrums of lower taxes, spending, and regulation have cohered into a specific view of the world. Paul Ryan has been the leading figure in defining this view and persuading the entire party, almost without exception, to fall in line behind it. The Ryan worldview is that the United States is heading toward a massive debt crisis, that the crisis is driven primarily by rising health-care costs, and only his plan stands any chance of alleviating it. Ryan has expounded this view over and over: It is of course unfair to judge the merits of an analysis solely by the rhetoric of its politicians; politicians have to sand off the rough and complicated edges of their ideas to appeal to a majority. The deeper expression of the Ryan worldview comes from Yuval Levin, a close adviser to Ryan, probably the most influential conservative intellectual of the Obama era (and who was recently recognized as such and granted a $250,000 Bradley Prize). The fullest expression of Levin’s view came in a widely cited essay he wrote for National Affairs, “Beyond the Welfare State,” which came out right about when Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, and has served as their blueprint ever since. The most striking thing about the essay is its Marxian grandiloquence. Just as Marx believed of capitalism, Levin insisted the welfare state was utterly doomed, that the ailments he identified would necessarily continue indefinitely unless his chosen remedy was adopted. Levin hinged his view upon two specific contentions. The first was that the debt crisis was not merely a long-term fear but an existing reality, responsible for the present crisis: This conflation of short- and medium-term problems — of annual deficits with retirement liabilities, of sluggish growth with the burden of debt, of the Obama agenda with the broader social-democratic project — is in one sense an error, of course. But it is not ultimately an error. Indeed, it is a powerfully clarifying synthesis, which has given us a vision of our future: The fiscal crisis we face is an extended and expanded version of our deficit problem; the recession from which we are emerging was a preview of life under suffocating debt; the Obama agenda does seek incrementally to advance the larger social-democratic vision — especially on the health-care front, where that vision has seen its greatest fiscal failures. This became the basis for the Republican view that deficit reduction could not be delayed and must be undertaken immediately, and that radical new tactics, like threatening financial chaos through defaulting on the debt, were a justified response to an emergency that did not lay over the horizon but was already upon us. Levin’s second argument was a fanatical hatred for the Affordable Care Act. No supporter of the law could muster an enthusiasm that could match Levin’s revulsion for the law — the “false hope that the dream [of the welfare state] may yet be saved through clever tinkering at the edges.” It was bound to fail in absolutely every respect, especially in its claim that it could limit health care cost inflation. Far from it, argued Levin. Obamacare “will exacerbate the cost problem,” he wrote in 2010. Under the new law, he was certain, “cost cutting can only be achieved at the expense of quality care ​—​and even so it rarely happens.” Levin’s arguments were hyperbolic versions of the critique of Obama that resonated among respectable centrists. The trillion-dollar deficits were shocking, dangerous; Obamacare didn’t do anything to limit the continuous rise of health-care costs. These propositions maintained enough political respectability that Republicans could turn (hyperbolized) versions of them into the premise for their domestic policy and be treated as sagacious guardians of fiscal responsibility. The doctrine of expansionary austerity — the premise that we must cut deficits not just eventually but immediately — has suffered a series of disastrous reversals. It has failed repeatedly in Europe, and its most prestigious academic basis, a paper by Harvard’s Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, was exposed for a series of fundamental errors. A New York Times article this week represented a watershed, baldly stating in its headline, as the entire macroeconomic forecasting field has understood all along, that the short-term deficit was too low, no longer a counterintuitive dissent but a clear and barely contested reality. Less visible, and possibly more interesting, is the growing mass of evidence that the health-care-cost inflation problem is indeed solvable. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that health-care costs, which have historically risen far faster than general inflation, pose the central threat to long-term fiscal stability. The Affordable Care Act attempted to control it at the same time as it expanded coverage to the uninsured. Levin, and Republicans like Ryan, like to say that Obamacare’s cost control’s consist only of the Independent Payment Advisory Board — “unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats,” as Ryan calls them. In fact, the law created a wide slew of reforms intended to attack health-care inflation from every possible angle. The law created bundled payments, so that Medicare would pay hospitals or groups of doctors based on quality, not quantity, of care. It penalized hospitals that have to readmit patients owing to shoddy work (they previously would enjoy a second payday for doing so), taxed high-cost health-insurance plans, encouraged electronic medical records and research on effective treatments, and many other things. Nobody believed every one of these experiments would work perfectly. The idea was to try as many promising reforms as possible, and health-care wonks expressed cautious optimism that the law contained a wide breadth of them. Over the last few years, health-care inflation has indeed decelerated — far more deeply than even the most optimistic backers of the law dare hoped. The federal budget for Medicare and Medicaid in 2020 is now projected to be 15 percent lower than forecasters expected a few years ago. At first, the sharp slowdown in health-care costs was assumed to have happened because the recession is making people cut back on their medical care. Levin has clung stubbornly to this interpretation. But as the trend has persisted, and undergone deeper study, a consensus is emerging that this is not the case at all. Several studies have found that the recession does not account for all, and possibly not even most, of the slowdown. The trend precedes Obamacare, too. But the law can’t be cleanly separated from the broad sentiment that the medical industry needed to overhaul its practices. As Matthew Yglesias argues, “If forward-looking investors think that future increases in health care spending will be met with legislative efforts to curb health care spending, then investments that rely on future high levels of health care spending won't be made and the system will lack the capacity to deliver ever-growing levels of services.” In keeping with Yglesias’s premise, construction on hospitals cratered since 2009 and has not recovered. Even with the data on their side, none of the advocates of Obamacare is nearly as certain the law will succeed as conservatives like Levin are that it will fail. That is a testament only to the overweening ideological certainty that pervades the right. The slowdown in health-care costs is provisional. Perhaps it will peter out, and Obamacare will require massive revisions. Perhaps, too, the interest rate spike Ryan has been warning of will suddenly appear. But the key thing is that the conservative program since 2009 has hinged on the absolute truth of both these provisions. The certainty of the imminent debt crisis, and the certainty that Obamacare would worsen rather than ameliorate it, undergirded the party’s entire strategy. It is not merely the ideological extremism but Levin’s dialectical certainty that the welfare state will collapse upon itself that has driven the party’s refusal to compromise. Why not meet Obama halfway, see what we have learned in a few years' time? Because, he wrote, half-measures “would make real reforms less likely, by letting our leaders persuade themselves they have dealt with entitlements when in fact they would have only bought a little time.” There is no point in buying time to learn more about the nature and scale of the problem when your ideology has already furnished the answer. And yet the canon of Levin and Ryan has undergone no revision whatsoever. The debt crisis is “irrefutably happening,” Ryan insisted recently. Obamacare, he said yesterday, will “collapse under its own weight.” Ryan and his party are so certain of these foundations his worldview rests upon that he can’t even be bothered to look down at the rubble all around his feet.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368289904751</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 12:31:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368290278545-52</Id><Topic><Title>Now that we know that Obama has been arming AlQaeda</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368280861966</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 10:01:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not upset about the death of an ambassador yet as all facts have not emerged on this issue.

The Right constantly claims devotion to our founding documents. The problem: Its policies completely violate them John D'Amico Last month, 20 House Republicans, along with staffers from nearly 40 congressional offices attended the first meeting of the Congressional Tea Party Caucus. The three premises behind the Caucus, according to Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), who emceed the event, are “we’re taxed enough, we spend less than we take in, and we follow the Constitution.” This purported devotion to the founding documents echoes the themes reverberated at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in March, where Sarah Palin and former Rick Santorum declared that the Declaration of Independence has given America “a set of principles and values” — and Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) urged his party to respect the individual “by going forward to the classical and timeless ideas enshrined in our Constitution.” Naturally, these pronouncements raise a fundamental question — namely, which governmental policies and programs are consistent with the core values and ideals of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution? Are they the ones proposed by the Tea Party and conservatives? The Declaration of Independence proclaims that: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men …” Slavery having been abolished and women enfranchised, Thomas Jefferson’s powerful words should be read to mean that all human beings are by nature equal as persons. A student of classic Greek philosophy, Jefferson may have derived this insight from Plato: “All men are by nature equal, made all of the same earth by the same Workman, and however we deceive ourselves, as dear to God is the poor peasant as the mighty prince.” All people have rights inherent in their human nature including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We all have bodies and brains. Although some people are smarter, better looking or more physically fit than others, we all need food, water, clothing and shelter to survive. But the mere satisfaction of our physical needs is not our ultimate goal. Our founding fathers learned from Aristotle that “happiness is the meaning and purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.” It is a whole life well-lived and enriched by the cumulative possession of all the goods — health, sufficient wealth, knowledge, friendship and virtue — that a moral and ethical human being ought to desire. Accordingly, John Adams believed “the happiness of society is the end of government.” Jefferson agreed, declaring that “the care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only legitimate object of good government.” The pursuit of happiness is dependent on, and calls for, governmental protection of our life and health. Viewed through the prism of the Declaration, then, universal background checks for gun purchases, health care reform legislation to cover the uninsured, child care, workplace safety, laws and regulations protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink, and measures to slow or reverse global warming that science tells us is threatening the health of our planet and its human inhabitants, are essential to protect our right to life and abet our pursuit of happiness. Conservative Republican and Tea Party senators and representatives want to block, weaken, or abolish these programs even though they are consistent with the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the objectives of the Constitution, the Preamble of which includes ideals that were embedded in the Declaration: “We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” Implicit in the Preamble is the assertion that no society in which we would want to live can exist without justice, civil peace, welfare and liberty. Toward these ends, Article One, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.” The “general welfare” is an element in the common good that the government was created to serve. The critical question is how much should the government do to serve the common good and thereby secure for its citizens life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? The Republican “Pledge to America” argues that Congress has ignored “the proper limits imposed by the Constitution.” It demands that the size of government be reduced, spending slashed, and taxes curtailed. The Tea Party “Contract from America” maintains that the “purpose of government should be limited to the protection of our liberties by administering justice and insuring our safety.” It asserts that government should not venture beyond these functions or attempt to increase its power over the marketplace and the economic decisions of individuals. These views echo the platform of the Libertarian Party, which emphasizes individual liberty in personal and economic affairs without interference from government. Libertarians place the highest value on liberty, and they want an unlimited amount of freedom even if the result is that some citizens are impoverished. It must be remembered, however, that one of the purposes of the government according to the Constitution is to “establish justice.” Alexander Hamilton once asked, “Why has government been instituted at all?” His answer: “Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint.” The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act regulating financial markets and creating the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in the wake of the Great Recession of 2009, the implementation of which is being stymied by banks and financial institutions and their conservative supporters in Congress, is a perfect illustration of Hamilton’s point. Only when it is understood and agreed that greed at the harmful expense of others is not good — a concept not yet grasped by Wall Street and our representatives in Washington — will reason and justice prevail. Implicit in our founding documents and in the thinking of our founding fathers is the principle that there should be a balance between liberty and equality. Thomas Jefferson expressed it this way: “rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others.” How, then, should we resolve the conflict between the extremist proponents of liberty and equality? Conservative 20th century philosopher and educator Mortimer Adler proposed a definitive formula for achieving the appropriate balance in his 1981 book, “Six Great Ideas.” The nation’s founders, he wrote, recognized that “neither liberty nor equality is the prime value, that neither is an unlimited good, and that both can be maximized harmoniously only when regulated by justice.” We should have only as much liberty as justice allows, and society should strive for only as much equality of conditions as justice requires. The economic inequality that justice allows “consists in some having more wealth than anyone needs … but since the amount of wealth available for distribution is limited, no one should be in a position to earn by his productive contribution — to earn, not to steal or seize — so much wealth that not enough remains for distribution, in one way or another, to put all individuals on the base line of economic sufficiency.” In other words, justice requires that no individual or family be “seriously deprived, by destitution or dire poverty, of that minimal supply of economic goods that everyone needs … To this much everyone has a natural right.” Adler maintained that “the pursuit of happiness is our primary obligation.” He added, however, that we are also obligated to do what is right with regard to others and to the community. This is not a new concept, as one discovers when reading Jefferson’s version of the Bible (Matthew 25:34-36, New King James Version), which consisted only of the words of Jesus: Then the King will say to those on his right hand, “Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you looked after Me; I was in prison and you came to Me … Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.” We have enacted these precepts into law in the form of public assistance, food stamps, meals on wheels, low-income housing aid, heating assistance, income tax credits and other forms of help for those who have slipped below the poverty line or are seriously disabled. Regrettably, conservative Republicans and Tea Partiers have forced Congress to slash most of these social safety net programs in the belief that economic rights are not guaranteed in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. It is true that economic rights were not a central concern in an 18th century society of self-sufficient farmers, artisans and slave plantations. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, the abolition of slavery and the Industrial Revolution had totally transformed America. The mass production of a wide variety of goods raised the standard of living for a growing middle class. It also created a large class of low-paid workers struggling to subsist in squalid urban tenements. These conditions prompted President Theodore Roosevelt to recognize in 1910 that “the object of the government is the welfare of the people” and that the economic well being of laborers must be protected: No man can be a good citizen unless he has a wage more than sufficient to cover the bare cost of living and hours of labor short enough so that after his day’s work is done he will have time and energy to bear his share in the management of the community, to help in carrying the general load. We keep countless men from being good citizens by the conditions of life with which we surround them. In his message to Congress in 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that “true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence … People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made …” He urged Congress to implement various economic rights — to a useful and remunerative job, adequate food and shelter, a decent home, adequate medical care, a good education, and protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident and unemployment. Government programs that secure and implement these rights such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Unemployment Insurance, and federal funding to reform education, assist students, create jobs, boost energy efficiency, and repair the nation’s infrastructure — all under attack by the far Right, are consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. These programs, along with all of the others mentioned in this article, safeguard our “inalienable rights” to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” They also “form a more perfect union,” establish “justice,” promote “the general welfare,” and secure “the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.” Unfortunately, we are still far from realizing these ideals of democracy. One in five Americans is unemployed or underemployed. More than 46 million people are living in poverty, and another 20 million barely subsist on Social Security. Over 1.5 million are homeless, and one in seven mortgages is in default or foreclosure. More than 17 million children lack the means to get enough nutritious food on a regular basis. Over 48 million lack health insurance. These needy persons can expect little relief from conservative Republican and Tea Party representatives and senators who promise to stop “out of control spending” and reduce the size of government while at the same time insisting that the richest Americans and hugely profitable corporations continue to benefit from low effective rates of taxation and tax loopholes. Why? Because the wealthy individuals and anonymous organizations that support this agenda pour hundreds of millions of dollars into Congressional campaigns, and special corporate and industrial interests dedicate billions of dollars to lobbying. The rich and super-rich who call the shots in Washington are not elected members of what Abraham Lincoln called our “government of the people, by the people, for the people.” They have not taken an oath to preserve and defend the Constitution. Yet, they exercise immense political power and have aborted and emasculated government programs on which millions of Americans depend for their survival. To prevent this political misuse of wealth, justice requires such reforms as public funding of electoral campaigns, shortening of the campaign season and assuring candidates equal time on television. To secure political liberty, justice requires an electoral system that does not impose unreasonable and unnecessary impediments to the right to vote, such as overly burdensome identification requirements and unduly restrictive times and places for the exercise of the franchise. The “Pledge to America” and the “Contract from America” challenge us to recall our beginnings as a nation and revisit the ideas and ideals that form the basis of our government and society. This analysis is mandatory because, as Adler said, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are the “American testament” and in relation to one another, “they are like the sacred scriptures of this nation.” There are even older scriptures, however, in the New Testament and the Torah that define the just and proper balance between the imperatives of liberty and equality (2 Corinthians 8:13-15, New Living Translation of the Bible; Exodus 16:18, Revised Standard Version of the Bible): Of course, I don’t mean that you should give so much that you suffer from having too little. I only mean that there should be some equality. Right now you have plenty and can help them. Then at some other time they can share with you when you need it. In this way, everyone’s needs will be met. Do you remember what the Scriptures say about this? “The one who had much did not have too much, and the one who had little did not have too little.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368300729517</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 15:32:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368301406576-65</Id><Title>Man who opened fire on Ohio police possessed extremist literature</Title><Msg>Authorities in Ohio say they aren’t sure what motivated a 42-year-old man to jump out of his car during a traffic stop in March and suddenly fire 37 rounds at two police officers. What seems clear, however, is the case is yet another example of the danger posed to unsuspecting officers who confront individuals steeped in extremist antigovernment ideas. James L. Gilkerson had a library of antigovernment, homemade munitions and firearms books in his vehicle — along with an AK-47 assault rifle, five loaded 40-round magazines for the weapon, knives, five pounds of gunpowder and a black mask and gloves, authorities say. He was unemployed, spent his time caring for his ill mother, and apparently had no history of mental illness. One of his books, Resistance to Tyranny, espouses a lone-wolf “underground movement of secret freedom fighters, each acting individually and independently to ignore, evade, resist and thwart the increasingly heavy hand of government power.” When his car was stopped after running a stop sign on March 10 — a quiet Sunday in Middlefield, Ohio — Gilkerson exited through his driver’s side door and began firing his assault rifle before officers could even get out of their police cruiser. Gilkerson fired 37 shots at officers Erin Thomas and Brandon Savage, who both returned fire, shooting 54 rounds at Gilkerson as he shouted, “Kill me.” He died at the scene. The unnerving gunfight, captured on a dash cam in the officers’ bullet-riddled patrol car, is now a high-hit posting on YouTube. “He was a #$%$, and a terrorist, and he’s dead,” Middlefield Police Chief Arnold Stanko said at a news conference last week, according to The [Cleveland] Plain Dealer. “I don’t know what he had planned or where he was going,” the chief said. “I just know he got out of his car intending to kill my officers. The AK-47 rounds he was firing would go right through a policeman’s bulletproof vest.” Both officers were wounded. Thomas lost the index finger of her left hand, and has not returned to duty. Savage had minor injuries to his left thigh and has returned to patrol work, the chief said. After an investigation involving the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Geauga County Sheriff’s Office, the officers’ actions were found to be justified. “When you see what he had, how much ammunition he had, these officers may have prevented a tragedy down the road,” Geauga County Prosecutor James Flaiz told Cleveland television stationWKYC-TV. The investigation showed that Gilkerson, who authorities described as a “loner,” had no known connections with extremist or antigovernment groups and had no criminal record. But he apparently did have an appetite for reading, particularly books about bombs, firearms and antigovernment activism.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368301406576</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 15:43:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368302488265-66</Id><Topic><Title>B.O.

John McCain, R-Ariz., Defense Secretary Leon Panetta addressed the claim that the military could have dispatched armed unmanned aerial vehicles, AC-130 gunships or fighter jets to thwart the attack. Such aircraft were not in the region and not an effective option, he said “The U.S. Armed Forces did everything they were in position to do to respond to the attack in Benghazi,” Panetta said in the letter, obtained by The Associated Press. Despite Panetta’s claim, a survey of U.S. military bases in the region suggests that the 19 hour response time that it took to put a Marine team in Libya was not, “everything they were in position to do to respond to the attack in Benghazi.” This is a failure of leadership. The timeline reveals that 78 minutes after the attack began, no U.S. forces — save for a single unmanned, unarmed drone — had yet to be mobilized. In fact, Panetta’s orders to reposition and deploy special operations forces were not finalized until approximately five hours after the attack began, according to the Defense Department and the CIA. It is unreasonable to assume that sufficient military forces were available to drop in and prevent the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens. The initial attack on the consulate was too rapid. But given the security situation in Libya at the time, and the significance of the Sept. 11 anniversary, it is reasonable to assume that responsible leadership would have had contingency plans in place that could have trimmed down the 19 hour response time.

They concocted delusional narratives that ranged from murderous first ladies to galactic alliances with Martians. It was an entertaining world of fiction and a guilty pleasure for some, even as the true believers were convinced of the frightening fate that was unfolding. Today, however, the boundaries between rational political discourse and raving madness have been erased. The extremist peddlers of nightmare scenarios who were once thought to be charmingly eccentric at 1am are now advising elected representatives of the people to initiate investigations and draft bills addressing these non-existent threats. Here are just a few of the urban legends that are circulating in the halls of state and federal legislative bodies courtesy of the whack job broadcasting set. 1. The UN Arms Treaty and US Sovereignty The United Nations recently passed an initiative to address the proliferation of “illegal” arms trading amongst terrorists and rogue nations. As expected, the right-wing Chicken Little Brigade immediately began protesting that this was another attempt to dilute national sovereignty and bring about a one-world government. Of course, there is nothing in the proposal that would infringe on the rights of any nation to set their own standards for gun ownership. The actual resolution explicitly states that countries will “exclusively” maintain the right within their borders to, “regulate internal transfers of arms and national ownership, including through national constitutional protections on private ownerships.“ This perfectly reasonable attempt to disarm criminals and tyrants was opposed initially by Alex Jones and similar fringe broadcasters. But eventually their outrage bubbled up to singe Republicans in congress who managed to prevent the treaty’s ratification.The GOP opposition was notable for the fact that it concurred with the only three UN nations that also opposed it: Syria, Iran and North Korea. 2. Commies? This may seem like a throwback to the 1950s and the Red Scare promulgated by Sen. Joseph McCarthy and others. But make no mistake, this is all too current. Commie hunters in the fringe media are still accusing all liberals of having pinko sympathies. And they have an ally in former representative Allen West, who is now hosting his own webcast. West told a group of supporters that “I believe there’s about 78 to 81 members of the Democrat Party who are members of the Communist Party. It’s called the Congressional Progressive Caucus.” West lost his seat last November, but it is important to note that the leadership in the House never rebuked him or dissociated themselves or the GOP from his remarks. 3. Muslims? This is a corollary to the commie conspiracy updated to smear a more contemporary foe. Originally this allegation was espoused by the infamous Islamophobe Pamela Geller. She latched unto the fact that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had a close aide with a Muslim-sounding name.Huma Abedin has worked for Clinton for more than a decade and is respected by all who know her. She was even defended by House Speaker John Boehner and Sen. John McCain. That didn’t stop a cabal of House members, led by Tea Party queen Michele Bachmann, to fire off a letter to the State Department demanding an investigation and alleging that Abedin had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. There was never any evidence provided to support these allegations. Nor is there any evidence accompanying the new accusations by Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, who told WorldNetDaily that Obama deliberately “bungled” the investigation of the Boston marathon bombing because “this administration has so many Muslim Brotherhood members that have influence.” 4. Benghazi The king of right-wing talk radio, Rush Limbaugh got the ball rolling with this one. He alleged on his program that Obama was deliberately blocking the investigation into the attack on the US facility in Libya. Limbaugh could not come up with an explanation for why Obama would want to stymie the inquiry, so the implication left hanging was that he had some connection to the attack that he wanted to cover up. Numerous other media outlets jumped on this mini-bandwagon with Fox News assuming a prominent role. Every Fox program began banging the Benghazi drum, and integral to their publicity push was escalating the scandal to include congressional players to add Washington credibility (such as it is). Republicans like Lindsey Graham and John McCain were happy to comply. 5. The Most Important Story In History Not one to be ignored, Glenn Beck joined the fray with what he considered to be the “most important story in history.” The plot involved a Saudi man who was briefly questioned following the Boston marathon bombing. It was quickly discovered that he was a victim, not a suspect, and he was released to recover from his injuries. Beck, however, would not let go of the story. He threatened the White House that if it was not forthcoming with the truth, he would reveal the evidence he had that would blow the roof off the White House. Beck’s deadline came and went with no revelations of scandal. He merely repeated what he had previously alleged, which had already been debunked. Which makes it all the more curious that four members of congress are officially demanding answers from the Department of Homeland Security based on what they call “media reports,” but are really just Beck’s psychotic discharges. 6. The Government Is Stockpiling Ammunition To Kill Us All Last year there was a flurry of panicky hand-wringing by notorious conspiracy mongers over reports that agencies of the federal government had purchased large caches of ammunition. In the minds of the nutcases on the right, that was evidence that the DHS was plotting a response to some impending disaster scenario wherein they will be forced to kill every person in America five times. That is precisely what Mark Levin, Sean Hannity’s replacement for Sarah Palin, is terrorizing his radio listeners with. This phony horror story was summarily dismissed by the DHS with documentation and proof that nothing out of the ordinary was occurring. It was merely a purchase contract to lock in lower prices for ammunition used commonly by several law enforcement agencies for regular use and training. Nevertheless, congressional overreaction to the “news” has resulted in a General Accounting Office inquiry into the purchase request. That inquiry was spurred by GOP senator (and Levin listener) James Inhofe, who has also drafted a bill to prohibit ammunition purchases in amounts larger than those of previous administrations. Presumably that’s to make sure that the black guy doesn’t get any ideas. 7. And Then There’s Agenda 21 Among the conspiracy theory elite there is only one supreme and all-encompassing doctrine of apocalyptic disaster: Agenda 21. The furor over this initiative dates back to the John Birch Society. In reality it is just a UN guide to sustainable environments that recommends some completely voluntary measures aimed at advancing smart growth and safer, more livable communities. It was adopted by 178 countries and signed for the U.S. by President George H.W. Bush. It was, however, never ratified by the senate. Somehow this benign project was transformed in the minds of conservative mythmakers into a monstrously evil plot to steal the liberty of all mankind. Glenn Beck even wrote a book describing it as “centralized control over all of human life on planet earth.” But the panic doesn’t stop there. Multiple state resolutions banning its implementation with a foreboding tenor have been enacted. For example, Tennessee’s resolution condemned its “destructive and insidious nature” and began by saying… “WHEREAS, the United Nations Agenda 21 is a comprehensive plan of extreme environmentalism, social engineering, and global political control that was initiated at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development…” That’s fairly typical of the numerous legislative measures aimed at defending America from a tyrannical, global, one-world government, orchestrated by despotic environmentalists and the liberal media. And we might as well throw in George Soros because that’s who freshman senator Ted Cruz of Texas believes is responsible for the whole affair. Cruz has promised that he will “…continue leading the fight, to stop Agenda 21 and any other globalist plan that tries to subvert the U.S. Constitution and the liberties we all cherish as Americans.” These delusional and thoroughly discredited inventions from the paranoia factories of Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, etc., were once the province of the radio backwoods and militia ham operators. And as frightening as these grim fairy tales are, what’s truly scary is that this conspiratorial fiction is now being embraced by elected officials in Washington and state houses across the country.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368313446690</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:04:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368313449565-99</Id><Topic><Title>Man who opened fire on Ohio police possessed extremist literature</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368301406576</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 15:43:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now that AlQaeda are the "good Guys" (that Obama supports in Libya and Syria" ..time to switch the narrative of who the extremists are to "terrorists are lone wolfs" with "patriot" literature.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368313449565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:04:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368313836982-100</Id><Topic><Title>7 bizarre conspiracy theories that the GOP takes seriously</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368313446690</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:04:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jesus ...

Bilmes and Michael D. Intriligator, ask in a recent paper, “How many wars is the US fighting today?” Today US military operations are involved in scores of countries across all the five continents. The US military is the world’s largest landlord, with significant military facilities in nations around the world, and with a significant presence in Bahrain, Djibouti,Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Kyrgyzstan, in addition to long-established bases in Germany, Japan, South Korea, Italy, and the UK. Some of these are vast, such as the Al Udeid Air Force Base in Qatar, the forward headquarters of the United States Central Command, which has recently been expanded to accommodate up to 10,000 troops and 120 aircraft. Citing a page at US Central Command’s (CENTCOM) website, they highlight the “areas of responsibility” publicly listed: The US Central Command (CENTCOM) is active in 20 countries across the Middle Eastern region, and is actively ramping-up military training, counterterrorism programs, logistical support, and funding to the military in various nations. At this point, the US has some kind of military presence in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, U.A.E., Uzbekistan, and Yemen. US Africa Command (AFRICOM), according to the paper, “supports military-to-military relationships with 54 African nations.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368314709984</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:25:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368314734149-103</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. Currently Fighting 74 Different Wars … That It Will Publicly Admit</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368314709984</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:25:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>according to the paper, “supports military-to-military relationships with 54 African nations.” [Gosztola points out that the U.S. military is also conducting operations of one kind or another in Syrian, Jordan, South Sudan, Kosovo, Libya, Yemen, the Congo, Uganda, Mali, Niger and other countries.] Altogether, that makes 74 nations where the US is fighting or “helping” some force in some proxy struggle that has been deemed beneficial by the nation’s masters of war.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368314734149</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:25:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368314809717-104</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi - Air assets supposedly available</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368308799581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 17:46:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nope - just listing public info - of course some may believe the three testifying un der oath were lieing... and not too surprising as to the trash coming out about the three whistleblowers- can almost write the script and dim talking points clueless- incompetent- delusional- whineers- political hacks - and other nice things attributed to any whistleblower.

Do you want Him to 100% control things (behavior, sin, bad everything)? Not 99%. It has to be 100%. Bear in mind that He would control things according to His specifications of righteousness. The Bible, especially the Old Testament, is a good place to start to understand what that might entail. Meaning we do not get to pick and choose what He will decide is allowed activities and behavior. In the future, He will enforce perfect sinlessness during the 1000 year reign of Jesus on earth (after the "tribulation"). No sin will be allowed. Period. Either we have "free will" or we do not. Now there is nothing stopping folks who hold to a righteous way of living from banding together and stopping a lot of the bad behavior out there right now. Or laws and government from doing the same. On the other hand, look at how our nation today seeks to have the freedom to do many things condemned in the Bible, as well as push God out of our lives. And then we expect God to intervene to prevent tragedies? Perhaps, we might step back and seek God's help and not assume that He simply wants bad things to happen. Maybe the problem is us. "If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."
