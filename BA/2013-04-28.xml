In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in great gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides. There was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented. Winston could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into existence.

The ANA flight, with company president Shinichiro Ito and Boeing's chief of commercial aircraft, Ray Conner, among those on board, left Tokyo's Haneda airport at 8:59 a.m. local time. It returned without incident at 10:54 a.m...., The ANA flight was the second by an airline since aviation regulators on Friday gave permission for 787 operations to restart after batteries on two of them overheated in mid January. One was on an ANA plane in Japan and another on a Japan Airlines jet parked at Boston's Logan airport. Ethiopian Airlines (ETHA.UL) on Saturday became the world's first carrier to resume flying Dreamliner passenger jets since the global fleet was grounded three months ago, carrying passengers to neighboring Kenya from Ethiopia.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1367166109394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 12:21:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367166626845-23</Id><Topic><Title>Taking Sides in the Syrian Civil War</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1367163576616</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 11:39:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree.

Which means to be safe, you have to lower it soon after takeoff and fly with it in the deployed position all the way to the scene of action, accepting the aerodynamic penalties involved. It's going to be hard to take over the world with shoddy equipment like this. I can't wait till we get the Mark IV black helicopters, when these bugs will be fixed.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1367176183646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 15:09:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367176235762-34</Id><Topic><Title>Everything Is Rigged: The Biggest Price-Fixing Scandal Ever</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1366996983550</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:23:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hahahahahahaha</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1367176235762</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 15:10:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367176796917-35</Id><Topic><Title>Everything Is Rigged: The Biggest Price-Fixing Scandal Ever</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1366996983550</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:23:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What did you say you were VA service connected for ? ...a mental condition wasn't it ?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367176796917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 15:19:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367176898485-36</Id><Title>You will NOT die of a Terrorist Act ...the Statistics dont lie !</Title><Msg>– You are 17,600 times more likely to die from heart disease than from a terrorist attack – You are 12,571 times more likely to die from cancer than from a terrorist attack — You are 11,000 times more likely to die in an airplane accident than from a terrorist plot involving an airplane — You are 1048 times more likely to die from a car accident than from a terrorist attack –You are 404 times more likely to die in a fall than from a terrorist attack — You are 87 times more likely to drown than die in a terrorist attack – You are 13 times more likely to die in a railway accident than from a terrorist attack –You are 12 times more likely to die from accidental suffocation in bed than from a terrorist attack –You are 9 times more likely to choke to death on your own vomit than die in a terrorist attack –You are 8 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than by a terrorist –You are 8 times more likely to die from accidental electrocution than from a terrorist attack – You are 6 times more likely to die from hot weather than from a terrorist attack</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367176898485</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 15:21:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367177142570-37</Id><Topic><Title>You will NOT die of a Terrorist Act ...the Statistics dont lie !</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367176898485</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 15:21:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wanna be shot by a cuckolded husband when I'm 95.

Max shows Airbus shareholders made 70% compared tothe boeing shareholders losing about 5% scroll along the periods of time and it is very clear all the Boeing Hacks that use their public advertisement and rotten notes to or about me are just that. The facts are if your a boeing shareholder your not as finanically well off as a Airbus shareholder. BTW Airbus does not have a message board here so Boeing is the best place to post about the duopoly. Getting back to the comparison, for , 5 years Airbus shareholders made 100% gain on their stock compared to Boeing shareholders making zero, you can read along this site it is clear that boeing is a dead cat bouce stock. 2 year Airbus returned 70% Boeing 19%, I year Airbus returned 30%, Boeing 21%, 6 months Airbus returned 50% , Boeing 32%, Year to date Airbus returned 35%, Boeing 22%. the main difference is since the 787 was grounded Boeign has been buying back their shares to make a fantasy gain, it is not a real stock market investment. It is a Boeing company buyback . Airbus has one too, if needed 15% of their stock has been authorised for a buy back. For those Boeing investors, it is nice to make 22% in 3 months right, too bad you missed all the better stocks you could have invested in like apple for 15 years until Steve jobs died, and many other

Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, do we have to show you how to look up historical BA values? Go to the "historical prices" tab in BA Yahoo. Enter start dates from about Feb1, 2009 to end dates of about April 30, 2009. You will see that the bottom of 29.36 accured on March 3, 2009 for a gain of 213 percent to today's 92. My earlier post used the April 20, 2009 value of 36.48 to get the 4 year gain of about 150 percent. My math says 150 percent for 4 years is better than Airbus 127 percent gain in 5 years. It's OK to admit you make a mistake once in a while. You probably shouldn't call someone a liar until you have checked the facts. And here's part of your post: "and yoru 150% for 4 years is total crapola btw boeing hit a statiically bottom as you know at about 55 and at 90 that is not a gain of 150%" Still calling me a liar about the 4 year gain? A lot of current Boeing employees probably bought BA thru the Boeing Savings Plan program and dollar-cost-averaging have made a good return the last 4 years. More when its low and less when its high.</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1367195224228</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 20:27:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367200066761-73</Id><Topic><Title>The Boston backlash is rooted in America’s paranoid past</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367107281074</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 20:01:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's not some weirdly-fantasized paranoid that is the true danger.
