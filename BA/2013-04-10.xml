If there is just one thing we can do to keep one father from having to bury his child, isn’t that worth fighting for?” - BHO Obama made a powerful emotional case for stricter anti-gun legislation yesterday, a case that few Americans heard unless their minds were already made up on the issue. And if some undecided American had happened to hear Obama’s speech, odds are they would have come away thinking, “Absolutely. I would do anything to keep my kid from getting shot.” And that is why Obama’s speech will fail. It has no limiting principle. In their more honest moments, anti-gun activists will readily admit that a more comprehensive government monitoring system of gun sales would have done nothing to prevent the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that took place in December. The shooter had no criminal record before he killed, so he would have passed a criminal background check. The killer’s mother, who purchased the weapons, also was not a criminal. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., basically admitted background check’s were ineffective to CNN’s Candy Crowley when she asked him, “How would anything in the bill, as it currently stands, have stopped anything that went on in Newtown?” Blumenthal could not identify a single scenario that would have prevented Sandy Hook. Instead he said he would fight for amendments that would ban “assault weapons” and high-capacity magazines. Neither of these measures are expected to pass even the Senate and the 1994 “assault weapon” ban proved to be a complete failure. Since the current gun control proposals would do nothing to stop mass shootings, even if Obama’s gun control bill became law, more are bound to happen. And the deaths in those events will be no more or less tragic than the deaths at Columbine, Aurora, or Sandy Hook. The emotional appeal for “more” gun control will be the exact same. Anti-gun activists would just use those future tragedies to justify further gun restrictions. The logic of doing “just one thing” so a father does not have “to bury his child” simply has no end.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1365596443544</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 08:20:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365598005720-31</Id><Topic><Title>Is chris_genna an Expert at Getting Shot Down?</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1365542941507</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 17:29:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He shoots!

She located the source of the problem in the insidious idea of parental responsibility for children. “We’ve always had kind of a private notion of children,” she said, in the tone of an anthropologist explaining a strange practice she discovered when out doing far-flung fieldwork. “Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility.” So long as this retrograde conception prevails, according to Harris-Perry, we will never spend enough money on children. “We have to break through,” she urged, “our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families.” __________________________________________ We already have a growing segment of society where parents have no interest in parenting or being responsible for their children. Are these the parenting traits that Ms. Harris-Perry hopes we all can achieve in order to meet her idealistic vision of our children's future?</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1365602033890</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 09:53:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365602157982-38</Id><Topic><Title>Africa: The Growing Campaign to Revoke Obama’s Nobel Peace Prize</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365379617772</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:06:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Under Obama's leadership our assassination-by-drone foreign policy has increased dramatically, which makes him a war criminal."

They dug up his bones and burned them because they considered him a heretic for opposing the Roman Catholic Church's authority. If you don't like Fox News, you're free not to watch it.

The Shadow Party was conceived and organized principally by George Soros, Hillary Clinton and Harold McEwan Ickes… "The Shadow Party is the real power driving the Democrat machine. It is a network of radicals dedicated to transforming our constitutional republic into a socialist hive. The leader of these radicals is ... George Soros. He has essentially privatized the Democratic Party, bringing it under his personal control. The Shadow Party is the instrument through which he exerts that control. ... It works by siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions that would have gone to the Democratic Party in normal times, and putting those contributions at the personal disposal of Mr. Soros. He then uses that money to buy influence and loyalty where he sees fit. In 2003, Soros set up a network of privately-owned groups which acts as a shadow or mirror image of the Party. It performs all the functions we would normally expect the real Democratic Party to perform, such as shaping the Party platform, fielding candidates, running campaigns, and so forth. However, it performs these functions under the private supervision of Mr. Soros and his associates. The Shadow Party derives its power from its ability to raise huge sums of money. By controlling the Democrat purse strings, the Shadow Party can make or break any Democrat candidate by deciding whether or not to fund him. During the 2004 election cycle, the Shadow Party raised more than $300 million for Democrat candidates, prompting one of its operatives, MoveOn PAC director Eli Pariser, to declare, “Now it’s our party. We bought it, we own it…”"”</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1365614869218</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 13:27:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365615624184-95</Id><Topic><Title>Better be prepared to sell the news</Title><Username>wearesoscrewed</Username><Timestamp>1365603711184</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:21:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When I speak of a correction and short interest I'm talking about a market correction not specifically BA.

A Quinnipiac survey released last week shows that 48 percent said they think the government will use background check records to seize legal guns, while 38 said the government would not. Following the passage of a historic and draconian anti-gun bill in New York, the state has moved to confiscate firearms. California has also moved to seize guns from citizens. Earlier this week in Austin, Texas, a Democrat official admitted the real purpose of gun legislation is registration. In February, a Canadian news anchor, Brian Lilley, warned Americans that gun registration will lead to confiscation. “I’ve got a warning to my American friends: Registration will lead to confiscation. And if you don’t believe me, just look at what’s happened here,” Lilley said. The Canadian Firearms Act, introduced in 1995, imposes severe restrictions of gun owners in Canada. In addition to erecting a mechanism for confiscation, the Canadian legislation is ideological. “The motivation for the Firearms Act was both ideological and political,” writes Donald Blake Webster. “It was emotionally inspired and politically-motivated social-engineering legislation pure and simple, a feel-good law to please urban left-liberal voters, but without any practical necessity or credible rationales.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365616330577</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 13:52:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365616495044-99</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing up 193% over the past three years!</Title><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1365606821434</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 11:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Excuse me.

I have thinned out a number of stocks that have significant gains. I sold some BEAV yesterday. I should have waited for today. They should report great earnings in a few days. I am also waiting for a significant dip. It may be awhile before it hits. Boeing has been a great stock to hold and I am keeping some for the long haul. I have been watching airbus (EAD.PA). They have had a lot of governments owning a significant amount of shares but they are now selling. Some say it will give EAD.PA more freedom to operate but it also takes away a lot of government support and has the potential to make things more difficult to operate.

All told, deficits would still total over $700 billion next year under President Obama's budget proposal. In his press conference, President Obama claimed that his spending increases will be "targeted investments in areas that will create jobs right now." The President rejected the choice between jobs investment and falling deficits, saying that "our deficits are already falling" and that "my budget will reduce deficits by another $2 trillion... in a balanced and responsible way." Before Obama is proclaimed a deficit-cutter, it's important to remember that standard Keynesian economics - that the President subscribes to - would prescribe falling deficits as an economy comes out of a recession. Keynesians like President Obama would be expected to advocate shrinking deficits in an economic recovery. What's important is to examine how President Obama treats the federal ledger in out years. It doesn't look good, either. President Obama's budget would see deficits shrink from 2014-2018 before starting to grow again. But of course, the next decade is going to be pivotal for deficit reduction. Entitlement reform that focuses on shrinking mandatory spending in the out years is of paramount importance, and President Obama's response to that is basically to fiddle around the edges, then wait and see how Obamacare works. What's more, the Office of Management and Budget - the office that calculates some of the projections - is historically kinder to the President than the more highly-regarded Congressional Budget Office. THe CBO will have their own score out on the President's budget in the next few weeks.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1365620716888</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 15:05:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365620921674-113</Id><Title>Why did Obam Choose the Hang out with Marxists when he was in College?</Title><Msg>If he didn't agree with their ideology why would he prefer them to other groups?</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1365620921674</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 15:08:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365621131719-114</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus return for 5 years is 114% Boeing return on investment for 5 years is 4% dead cat bounce red flag</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365231092292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 02:51:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>o yeah</Msg><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1365621131719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 15:12:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365621223520-115</Id><Topic><Title>Why did Obam Choose the Hang out with Marxists when he was in College?</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1365620921674</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 15:08:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because it's a free country and you can share ideas with anyone you like.

Scripted down to the very last word, the media will never tell you that only around 300 individuals are killed per year from rifles according to the FBI‘s own data sheet — a number far less than even the deaths from hands and feet. Instead, the mainstream media machine runs only on the fuel of highly filtered events that coincide with their preconceived topic of the year: the purported necessity of extreme gun control. You won’t hear about the shootings that have been stopped by law-abiding citizens with concealed carry permits, such as the incident in which another movie theater shooting was stopped by a legal citizen with a legal handgun. You also won’t hear about the fact that James Holmes intentionally drove to a smaller, farther away movie theater in order to avoid the venues that allowed for legal concealed carry holders to attend.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365627815743</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 17:03:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365627974570-136</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus return for 5 years is 114% Boeing return on investment for 5 years is 4% dead cat bounce red flag</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365231092292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 02:51:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Airbus is adding 1000 worker now for their better version of the 787 and the stock price shows they are up 114% in 5 years compared to Boeing up , laught now 4% in 5 years .

First is the publicity about the battery problem and the grounding brought a lot of attention to the stock by people who were not interested before the problem. Many believed the problem would be solved and the stock would go up so the started buying. Second, those who shorted the stock got caught in a short squeese since the price didnt tumble and had to buy it back at a higher price. There is some truth to the old saying about any publicity is good publicity. But only when there are steady improvements in the story.

They are warning that we have now entered a "bear market" for gold and that the price of gold will continue to decline for the rest of the year. So should we believe them? Well, their warnings might be more credible if the central banks of the world were not hoarding gold like crazy. During 2012, central bank gold buying was at the highest level that we have seen in almost 50 years. Meanwhile, insider buying of gold stocks has now reached multi-year highs and the U.S. Mint cannot even keep up with the insatiable demand for silver eagle coins. So what in the world is actually going on here? Right now, the central banks of the world are indulging in a money printing binge that reminds many of what happened during the early days of the Weimar Republic. When you flood the financial system with paper money, that is eventually going to cause the prices for hard assets to go up dramatically. Could it be possible that the banksters are trying to drive down the price of both gold and silver so that they can gobble it up cheaply? Do they want to be the ones sitting on all of the "real money" once the paper money bubble that we are living in finally bursts?
