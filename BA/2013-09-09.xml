That's why we have more liars in America then people who tell the truth. Back men lie, that's why they fill the prisons. They run from their kids, run away from a job. They still guns and kill people then these liberals try to take honest Americans guns away. If these people have their way thugs will be the only people with guns, and they were all stolen. They sell kids out to teachers unions while sending their kids to private schools. Kerry claimed to be a hero, his troop came forward and said he was a coward. Now the coward is in charge along with the first homosexual president in our nations history.</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1378699351943</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 00:02:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378699983389-2</Id><Topic><Title>All electric 787 short on watts !</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378689223521</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-08 21:13:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>welcome to the club !</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378699983389</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 00:13:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378701509953-3</Id><Title>Man 'O" Man</Title><Msg>When are politicians in the U.S. going to realize that it is not our job to police other countries and interfere in their politics.

In addition, the court extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years — and more under special circumstances, according to the documents, which include a recently released 2011 opinion by U.S. District Judge John D. Bates, then chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. What had not been previously acknowledged is that the court in 2008 imposed an explicit ban — at the government’s request — on those kinds of searches, that officials in 2011 got the court to lift the bar and that the search authority has been used. Together the permission to search and to keep data longer expanded the NSA’s authority in significant ways without public debate or any specific authority from Congress. The administration’s assurances rely on legalistic definitions of the term “target” that can be at odds with ordinary English usage. The enlarged authority is part of a fundamental shift in the government’s approach to surveillance: collecting first, and protecting Americans’ privacy later. “The government says, ‘We’re not targeting U.S. persons,’ ” said Gregory T. Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. “But then they never say, ‘We turn around and deliberately search for Americans’ records in what we took from the wire.’ That, to me, is not so different from targeting Americans at the outset.” ------------------------------------------------------------ Obonzo is a tyrant and the worst president ever as he continues abusing freedom ,privacy and other citizen rights.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1378729568365</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 08:26:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378729761556-17</Id><Title>Notice to chris_genna: Your Race Card has Expired</Title><Msg>Time to renew your white liberal bigotry membership.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378729761556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 08:29:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378730833085-18</Id><Topic><Title>Notice to chris_genna: Your Race Card has Expired</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378729761556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 08:29:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama will bomb brown people in Syria.....Obama is the abortion Resident.

Additionally, many analysts have predicted what has come to be known as "rate shock" - the realization of many who go to get insurance on the exchanges that they'll be paying a lot more now than they used to. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) - who is one of a few actual doctors in the Senate - put those predictions into words. "Many families are going to have real sticker shock when they see their new insurance rates - even families who get government subsidies," Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon, said. Barrasso said there is "no question" that the U.S. healthcare system needs reform, but at a lower cost, not a higher one. He cited a Kaiser Family Foundation study this week showing that the average family premium for people getting health insurance through their employers has risen by nearly $3,000 from when Obama took office in January 2009. Interestingly, as the AP article notes, the Obama Administration used the same Kaiser study to tout that insurance may end up cheaper for many people. Both Barrasso and the Obama Administration are right on that front. Listed prices for insurance premiums will be higher, but the out-of-pocket cost for those premiums will be lower for many Americans due to government subsidies doled out to pay for insurance. Progressives have used the government subsidies side of the equation to say that the whole enterprise will be worth it, but it's still incredibly important that the total cost of premiums are set to rise all over the country.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1378736769005</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 10:26:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378736831702-32</Id><Topic><Title>Press hiding Norway 787 grounded 9/8/13 for electrical problems</Title><Username>lgbt_2b_free</Username><Timestamp>1378723270096</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 06:41:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You just have to watch any news and the 787 pops up with another ;canceled flight due to technical problems.</Msg><Username>lgbt_2b_free</Username><Timestamp>1378736831702</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 10:27:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378736905580-33</Id><Topic><Title>Notice to chris_genna: Your Race Card has Expired</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378729761556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 08:29:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wasn't Slavery once the law?</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1378736905580</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 10:28:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378737015471-34</Id><Topic><Title>Notice to chris_genna: Your Race Card has Expired</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378729761556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 08:29:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What brought this on?

For the second time in less than a week, a 787 Dreamliner from Boeing Co. (BA) owned by Norwegian Air Shuttle was forced to remain on the ground Sunday due to a technical problem. This time the problem was electrical. The problem first reported last Thursday affected the aircraft’s brakes. An airline spokesman told The Wall Street Journal that the electrical problem has now been fixed and the plane should be cleared to fly again on Monday. The aircraft was scheduled to take 250 passengers on a flight from Oslo to Bangkok, but the airline was forced to fly them to Stockholm, where they boarded an Airbus plane built by Boeing rival European Aeronautic Defense and Space Inc. (EADS) for the flight to Bangkok.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378737848765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 10:44:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378738205836-39</Id><Topic><Title>Why Does Obama want to use Our Military to save Syrians.......</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378663198735</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-08 13:59:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Marxist mentality.....killing 20 million of your own people to force socialism on them is just a means to an end.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1378738205836</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 10:50:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378739001898-40</Id><Topic><Title>Notice to chris_genna: Your Race Card has Expired</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378729761556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 08:29:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Illogical.....there is a difference between having an opinion about good and.evil and upholdolding the law.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378739001898</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 11:03:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378739186210-41</Id><Topic><Title>Who will buy America's debt</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378702825837</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 01:00:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What if Russia and China dump 4 trillion in bonds destroying the US economy?</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378739186210</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 11:06:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378741054343-42</Id><Title>Anybody Know Why Obama Appointed a Known Communist to His Administration?</Title><Msg>......does it make liberals curious.

Maintenance workers replaced a part on the plane late Sunday and the 787 was returned to service on Monday afternoon, Mr. Sandaker-Nielsen said. He could not identify the component. Boeing had delivered the plane to the airline in late June. Norwegian Air Shuttle had grounded its other 787 on Sept. 2 after a cockpit display indicated a problem with the plane’s brakes. The plane had been scheduled to fly from Stockholm to Bangkok and then on to New York. Maintenance crews inspected the aircraft at the Stockholm airport over the course of three days, Mr. Sandaker-Nielsen said, but found no problems. That plane, which has been delivered in mid-August, went back into service on Friday. “We are very happy with the way the aircraft is performing,” Mr. Sandaker-Nielsen said.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1378747273630</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 13:21:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378747294639-71</Id><Title>Boeign stock up .92%, Airbus stock up 1.15% today, ACAD up 8.41% today AB for 3 years 146%, BA 70%</Title><Msg>Airbus year to date stock price gain is now 52% Boeing is 41%.

Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told reporters that he had conveyed the idea to Syria at talks in Moscow and expected “a quick and, I hope, a positive answer.” Syria publicly welcomed the idea. A senior White House official told NBC News that it was no more than a delay tactic. Hours later, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the previous secretary of state, said after a meeting with President Barack Obama that it would be “an important step” if Syria ceded control of its chemical weapons stockpile.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1378753693047</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 15:08:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378754371784-93</Id><Topic><Title>How about this news?</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1378753693047</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 15:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sparty is probably muttering swear words under his breath ...</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1378754371784</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 15:19:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378754397523-94</Id><Title>DC Denied Permit For "2 Million Biker Ride In DC" but gave "Million Muslim March" one</Title><Msg>Washington DC has DENIED our permit for a no-stop ride through Washington DC.

A resident of the town said the rebels shouted “Allahu Akhbar” as they moved through the village, and proceeded to assault Christian homes and churches. “They shot and killed people,” he said. “I heard gunshots and then I saw three bodies lying in the middle of a street in the old quarters of the village. Where is President Obama to see what has befallen us?” Another witness stated, “I saw the militants grabbing five villagers and threatening them and saying, ‘Either you convert to Islam, or you will be beheaded.’” The village is located just 25 miles from Damascus, and sites within the village are dedicated as United Nations world heritage sites. Residents still speak Aramaic, the language of Jesus. The rebels who took over the city are associated with the al Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-associated Islamist group.

But, at the same time, according to the U.S. Treasury, the federal debt did not increase at all during the month. Total federal receipts were $185 billion during August, according to the CBO, while total federal outlays were $331 billion. Thus, the Treasury was forced to engage in $146 billion in deficit spending. Despite this deficit spending, the Treasury reported that at the close of every single business day in August, the federal debt subject to a legal limit by Congress remained exactly $16,699,396,000,000. That is approximately just $25 million below the legal limit on the debt that is $16,699,421,095,673.60 If the federal debt had climbed by the same $146 billion that the deficit climbed in August, it would have exceeded the legal limit by almost $146 billion. In fact, according to the Daily Treasury Statements that the Treasury publishes at 4:00 p.m. on each business day, the debt subject to the legal limit has remained at exactly $16,699,396,000,000--or about $25 million below the legal limit--every day since May 17. With the release of the Daily Treasury Statement for Sept. 6 (which occurred at 4:00 p.m on Sept. 9), that makes 112 days that, according to the U.S. Treasury, the debt has been stuck at $16,699,396,000,000.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassyguy</Username><Timestamp>1378760412127</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 17:00:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378760478821-114</Id><Topic><Title>If Obama Would Explain why He and Hillary lied About Benghazi it might Help</Title><Username>mediocreclassyguy</Username><Timestamp>1378752981400</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 14:56:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What lie?

In a London news conference this morning, Secretary of State John Kerry responded to a question about whether Assad could do anything to avoid war by saying "he could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week. Turn it over, all of it, without delay and allow a full and total accounting." Obama Pushes His Case to Strike Syria Kerry delivered the statement almost dismissively and quickly said Assad had no intention of giving up "weapons he denies using." But it was still the first time such a suggestion had been made by the Obama administration. The State Department was forced to clarify the remarks, calling them "rhetorical" and making clear its desire to strike could be tempered by a Syrian offer. Kerry's point, according to spokeswoman Jen Psaki, "was that this brutal dictator with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts cannot be trusted to turn over chemical weapons." Kerry also rebutted new claims by Assad that the United States has no proof the Syrian president personally ordered the chemical weapons attack. In an interview with PBS' and CBS' Charlie Rose, Assad argued that Kerry had not presented a "single shred of evidence." The German magazine Bild seemed to give some credence to Assad's claims this weekend, reporting that Syrian government forces might have carried out the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack without Assad's permission.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassyguy</Username><Timestamp>1378760680575</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 17:04:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378760752608-116</Id><Title>Norwegian Airlines is leasing Airbus planes while their lemon boeing 787's are down</Title><Msg>So the lemon 787s fix now is to use Airbus planes while the lemon 787 are down!

House Republicans would eliminate food stamps for more than 800,000 Americans who now receive them but still do not get enough to eat or have only a barely adequate diet. Even if the Democrats prevent these draconian cuts, food stamp benefits will still be reduced in November, when a provision in the 2009 stimulus bill expires. While attention is focused on Syria, funds for the nation’s poorest schools are being slashed. Teachers are still being let go. Classrooms are more crowded than ever. The sequester will drain even more funds after October 1. While attention is focused on Syria, low-income housing is disappearing. Funding for housing vouchers has already been cut by $854 million this year, with the result that half of all public housing authorities have stopped issuing new vouchers — even though the percentage of households most in need of assistance has grown by 19 percent since 2009. The cuts scheduled to begin October 1 will be even more severe. While attention is focused on Syria, America’s rich are growing even richer. A single year’s income of one of the ten richest Americans could buy housing for every homeless person in America for an entire year. (This calculation is based on a typical day last winter, when over 633,000 people were homeless, and the typical monthly rental cost of a unit with single room occupancy of $558 per month.) But we are not talking about any of this. We are not debating what’s happening to our nation. We are not creating jobs for the long-term unemployed. We are not raising the minimum wage, expanding the EITC, or providing enough food stamps to feed America’s poor children or keep working Americans out of poverty. We are not improving the nation’s poorest schools or providing enough low-income housing to keep destitute families off the nation’s streets. We are not reforming our tax code or making college more affordable or reforming our brutal immigration system. We are not addressing the widening gap between a few at the top who are doing better than ever and a larger number below who are sinking. We are not getting big money out of politics. We are paralyzed at home — as we turn our attention to a potential quagmire abroad. This is the great tragedy of our time.</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1378763466442</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 17:51:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378763540376-127</Id><Topic><Title>How about this news?</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1378753693047</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-09 15:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are working on it.

Boeing Co. spokeswoman Yvonne Leach confirmed the report, saying the aerospace company is working with Norwegian Air to fix the problem. Leach said the problem was not related to the jetliner's lithium-ion batteries. Norwegian Air spokesman told the AFP news service that the grounded 787 was not getting enough electricity. But no worries, har har , not batteries. AFP reported that the plane was scheduled to leave Oslo for Bangkok on Saturday, but after waiting for more than 24 hours, the passengers were transferred to Stockholm, where they boarded a chartered plane.

Industry sources believe that the 737's design makes re-engining considerably more expensive for Boeing than it was for the Airbus A320. However, there did prove to be considerable demand. Southwest Airlines, who use the 737 for their entire fleet (680 in service or on order), said they were not prepared to wait 20 years or more for a new 737 model and threatening to convert to Airbus.[27] Boeing eventually bowed to airline pressure and in 2011 approved the 737 MAX project, scheduled for first delivery in 2017.
