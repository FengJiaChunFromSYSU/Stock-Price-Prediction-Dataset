Horrible attitude, disrespectful to coworkers and customers, unprofessional behavior, unwillingness to follow procedures, poor workmanship, and refusal to collaborate with other team members seem engraved in the military culture. When there was a fight or major disagreement where I work, one of the few ex-military employees seems to always be part of it. For an example, a recent fight erruped after a particular exmilitary engineer exploded in a tirade of foul language and namecalling towards our QA person after he simply requested that the engineer add a few notes in his drawing to be more clear to manufacturing. The ex-military engineer has demonstrated poor behavior towards the QA and others numerous times but HR and management ignores taking any action against it. (his direct manager who refuses to take action is also ex-military - now how suprising is that?) I respect the military and what they do, but it seems to me that they dont mix well within a workplace of civilians.</Msg><Username>hansy4prez</Username><Timestamp>1367057292243</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 06:08:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367063009149-10</Id><Topic><Title>Comparing the TEA Party and it's Policies</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1366991424329</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 11:50:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are you polluting Boeing board with your political nonsense.

In the past three years, numerous political and economic arguments for and against the law’s provision have been thrown back and forth by pundits and lawmakers of every political persuasion. But putting aside whatever political ramifications the legislation may have in the future, companies in the the healthcare sector and beyond are preparing for the mandates and regulations that will take effect next year. While some companies, such as The Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE) and Whole Foods (NASDAQ:WFM), have spoken out against the economic ramifications of Obamacare — that will cause a great increase in corporate spending on healthcare — many areas of the healthcare sector will experience growth as a result… Here’s a look at several stocks that should see benefits from the implementation of Obamacare: The most interesting category of possible beneficiaries includes health insurance providers such as AthenaHealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH). From one perspective, the Affordable Healthcare Act could pose some problems for insurers. With more Americans signing up for coverage, there is likely to be more competition in the industry. As evidence of this concern, upon Obama’s reelection shares of these insurers dropped slightly. But as all Americans — excluding those exempt on a religious basis or because of extreme financial hardship — will be required to have insurance, the pool of potential customers will increase. Just as for insurers, this double-edged sword will shape the experience of customers as well. Because insurance companies will now be unable to decline coverage to individuals with preexisting conditions, the potential risk — and the potential loss — for insurance companies will Just as for insurers, this double-edged sword will shape the experience of customers as well. Because insurance companies will now be unable to decline coverage to individuals with preexisting conditions, the potential risk — and the potential loss — for insurance companies will soar. After all, even though the pool of potential customers will be larger, in the aggregate, it will be less healthy. As the risks will be greater, premiums will likely increase. In a private presentation to brokers at the end of February, UnitedHealth said that premiums for some consumers purchasing their own plans could increase as much as 116 percent and small business rates could jump as much as 25 percent to 50 percent… The most obvious beneficiary of mandated healthcare will be hospital operators. As the U.S. healthcare system currently functions, many hospitals provide care to individuals without health insurance, and therefore they often are not compensated for their services. Under Obamacare, each individual will be required to purchase insurance if it is not already provided by their employers, so hospitals will be paid from the insurance companies, not uninsured individuals. This will both improve profitability for companies such as HCA Holdings and LifePoint Hospitals (NASDAQ:LPNT) and increase their business, as those who have insurance are more likely to go to a medical provider than those who do not. Obamacare laid out a wide and varied mission. In addition to its higher profile goal of mandating universal healthcare, the act also sought to increase the accuracy and lower the cost of medical records by compelling doctors, hospitals, and pharmacists to begin developing electronic medical records. With this requirement, companies that work with EMRs — such as Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) — will see business increase greatly. But for companies that manufacture medical devices and pharmaceuticals — such as Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) — Obamacare will bring added pressure, as virtually every medical device or drug will be put under greater scrutiny.</Msg><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1367087132532</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 14:25:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367087208036-37</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing 9/11 plane landing gear found behind Park Place mosque</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1367078605378</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 12:03:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There wasn't an AF in WWII, only an Army Air Corpse</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367087208036</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 14:26:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367087512569-38</Id><Topic><Title>How to profit from "Obamacare"</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1367087132532</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 14:25:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>another man made disaster, courtesy of maobowa n dumbocrats</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367087512569</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 14:31:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367090348580-39</Id><Topic><Title>How to profit from "Obamacare"</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1367087132532</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 14:25:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Individual healthcare premiums have always been way too sky-high until now, when individuals might be able to co-opt due to circumstances beyond their control, such as: 1. being born to right-to-lifer with a major medical genetic fault or pre-dispostioning condition, such as a dumbfascist or censored50 (only 50 ?) 2. corporations rule and suck 3. para ayunda en espanol por favor llamo al 4. etc.</Msg><Username>reloadx10</Username><Timestamp>1367090348580</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 15:19:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367090493905-40</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing 9/11 plane landing gear found behind Park Place mosque</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1367078605378</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 12:03:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Well, there you go again...." - the semi-senile el presidente RWR, aka 666, your hero</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367090493905</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 15:21:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367090639525-41</Id><Topic><Title>April delivery status</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1367082521809</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 13:08:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>by falmouthharbor•Mar 26, 2013 6:55 PMFlag . 40 planes so far. 29 737's. 3 747's. 8 777's. hmmm...</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367090639525</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 15:23:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367090740056-42</Id><Topic><Title>Let's take a poll of the Board</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367020800974</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 20:00:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How many believe that hope4white peoples is a low IQ right-wing bigot ?</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367090740056</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 15:25:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367090892850-43</Id><Topic><Title>first 787 commercial flight since grounding</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1367076637230</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 11:30:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lololololol</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1367090892850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 15:28:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367091447717-44</Id><Topic><Title>How to profit from "Obamacare"</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1367087132532</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 14:25:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But what about the DRUGS to treat low IQ right wing bigots what will happen to that and their mental healtcare benefits...???

You were right. The players may be a little different, but your basic premise is correct: The world is a rigged game. We found this out in recent months, when a series of related corruption stories spilled out of the financial sector, suggesting the world’s largest banks may be fixing the prices of, well, just about everything. You may have heard of the Libor scandal, in which at least three – and perhaps as many as 16 – of the name-brand too-big-to-fail banks have been manipulating global interest rates, in the process messing around with the prices of upward of $500 trillion (that’s trillion, with a “t”) worth of financial instruments. When that sprawling con burst into public view last year, it was easily the biggest financial scandal in history – MIT professor Andrew Lo even said it “dwarfs by orders of magnitude any financial scam in the history of markets.” That was bad enough, but now Libor may have a twin brother. Word has leaked out that the London-based firm ICAP, the world’s largest broker of interest-rate swaps, is being investigated by American authorities for behavior that sounds eerily reminiscent of the Libor mess. Regulators are looking into whether or not a small group of brokers at ICAP may have worked with up to 15 of the world’s largest banks to manipulate ISDAfix, a benchmark number used around the world to calculate the prices of interest-rate swaps.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367096864572</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 17:07:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367096938307-52</Id><Topic><Title>RIGHT ALL ALONG ..FOR BANKSTERS EVERYTHING IS RIGGED ...</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367096864572</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 17:07:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But the biggest shock came out of a federal courtroom at the end of March – though if you follow these matters closely, it may not have been so shocking at all – when a landmark class-action civil lawsuit against the banks for Libor-related offenses was dismissed. In that case, a federal judge accepted the banker-defendants' incredible argument: If cities and towns and other investors lost money because of Libor manipulation, that was their own fault for ever thinking the banks were competing in the first place. "A farce," was one antitrust lawyer's response to the eyebrow-raising dismissal. "Incredible," says Sylvia Sokol, an attorney for Constantine Cannon, a firm that specializes in antitrust cases. All of these stories collectively pointed to the same thing: These banks, which already possess enormous power just by virtue of their financial holdings – in the United States, the top six banks, many of them the same names you see on the Libor and ISDAfix panels, own assets equivalent to 60 percent of the nation's GDP – are beginning to realize the awesome possibilities for increased profit and political might that would come with colluding instead of competing. Moreover, it's increasingly clear that both the criminal justice system and the civil courts may be impotent to stop them, even when they do get caught working together to game the system. If true, that would leave us living in an era of undisguised, real-world conspiracy, in which the prices of currencies, commodities like gold and silver, even interest rates and the value of money itself, can be and may already have been dictated from above. And those who are doing it can get away with it. Forget the Illuminati – this is the real thing, and it's no secret.

In this case, that appearance included a curfew that amounted to searching and hassling people who were clearly not in cahoots with the bombing suspects. Police detained and searched anyone on the streets of Boston and Watertown, even searching famous local news reporters multiple times during the course of the manhunt. In some instances, news reporters received death threats from over-zealous police officers. In the end, if the goal of the terrorists was to terrorize, the terrorists won in Boston. Rather than returning to its ordinary business, one of the world's greatest cities was terrorized, and even shut down, for days by the two suspects identified by authorities as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older (deceased) brother Tamerlan. The two presumably hated America for its freedom, and were able to get the government to take away much of those freedoms from its citizens for a period of time. The scare even led to a humorous over-reaction in Bridgewater, a college town where a “suspicious” backpack forced the evacuation of part of Bridgewater University. The Navy bomb disposal team arrived to find the backpack full of beer, according to the Brockton, Mass.-based Enterprise newspaper. The newspaper story did not record how police disposed of the “suspicious package.” The reaction of Massachusetts's state and federal officials to the Boston Marathon bombings — two black powder bombs with nails and ball bearings that killed three people — can be contrasted with the wave of 125 nearly identical bombings, technologically speaking, that took place across America in major U.S. cities during the 1917-20 "Red Scare." The differences are that many more were killed 100 years ago, top U.S. government officials were targeted (including the U.S. Attorney General and judges) back then, and the federal government did not shut down entire cities. Although the period is known as the "Red Scare," the genuine security threat was greater than the threat authorities responded to in Boston. And with the exception of a set of warrantless searches by the Justice Department's Bureau of Investigation (later the FBI) under J. Edgar Hoover, the public's liberties were respected. And as if the attacks on civil liberties during the current Boston manhunt weren't sufficient offense against the Bill of Rights, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsay Graham has called on denying Dzhokhar Tsarnaev — a U.S. citizen — all his rights under the U.S. Constitution. On the evening of Tsarnaev's arrest, Graham tweeted the following remarks: • “If captured, I hope Administration will at least consider holding the Boston suspect as enemy combatant for intelligence gathering purposes.” • “The Law of War allows us to hold individual in this scenario as potential enemy combatant w/o Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.” • “Under the Law of War we can hold #Boston suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.” Graham later tweeted a partial retraction, claiming: “As to any future trial, if this suspect is an American citizen, he is NOT subject to military commission trial. #Boston.” However, that trial could (and probably should) be indefinitely delayed, according to Graham and Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). The two issued a joint statement on April 20, arguing: “We hope the Obama Administration will consider the enemy combatant option because it is allowed by national security statutes and U.S. Supreme Court decisions.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367097381511</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 17:16:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367097466915-54</Id><Topic><Title>RIGHT ALL ALONG ..FOR BANKSTERS EVERYTHING IS RIGGED ...</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367096864572</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 17:07:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tip of the iceberg is 10% imagine a world with the tip of an icberg 1% the cat must be a communist because it wants to sing along 3-28-81 to get it's licks in meouw c'est le meme dans tout language or langage shake it shake it where'd it go don't wanna be made into guitar sttrings strangle the cat burn the house down lunch in Bali/Fiji/Tahiti even S.

It seems the board resident loon has been having a spell of the vapors while I was out and about having a real life. So let me see, Farty. You are claiming this statement supports your wildest fantasies: "Conspiracy theorists of the world, believers in the hidden hands of the Rothschilds and the Masons and the Illuminati, we skeptics owe you an apology"." MT OMFG! Irony is totally L-O-S-T on you, ain't it!! WHAT A HOOT!!! You really do take satire literally! Reasoning with you is like trying convince a 5 year old that the bogeyman he saw on TV was fiction. I'm sorry to take you down this way, Farty. I really don't enjoy fighting a battle of wits with an unarmed man. But.....you took it upon yourself to poop on my thread, so it's all on you.
