Two limits being discussed in FAA. 1st is a two hour flight maximum and the other is a 5.5 hour maximum. Not going very far on either. Makes the fuel efficiency a moot point with no long haul service. Looks like the 70's to me in the short term. Once the airlines get some real flight time on the aircraft they can extend the Etops cert. Downward pressure for now and more cost to the company. Makes it hard to deliver an aircraft to Japan or other parts of the world.

By ‘liberal’, I do not mean simply someone who has a generally liberal outlook, in the sense of a ‘live and let live’ philosophy, nor do I mean liberals in the sense of the classical liberals of the conservative tradition. By ‘white liberal’, I mean a white Western individual who is likely to come from a middle class background and have a university education, considers him or herself to be both ‘left-wing’ and socially ‘liberal’, and almost certainly reads The Guardian or The Independent. White liberals espouse an artificial and pretentious form of ‘egalitarianism’, a patronising and hypocritical approach to ethnic minorities and non-Western cultures, and – in a re-hash of the notion of the ‘white man’s burden’ – devote themselves to a delusional Messianism in which they seek to ‘save the world’ through protesting against war (in real terms, protesting against non-white people having a chance at freedom and democracy), Israel (the one truly liberal society in the Middle East), globalisation (thereby opposing the one great vehicle by which poorer nations can develop), and so on, while making themselves feel and look ‘good’ by flaunting their pious support for campaigns to end poverty in the Third World (which will do no such thing, as Dambisa Moyo, Stephen Pollard, Marian L. Tupy, and others rightly point out ), and boasting about how ‘progressive’ they are by showing ‘solidarity’ with genocidal Islamists in Gaza. White liberals, despite viewing themselves as intelligent and open-minded, are actually some of the most illiberal and narrow-minded people in society today. Their reactions to the idea that anyone might think differently to them range from gut-wrenching despair to pure hatred of the kind seen in the most fanatical of ‘true believers’. White liberals are, by and large, incapable of serious adult debate (preferring innuendo and accusations of bigotry), or of dealing with the fact that not everyone will agree with them (despite their supposed love of pluralism and a multiplicity of different ‘voices’), and tend to see any view which deviates from their cultic leftist script as a form of irredeemable moral evil. White liberals do not base their world-view on rational analysis and sensible argument, but instead on an almost religious faith that they possess the ‘truth’, and just as we see in so many fundamentalist religious cults and sects, the devotees of the white liberal faith burn with hatred for the ‘sin’ that surrounds them, and indeed, all too often for the ‘sinners’ themselves. White liberals, who are the intellectual equivalent of stroppy, rebellious teenagers, have sought to subvert and undermine Western civilisation, and some offer support for authoritarian and even terrorist movements as part of their attack on ‘racism’ and ‘colonialism’. White liberals approach issues of race and racism from an essentially irrational, moralistic standpoint. White liberals do not simply judge racism to be based on bad thinking and criticise it for its illogical collectivism. Instead, white liberals make the issue of racism, as with other issues, all about them. White liberals have colonised the discourse of racism and anti-racism because it offers them an opportunity to boast of the superiority of their virtue and to demonstrate their purity and holiness through ostentatious and vacuous public displays of self-flagellation. Just as early Christianity imbued adherents with a deep sense of guilt and sinfulness, so the white liberal finds in reflecting on the history of white racism the opportunity to both revel in the guilt of the sinner and to make atonement through ‘anti-racist’ initiatives, thereby offering them the opportunity to further present themselves as a holy elite tasked with saving the world. And just as at various points in the history of Christianity an overarching sense of guilt derived from an intense awareness of, and obsession with, the supposedly inherent sinfulness of human beings and of the ‘world’ led ‘holy’ men and women to conclude that the path to holiness is found in the hatred of self, world, and the human condition, white liberals indulge in a form of self-hatred which is designed to project the image of penitence and sanctity, while actually being transparently pretentious, self-aggrandising, and destructive. Ideological white racists are collectivists who adopt the irrational position that white people form some kind of world-wide ‘brotherhood’ with a unified history and culture. The huge variations in the historical and cultural experiences and manifestations of the various majority white nations is seen to be of little importance in the bigger picture. Ideological white racists are frequently people who have made little or no personal contribution to the development and advancement of Western civilisation. You won’t find many ground-breaking inventors and innovators, great scientists, artists, composers, and so on in the ranks of the modern white supremacist movement, but you will find many bitter and insecure individuals who make themselves feel important by piggy-backing on the achievements of others. When white racist activists and ideologues talk of ‘white unity’ and ‘white pride’, they almost always claim to be ‘proud’ of the ‘superior’ achievements of white people throughout history. Ideological white racists will point to great men and women of the past and present who happen to share their skin colour and state how great the ‘white race’ is. So, you will find the absurd phenomenon of drug dealing, dole scrounging morons who somehow feel Shakespeare and Mozart can be claimed by them as great men of ‘their race’. Clearly, stating yourself ‘proud’ of things that you have not made or done just because they were made or done by people who look or looked similar to you has no rational basis. On this point, white liberals will agree. However, at the same time, white liberals advocate an inverse form of the same collectivist nonsense by proposing that whites should feel collective guilt for the negative actions of white people of the past. It’s clearly stupid for a skinhead thug to claim to feel ‘proud’ of the works of Beethoven, yet it is also equally stupid for a white liberal to claim to feel ‘guilty’ for the actions of white slave traders or marauding white colonialists. But the white liberal simply will not accept this. White liberals hold an almost universally negative view of the history of Western civilisation and claim that modern Western whites should apologise and make amends for the actions of whites of previous generations and even previous centuries. If a Mayor of London made a public speech tearfully extolling the superior virtues of white people who happened to live in London in the past most people would be shocked by this act of collectivist posturing and irrational bigotry. However, when the tables are turned and a Mayor of London makes a tearful ‘apology’ for long dead Londoners’ involvement in the slave trade, this is seen by white liberals to be a moral and righteous act.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1364398979695</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 11:42:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364398990938-34</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare Will Cause Medical Claims Costs To Jump 32 Percent: Study</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1364350588292</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 22:16:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>actually its the Tbaggers and RWNJs who feel the walls crashing in- in years past there was no Obamacare or green energy programs- these things are now be fought for and are becoming law for most of Obamas policys</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1364398990938</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 11:43:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364399309224-35</Id><Topic><Title>White House Schedule</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363270937569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 10:22:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>another busy day... 10:30 AM The President and the Vice President receive the Presidential Daily Briefing 12:15 PM Press Briefing by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest 2:25 PM The President is interviewed by Univision 2:40 PM The President is interviewed by Telemundo home alone, no pesky tours, the kids on vacation, but where is moochelle? got budget?</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1364399309224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 11:48:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364399482133-36</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare Will Cause Medical Claims Costs To Jump 32 Percent: Study</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1364350588292</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 22:16:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The cost is insane - but ya ain't seen nuthin yet "[T]he Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is no more popular now than when it was passed, as Americans have come to realize that it will neither protect patients nor provide for affordable care. While full repeal of the law is not within the realm of short-term political reality ... repeal should nonetheless remain the end goal, either one piece at a time for now or root and branch. The price tag for Obamacare has gone from shocking to preposterous. In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the ten-year cost of the law at $898 billion; by February 2013, that number had climbed to $1.6 trillion, and it is likely that further revisions will be in the upward direction. ... As mind-boggling as its price tag is, expense is not the main reason to repeal Obamacare. What is not sufficiently understood is that Obamacare does not reform or regulate health insurance: It effectively abolishes health insurance. ... In short, the system created by this ill-advised law would prevent the emergence of normally functioning markets in medical services and health insurance. Instead, it establishes a top-down system of price controls and subsidies that will discourage healthy people from buying insurance in the first place, reward those who exploit the system's defects, and discourage doctors and other health-care providers from extending their care to those who most need it". ...

We repudiate the artificial unity that does nothing more than deprive persons of individual responsibility. We do not repudiate the natural unity of mankind under Providence. Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.” Bastiat A conservative wants to do these things with money contributed voluntarily.

A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 22% of Likely U.S. Voters still think the sequester cut the projected growth in spending too much. But twice as many (45%) disagree and think it didn’t cut enough. Fourteen percent (14%) feel the amount cut was about right.

Don’t buy it for a moment. Economics is not really that complex a subject. More than a century ago, Frederic Bastiat, a French philosopher and economist, noted that most bad economic policies are the result of rather simple fallacies. In one particularly famous essay, Bastiat addressed the “fallacy of the broken glass.” It goes like this: if a boy throws a brick through a shopkeeper’s window, is he a curse or a benefit to society? You may think he is a curse, the purveyor of fallacy might answer, but in reality, he is an overall benefit to society. For consider: because the window was broken, the glazier gets a new job. With the money he makes, he can buy a new shirt. With the money he gets from the glazier, the haberdasher can buy a new table. And so on and so forth. Can you see the fault in this line of reason? Can you see the fallacy? This fallacy has been used by unscrupulous politicians since at least the days of Bastiat. I recall, as a child, being told by teachers, that we did the Japanese and Germans a favor by reducing their factories to rubble in WWII, because this forced them to build new factories, which put them at a competitive advantage against us, which explained why the Japanese and German economies boomed in the years after WWII. Do you see the fallacy? Today, a variation of the broken glass fallacy is being used to push the so-called “stimulus package.” Basically, the argument goes that if you take money from the taxpayers, and spend that money on government programs, there will be a “stimulus” to the economy that would not otherwise occur. Because, you see, the government employees who get the taxpayer’s money will take it and spend in on new clothes, and new cars. And then the clothiers and the car dealers will make more money, which they will spend on color TV’s and new homes. And so on and so forth. I am deliberately refraining from naming the nature of the fallacy, because I know the Capitol Hill Blue readership can think it through. From now on, when you hear a government proposed “solution” to economic problems the government has itself created, see if the fallacy of the broken glass applies. It all goes under the theory of “that which is seen, and that which is not seen.” And do read the entire essay, by all means. You will find there is very little in today’s economic sophistry that was not identified and refuted centuries ago.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1364417370791</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 16:49:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364417553512-111</Id><Topic><Title>Will Anyone Here Dare Admit they are a Liberal.....</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1364411676641</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 15:14:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we liberals are not ashamed of our liberalism - but are proud of it- you on the other hand have to be proud of your anti intellectualism, your backwardness and your inability to advance beyond the 16th century..

I wonder what they call Star Parker, a black woman who says outrageous things like this: “The more that human lives are governed by compulsion and entitlement rather than freedom, choice and personal responsibility, the outcomes are uniformly undesirable.” Detroit and the top 10 poorest #$%$hole urban kill zones in the country have been run by Democrats for decades. Their entitlement policies, rampant corruption, and utter failure in educating its children have made them unlivable for civilized human beings. Union thugs run the show. High taxes, high crime rates, and ignorant savages impregnating ignorant sluts has resulted in Detroits all over America. These are the very same policies being implemented by Obama and his minions across the country. Detroit is unfixable. The $14 billion of unfunded liabilites will be defaulted on. This will happen in every urban municipality in this country. It will eventually happen in the entire country. Numbers do matter. Personal responsibility does matter. Being able to add or write a sentence does matter.
