A particular piece, “Benedictus”, you will find many U-tube versions posted. But this one, “Benedictus – Karl Jenkins”, is worthy of note because of the visuals from many wars that goes with it: Go to U-tube and either enter “uNocNUr9aaY” or “elena171177” and then select Benedictus. You likely remember the young girl running away from the napalm, i.e., “The Napalm Girl”. That photo is in the mix, so it is difficult in some of its imagery. And the music is exceptional. She has an interesting story to tell. I extracted the following on-line: The girl-turned-woman, Kim #$%$, who helped end the Vietnam War when she was pictured screaming naked as blobs of sticky napalm melted through her clothes, says she has embraced Christianity as a way to forgive and find healing in love. On that fateful day of June 8, 1972, the girl's clothes literally melted on her body as everything around her was consumed by fire when a South Vietnamese plane dropped its flaming napalm on civilians while searching for Communist North Vietnamese forces and their Viet Cong allies. "Napalm is the most terrible pain you can imagine," #$%$ said in a Faith Today publication article, republished Friday, June 8 (2012), by the Breaking Christian News (BCN) service. "Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. Napalm generates temperatures of 800 to 1,200 degrees Celsius." She planned to become a doctor, but the Vietnamese government realizing she had propaganda value wanted to use her as their "National Symbol of War". The teenager was made to leave school and participate in highly choreographed publicity gatherings, including meeting journalists in her village. Now 49, she recalled the darkness and bitterness that surrounded her in those days saying "I didn't want to live anymore." Though #$%$ wasn't allowed to attend school anymore, she was still a seeker of truth and became engrossed in books at the library. It was there that she stumbled upon a Bible, and "I couldn't stop reading it," she said. Eventually she attended a church. "I heard the Gospel explained to me for the first time. The love of God changed my life. I knew that Jesus died on the cross and paid for my sins. So I asked God, 'Do You forgive me?'" Still struggling with anger and sorrow over her life, which she described as a cup of bitter, dark coffee, #$%$ said she asked the Lord, "How can I clean everything in my heart if it's full of coffee?" She found that the answer was in pouring out that cup each day "until it became empty and God spilled His love into my cup." After being allowed to study in Cuba for a time, she met and married fellow Vietnamese student Bui Huy Toan, and after honeymooning in Moscow, the couple grabbed their chance at freedom. As their plane stopped for fuel in Newfoundland, the two defected and began a new life together in Ontario, Canada. She once summarized her experiences in a poem, writing: "Had it not been for the war, I would not value peace. Had it not been for pain, I would not know the healing power of love. Had it not been for hatred, I would never have learned to forgive. Had it not been for imprisonment, I would not value freedom. Had it not been for living in want, I would not value everything I have. Had it not been for fear, I would not value peace..." So, despite how we banter or brawl, this reminds me of God’s promise in Revelation 21:1-4 …. Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” Bulky</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359274249442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 03:10:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359274638037-13</Id><Topic><Title>Sincere,,,</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359273612622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 03:00:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah well...</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359274638037</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 03:17:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359274661990-14</Id><Topic><Title>Sincere,,,</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359273612622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 03:00:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we win again</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359274661990</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 03:17:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359275045518-15</Id><Topic><Title>John Kerry Grilled By Rand Paul Over Presidential Power In Constitution</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359254176691</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:36:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The problem is, it just doesn’t work in some instances when 10,000 people are to be wiped out by a brutal dictator and need to make a quick judgment about engagement, you can’t rely on a Congress that has proven itself unwilling to move after weeks and months."

This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The United States desperately needs to maintain control over its own domestic energy resources so that we can end our addiction to foreign oil. As I have written about previously, the United States actually has plenty of oil. If we would simply use the resources that we already have, we would never have to import a single drop of foreign oil. But instead, we continue to be the largest importer of oil on the planet and we are allowing China to rapidly buy up oil and gas deposits inside the United States. This is fundamentally wrong and it is a serious threat to our national security. But apparently everything is for sale in the United States today, and that includes our precious energy resources. The Chinese government is using two giant corporations to buy up these energy resources. The first is the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). According to Wikipedia, this corporation is 100 percent owned by the Chinese government…. CNOOC Group is a state-owned oil company, fully owned by the Government of the People’s Republic of China, and the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) performs the rights and obligations of shareholder on behalf of the government. The second is Sinopec Corporation. Sinopec Group is the largest shareholder (about 75% of the shares) in Sinopec Corporation. And as the Sinopec website tells us, Sinopec Group is owned by the Chinese government…. Sinopec Group, the largest shareholder of Sinopec Corp., is a super-large petroleum and petrochemical group incorporated by the State in 1998 based on the former China Petrochemical Corporation. Funded by the State, it is a State authorized investment arm and State-owned controlling company. So wherever you see CNOOC or Sinopec you can replace those names with the Chinese government. The Chinese government essentially runs both of those companies. And both companies have been very busy buying up U.S. oil and gas deposits.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359314714505</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:25:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359314807109-50</Id><Topic><Title>Battery Choice Saved 40 Pounds</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1359261000650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:30:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Forbes article goes on to quote the professor: The lithium-ion battery in a cell phone, for example, is safer because the battery is so close to the outside of the phone that heat does not build up and cause a problem. In stark contrast, the 787′s lithium-ion battery is actually eight notebook sized batteries all packed next to each other in a closed box. This means that only the batteries on the ends have any hope of venting the heat they generate. The other six batteries just heat each other up since they can’t release their heat outside the box.... He also would put temperature sensors on each of the eight batteries and implement a “system of forced airflow” inside the box to help assure that the temperature of each battery stays below a threshold level. It pains me to think that Boeing would make a fundamental design error like this but in the context of outsourced design of systems with multiple sub contractors it makes more sense. The system issues, like overheating, can get lost in the rush to make schedules, reduce weight, integrate the parts, and keep the system within a specified size. I hope this doesn't turn out to be the problem (or part of the problem) because it's embarrassing. But, if it is it should be a relatively easy fix, particularly if Boeing is smart enough to bring in people like this to consult.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1359314807109</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:26:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359314827064-51</Id><Topic><Title>China buying up huge Amounts of US REAL Estate and Assets</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359299081701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:04:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chinese group known as “Sino-Michigan Properties LLC” has bought up 200 acres of land near the town of Milan, Michigan. Their plan is to construct a “China City” with artificial lakes, a Chinese cultural center and hundreds of housing units for Chinese citizens. Essentially, it would be a little slice of communist China dropped right into the heartland of America. This “China City” would be located about 40 minutes from both Detroit and Toledo, and it would be marketed to Chinese business people that want to start businesses in the United States. Unfortunately, this is not just an isolated incident. In fact, Chinese companies have been buying up land and businesses all over the country in recent years. There has even been talk of establishing “special economic zones” inside the United States modeled after the Chinese city of Shenzhen. It was inevitable that the Chinese were going to do something with the trillions of dollars that they have made flooding our shores with cheap products. Now they are rapidly buying up pieces of America, and many of our politicians are welcoming them with open arms. The town of Milan, Michigan is a small farming community of only about 6,000 people, but big changes are coming their way. The following is from a recent Dayton Daily News article about this new project…. A group of mainland Chinese known as Sino-Michigan Properties LLC paid $1.9 million for 200 acres of farmland on Milan city limits in purchases this year and in 2011, according to local officials and property records. Unfortunately, the goal does not appear to be to integrate this new “city” into the existing community in and around Milan. Rather, it appears that all of the new housing will be sold to people coming over from China. According to the Milan News Leader newspaper, the new housing units “would be marketed to Chinese business people who want to start companies in the United States”. In essence, we would be looking at a new Chinese city right in the middle of Michigan.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359314827064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:27:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359314994259-52</Id><Topic><Title>The U.S. has far more gun-related killings than any other developed country</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1359310776342</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 13:19:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I asked BrokeDik_Hertz a few times why...if Obama is the answer to racism, WHY are there so many blacks getting killed in America?

What you and Hooz keep running from are facts that taking away or banning guns is a from everybody is a solution to gun violence when it isn't. You want everyone to pay for the sins of a few and that is not what this country is about. I'm pointing out that White people with guns aren't even the problem and when stats on whites are compared to other developed countries that have a homogeneous populations the stats are as good and often better for Whites in the USA. If Blacks are using guns to kill at a ratio that's 9 times higher than Whites isn't that a relevant point in approaching the problem? If you want to ignore Hooz's misleading comparisons and make it look like I don't care about blacks, then I suggest that you're dishonest for doing so.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1359316624611</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:57:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359316663290-64</Id><Topic><Title>FBI's OWN statistics show 50 % LESS violent crime the 20 years ago</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359171205734</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:33:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Virtually none from assault weapons sinc assault weapons are fully Auto.

The Gill Electric Company was founded by Mr. Lawrence Gill in 1920, in Redlands, California, where the factory remains today. At that time, Gill Electric was manufacturing lead-acid batteries for the automotive industry. During the war years, Gill manufactured batteries for military ground vehicles and aircraft; some of these batteries are still in production today. Gill Electric improved the drycharged process which provides a fresh charged product when the electrolyte is added. Gill has become the OEM "original equipment battery" for Raytheon, Cessna, LearJet, Mooney, Piper, Ayres, Airtractor, Maule, Schweizer and others in the aviation industry and Gill continues to be the industry's choice for quality battery products.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359317512307</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 15:11:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359318053721-68</Id><Topic><Title>Battery Choice Saved 40 Pounds</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1359261000650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:30:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The battery may be a symptom , not the root cause of the grounding, the issue is the cheap outsourcing to save money and not using the skill, knowledge and ability of the SPEEA engineering talent that Boeing had in the era of the 777 more examples of successful batteries that Boeing engineers approved ----Boeing 767 aircraft use a Nickel Cadmium battery (Ref AIPC 24-31-01-02 Item 35). Boeing part number S282T002-1 (ELDEC part number BA06 or SAFT part number 4579). This battery is 28VDC. There are actually two batteries installed, one is for the aircraft power system, the other for APU starting. Not going to look up that reference. They are both the same part number and are interchangeable. (And weighs 96 pounds - no fun installing in the APU battery location behind the P49 panel) The main battery for an MD-88 is actually two batteries. Instead of having one heavy 28VDC battery, it has two 14VDC batteries in series. Voltage adds in series, so that makes 28 volts. They are replaced as a set. This is a Douglas thing. The MD-11 is the same way.

(I ignored Secuarplane as they do not appear to have a direct physical/thermal responsibility.) However the same search for "Saft" (maker of commercial and defense Li-ion batteries, a French company with U.S. based manufacturing) resulted in a cogent patent involving understanding the potential runaway heating problem for Li-ion batteries and a patented method to control and remove the heat. The Saft Patent (5,187,030) was issued in 1993. (I am not offering that it is a profound patent, but it is there, nevertheless). The point being that many understand that the thermal management of Li-ion batteries is crucial. Satellite manufacturers, for example, like Boeing, Loral, and Lockheed Martin also "worry" the battery thermal management to the "nth" degree of everything, and especially the battery as its performance is greatly impacted by conditions too cold as well as too hot. Once in space, there is not much in the way of adjustments that can be made. The design of such thermal control is proved and shaken down in unit, subsystem, and system level testing. It is hard to believe that Boeing Airplane did not have an appreciation for Li-ion battery thermal issues but may have, as you suggested, lost control of the thermal systems discipline in the outsourcing process for the battery.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359319042789</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 15:37:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359319415595-74</Id><Topic><Title>Military leaders are being asked if they will fire on U.S. citizens if ordered.</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359217762358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:29:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What Obama ACTUALLY said if full context: Obama, July 2, Colorado Springs, CO: [As] president I will expand AmeriCorps to 250,000 slots [from 75,000] and make that increased service a vehicle to meet national goals, like providing health care and education, saving our planet and restoring our standing in the world, so that citizens see their effort connected to a common purpose.

We’ve got to have a civilian national security force that’s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded. We need to use technology to connect people to service. We’ll expand USA Freedom Corps to create online networks where American can browse opportunities to volunteer. You’ll be able to search by category, time commitment and skill sets.

Or does he? From the Seattle Times Saturday. A Lynnwood man who allegedly hogtied a 4-year-old and shot her 36 times with a pellet gun has been arrested by the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office. The 26-year-old man is being held for investigation of second-degree child assault and unlawful imprisonment after the girl told her grandmother and a child-interview specialist this month that she had been punished for waking him up early, according to the Sheriff’s Office. A Sheriff’s Office report says the man “knowingly inflicted bodily harm, which by design caused pain as to the equivalent of that produced by torture.” A deputy was alerted about the treatment after the girl’s grandmother took her to Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett with what she thought was chickenpox. But the girl told her grandmother, and later a child-interview specialist, that the man had bound her hands behind her back and tied her “feet wrists” with plastic zip ties before shooting her several times. The man and the girl live at the same Lynnwood home, but the Sheriff’s Office has not specified what relation they have to each other. When asked why her mother doesn’t intervene, the report says the girl “said her mom doesn’t care about her getting shot and tied up and said her mom leaves because she doesn’t want to hear her cry.” Now what had I been saying to bulky about "twisted souls"???</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1359333858317</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:44:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359336011740-91</Id><Topic><Title>The Myth of Living Beyond Our Means</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1359333386848</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:36:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Yale Professor Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott have proposed a 2 percent surtax on the wealth of the richest one-half of 1 percent of Americans owning more than $7.2 million of assets." If we did this, then we would have "France" but without Paris. And, like Obama's failed promise to "not raise taxes on incomes less than $250K", the "$7.2 million" threshold and the "2 percent" rate would be "adjusted" until it is only the middle class paying the tax, as the rich, like Michael Moore and Heinz-Kerry, will have picked up their tents and pitched them elsewhere. The rich are only a "prop", used by the Federal Government to prey upon the envy of the so-called poor, for convincing the gullible public to raise taxes on everyone. What is wrong with cutting spending? Save money by getting rid of 99% of the regulations that strangle business, then the government coffers would be so full of revenue that they would swear they just robbed a bank. Oh, that is what they have been doing.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359336011740</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:20:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359336125111-92</Id><Topic><Title>Government Officials Can Still Own Assault Weapons Under Feinstein Bill</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359315286828</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:34:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What difference does it make once we are all in our FEMA camps like you incessantly predicted?</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1359336125111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:22:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359336287472-93</Id><Topic><Title>Raising kids to be responsible citizens, one pellet at a time.</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1359333858317</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:44:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just another NRA Republican.

One day after Fox News confirmed that it and Sarah Palin had parted ways, the former Alaska governor spoke out Saturday on why she decided to leave her gig as a paid contributor. In an interview with the conservative news outlet Breitbart, Palin said she wants to share her values "more broadly" rather than "preach to the choir." “The message of liberty and true hope must be understood by a larger audience," she said. Palin's contract ended at the end of 2012, but a source close to Palin told CNN that the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee turned down a recent offer to renew it. Palin said the 2014 mid-term elections will be "imperative" and advocated for who she described as anti-establishment conservatives. "It’s going to be like 2010, but this time around, we need to shake up the GOP machine that tries to orchestrate away too much of the will of constitutional conservatives who don’t give a hoot how they do it in D.C.," she said. Palin was not specific about her long-term plans, saying "the door is wide open." The three-question interview was published by Stephen K. Bannon, who directed a documentary about Palin called, "The Undefeated." The Republican National Committee gathered last week for its winter meeting, where several GOP leaders argued the party needed to make serious changes in messaging and outreach to become more inclusive. Last year's presidential election results show that President Barack Obama overwhelmingly won African Americans, Asians and Latinos. Palin, however, said some in the party are being "skittish" because of the election results. "They shouldn’t be. Conservatism didn’t lose. A moderate Republican candidate lost after he was perceived to alienate working class Reagan Democrat and independent voters who didn’t turn out for him as much as they did for the McCain/Palin ticket in 2008," she said, adding the election was “defined by a biased media plus millions of voters who sat it out in disgust.” Asked for her reaction to the idea that she and the tea party no longer hold as much sway, Palin said the fight hasn't even begun. "I was raised to never retreat and to pick battles wisely, and all in due season," she said. "When it comes to defending our republic, we haven’t begun to fight! But we delight in those who underestimate us."</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1359341434695</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:50:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359341918018-107</Id><Topic><Title>Karl Marx Is More Relevant Than Ever</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1359331193597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 18:59:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooz, Are you just trying to stir up trouble?

Global warming began 18,000 years ago as the earth started warming its way out of the Pleistocene Ice Age-- a time when much of North America, Europe, and Asia lay buried beneath great sheets of glacial ice. Earth's climate and the biosphere have been in constant flux, dominated by ice ages and glaciers for the past several million years. We are currently enjoying a temporary reprieve from the deep freeze. Approximately every 100,000 years Earth's climate warms up temporarily. These warm periods, called interglacial periods, appear to last approximately 15,000 to 20,000 years before regressing back to a cold ice age climate. At year 18,000 and counting our current interglacial vacation from the Ice Age is much nearer its end than its beginning. Global warming during Earth's current interglacial warm period has greatly altered our environment and the distribution and diversity of all life. For example: Approximately 15,000 years ago the earth had warmed sufficiently to halt the advance of glaciers, and sea levels worldwide began to rise. By 8,000 years ago the land bridge across the Bering Strait was drowned, cutting off the migration of men and animals to North America from Asia. Since the end of the Ice Age, Earth's temperature has risen approximately 16 degrees F and sea levels have risen a total of 300 feet! Forests have returned where once there was only ice. During ice ages our planet is cold, dry, and inhospitable-- supporting few forests but plenty of glaciers and deserts. Like a spread of collosal bulldozers, glaciers have scraped and pulverized vast stretches of Earth's surface and completely destroyed entire regional ecosystems not once, but several times. During Ice Ages winters were longer and more severe and ice sheets grew to tremendous size, accumulating to thicknesses of up to 8,000 feet!. They moved slowly from higher elevations to lower-- driven by gravity and their tremendous weight. They left in their wake altered river courses, flattened landscapes, and along the margins of their farthest advance, great piles of glacial debris. During the last 3 million years glaciers have at one time or another covered about 29% of Earth's land surface or about 17.14 million square miles (44.38 million sq. km.) . What did not lay beneath ice was a largely cold and desolate desert landscape, due in large part to the colder, less-humid atmospheric conditions that prevailed. During the Ice Age summers were short and winters were brutal. Animal life and especially plant life had a very tough time of it. Thanks to global warming, that has all now changed, at least temporarily." Courtesy; Global Warming: A Chilling Perspective . Good stuff, give it a search . Y.T.

Now, don't throw eggs yet, but here is a problem: that would mean that God did not know what He was doing, or miscalculated, when He told man to "be fruitful and multiply" and "subdue the earth" (which the second command was to support the 'multiply' command). There are now 7.1 billion human beings on this earth. Let's roll back the time machine as far as technology is concerned and make human beings live with what meager technology existed BEFORE the machine age – in order to quell the “carbon monster” lurking behind Al Gore’s mega-mansions. I mean we have to go back to horses, mud huts, and campfires. The mere number of human beings is the problem. Humans need food, warmth, and clothing. Just that minimum is unsustainable with ancient technology. There are not enough trees for shelter and fire and enough animals for food and clothing without there being an even greater amount of carbon consumption and reduction in the capability to mitigate CO2. It might be noted that using “wood” for warmth would probably also directly increase the amount of CO2 and pollution much more than today. Apparently, there are 57 square miles of land on the earth. Only 12 million (7.68 billion acres) are “arable” (able to be farmed). What that meant to 250 million people in the year 1 AD and today with 7.1 billion is that the amount of land/person has dropped from 640 acres to 1.1 acres/person. On that 1.1 acres, you need to have shelter, room for cattle, room for crops, room for storage, etc. How about roads, amusement parks, city halls, fire stations, museums, a palatial suite for the President, etc., etc., etc.? Depending upon how things go, the world population will continue to grow – maybe to 10 or 11 billion around 2050. Now that “density” problem will simply result in collapse of society at some point – assuming the use only of ancient technology. The conclusion is that we need modern building methods, food production methods, and modern transportation methods in order to sustain the population and keep them amused (happy) and have a meaningful life. We need oil and we need lots of it. Do you think that God did not know this? Maybe this is the end. We have reached the proverbial “brick wall” of existence because increased human life – and thus God’s direct commandment to be “fruitful and multiply” cannot be sustained beyond today. God put the oil on the earth. Did He put in enough? He gave us the brains to build skyscrapers and develop medical methods to sustain life. He is VERY interested in more human beings, not less. Now, I recognize that that takes a leap of faith, but there is no alternative, except fear. Have you noticed that the “climate change” folks when they meet always talk about “taxing” and “redistributing wealth”? We should be smart about the use of oil but we should also be smart about the charlatans, like Al Gorezeera, that come along and try to instill fear in order to engorge themselves with wealth.

Don the word is out and you and the boeing Enablers group has been given the assignment of negative reinforcement to attempt to drive you away. So Don, each time you get a thumbs down, look at it as a thumbs up. Don you are a Boeing Retiree with a lot of personal hands on work experience, and you email your opinions , sometimes they do not enable the outsourcing failure Boeing Managment and many of your other emails are factual. Don, better stated you are being shunned in an attempt to drive you away. So Don , it is simple your getting through and good for you ! When you email something over the top I will ask you about it or ignor it, sometimes your too emotional on the subject and I email something that does make you think aobut it like the SPEEA office manager really hit a hot spot with you. So I just replied that was wha the newspapers reporters suggested was a credible source and it seem to calm you down a tad. In any eent I got your message you do not #$%$ the office manager for more than one reason I got that part .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359347306592</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 23:28:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
