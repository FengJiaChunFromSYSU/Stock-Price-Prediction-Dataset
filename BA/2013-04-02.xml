But even someone who reads newspapers regularly and watches numerous television newscasts may never learn that guns also save lives-- much less see any hard facts comparing how many lives are lost and how many are saved. But that trade-off is the real issue, not the Second Amendment or the National Rifle Association, which so many in the media obsess about. If guns cost more lives than they save, we can always repeal the Second Amendment. But if guns save more lives than they cost, we need to know that, instead of spending time demonizing the National Rifle Association. The defensive use of guns is usually either not discussed at all in the media or else is depicted as if it means bullets flying in all directions, like the gunfight at the OK Corral. But most defensive uses of guns do not involve actually pulling the trigger. If someone comes at you with a knife and you point a gun at him, he is very unlikely to keep coming, and far more likely to head in the other direction, perhaps in some haste, if he has a brain in his head. Only if he is an idiot are you likely to have to pull the trigger. And if he is an idiot with a knife coming after you, you had better have a trigger to pull. Surveys of American gun owners have found that 4 to 6 percent reported using a gun in self-defense within the previous five years. That is not a very high percentage but, in a country with 300 million people, that works out to hundreds of thousands of defensive uses of guns per year. Yet we almost never hear about these hundreds of thousands of defensive uses of guns from the media, which will report the killing of a dozen people endlessly around the clock. The murder of a dozen innocent people is unquestionably a human tragedy. But that is no excuse for reacting blindly by preventing hundreds of thousands of other people from defending themselves against meeting the same fate. Although most defensive uses of guns do not involve actually shooting, nevertheless the total number of criminals killed by armed private citizens runs into the thousands per year. A gun can also come in handy if a pit bull or some other dangerous animal is after you or your child. We need to recognize the painful reality that, regardless of what we do or don't do about gun control laws, there will be innocent people killed by guns. We can then look at hard facts in order to decide how we can minimize the number of needless deaths.</Msg><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364908143154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:09:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364908229173-19</Id><Topic><Title>Poll: Americans say GOP “unwilling to compromise”</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1364863746735</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 20:49:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You could be right in one sense. Since the president has the bully pulpit the only way to fairly assess reality is to look at press influence in communicating facts rather than the presidents message that the Republicans are the ones responsible for lack of compromise that is constantly regurgitated by the press. Many Republicans still think that Barry is interested in compromise so had the the question been asked like this, "Given the presidents refusal to consider any Republican input in budgets, do you think Republicans are uncompromising?". The context of questions can bias a poll and the lack of real knowledge can be misleading as to the true feelings of people. The only real value of a poll like this is to verify if the public is absorbing the talking points of each political party.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1364908229173</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:10:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364908614422-20</Id><Topic><Title>Guns Save Lives</Title><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364908143154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:09:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guns save lives??

Yet they ignore other countries with stronger gun control laws than the United States, but which have much higher murder rates, such as Brazil, Russia and Mexico. Even in the case of Britain, London had a much lower murder rate than New York during the years after New York State's 1911 Sullivan Law imposed very strict gun control, while anyone could buy a shotgun in London with no questions asked in the 1950s. Today, virtually the entire law-abiding population of Britain is disarmed-- and gun crimes are vastly more common. Gun control laws make crime a safer occupation when victims are unarmed. The gun control crusade today is like the Prohibition crusade 100 years ago. It is a shared zealotry that binds the self-righteous know-it-alls in a warm fellowship of those who see themselves as fighting on the side of the angels against the forces of evil. It is a lofty role that they are not about to give up for anything so mundane as facts-- or even the lives of other people.</Msg><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364909175029</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:26:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364909631024-24</Id><Title>More Bizarre Quirks of American Politics</Title><Msg>Insisting that the government live within its means is considered to be a radicalism, while suggesting that it spend trillions of dollars that we don't have and will probably never be able to pay back is considered largely non-controversial in D.C. Ultimately, elections in America tend to be decided by the "most indecisive, least informed, least deserving voters" who make decisions at the last minute. Polls consistently show that the American public is strongly in favor of cutting government spending and yet, when you get into specifics, Americans oppose cuts to spending on just about any and every program imaginable. Having few accomplishments of note and a sparse voting record on bills is considered a HUGE ADVANTAGE in running for the presidency of the United States. Each election, roughly 90% of black Americans vote for the political party behind slavery, segregation and Jim Crow laws. Between 80% and 90% of the supposedly "unbiased" mainstream media votes for Democrats over Republicans every election. In a nation that's 70% Christian and 2% Muslim, Christianity is regularly mocked in the foulest of terms by Hollywood and the mainstream media while Islam is treated with great respect.</Msg><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364909631024</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:33:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364909634574-25</Id><Topic><Title>Guns Save Lives</Title><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364908143154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:09:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you cannot demonstrate or provide any proof of your contentions- Britain does not have higher gun death numbers per capita than the US- in fact they are on the order of 10% of US numbers.

The report, which covers the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, says that the state's negative status -- all of its assets minus all of its liabilities -- increased that year, largely because it spent more than it received in revenue. (No #$%$ Sherlock?) The report listed the state's long-term obligations at $167.9 billion, nearly half of which ($79.9 billion) were in general obligation bonds, with another $30.8 billion in revenue bonds, many of which were issued to build state prisons, whose "revenue" is lease payments from the state general fund. The list of long-term obligations did not include the much-disputed unfunded liabilities for state employees' future pensions, nor the $60-plus billion in unfunded liabilities for retiree health care. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board and Moody's, a major bond credit rating house, have been pushing states and localities to include unfunded retiree obligations in their balance sheets and were they to be added to California's, it could push its negative net worth down by several hundred billion dollars.

Malcolm Smith and city Councilman Dan Halloran were arrested this morning on charges they were plotting to rig this year’s mayoral election through fraud and bribes. The pols allegedly formed an alliance built on cash payments and fraud to get Smith — one of the state’s top Democrats — placed on the GOP mayoral ballot, sources said. FBI agents arrested them both at their Queens homes shortly after 6 a.m. “I have no idea,” Halloran, in handcuffs, told a Post reporter when asked if he knew why he was being arrested. “I’m sure the truth will come out once I have an opportunity to find out what’s going on.” Smith would not say anything as he was hauled off. FBI officials confirmed the arrests. “Elected officials are called public servants because they are supposed to serve the people. Public service is not supposed to be a shortcut to self-enrichment," FBI Assistant Director George Venizelos said in a written statement today. "People in New York, in Spring Valley -- in any city or town in this country -- rightly expect their elected or appointed representatives to hold themselves to a higher standard. At the very least, public officials should obey the law. "As alleged, these defendants did not obey the law; they broke the law and the public trust. There is a price to pay for that kind of betrayal.” Prosecutors are planning to lay out the whole sordid scheme during a news conference later today. “Today’s charges demonstrate, once again, that a show-me-the-money culture seems to pervade every level of New York government. The complaint describes an unappetizing smorgasbord of graft and greed involving six officials who together built a corridor of corruption stretching from Queens and the Bronx to Rockland County and all the way up to Albany itself, "US Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.</Msg><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364910076182</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:41:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364910267719-28</Id><Topic><Title>Guns Save Lives</Title><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364908143154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:09:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Stronger gun control laws like Brazil, Russia or Mexico have to be enforced - but are not in these countries" They aren't here in the USA either.....so what's the point of more laws if you refuse to enforce the ones you already have?</Msg><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364910267719</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:44:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364910455006-29</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT IF(??) - 'A 787 LOSES POWER-CRASHES INTO RESIDENTIAL AREA near Tokoyo??</Title><Username>analyticanalysis</Username><Timestamp>1364784590717</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 22:49:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lots of Japanese will be crushed</Msg><Username>meinfdia</Username><Timestamp>1364910455006</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:47:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364910619155-30</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT IF(??) - 'A 787 LOSES POWER-CRASHES INTO RESIDENTIAL AREA near Tokoyo??</Title><Username>analyticanalysis</Username><Timestamp>1364784590717</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 22:49:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you can't stand the answer , don't ask the question, watch youtube Dan Rather report on composite , plastic planes,</Msg><Username>meinfdia</Username><Timestamp>1364910619155</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:50:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364910875667-31</Id><Topic><Title>787 prospects</Title><Username>anuandamit</Username><Timestamp>1364785286403</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 23:01:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow, anotrher successful fright test, How about a drop test on composite , plastic plane on 787, Watch yourtube Dan Rather report back in 2007 to learn more on composite plastic planes.</Msg><Username>meinfdia</Username><Timestamp>1364910875667</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:54:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364910927719-32</Id><Topic><Title>Guns Save Lives</Title><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364908143154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:09:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They aren't here in the USA either.....so what's the point of more laws if you refuse to enforce the ones you already have? well thats certainly part of the problem- along with the insane volume of guns produced and owned in this country- and arent the results wunnerful?

Surpluses are showing up in places you’d expect. North Dakota, currently enjoying an energy and agricultural boom, is projecting a $1.6 billion surplus over its two-year budgeting cycle. Texas, another resource-rich state, foresees an $8.8 billion surplus over its current two-year budget cycle. Life is becoming more fun for GOP governors. Governors like John Kasich (Ohio), Mike Pence (Indiana), and Terry Branstad (Iowa) are pushing for tax cuts. Others are essentially pocketing the cash, stowing it in rainy-day funds or using it to cope with higher spending requirements. Tennessee is looking to use cash to spend more on health care and its prison system. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, up for reelection in 2014, is seeking to raise pay for teachers. Looking ahead to fiscal 2014, which starts for most states later this year, NASBO says almost every state is projecting a spending increase, and up to a dozen are cutting income taxes. Sustained growth is the miracle cure for deficits. And when it comes to state finances, surpluses can help spur further growth. California and New York are not in such good shape with massive budget probems and deteriorating economies. They also have been governed by Democrats for years.</Msg><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364911791069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:09:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364911887510-39</Id><Topic><Title>SCARIER THAN BATTERY.</Title><Username>hoiinca</Username><Timestamp>1364826991070</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 10:36:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Scary.

If terrorists were detonating bombs in port after port, you can be sure Congress would be working to upgrade the nation’s security measures. If a plague was ripping through communities, public-health officials would be working feverishly to contain it. Only with gun violence do we respond to repeated tragedies by saying that mourning is acceptable but discussing how to prevent more tragedies is not. “Too soon,” howl supporters of loose gun laws. But as others have observed, talking about how to stop mass shootings in the aftermath of a string of mass shootings isn’t “too soon.” It’s much too late.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1364912581321</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:23:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364912703388-44</Id><Topic><Title>New BATTERY PROBLEM for Boeing 787 Battery Maker: NY TIMES</Title><Username>analyticanalysis</Username><Timestamp>1364784933105</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 22:55:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Old problem buried by Boeing PR, watch Dan Rather report on composite , plastic planes in 2007.</Msg><Username>meinfdia</Username><Timestamp>1364912703388</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:25:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364912829576-45</Id><Topic><Title>CRIMINALLY CHARGE</Title><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1364413680820</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 15:48:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bring out Dan Rather with his report on composite planes on youtube</Msg><Username>meinfdia</Username><Timestamp>1364912829576</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:27:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364912843455-46</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Governed States Enjoying Huge SURPLUSES</Title><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364911791069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:09:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's should give liberals a clue about why the Federal government is in the shape it's in.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1364912843455</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:27:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364913011243-47</Id><Title>Euro Zone Jobless Hits Record High 12%...</Title><Msg>Yet, Democrats keep crying....."why can't we be more like the European socialists countries"......so now we are.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1364913011243</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:30:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364913264306-48</Id><Topic><Title>What are the methods available for air restart on the 787?</Title><Username>wearesoscrewed</Username><Timestamp>1364518787182</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 20:59:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bird in engines after takeoff. , crash landing, plane shatter.

More children may die in bathtub accidents than in shooting accidents, but you are not likely to read that in most newspapers or see it on television newscasts.

(AP) — Backers of a newly adopted ordinance requiring gun ownership in a small north Georgia town acknowledge they were largely seeking to make a point about gun rights. The ordinance in the city of Nelson — population 1,300 — was approved Monday night and goes into effect in 10 days. However, it contains no penalties and exempts anyone who objects, convicted felons and those with certain mental and physical disabilities. City Councilman Duane Cronic, who sponsored the measure, said he knows the ordinance won't be enforced but he still believes it will make the town safer. "I likened it to a security sign that people put up in their front yards. Some people have security systems, some people don't, but they put those signs up," he said. "I really felt like this ordinance was a security sign for our city." Another purpose, according to the city council's agenda, is "opposition of any future attempt by the federal government to confiscate personal firearms." Council members in Nelson, a small city located 50 miles north of Atlanta, voted unanimously to approve the Family Protection Ordinance. The measure requires every head of household to own a gun and ammunition to "provide for the emergency management of the city" and to "provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants."</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1364919040559</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 12:10:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364919066187-77</Id><Topic><Title>What are the methods available for air restart on the 787?</Title><Username>wearesoscrewed</Username><Timestamp>1364518787182</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 20:59:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If one engine is operating it can start the other one electrically. If both engines are out you need the APU for a restart which needs the battery to start it. If one battery is out (burning or whatever) the other one can be used to start the APU assuming the 28V DC BUS isn't in trouble as well. If the 28V BUS goes out as well things get complicated. There is a link from the batteries to the engine AC BUSes but it isn't clear to me whether the juice can be relayed through them to the APU. The Ram Air Turbine will deploy but it doesn't generate enough juice to start the engines and run the (limited) flight control system. Bottom line, it would take multiple failures to prevent a restart but some of the redundancies run through the 28V BUS.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1364919066187</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 12:11:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364919378845-78</Id><Topic><Title>Guns Save Lives</Title><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364908143154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:09:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What liberals want to talk about, and strictly talk about, is can we win the majority vote period.

This isn't some program that can collapse and go away without much ripple effect. Millions of people are counting on Obamacare to work the way it was described by its proponents. The law will impact supporters and detractors alike. Already, the law is proving to be an unwieldy nightmare, as the government labors to meet its own deadlines. Individuals, families and businesses are slated to have access to a "reformed" healthcare system starting in early 2014, four years after the law was signed with much fanfare. But that time horizon evidently hasn't provided ample time for the feds to get their act together and offer you the options and features you were promised for the bargain-basement price of nearly $2 trillion. The New York Times reports that the launch date for a major section of the law is being pushed back: Unable to meet tight deadlines in the new health care law, the Obama administration is delaying parts of a program intended to provide affordable health insurance to small businesses and their employees — a major selling point for the health care legislation. The law calls for a new insurance marketplace specifically for small businesses, starting next year. But in most states, employers will not be able to get what Congress intended: the option to provide workers with a choice of health plans. They will instead be limited to a single plan. The choice option, already available to many big businesses, was supposed to become available to small employers in January. But administration officials said they would delay it until 2015 in the 33 states where the federal government will be running insurance markets known as exchanges. And they will delay the requirement for other states as well. The promise of affordable health insurance for small businesses was portrayed as a major advantage of the new health care law, mentioned often by White House officials and Democratic leaders in Congress as they fought opponents of the legislation. Supporters of the law said they were disappointed by the turn of events. The delay will “prolong and exacerbate health care costs that are crippling 29 million small businesses,” said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana...The administration cited “operational challenges” as a reason for the delay. Here's the president explaining how fantastic this portion of his signature law would be in 2009: "If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you’ll be able to get coverage. We’ll do this by creating a new insurance exchange, a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices." Now, not only has the small business marketplace been punted off to 2015, its "beneficiaries" will be limited to just one "option" -- rather than the array of competitive plans they were promised. And along comes Mary Landrieu, the 60th vote for Obamacare, whinging about how it might "cripple" small businesses. She knew all about the flaws embedded in this legislation, but being the reliable liberal foot soldier that she is, Landrieu cast the deciding vote in its favor. She is up for re-election in Louisiana next year. The "this is going to be great!" crowd hailed this particular feature of Obamacare as extremely beneficial to small businesses, many of which were strong critics of the legislation. For reasons that are becoming more apparent every day, many of those businesses continue to oppose the law. Philip Klein wonders if this false start is an omen of things to come: The big question is whether this is a harbinger of more to come. In theory, there are supposed to be operational health insurance exchanges by Oct. 1, which will begin actually providing benefits on Jan. 1. Now that the federal government will have to run all or part of the exchanges in 33 states, it remains a big question whether health officials are going to be able to meet their deadlines. Something tells me we’ll be reading more stories like this in the coming months. Of course we will. If you're keeping score at home, so far we've seen: Two unpopular and job-killing elements of the law repealed, with another one on the way out (driving up the price tag of the law in the process by eliminating fanciful "revenues), and now a popular component narrowed considerably and delayed. And the "go" date is still ten months away. This is why conservatives opposed Obamacare. Not because it was this president's idea, not because we hate government, not because we don't want people to have healthcare -- but because the law is unaffordable, poorly thought-out, and logistically shambolic. It will not help people the way we were told it would. Conservatives favor limited government in principle, of course, but it's also a practical position. Big, bloated government is limited in its capacity to do things properly, and when it bites off more than it can chew, we all suffer -- especially on something as personal, sensitive and important as healthcare.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1364925026705</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 13:50:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364925294340-98</Id><Title>Fresh bad news for people with pre-existing conditions</Title><Msg>ust like the pledge that premiums wouldn’t go up, another key ObamaCare promise is coming a cropper: that Americans with pre-existing medical conditions will be completely covered. In his November 2009 address to Congress, President Obama said, “Under [this] plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition . . . [or] drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most.” That might be true when ObamaCare is fully implemented in January. In the meantime, people have to rely on a plan administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Well, guess what? The CMS has announced that it has run out of money to enroll any more individuals in the program. So it is blocking states from accepting any more applications. It’s a sweet political irony, but it’s not funny to those stuck without insurance. In response, senior House Republicans last month sent the White House a letter outlining some possible solutions. As Majority Leader Eric Cantor told The Post during a recent visit, “ObamaCare has many broken promises. But this is one issue that we can address immediately without delay . . . Let’s reprogram the money to help people most in need right now.” Will the White House fix it? The House GOP is still waiting for an answer. In the meantime we are left with this: An Obama agency that offers a stop-gap insurance program is now doing exactly what Democrats accused the big, bad insurance companies of doing — opting not to cover certain people out of financial considerations.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1364925294340</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 13:54:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364925654425-99</Id><Topic><Title>Ben Carson compares homosexuality to murder</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1364841238977</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:33:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>here's another one ahkmed...

If I question the sincerity of his "faith" (alleged Christian faith) or his "support of Israel" when the facts point to the contrary, is that "disparaging"? He is a public figure and deserves scrutiny. It is a reasonable thing to ascertain what his motives are because of his non-transparent transparency. And it is a reasonable thing to dig into his background and associations. If we cannot question the motives and actions of our leaders, and bring them to account, then it is time to retire our so-called republic.

Have to wait till the 24th to find out.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1364932295766</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 15:51:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364932381448-122</Id><Topic><Title>He , Jesus used to speak of Peace</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1364522298390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 21:58:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Especially among white Bible-thumping Christians.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364932381448</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 15:53:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364932463814-123</Id><Topic><Title>He , Jesus used to speak of Peace</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1364522298390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 21:58:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Verily, Bulky.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364932463814</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 15:54:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364932506742-124</Id><Topic><Title>Been Registering Democrats all morning...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1364920689355</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 12:38:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He shoots ...

The long-debated U.N. Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) requires countries to regulate and control the export of weaponry such as battle tanks, combat vehicles and aircraft and attack helicopters, as well as parts and ammunition for such weapons. It also provides that signatories will not violate arms embargoes, international treaties regarding illicit trafficking, or sell weaponry to countries for genocide, crimes against humanity or other war crimes. With the Obama administration supporting the final treaty draft, the General Assembly vote was 154 to 3, with 23 abstentions. Iran, Syria and North Korea voted against it. American gun rights activists, though, insist the treaty is riddled with loopholes and is unworkable in part because it includes “small arms and light weapons” in its list of weaponry subject to international regulations. They do not trust U.N. assertions that the pact is meant to regulate only cross-border trade and would have no impact on domestic U.S. laws and markets. Critics of the treaty were heartened by the U.S. Senate’s resistance to ratifying the document, assuming President Obama sent it to the chamber for ratification. In its budget debate late last month, the Senate approved a non-binding amendment opposing the treaty offered by Sen. James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, with eight Democrats joining all 45 Republicans backing the amendment.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1364935035338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 16:37:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364935384256-142</Id><Title>Ya Just Gotta Love Texas</Title><Msg>This is why I hung on to a section of Texas land when I moved to Louisiana.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott wrote a letter to President Obama on Tuesday saying that the state will head to court over the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty should Mr. Obama sign it and the U.S. Senate ratify it. “The UN has concluded its negotiations on the Arms Trade Treaty,” Mr. Abbotwrites. “It is now up to you to sign it — or reject it. Do not sign this treaty.” Mr. Abbott writes that he understands the apparent purpose is to combat illegal arms trafficking around the world, but that the treaty could draw law-abiding gun owners and gun operators “into a complex web of bureaucratic red tape created by a new department at the UN devoted to overseeing the treaty.” “As with most so-called international-law documents promulgated by the UN, the draft treaty is not written using the precise, unambiguous language required of a good legal document,” he continues. “Instead, the treaty employs sweeping rhetoric and imprecise terminology that could be used by those who seek to undermine our liberties to impose any number of restrictions on the right of law-abiding Americans to keep and bear arms.”</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1364935384256</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 16:43:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364935646247-143</Id><Topic><Title>Why Are Liberals so concerned about firearms and children?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1364917160515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 11:39:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You forgot the intentional murdering of GODs most Holy Innocent Children through abortion. liberal, Godless brains think they have a right to murder the Holy Innocent....</Msg><Username>mandan14shooter</Username><Timestamp>1364935646247</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 16:47:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364936146883-144</Id><Topic><Title>REPORT: FBI busts top NY Dem in 'bribery plot' to rig mayor race, run as Republican...</Title><Username>white_mirah</Username><Timestamp>1364910076182</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:41:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whatsthebigdeal......just more typical lying, cheating, stealing bribing Democrats.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1364936146883</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 16:55:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364936293500-145</Id><Topic><Title>Why Are Liberals so concerned about firearms and children?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1364917160515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 11:39:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Answering why liberals do what they do can't rationally be answered.

The thirty-five teachers and administrators represent only the first round of potential defendants in the appalling story, where “educators” spent more effort in burnishing test scores than in actually educating children — who got left behind in service to the ambition of the school system. Investigators say Atlanta’s school district orchestrated a culture of cheating to benefit those at the top. Nearly 200 educators admitted to taking part in the massive scandal: they tampered with students’ standardized tests and corrected answers to inflate scores. Some teachers had pizza parties to erase wrong answers and circle in the right ones. One principal allegedly handled altered tests wearing gloves to avoid leaving her fingerprints. At one middle school, 86 percent of eighth-graders scored proficient in math, compared to 24 percent the year before. Prosecutors say that progress was a criminal mirage. “The four principle crimes that are charged in the indictment are the statements and writings, false swearings, theft by taking, and influencing witnesses,” Fulton County District Attorney Paul L. Howard, Jr. said. Beverly Hall is Atlanta’s retired school superintendent. Her system’s turnaround won her national fame, awards, and more than $500,000 in performance bonuses. But investigators say she pressured teachers and principals to cheat, and punished those who refused. Hall, among those indicted, has denied the charges. A grand jury recommended her bail be set at $7.5 million. One of those left behind was Nybria Collins, now 15 and reading at a fifth-grade level. Despite failing her classes, she kept passing the standardized tests, leaving her mother to wonder what was happening at the public school. Instead of being prepared to succeed in adulthood, these “educators” left Nybria to fail for a lifetime while they had pizza parties to cover up their incompetence. The indictments involve racketeering charges, which carry a maximum 20 years in prison. Compared to the length of the damage they did to children like Nybria, that’s letting them off easy. Perhaps school choice will get a closer look, at least in Atlanta.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1364938274167</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 17:31:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364938445558-152</Id><Topic><Title>BOOM!

Michele Bachmann. Due to a series of gaffes, she is again on the receiving end of criticism, including from Fox News powerhouse Bill O'Reilly. The congresswoman is also, as reported by The Daily Beast's John Avlon, "embroiled in a litany of legal proceedings related to her rolling disaster of a presidential campaign — including an Office of Congressional Ethics investigation into campaign improprieties." It's almost as if Bachmann were a Democratic mole embedded in the Republican Party with the purpose of chasing away a wide range of voters. Her latest sound-bite-producing comment, this time on ObamaCare, begged for audio accompaniment of the Twilight Zone theme. Try to imagine it: "Let's repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens. Let's not do that. Let's love people. Let's care about people. Let's repeal it now while we can." While some Republicans have distanced themselves from Bachmann — or fled altogether, as Republican campaign consultant Ed Rollins did from her ill-fated presidential campaign last year — she is still popular with GOPers who condone the paranoia-tinged political rhetoric that alienates independents, centrists, moderates, and many young people. Such rhetoric is in full display in too-out-there-for-Fox Glenn Beck's theory that the real reason Bachmann is being investigated is because a faction of "radical Islam" embedded in the U.S. government is out to get her. But, no, it's not what "they" are doing to Bachmann but, once again, what Bachmann is doing to herself. Her name has repeatedly been splashed in headlines because of her sensationalist statements that destroy her credibility. Many pundits considered her a conservative extremist when she entered the 2012 presidential race, yet (with Rollins' help) she eventually took the lead. But when it came time to broaden her appeal, she wasn't able to ditch the primary-speak to appeal to anyone but the Tea Party and other Republicans who are fond of the talk-show circuit. Thus, the majority of Republican primary voters decided she was not a viable national candidate. "Bachmann committed no major gaffe to lose that lead, no revelation of old affairs, like Herman Cain, or inability to debate well, like Rick Perry," says Joel Mathis at the Philly Post. "Instead, what seemed to put off GOP supporters was the same thing that's always alarmed the rest of us about Michele Bachmann: She seemed just a little crazy." Aaron Astor, an associate professor of history at Maryville College, has seen a major shift in how generations communicate — which does not bode well for Bachmann or the Tea Party-flavored Republican Party. "People under the age of 40 thrive on irony," he told me. "That's why Stephen Colbert and The Daily Show are so popular. The Fox News/talk show world is decidedly un-ironic. Once upon a time it had a certain mocking humor and edge to it — mostly in the late 1980s when conservative comedy was still somewhat edgy. But Hannity is pure smarm and has zero appeal to younger people, regardless of ideology. Preachy, soap-box hollering is the stuff of baby boomer politics." Andrew Sullivan also once asserted that "the bitter, brutal tone of American politics comes from... the baby boomers. The divide is still — amazingly — between those who fought in Vietnam and those who didn't, and between those who fought and dissented and those who fought but never dissented at all." Many baby boomer media figures and politicos remain hopelessly mired in those 1960s and 1970s resentments. And Bachmann, born in 1956, is most decidedly a baby boomer — and perhaps even a caricature of one. She speaks in apocalyptic terms about President Obama and Democrats. She has never met an inaccuracy or exaggeration she didn't like in her thirst to negatively define the other side. (Fact-checkers following her speeches may soon have to seek workmen's compensation.) Even her way of speaking seems to resemble the late Gilda Radner playing Rosanne Rosannadanna on Saturday Night Live. As The Daily Beast's Avlon sees it, the ethics investigation "adds an additional indignity to the self-inflicted disasters of her political career. Demagoguery eventually brings dishonor. And her most passionate supporters ought to consider what it means when the people who know Bachmann best respect her the least." Does all this mean Bachmann won't get re-elected? No it doesn't. The way her district is set up, she has nothing to worry about. Bachmann will likely be around for a while, maybe even for another doomed presidential bid. She'll get the sound bites and make headlines. Voters that the GOP needs will continue to see her and be reminded of the party's lack of inclusiveness. And many will decide to steer clear of the GOP — and its off-putting sideshow.</Msg><Username>the_loading_dock_01</Username><Timestamp>1364948604956</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 20:23:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364948654583-169</Id><Title>I like asking Quest that Democrats refuse to answer because......</Title><Msg>.....it exposes their hypocrisy and inability to see how ignorant and inconsistent they are.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1364948654583</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 20:24:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364948900390-170</Id><Topic><Title>CRIMINALLY CHARGE</Title><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1364413680820</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 15:48:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I told you .....
