But, of course, they will include all of the touchy-feely, I am one-with-you, "have your back", and "he understands me" questions which Obama has mastered over the years. Operative term is "mastered", not "accomplished". For example, the attention that was drawn to Ann Romney's $990 blouse for some reason overshadowed Michelle Obama's $6800 jacket - all in the same timeline breath. Or the Romney's vacationing in their summer home not long after the Obama's have been on their 16th lavish and costly vacation at tax payer's expense. Only fools really believe that this President "relate" to them - unless they are also the elite. This President and his wife have raised hypocricy to new heights.

(Title 18, Part I, Chapter 119, Section 2511) - In particular, Jimmy Cart, IV - Conspired, via the internet, with one undisclosed name, “Anne Onymous” (Youtube account), an apparent person of foreign origin (China) (1a, 1b, and 1d) - Disclosed a recorded private conversation in which no affected parties had given permission (1c) The language of the law: (1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who— (a) intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication shall be punished as provided in subsection (4)… (4) whoever violates subsection (1) of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. Further, James Carter was acting, without disclosure, as a “foreign agent” by facilitating the larger release of the illegal video. (U.S.C. Title 22, Chapter 11, Subchapter II, Section 611). The Youtube account of Anne Onymous specifically declares the source origin as China. Since much of what China does over the internet, affecting the United States, is through military/political agencies, Mr. Carter may have been facilitating China’s interference in U.S. Elections. He conducted private communications with a person of foreign origin, Anne Onymous, via Twitter and other internet means, likely in violation of the Logan Act (18 U.S.C., Part I, Chapter 45, Section 953) What has that so-called Sunday school teacher grandfather been teaching his grandson? To lie. To deceive. To betray. To be unlawful. Besides the violation of U.S. Code, there are probably several hundred Bible verses involved and violated, though that is not often the concern of liberals and the press as the highest moral principle is “the ends justifies the means.”</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1348432935029</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 16:42:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348433385874-20</Id><Title>Myth Rmoney's Star is Fading Fast...</Title><Msg>Obama's lead on Intrade is now 42 percent points.

Unless the U.S. Code is printed only for the "eyes" of lawyers, and given the simple process of putting "two and two" together, it should not be hard for someone to realize that federal laws have been broken: 1. Illegal recording of a private conversation without consent 2. Conspiracy to distrivute same recording 3. Acting as a foreign agent without filing a disclosure. 4. Conspiring with a foreign government (likely, to be determined) and conspiring to negatively impact U.S. Federal elections. Sounds like at least 20 years in federal prison.

Is that your duty?" Freedumb. I am pleased that you are thinking about God today. I have found that daily reading of the Bible is helpful. How about yourself? Don't just use God as some sort of weapon, presumed weapon, against me. He is there waiting for you to seek Him and include Him in your daily life. That is the way it will be for eternity - assuming that you have made the right decision to belive in Jesus. Or there is the other alternative. Avoid that path. And, by the way, the video was not given at full length for pulic consumption to show context. Obviously, the "47%" statement was a bad one - not unlike "my Mus.lim" faith, "you didn't build that", and "the private sector is fine". You see, politicians are human beings under tremendous pressure. A poor choice of words should not be the entirety of a person. There, but for the grace of God, go I. Mr. James Carter's violation of the law, on the other hand, was purposeful, and protracted, and was something borne of spite and conspiracy to deceive. Basically, he confessed to what he did. Sounded proud of it. He's seems kind of dumb.

It simply says that recording private conversations (no matter how many that are "aggrieved") is prohibited and punishable as the otherwise aggrieved have an expectation of privacy - unless they give their consent to be recorded. That was a "closed door" affair of only 30 people - hence, the need for the perp to secretly record. The first amendment does not apply - unless this part of the U.S. Code is somehow unconstitutional. Possible, but not likely. By now, it would have been challenged and off the books. Recording of pulbic conversation is legal, obviously. You make what seems to be a point about the greater good for the people to know. Still not a rational basis for law breaking and conspiring with foreign agents. Yet, would you also support the people's demand for seeing Obama's various school records - the one's that he has spent considerable money to suppress? I know that you woudn't demand to see the records - likely out of fear that they disparage your condidate. However, I would like to see them - in order to see if he is telling the truth about himself. Not unlike what you just argued, "Of far far more importance is the transparent view that Willard transmitted about U.S. citizens."

That is something that can be addressed. It is a red herring to presume that upholding any and all laws involving and affecting a condidate is not an expectation deserved by as well as requied of any candidate. Remember Watergate? Though your point is well taken that we have often devolved to this and have grown accustomed to it. Mr. Carter, though, went beyond the usual posting of his own recorded material (still not necessarily right) and instead sought out and conspired with someone from China to obtain the material. Do you believe that Chinese nationals/officials/military/intelligence have the right to record private conversations in the United States (with impunity) and then work with a U.S. citizen to distribute that material - with the intent of influencing our elections? Nevertheless, there are four laws that were broken. Whether the government feels that that merits review and prosecution is often arbitrary and that arbitrary deision does not change the fact of breaking the law.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1348444463808</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 19:54:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348444876646-42</Id><Topic><Title>James Carter's "47 Minutes" of Unlawful Activity</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1348432935029</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 16:42:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chris, The Code says that the person doing the recording has to OBTAIN consent - a proactive process. No NDA is required because our lawmakers have passed a blanket NDA (by definition) that applies to all of us - under threat of prosecution. That is, it is the law, we have to obey it. The "wait staff" do not have an exclusion in the law. Thus, they have to obey it. The law simply states that recoridng private conversations without consent is prohibited and will be prosecuted under the law (that statute). And thank you for the modicum of compliment regarding "biblical interpretation".

Now, I conceed that this is my interpretation of his activities vs. what the U.S. Code says. You may (and obviously) disagree. Though I would be disappointed if you all decided to engage in conversation and not even read the Code. I will just assume that you did. I think that we could agree that the conversation was recorded. And, I think that we could agree that it was done surrepticiously - ergo, hiding the camera. Carter, as I indicated, did not do the recording. It was done by "Anne Onymous" (whoever that is) - from China or posted by someone from China, according to Youtube. The Code does not care about who did the recording when, if it is illegal, it is then distributed. There is a statute for the one who did it and one for who distributed it. His futher problems involve the connection to foreign nationals and that the video was provided for the purpose of manipulation - the greater good, notwithstanding - of U.S. elections. It simply is illegal. That conspiracy and lack of proper disclosure (i.e., registration) as a foreign agent is a problem. In the limit, he was working (unwittingly) with Chinese government/military agents. Now, whether he is "dumb" or not. Yes, I think so. And this is what I mean. If you read his statements, he said that he was upset about how the Romney campaign was disparaging his grandfather. Well, I can understand that. We usually all love our grandparents - if still living, and even then thereafter. One thing I would not do is embark upon a path of illegal behavior in order to set things right. He was not thinking or exceedingly ignorant - that is obvious to me. Of course, this administration will not prosecute. Maybe too small of potatoes. Maybe, not politically correct.
