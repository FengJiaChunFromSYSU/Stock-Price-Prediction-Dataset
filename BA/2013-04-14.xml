Wall Street: On Wednesday, March 6, 2013, Eric Holder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, implying that Wall Street tycoons are above the law, in essence giving them a license to plunder the American people. Holder’s head of the criminal division did not prosecute a single Wall Street executive for the fraud that destroyed the economy. Defense of Marriage: Eric Holder has directed the DOJ not to enforce the federal Defense of Marriage Act. In doing so, Holder has violated his oath of office and clearly shows his violation of the laws of Nature and Nature’s God. Fast and Furious: As we all know, Eric Holder is guilty of putting thousands of assault rifles into the hands of Mexican drug lords in an attempt to blame the American people for the crimes administration officials are guilty of contriving and committing. As a result, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed, along with hundreds of Mexican civilians, including teens at a birthday party and a Mexican beauty queen. Black Panther Voter Scandal: Soon after being sworn in as Obama’s attorney general, Holder ordered the voter intimidation case against the Black Panthers during the 2008 presidential election to be dropped. Marc Rich Pardon: During his tenure as Clinton’s deputy attorney general, Holder was involved in the controversial pardon of Marc Rich, a major Democratic contributor and fugitive for tax fraud. Holder advised Rich’s lawyer to bypass the normal pardon request procedures and take their plea directly to the White House. Holder also failed to inform prosecutors that a pardon was in process for Rich, denying them the opportunity to intervene. Boricua Popular Army Clemency: The Canada Free Press reported that against the express wishes of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the federal prosecutor and the victims of the Boricua Popular Army, at Holder’s recommendation, Clint</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365928879292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 04:41:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365928949612-5</Id><Topic><Title>The Obama hypocracy continues one day at a time one hypocracy after another</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1365906300030</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 22:25:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its beyond belief how any sane person can defend the criminality and hypocrisy of this administration</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365928949612</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 04:42:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365932584361-6</Id><Topic><Title>The Kent Raven is orly taint and hooz</Title><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1365395848946</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 00:37:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You forgot nowarrantneeded and half a dozen others</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365932584361</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 05:43:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365935314227-7</Id><Topic><Title>Thought for the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1365863198020</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 10:26:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He even posted a few times simultaneously under both names using two computers in order to make it look like two different posters to try and throw people off the trail when he was caught.

Former Black Girlfriend accuses HBO star of physical abuse, "degrading racial comments" quote: NOVEMBER 11--Comedian Bill Maher was slapped yesterday with a $9 million palimony suit by an ex-girlfriend who alleges that the HBO star subjected her to physical and verbal abuse, including "insulting, humiliating and degrading racial comments." In the below Los Angeles Superior Court complaint, Nancy Johnson, a centerfold model and former flight attendant also known as Coco Johnsen, alleges that Maher, 48, reneged on promises to pay her expenses and purchase a Beverly Hills home. Johnson, who says she dated Maher for 17 months before splitting from him in May, also contends that the performer promised to marry her and have children. Johnson, pictured at right, does not detail the degrading racial comments allegedly made by Maher, and recounts only one episode of supposed physical abuse by the host of HBO's "Real Time." She charges that Maher pulled her arm and shook her at one party, causing "injuries to her back and neck," and later that evening warned he'd hit her on the head with a hammer if she was unfaithful.

Everything They* Ever Told Me Was a Lie: Volume One (paperback, 280 pages). Investigative journalist, author and radio show host Pat Shannan lays it all out in no uncertain terms. Completing a work that took four years to research and document, the author discovered so much suppressed information that it has been divided into two volumes. Volume One is a blockbuster, spanning the past half century and covering the unknown facts about the JFK assassination through the Pat Tillman and Obama controversies of current times. The author takes a hard look at all the evidence including the altered and intentionally fabricated FBI official reports he found. Learn new insights into the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King and the attempt on Ronald Reagan. How could Arthur Bremer fire seven shots from a five-shot revolver the day he nearly killed Gov. George Wallace in 1972? Why was Pat Tillman murdered in Afghanistan in 2004? Why do such ridiculous lies as the 9-11 official story not only survive but thrive and become accepted truths? This book also explains how the the unconstitutional use of legal tender created from thin air is the hidden power behind the expansion of the central government. Everything They* Ever Told Me Was a Lie explains from the outset exactly who "They" are and how a cooperative news media, by ignoring facts and refusing to address pertinent questions, allow outrageous lies to meld into definite, indisputable truths. It shows that government plots survive because of little or no investigation and only through the aid of a cooperative and controlled mainstream media. This book is a tour de force destroying the government lies and exposing the cover-ups of the past 50 years.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365957386389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 12:36:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365958047090-29</Id><Topic><Title>Our Greatest President born on this date</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365872116253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:55:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How do you KNOW he boffed his slaves ?

The authors know that they have a steady state audience and readership...probably 5- 10% of the population want to believe that there is a conspiracy involving just about everything. They feel this way because they are sociopaths who simply do not feel comfortable with reality; they consequently gravitate to personal, alternate "realities" to give themselves peace of mind and a sense of control of their lives. These people are at times entertaining, usually not dangerous, but ultimately simply very boring after spouting the same drivel day after day.</Msg><Username>greatolbigun</Username><Timestamp>1365958863976</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 13:01:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365958999998-33</Id><Topic><Title>Everything they ever told Me was a Lie: Volume 1</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365957386389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 12:36:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lots and lots of people feeling that way these days.
