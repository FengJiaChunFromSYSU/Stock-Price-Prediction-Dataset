Historian and biographer Joseph Ellis has called Jefferson, who had a monumental role in shaping American politics, the American sphinx for his enigmatic character. Since his terms in office, presidents and politicians from both ends of the political spectrum have borrowed from Jefferson's political philosophy in an attempt to link their own leadership with this most influential and admired founding father. Jefferson's character--as a man or a president--defies definition in black and white. He was at once an intellectual, architect, philosopher, musician and essayist. His fascination with science prompted his study and collection of fossils. He projected a down-to-earth, relaxed and unconventional attitude and his desire to be seen as a common man was reflected in his penchant for receiving White House visitors in a robe and slippers. Jefferson denounced oppressive government and was a fierce proponent of freedom of speech and religion. He worried that fellow founding fathers George Washington, John Adams and Alexander Hamilton had designs to fashion the American presidency after a monarchy. When Washington and Hamilton proposed a national bank and state assumption of national debt, Jefferson resigned from Washington's cabinet in protest. He adamantly rejected Hamilton's plan to build a strong federal military, fearing it might be used by a tyrannical leader against American citizens. Though Jefferson was highly principled, he was not above using smear tactics against political opponents. He anonymously assailed his victims in print under a pseudonym and helped to fund the anti-Federalist press. Although in theory Jefferson desired the abolition of slavery, it is a fact that Jefferson owned other human beings who worked his plantation. Historical accounts indicate Jefferson treated his slaves well within the context of the times. It has long been rumored--and debated by historians--that one of his slaves, Sally Hemings, was Jefferson's lover. She bore a son, named Eston, in 1808. For 200 years, the Hemings affair and Eston's paternity were the focus of intense scholarly analysis. In 1998, DNA testing proved that a Jefferson was Eston's biological father, which many took to mean that he was indeed Thomas Jefferson's son, a fact backed up by the oral tradition of the Hemings family. However, other scholars have disagreed with this conclusion and it remains a topic of fervent debate. Jefferson, a widower since the death of his wife Martha in 1782, is also thought to have had a relationship with Maria Cosway, a beautiful (and married) British painter and musician whom he met while serving as minister to France. Jefferson's relationship with Cosway inspired him to write the romantic essay A Dialogue Between the Head and Heart in October 1786. One historical account of their affair paints Jefferson as a lovesick schoolboy--as he and Cosway shared a romantic walk in the countryside near Paris, Jefferson attempted to leap over a fence, fell and broke his wrist. Jefferson's anti-federalist policies and personal attacks on John Adams caused a huge falling-out between the two former friends. After retirement, though, Adams and Jefferson rekindled their personal connection. The last two original revolutionaries living, Jefferson and Adams, died on the same day: July 4, 1826.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365872116253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:55:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365872138978-41</Id><Topic><Title>Gun Traficking</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365810419672</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 19:46:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They think alike...</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1365872138978</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:55:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365872345114-42</Id><Topic><Title>Gun Traficking</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365810419672</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 19:46:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooz Chi Minh...you nailed it</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365872345114</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:59:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365872386480-43</Id><Topic><Title>The New World Odor wants Weak Teleprompter reading</Title><Username>generaljackripper</Username><Timestamp>1365360817862</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 14:53:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Kent Raven prefers Pravda, PMS, CNN and MSLSD.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1365872386480</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:59:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365872510191-44</Id><Topic><Title>Thought for the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1365863198020</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 10:26:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooz Chi Minh...You're the one who raised the issue of Obama being a Muslim and I simply said that that's his constitutional right. ...no defensiveness required</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365872510191</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 13:01:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365873008139-45</Id><Title>New 737 crashes breaks into sections NTSB investigation , all is well, no passengers died</Title><Msg>"It apparently failed to reach the runway and fell into the sea," said the spokesman, Edward Sirait.

When the two batteries failed in January, the FAA's process came under scrutiny and critics said the agency could have applied lessons from past battery incidents. The NTSB has set April 23-24 for an investigative hearing on the Boeing battery that caught fire. The FAA also has launched an extensive review of Boeing's manufacturing, production and design process for the 787, aimed at addressing the batteries and other problems that have cropped up during the first year of service by the new high-tech plane. Boeing isn't considering shifting away from lithium-ion batteries.

Jefferson did write a first draft of the Declaration, but he wrote it for, and with some reworking from, a committee that included other founders like Benjamin Franklin. (Unlike you, Jefferson was NOT out there on his own, foisting his own opinions on others.) The Declaration is a wonderful statement of the rights of man (much of it cribbed from Thomas Paine and others) and is towering rhetoric. But Jefferson knew what he was doing was in part propaganda (the opening lines SAY SO), in particular when he wrote that "all men are created equal" when he was bedding one of his slaves who couldn't really refuse. Thomas Jeferson had opposition in his own time, include a vicious campaign for president against John Adams (whom you have also indicated you worship if not give metaphorical BJs to) and you're now trying to tell us ALL THOSE FOLKS were anti-American? I'd laugh if it wasn't so insulting. The original principal of being American was that you were free to dissent. If you were not insane you would not lose sight of this simple fact -- it's one of the reasons we KNOW you are Insane.

Your confusing Jefferson's problem with "freeing his slaves" with George Washington's -- they were Martha Custis' estate to HER kids. Jefferson was up to his eyes in debt, and it fueled a lot of his revolutionary zeal -- he was the first member of Occupy Wall Street, except that "Wall Street" was then in England. TJ just never got 'round to it, because his budget was never in shape to do so. He said so in his own writings, so you go ahead and re-read your loony lib sources -- before you JAM them. And incidentally, you don't have to FREE your slaves to stop boffing them.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1365891182860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 18:13:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365891346510-63</Id><Topic><Title>Our Greatest President born on this date</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365872116253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:55:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>P.P.S.

Even Joseph Ellis, the dean of American Jefferson experts, admits that he did not know of Randolph's existence at the time he wrote his Jefferson opus "American Sphinx'. The obscure Randolph was a long-time widower who was well-known at the time for after-hours reveling in the slave quarters at Monticello. According to the SC Report, Randolph was most likely the father of Sally Hemings' children. However, the suggestion of anyone besides Thomas Jefferson being the father is met with howls of "You're in denial! You are prejudiced and you just don't want to admit that Thomas Jefferson could have loved a black woman!" Not so, folks. Each of us is a composite of many races and ethnicities, which becomes apparent in the study of genealogy. It is highly unlikely that any of us are pure anything when it comes to race. While it is obvious that some of the Hemings have some Jefferson blood, the available evidence still does not answer the question of WHICH Jefferson. Since Thomas Jefferson had several siblings, uncles and cousins, there are numerous collateral lines to the family, which are not in direct line of descent from him. Those of the collateral lines are not eligible for burial in the family cemetery at Monticello, an honor reserved for the descendants of his two daughters, Martha Jefferson Randolph and Maria Jefferson Eppes. Private family burial grounds were quite common at one time, especially in rural areas. Now, however, they may mistakenly be perceived as snobbish. or elitist. This misunderstood aspect of the controversy plays directly into the hands of the forces of political correctness, whose aim is to alter the way we view the Founding Fathers and American history in general. Americans owe a huge debt to Mr. Jefferson's genius, particularly in terms of our concepts of individual freedom. Those who seek to defile his memory also seek to undermine the concepts he taught us. Certainly the contributions of minorities to the founding and development of this country must be acknowledged and advanced, but not by deception and deliberate tampering with the facts. To accept the Sally Hemings myth as truth is to question the validity of everything Jefferson ever said or wrote. This accusation against him is contrary to everything we know about him, and we know much from his journals, his massive correspondence, and his professional writings. I have found that the likelihood of someone believing the Jefferson-Hemings story is directly proportionate to how little they know about him. I attribute ignorance of this and so many other subjects to the massive dumbing-down of Americans, which we can see all around us. Many people are better informed about sports and celebrity lifestyles than they do about the history of their own country. In a climate of fostered ignorance, it is easy for those with an agenda to alter history. It is clear to me that Jefferson's ideals of independence and self- determination are anathema to those who would prefer to make all of our decisions for us. Thus, the implications of the Jefferson-Hemings controversy extend to the way we live from day to day. Are we going to be obedient consumers who allow our history to be subverted for profit and propaganda? For the sake of our future, I hope not. It is time for Americans to stand up for the ideas and people who made this country great, and Thomas Jefferson is in the forefront of these. It is my earnest hope that Americans will take the time to look into this issue, examine all the evidence, and realize that we are in danger of losing our unique heritage to the forces of manipulated conformity and political Correctness. To defend Thomas Jefferson's good name is to defend our priceless legacy of individual freedom.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365892427543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 18:33:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365893022497-66</Id><Title>BOE5 787 flight saturday</Title><Msg>boe5 787 flew to San Bernardino this afternoon.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1365893022497</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 18:43:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365893329856-67</Id><Topic><Title>Our Greatest President born on this date</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365872116253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:55:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Prove Jefferson had an affair...all the DNA evidence shows is that it was someone from Jeffersons family.
