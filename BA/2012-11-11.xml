Because even though they have more money than they and future generations of their most dissolute progeny would be able to spend on even their most lavishly ostentatious excesses, they don't want to have to contribute in any way to making life easier for the poor, the hungry, the homeless, and the otherwise disadvantaged. It's the kind of people they are. Low, petty, small and mean. So in order not to have to pay more taxes, in order to prevent anyone from making them contribute to a more just and fair society, they give hundreds of millions of dollars to failed right wing political hacks such as Karl Rove, who #$%$ those hundreds of millions away, with nothing to show for it. They might as well be doing lots and lots of really really expensive drugs. So, as a result of this year's elections, these big money Republican donors will have to keep paying taxes, hopefully they soon will have to pay even more taxes, and they also #$%$ away hundreds of millions of their own fortunes to no purpose at all. You'd think they'd want to save their money, next time. They might not have a choice about taxes, but they do have a choice about continuing to throw good money after bad. If they care so much about preserving every penny of their staggering wealth, perhaps they ought to consider not wasting it.</Msg><Username>agent0977</Username><Timestamp>1352645909547</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 09:58:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352646507949-7</Id><Topic><Title>My Condolences to Baggers</Title><Username>agent0977</Username><Timestamp>1352559355282</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 09:55:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jensen = Murdoch Beale = Hannity et al Beale didn't wake anybody up or break any trance.

This election was given to them by a terrible economy and a disastorous employment situation. They blew it. History shows that no one wins re-election with those employement numbers. Obama crushed Romney. Lets face it, the republicans did not want this election. Look at the primary, bachmann, perry, gingrich, cain and that guy who kept asking for a birth certificate. With an economy crushed by outsourcing and one that has totally benefited the top 1%, how could you give us a candidate that did not work one day but made $20 million, banks in the caymans, dodged vietnam by doing missionary work in a mansion in paris france, and started a company that does today exactly what got us into the bad economic situation that we are in today.

With high unemployment a massive deficit Romney should have won. Here's why I think Romney lost. Mistake 1. He picked Paul Ryan, who couldn't carry his own state. This turned Romney's perception from a moderate Republican to a conservative Republican. Paul Ryan calls for vouchers for medicare and investing social security monies. 2. The public were scared that Romney view on changing social security and medicare would weaken benefits for seniors. 3. With high unemployment the public has become more dependent on government. What if Romney could not deliver on jobs, the public would still need government, and Romney wants to reduce government. 4. Romney did not visit the stricken states from Hurricane Sandy, Obama did. It made Romney appear indifferent to the plight of the ordinary person who will now need more government and FEMA to recover. 4. People perceived Romney as looking out more for the rich than middle class and not caring at all for those struggling. 5. Obama was able to make Romney into a villian by accusing him of calling to end the American auto industry. Romney was never able to explain himself that he wanted the bankruptcy courts to balance the auto makers books in cutting debt. 6. Obama made Romney look foolish in the 3rd debate. Obama lectured Romney that the military does not win wars with horses, bayanets and battleships, while Romney wanted additional submarines and aircraft carriers, but Romney failed to make himself clear. 7. Romney failed to appeal to young voters who look to Pell Grants, Edu loans, women who do not want to be found in men's binders and seek to maintain Roe v Wade, and Latinos seeking immigration reform.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1352656563622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 12:56:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352656879914-21</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats = Marxism</Title><Username>locost7777</Username><Timestamp>1352651122406</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 11:25:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Locust could help himself and the country by moving to any deeply red state.

Looks like I was close enough for "horseshoes or hand grenades " The identity emerged Sunday of the woman who purportedly received harassing emails from CIA Director David Petraeus’ biographer that eventually led to an FBI investigation, then Petraeus’ resignation. A senior military official said the woman is a State Department's liaison to the military's Joint Special Operations Command. The official identified her as 37-year-old Jill Kelley, in Tampa, Fla., according to the Associated Press. The emails from Petraeus biographer Paula Broadwell triggered the FBI investigation. The official was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Another person who knows Kelley and Petraeus confirmed their friendship and said she saw him often. Petraeus quit as CIA director last week after acknowledging an extramarital relationship with a woman -- later identified as Broadwell. The FBI probe began several months ago with a complaint against Broadwell. That investigation led to Broadwell's email account, which uncovered the relationship with Petraeus. Petraeus’ resignation was announced Friday, but new details continue to emerge about the affair between the former four-star Army general and Broadwell, a West Point graduate. The first knowledge of the affair outside the FBI came from an FBI whistle-blower who contacted a Capitol Hill Republican who told House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Wash., got a tip from a friend who knew the whistle-blower, as reported by The New York Times. Sources tell Fox News that Reichert talked to the whistle-blower, then referred him to Cantor. The whistle-blower talked to the majority leader’s office, then to Cantor directly. The whistle-blower -- who purportedly was concerned about a possible national security breach --was then put in touch with FBI Director Robert Mueller. "Our office stands by the accuracy of the New York Times article as it pertains to Rep. Reichert,” the congressman’s office said Sunday.” We have no further comment about our involvement."</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1352669228661</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 16:27:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352673551514-28</Id><Topic><Title>Open flys close careers</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1352506044986</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 19:07:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you Bongo 52 actual?</Msg><Username>harry_caul</Username><Timestamp>1352673551514</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 17:39:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352675189898-29</Id><Topic><Title>Just before I began campaigning for Obama I had a 30-minute conversation with God...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1352673281259</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 17:34:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"[One day] the evil spirit answered them, 'Jesus I know, and I know about [the Apostle] Paul, but who are you?'

The point is that man is in charge of managing civil government. If man chooses to have a lying, deceiving, conniving, evil person in the office of chancellor or president or prime minister, God will allow that. The Bible even says that God will send a strong delusion to people that choose to believe a lie (2 Thessalonians 2:11). As far as love of God is concerned, He does love you, me, and all of mankind - more than you can fathom - John 3:16. But you already knew that, I am sure.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1352676476822</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 18:27:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352677132486-36</Id><Topic><Title>Just before I began campaigning for Obama I had a 30-minute conversation with God...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1352673281259</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 17:34:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How can that be possible if you're a communist?</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1352677132486</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 18:38:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352678115161-37</Id><Topic><Title>Just before I began campaigning for Obama I had a 30-minute conversation with God...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1352673281259</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 17:34:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>George..., Don't be too quick to assume that the storm was "an act of God", though He can certainly make that happen. But he is not the only one given authority over the elements. According to Ephesians 2:2, Satan has some authority over the earth: "Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the PRINCE OF THE POWER OF THE AIR, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience". You may also recall from the account in Exodus how Pharaoh's magicians also performed some of the same "miracles" (plagues) as Moses relating to the natural world. Pharaoh, therefore, was not convinced to let the Israelites to leave until God took Pharaoh's "first born" child. It is now pretty clear that Sandy was instrumental in swaying some number of voters - though I dare say they may wish now they could reverse that vote, given Obama's tepid level of support demonstrated after the election. Obama and the Democrat party are the leader and party of sin and evil (unrestricted abortions, undermining Israel's security, and same-sex marriage).

At least, I have referenced, even quoted, it a few times. There is no time limit regarding the promise of blessings or curses based upon how individuals and nations deal with Abraham and his "seed". But, besides the prophetic fulfillment of Israel's return to the "promised land", she will play a vital role at the time of the worldwide judgment of the earth. Israel will be converted to Christianity and become witnesses for Jesus - the often quoted "144,000 witnesses" (Revelation 7).
