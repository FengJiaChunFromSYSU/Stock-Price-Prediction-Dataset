The reality is this. All new airplanes, whether they're a derivative or what we call a "clean sheet" airplane, have problems when they first go into service. Let me repeat that, ALL new airplanes have problems when they first go into service. It was no different with the A380, the A320, the 777, the 737, the F-22 or any other airplane you can name. The same is true of virtually any complex product (e.g. Playstation 2 and XBox video game consoles, iPhone, etc) and large, commercial airplanes are more complex than the average person on the street could ever possibly imagine. The 787 may be more prone to this kind of thing simply because it has more state-of-the-art technology on it than any other commercial airplane in history. That said, the reports I've seen in the media do suggest that there's some kind of problem with the 787's electrical system and/or batteries. Being on the inside and having been personally involved in several such situations over the years, here's what I can tell you. Right now there's a team of engineers and technicians working very long hours (maybe even around the clock) to determine what the cause of the problem is. Once the cause is identified and validated, they'll then propose and validate a fix. The only question is, how long will it take to identify the cause, propose a fix and get it implemented? Been there, done that ... many times. This type of thing goes on all the time and is actually fairly normal. The public just isn't aware of it because it's going on behind-the-scenes outside of their purview.</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1358327358733</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 04:09:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358328564216-27</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Employees</Title><Username>wasssssupppppp</Username><Timestamp>1358299500084</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 20:25:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe they should test the planes before they put the passengers on board.</Msg><Username>dxo6919</Username><Timestamp>1358328564216</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 04:29:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358328618389-28</Id><Title>BA engineers have decided to looki into this #$%$ gas leak problem</Title><Msg>did they read the instruction manual fully please collect a sample for anal-y-sis</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1358328618389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 04:30:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358329174383-29</Id><Topic><Title>BA engineers have decided to looki into this #$%$ gas leak problem</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1358328618389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 04:30:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>velly funny 2 cent</Msg><Username>here_comes_old_flatop</Username><Timestamp>1358329174383</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 04:39:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358329537991-30</Id><Topic><Title>Not long before FAA grounds 787</Title><Username>philthyesthoodlum</Username><Timestamp>1357913628933</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 09:13:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like Japan is the 1st country to ground these aircraft.

The drawbacks of this approach emerged early. Some of the pieces manufactured by far-flung suppliers didn't fit together. Some subcontractors couldn't meet their output quotas, creating huge production logjams when critical parts weren't available in the necessary sequence. Rather than follow its old model of providing parts subcontractors with detailed blueprints created at home, Boeing gave suppliers less detailed specifications and required them to create their own blueprints. Some then farmed out their engineering to their own subcontractors, Mike Bair, the former head of the 787 program, said at a meeting of business leaders in Washington state in 2007. That further reduced Boeing's ability to supervise design and manufacture. At least one major supplier didn't even have an engineering department when it won its contract, according to an analysis of the 787 by the European consortium Airbus, Boeing's top global competitor. Boeing executives now admit that the company's aggressive outsourcing put it in partnership with suppliers that weren't up to the job. They say Boeing didn't recognize that sending so much work abroad would demand more intensive management from the home plant, not less. "We gave work to people that had never really done this kind of technology before, and then we didn't provide the oversight that was necessary," Jim Albaugh, the company's commercial aviation chief, told business students at Seattle University last month. "In hindsight, we spent a lot more money in trying to recover than we ever would have spent if we tried to keep many of the key technologies closer to Boeing. The pendulum swung too far."</Msg><Username>greendog03</Username><Timestamp>1358343737080</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 08:42:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358343922623-80</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing analyst said two fires on a 787 would be a gmae changer last week and we are here!</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358312565186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 00:02:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey wayne the way your talking, i wonder if possible sabatage was possible! just THINKING out loud,and i'm glad Boeing put a plant in North Carolina,good work force in that state,Some Unions IMO would rather a co. go out of buisnesss than move a plant some where else in the USA! all your doing is being bitter about Boeing trying to survive in a competitive world! so F--------------U PAL with your union junk, and right now they aren't 100% sure what the problem is, these are very complicated air craft! jmo and american car makers are better off w/o union rules!jmo ps unions are good, but they pushed too hard and basically keep crummy workers from being let go!jmo</Msg><Username>jondow69</Username><Timestamp>1358343922623</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 08:45:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358344255978-81</Id><Topic><Title>Despicable "Truthers"</Title><Username>freedumber</Username><Timestamp>1358341728424</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 08:08:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just because you call yourself a "truther" does not mean you have any relationship to "truth".

His paper was a biting critique of excessive outsourcing, a warning to Boeing not to go down the path that had led Douglas Aircraft to virtual obsolescence by the mid-1990s.The paper laid out the extreme risks of outsourcing core technology and predicted it would bring massive additional costs and require Boeing to buy out partners who could not perform. Reachedin his native Australia, where he is now retired, Hart-Smith said he'd heard in recent months on the grapevine from former colleagues that senior executives at Boeing Commercial Airplanes have been reading his paper.

Shortly after that the fellowship rules were changed to allow the firing of Senior Tech Fellows (they do not have SPEEA protection). What made the paper so powerful was that it stated the problem in a language that the managers could understand even though he was a highly regarded structural engineer. Outsourcing made no sense from a business as well as an engineering perspective and that was one of the main reasons that Douglas lost out to Boeing in the commercial airplane market. If the same business model was applied to Boeing by the Stonecipher crowd it would happen to Boeing. Sadly, the 787 proved he was right from both an engineering and business perspective. The only reason Boeing hasn't gone down has been the steady cash flow coming in from the legacy models and a very favorable . I am wondering where foulmoutharbor is with Boeing airplane delivery report ? Those reports mean nothing, if you study the 787 each one delivered costs the shareholders 300 million in a loss.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358346114969</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 09:21:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358346333271-105</Id><Topic><Title>battery manufacturers lied or quality control is an issue</Title><Username>thelyingherd</Username><Timestamp>1358345765674</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 09:16:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a hand wheel generator.

But then that’s Obama. When he makes his gun control desires known today Obama is going to surround himself with children. Obama says that these are children who wrote him letters after the Sandy Hook shooting telling him he needed to do something. My guess? These letters were virtually ALL written by government school children at the direction of their union Democrat-voting government school teachers. Prove me wrong. Know what? You can go on the internet and find dozens of pictures of Adolf Hitler surrounding himself with children. It’s a well-worn propaganda tool, and certainly not below Dear Ruler. Obama knows that people will accept almost any idea if they can be convinced that it’s “for the children.” In fact … take a look at this quote. It’s a fabricated quote, but it still gets the message across: “As long as the government is perceived as working for the benefit of the children, the people will happily endure almost any curtailment of liberty and almost any deprivation.” That quote is being widely distributed and credited to Adolf Hitler. I can’t find any verification for the quote, and several left-wing sites are calling it a fabrication. Whoever wrote the quote, I like it … because it describes Obama to a “T”. Remember the little black child standing next to Obama when he signed the document (ObamaCare) that will eventually destroy our system of medicine? There is one verified Hitler quote that I found during my research that does fit Obama perfectly. Here it is: “The receptivity of the masses is very limited, their intelligence is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these facts, all effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand by your slogan.” Slogans? Oh! You mean slogans like “Their fair share?” THAT type of slogan?

If Obama accomplishes the “fundamental transformation” he promised us, the freedom that you love, and millions have served to protect, will be nothing more than a concept read about in history books. Even then, the government schools will somehow manage to screw it up! But the Senate Budget Committee released an analysis which shows that federal means-tested welfare spending will increase 80% over the next decade. That will swallow roughly one quarter of our cumulative federal spending at a cost of $11 trillion. Now, consider the fact that the federal government currently takes in about $3 trillion in revenue. While we are comparing current revenues to future expenditures, we are talking about over three times as much spending going just towards welfare as we take in in revenues. After all, there is only so much wealth that can be created within the next ten years. What does this mean? More national debt! A lot more. I saw this quote in an IBD Editorial and found it to be appropriate right about now: To preserve our liberty, Jefferson wrote, "we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude." We are most assuredly at the latter … the re-election of Barack Obama solidified that one. Big time.

The Progressive guru, Saul Alinsky harkened PROGRESSIVES early on to bankrupt the govt by signing up everyone they could dig up onto tthe welfare rolls. That was their strategy to gain power, and enable them to take over every facet of the economy. So what is Obama doing? Now he will enact Executive Privelege to get gun control.

What’s more, Obama’s insistence on repeatedly extending long term unemployment benefits may be fueling the unemployment problem. According to data recently released by the St. Louis Federal Reserve, the average duration of unemployment is now at about 40 weeks, double the previous highest level of about 20 weeks that prevailed during the last three recessions. A separate paper released by the Boston Federal Reserve paints a pernicious picture of the problem: Employers seem to be throwing out the resumes of the long-term unemployed and only hiring those who have been without a job for less than six months. Meanwhile, with the guarantee of benefits rolling in, the long term jobless might not be looking aggressively enough for work, the paper states. This suggests those who just had their unemployment benefits renewed for another year under this month’s fiscal cliff deal may need the benefits renewed again next year. And since the failure to get jobs is related solely to the length of unemployment – age, education and worker type do not seem to be a factor – Obama’s ambitious plans for funding worker training programs may have little effect. Since 2008, Congress has voted to extend unemployment benefits ten times at a cost of more than $500 billion. The latest extension raised federal spending by $30 billion.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1358348700396</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 10:05:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358348735145-131</Id><Title>THE 787 HAS A NEW SMOKING SECTION ON ITS FLIGHTS</Title><Msg>its called the puff daddy section</Msg><Username>forland1966</Username><Timestamp>1358348735145</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 10:05:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358348857245-132</Id><Topic><Title>THE 787 HAS A NEW SMOKING SECTION ON ITS FLIGHTS</Title><Username>forland1966</Username><Timestamp>1358348735145</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 10:05:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who knew you could get high off of overheated batteries?</Msg><Username>fattymcbutterpants2001</Username><Timestamp>1358348857245</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 10:07:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358348956378-133</Id><Title>Its obama fault on the 787...</Title><Msg>It happened, under his watch....will he use smoking asian, in japan behind him!</Msg><Username>forland1966</Username><Timestamp>1358348956378</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 10:09:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358349112401-134</Id><Topic><Title>Despicable "Truthers"</Title><Username>freedumber</Username><Timestamp>1358341728424</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 08:08:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>every major attack on gun freedom has been accomplished behind children being killing, England and Scotland, Australia, Norway, and now the USA.

The climate rally unfolded four hours after the highest predicted tide of 2013 in Budd Inlet. Climate activists draw attention to the winter high tides, calling them a precursor of a future shoreline under siege from sea-level rise. The irony of Monday’s cold weather compared to a global climate that is heating due to a carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere was not lost on the crowd, or some of the speakers. “Climate and weather are two different things,” Olympia-area environmentalist Paul Pickett was quick to remind the bundled-up crowd. Climate is long term and weather is what happens daily, he said."

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) gave an interview to the Christian Broadcasting Network in which he rather strongly denounced President Obama’s threats to impose gun control through executive orders. ”I’m against having a king,” said the Senator. ”I think having a monarch is what we fought the American Revolution over, and someone who wants to bypass the Constitution, bypass Congress, that’s someone who wants to act like a king or monarch.” To be more specific, the notion of suffering rule without representation was a big sticking point with the authors of the Declaration of Independence. Speaking of kings and monarchs is a valid shorthand way of expressing the notion that unitary government is the problem… even if the absolute ruler has to stand for election every four years, and even when he’s limited to two terms in office. Bypassing Congress is an aggressive method of ruling without representation. It’s supposed to be difficult to force sweeping national agendas upon a free people. The modern appetite for swift, “efficient,” all-powerful centralized government is a denial of that principle. It’s tough to find issues where Rand Paul agrees with, say, Harry Reid, isn’t it? Good. That difficulty defines the boundaries of what the federal government is supposed to be doing. Battles over the extension of those boundaries should be nice and vicious. The American people deserve no less. What makes a “king?” It’s not the means by which he takes the throne, or the length of time he remains there. The threat of punishment at the ballot box in four years is not a sufficient check on executive power, especially for a President who will never again face the voters. What is “taxation without representation?” Ask your grandchildren, when they are taxed through the nose to pay off deranged spending commitments they weren’t alive to oppose. I see nothing wrong with invoking the language of the American Revolution, when it is so clearly still in progress.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1358357425315</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:30:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358357809620-205</Id><Title>Batteries</Title><Msg>Boeing should think about buying A123 Systems battery technology.

The letters were released to the Associated Press in what appears to be a coordinated effort to help shape the narrative the day of Obama's announcement. "Three days after six teachers and 20 students were killed by a rampaging gunman at their elementary school in Newtown, Conn., an 8-year-old from Maryland pulled out a sheet of paper and asked President Barack Obama for 'some changes in the laws with guns,'" the AP reports. "It's a free country but I recommend there needs (to) be a limit with guns," Grant wrote in a letter dated Dec. 17. "Please don't let people own machine guns or other powerful guns like that." In the days after the shooting, children around the country had the same idea as Grant. They put their feelings about the massacre on paper and sent those letters to a receptive White House. "I am writing to ask you to STOP gun violence," wrote Tajeah, a 10-year-old from Georgia. "I am very sad about the children who lost their lives. So, I thought I would write to you to STOP gun violence." Half way through the article, the AP admits, "The White House shared three such letters with The Associated Press, from young writers who seemed to agree that Obama should do what's necessary to make it harder for people to get guns." White House spokesman Jay Carney announced yesterday that Obama will be surrounded by little kids when he announces his gun proposal later today. Another letter reads: Eleven-year-old Julia, who lives in the District of Columbia and dotted the "I'' in her name with a heart, wrote that she has four brothers and sisters and "I know I would not be able to bear the thought of losing any of them." She said it should be "very hard" for people to buy guns and closed by acknowledging that Obama can't do it alone. "I know that laws have to be passed by Congress but I beg you to try very hard to make guns not allowed. Not just for me, but for the whole United States," Julia wrote, signing the letter with "my love and regrets." She will also be at the White House on Wednesday. The White House appears not to have released a single letter to the AP in opposition to President Obama's gun proposal.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1358357841424</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:37:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358357872009-207</Id><Topic><Title>Dreamliner uses Lithium Ion Batteries - These are unstable &amp; can start fires</Title><Username>hysailr</Username><Timestamp>1357918332765</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:32:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fair enough. However, the use of Li-ion batteries is sound. The implementation (design and manufacturing and/or battery/charger compatibility) may be at issue. Battery charge management of Li-ion batteries is less forgiving than for the older Ni-Cad or Ni-H batteries. The benefit of Li-ion is that it has double the density of storage. And weight is an issue on an airplane - just like on satellites. The 787 uses batteries made by GS Yuasa. Look up their website. They have a lot of experience and make such batteries for everything - including for electric trains (1800 kWh) (that is 1.8 Megawatt/hour!) and satellites (which use considerably less). The charge controller is either made by Thales Avionics Electrical Systems or Securaplane. This is what Securaplane says about the 787: "Securaplane is pioneering lithium battery technology on commercial aircraft, developing the charger for the lithium main ship batteries on the Boeing 787 through Thales". Gulfstream and Embraer are also going with Securaplane Li-ion systems. Thales is the subsystem integrator for the battery + controller. This is what Thales says about their equipment: "Thales offers an innovative and highly secure Li-Ion emergency low voltage system for commercial aircraft. It is the first commercial application of Li-Ion technology anywhere in the world." Their website also indicates that they have experience with controlling Li-ion batteries for satellites. Thales indicates that their satellite controller experience is for 50V (up to 100V) and 18 kW. 18kW is still pretty substantial - more than the maximum power demand by the largest commercial satellite. Securaplane and GS Yuasa also indicate capabilities to provide battery charge management. The (internet available) photo of the "burned out" battery pack shows 8 LVP65 GS Yuasa cells in (what appears to be) a series configuration (8x3.7V) at 65/75 amp/hr or about 1.8 kWh, assuming one cell failure (one tenth of Thales largest battery charge management capability). Thus it is minor compared to Thales satellite experience and peanuts compared to what other battery configurations have been built by GS Yuasa.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1358357872009</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:37:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358358171260-208</Id><Title>Hospital to stop delivering babies because of Obamacare...</Title><Msg>WINDBER, Pa. (AP) — A southwestern Pennsylvania hospital will stop delivering babies after March 31 because its obstetricians are either leaving or refocusing their practices, and because hospital officials believe they can't afford it based on projected reimbursements under looming federal health care reforms. The Windber Medical Center, about 60 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, is losing two obstetricians and two others are shifting their focus more to gynecology. Hospital officials say the population of women of child-bearing age is dropping and that the number of births the hospital would be called upon to perform isn't enough for it to provide the service in the face of lower reimbursements under the federal Affordable Care Act. The hospital delivered about 200 babies each year since restarting its obstetrics program in 2005. Officials aren't sure how many jobs will be lost.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1358358171260</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:42:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358358204036-209</Id><Topic><Title>Batteries</Title><Username>rigrunner_24</Username><Timestamp>1358357809620</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:36:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A123 went bankrupt, then was purchased by the Chinese.

The action was prompted AD was prompted by a report of a battery fire that resulted after an energized ground power unit was connected to one of the affected airplanes equipped with a lithium-ion battery, Cessna part number (P/N) 9914788-1, as the main aircraft battery. This condition, if not corrected, could result in an aircraft fire. The FAA says it has reviewed Cessna Citation Service Bulletin SB525C-24-05, dated September 29, 2011. The service information describes procedures for replacing lithium-ion main aircraft batteries, Cessna P/N 9914788-1, with Ni-Cad or lead acid batteries. The agency is issuing this AD following evaluation of all the relevant information and determined the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design. The AD requires accomplishing the actions specified in the service information described previously. Within the next 10 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD or within the next 7 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, replace the lithium-ion main aircraft battery, P/N 9914788-1, following Cessna Citation Service Bulletin SB525C-24-05, dated September 29, 2011. As of the effective date of this AD, do not install a lithium-ion battery, P/N 9914788-1, on any of the affected airplanes.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1358362225751</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:50:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358362302060-243</Id><Topic><Title>After the election Obama did not cut drilling on government lands again</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1358360977601</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:29:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>based on neocon facts; - Romney the election... !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358362302060</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:51:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358362317505-244</Id><Topic><Title>Batteries</Title><Username>rigrunner_24</Username><Timestamp>1358357809620</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:36:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If it's on fire, then it will land quickly one way or another!</Msg><Username>zombiegrunt</Username><Timestamp>1358362317505</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:51:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358362368038-245</Id><Title>ba</Title><Msg>planes already flying ,all up from here saw it oncnbc clip they do not even know or care</Msg><Username>rayjo5</Username><Timestamp>1358362368038</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:52:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358362512716-246</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing has earnings report tomorrow , perfect timing , and the strike to consider</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358346114969</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 09:21:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cvs9yt, right there are so many Boeing management enablers who know nothing. cvs9yt, so I check now and then to see if they have a clue, your right. today while I watched my stock go up 5% rimm sold and then did the same with STP at 6% and out, cvs9yt, why lose on BA at best it is a dead cat bounce stock.

However and during development in 2006, a three-alarm fire occurred at Securaplane Technologies Inc., which is a unit of Meggitt plc (LON: MGGT) that in turn supplies the battery’s charger to Thales SA (EPA: HO) who then supplies it to Boeing. And the circuit boards for the electrical panel supplied by Thales came from a third tier vendor in Mexico that were determined to be sub standard. Maybe they should have done a more detailed root cause on the SecuraPlane warehouse fire where they were storing/checking the battery charging system. It bothers me to see multiple vendors who may or may not be working out system issues in concert. Clearly something in the supply chain and overall system integration is not working. Frankly, I'd like to see some of the non-aerospace organizations that appear to have solved the Li-Ion battery issue brought in to assist with this.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1358365052469</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 14:37:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358365212366-279</Id><Title>5 min is up CNBC talking about BA</Title><Msg>Yesterday they #$%$ all over aapl all day, only to have an AH timer push it up to catch shorts by the balls, thye could must likely do the same here</Msg><Username>cvs9yt</Username><Timestamp>1358365212366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 14:40:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358365256375-280</Id><Title>Hello McNUTY- CEO, THE SMARTEST BA CEO</Title><Msg>One time I had as many as 3000+ shares of BA.

That is what the battery management subsystem (BMS) does. each cell develops 2.4 volts while being charged.... but must not exceed that. also, there is a limit on current. if an overcurrent or overvoltage condition occurs (let's say at the fault of the BMS), then swelling within the cell may occur. now if the pack of cells is mechanically constrained to fit into a frame of somesort, swelling (which is non-reversible) will cause an external pressure and potentially cause breakdown... along with either overvoltage or overcurrent. i'm sure their engineers are looking at the BMS and that they are also looking at full loads those battery packs supply - and i would not want to be an EE on the job either - LOL.... but really, there's something worth noting here - the more complex things become, the more failures you're gonna have. boeing needs to bring back the B17. that thing was built like a tank. all this stuff controlled by computers (including the BMS) just has too many points of failure... even with redundancy... why? cuz fires are not redundant and they do not care.</Msg><Username>hysailr</Username><Timestamp>1358366009427</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 14:53:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358366282752-292</Id><Title>Hello Greece, Roman Empire..........</Title><Msg>YEH, the repucs like a nagging housewife, but I understand......!

Engineers said no, managers said go. There lies the problem. When the people in charge are not engineers they do not have the knowledge to make good decisions. They see everything as ROI and image. How can they possible manage a technical company. The only MBAs that are successful are the ones that break up a company and sell off the pieces and the only reason they do that is so they can make a lot of money which is what they were taught. MBA = worthless (or at most a necessary evil) and they should never have the power to make technology decisions. They should be giving advice not making decisions which impact an engineering company. However, in this world of high finance the MBA makes the decision and the engineers give the advice.

This is a dangerous situation for BA and for stockholders.</Msg><Username>toad030warm899</Username><Timestamp>1358367971932</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 15:26:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358368276176-308</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Republicans hate the America !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358363267913</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 14:07:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The simple answer is, yes, they are that stupid!</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1358368276176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 15:31:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358368540316-309</Id><Topic><Title>Batteries, what management said today:</Title><Username>toad030warm899</Username><Timestamp>1358367971932</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 15:26:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Could it be the way the Japanese airlines are using the plane?

They don't fall out the way the press has led you to believe. No big deal!! Batteries are a different situation. Ni Cad batteries, widely used ( different than the 787 batteries) was a serious problem for all pilots and still is. We are able to isolate the battery from the electrical system and watch the temperature of the battery. If the temperature stabilizes, no problem. If it continues to increase we are going to land. The only problem with the 787 is the type batteries being used. All other problems are minor. Knowing BA as I do, they are 100% on the problem and will find a solution soon. As a retired commercial pilot I wouldn't hesitate to fly the 787 as a passenger and with my family.</Msg><Username>laylow1991</Username><Timestamp>1358369766375</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 15:56:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>19</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358369770749-318</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes</Title><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1358356099824</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:08:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>buy after the 1st crash of a 787 for a huge discount!</Msg><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1358369770749</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 15:56:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358369808930-319</Id><Title>BA Could see mid $50's</Title><Msg>This is broken.

Then later the smell of electrical smoke from the dashboard was possible (and possibly the result of resting a foot on the brake while idling.) As the car reached 180,000 miles and was no longer driven, the headlights weren't working correctly. I did take the fuses out of the seat warmer circuits and use a summer-zone battery. Of course these GM electrical parts are often made in Mexico. That shouldn't be the problem, the problem should be the design specifications or the overall electrical system. I once needed toggle switches for a race car. I didn't like the switches at KMart so I went to an Aircraft parts counter and they helped me choose switches without having part numbers. They were very high quality switches. I use a Braille AMT battery in my sports car. It's half the weight and no problem but a lithium-ion battery would be half the weight again. Telsa has a wiring system that takes a bad battery cell out of the loop. This is their primary technology but of course they use a lot of batteries.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1358370837392</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 16:13:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358371027221-326</Id><Topic><Title>Batteries, what management said today:</Title><Username>toad030warm899</Username><Timestamp>1358367971932</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 15:26:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An MD-11 with all aboard was lost during the transition period when new entertainment systems were being stuffed into older airplanes partly because of circuit overloading.

For years, American companies built upon the knowledge and experienced gained building other products to build new and improved products. They never started from "scratch". Also, the bigger more scuccessful companies were vertically integrated and built products under close supervison using known trusted local vendors if necessary. Boeing through all this to the wind abandoning sound and proven methods, if expensive ones, for "fresh new ones" and relentlessly outsourced globally based on cost containment versus quality. We now see the results. Estimates are that this plane conservatively has taken twice as long and cost twice as much as using the old tried and true methodoligies.

Liberals have traditionally celebrated its cradle-to-grave safety net, while conservatives have disparaged its high taxes and centralized health-care regime. Yet both groups have generally agreed that Swedish-style socialism is a far cry from rough-and-tumble U.S. capitalism. In fact, contemporary Sweden is much less socialist than many Americans realize. Since the early 1990s, when it suffered a painful financial crisis, the Scandinavian country has deregulated key industries (such as airlines, telecommunications, and electricity), lowered its overall tax burden, established universal school vouchers, partially privatized its pension system, abolished certain government monopolies, sold a number of state-owned enterprises (including the parent company of Absolut vodka), and trimmed public spending. Several years ago, it eliminated gift and inheritance taxes. The World Economic Forum now ranks Sweden as the second-most competitive economy on earth, behind only Switzerland. According to the 2010 Index of Economic Freedom (compiled by the Wall Street Journal and the Heritage Foundation), Sweden offers greater business freedom, trade freedom, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, freedom from corruption, and property-rights protection than does the United States.

The 26.4VDC, 44Ah Lithium Ion main battery weighs 54 lbs, a 35% weight saving over a Nickel-Cadmium battery. Using phosphate-based Lithium Ion cells, which have no positive feedback thermal runaway failure mode, system integration of the battery and aircraft architecture design is simpler. Electronics and software are needed to optimize life only, not to ensure safety. Emergency discharge with failed electronics is enabled with the selection of a less volatile chemistry, the use of an analog Module Management System for cell balancing and protection, and the use of a microcontroller-based digital Central Monitoring System that reports health. System safety failure hazard assessment is considered Major, and the battery software is certified to the requirements of RTCA DO-178B, Design Assurance Level C. New Battery Fault and Battery Fail annunciations supersede the conventional Battery Overtemperature messages to accommodate other non-temperature related failure modes. Heaters enable performance at cold temperatures while its aircraft-in-the-loop circuit ensures safety. The Lithium Ion battery and the Cessna Citation CJ4 electrical bus and avionics suite designs were integrated to optimize performance, safety, protection, and maintenance frequency. And then: The FAA says it has reviewed Cessna Citation Service Bulletin SB525C-24-05, dated September 29, 2011. The service information describes procedures for replacing lithium-ion main aircraft batteries, with Ni-Cad or lead acid batteries. The agency is issuing this AD following evaluation of all the relevant information and determined the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design. The AD requires accomplishing the actions Replace the lithium-ion main aircraft battery) within the next 10 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD or within the next 7 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. As of the effective date of this AD, do not install a lithium-ion battery, on any of the affected airplanes.

Batteries are the main problem with the 787 in my opinion and will be solved over time. Boeing would never allow their aircraft to fly if they felt it could cause an accident. All other malfunctions are teething pains and are not that serious. Most accidents are caused by pilots not following safety procedures and ignoring warning systems.

Before further flight, operators of U.S.-registered, Boeing 787 aircraft must demonstrate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that the batteries are safe. The FAA will work with the manufacturer and carriers to develop a corrective action plan to allow the U.S. 787 fleet to resume operations as quickly and safely as possible. The in-flight Japanese battery incident followed an earlier 787 battery incident that occurred on the ground in Boston on January 7, 2013. The AD is prompted by this second incident involving a lithium ion battery. The battery failures resulted in release of flammable electrolytes, heat damage, and smoke on two Model 787 airplanes. The root cause of these failures is currently under investigation. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical systems and structures, and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment. Last Friday, the FAA announced a comprehensive review of the 787’s critical systems with the possibility of further action pending new data and information. In addition to the continuing review of the aircraft’s design, manufacture and assembly, the agency also will validate that 787 batteries and the battery system on the aircraft are in compliance with the special condition the agency issued as part of the aircraft’s certification. United Airlines is currently the only U.S. airline operating the 787, with six airplanes in service. When the FAA issues an airworthiness directive, it also alerts the international aviation community to the action so other civil aviation authorities can take parallel action to cover the fleets operating in their own countries.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1358379921275</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 18:45:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358379922248-400</Id><Title>Sure, the witch broom was on fire</Title><Msg>hahahahahaha¡</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

I feel the batteries are less a problem than the electrical systems tied to it. There is a chance, since other 787's have not had a problem, that the batteries in question may have been defective. They are made in Japan. That is the easy solution. At least I hope so. Knowing Boeing like I do, they will over time correct the problem. I will be buying Boeing stock now that there is blood in the street.

One guy crashes because he had the wrong mat on the floor and like a dope, he pushed it with his foot so that it bunched up on the accelerator. Then every tom #$%$ and harry was screaming about how their accident was a result of sudden acceleration, or if they were behind on car payments, they crashed their car on purpose and blamed it on sudden acceleration. Government dopes fall for the scam and hold hearings, etc. Government produced some pathetic university professor to testify that it could happen (if you hit the thing with a hammer when the car was going 75 mph and also soddered a wire from the tail pipe to the accelerator pedal. In the end, government comes out and says the who problem was a result of driver error!!!! DRIVER ERROR! What a joke. So guess what. One bad battery on a 787 plane. News media goes hog wild, so everyone thinks that they smell smoke on every plane. Second plane's smoke problem was probably some nicotine addicted #$%$ in the bathroom smoking a cigarette, or someone who had smoked a cigarette just before boarding the plane. This will all blow over. Makes for great news press. Boeing will have this stuff figured out in no time, outline the solution (if one is needed), and then back to making billions of dollars. In meantime, short sellers on this board will scream and holler like the weenies they are. Some will make some money. Most will not. Long term players will buy in on the cheap hugely and ring the cash register. Check out what happened to the Toyota stock price. Up about 50% from the height of the overblown accelerator scare.</Msg><Username>thedeathrace</Username><Timestamp>1358381594639</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 19:13:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358381664044-431</Id><Topic><Title>Who thinks this AH price will hold until the open?</Title><Username>brandnerjoshua</Username><Timestamp>1358380065808</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 18:47:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh ok...I am active on AAPL so that was what shocked me haha!

This 787 is his Baby</Title><Msg>McNerney Must Go...This 787 is his baby...he has been on the board of directors, ceo, chairman of the board, or all of the above for the entire history of the 787. I am the biggest fan of the 787 and Boeing, but I've watched this fiasco for nearly 10 years now. McNerney and his cockeyed manufacturing plan has destroyed the reputation of this once great and respected company. I don't care what anyone says - not the rubber stamping FAA, not that phony transportation secretary, and not any of you fools who can't wait to get on board, fuel leaks and electrical problems are a dangerous mix. Broken window on a three week old plane ??? Generators mal-functioning after three weeks service ???? -----there are six generators on every 787 !!!! I certainly wish no one any harm, but this "nightmare liner" is looking pretty scary. Why weren't these problems discovered during the thousands of hours of test flights. I suspect right about now McNerney wishes he never heard the word "outsourcing". In an effort to sidestep American engineers and technicians and their relatively high wages (relative to Chinese and Vietnamese peasants wages), the design and manufacturing of the 787 was sourced to the lowest bidders in third world countries 15 years out of the stone age. That might work for cheap trinkets and transistor radios but for 200 foot long cylinders traveling at 30000 ft.and 500mph for 15 hours on end, experience is simply irreplaceable. McNerney is an mba, not an engineer. That explains everything. I hope very much to fly on a 787 some day, but it won't be anytime soon !!! Good luck to all Boeing investors and especially all booked 787 passengers.</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1358383496122</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 19:44:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358383500843-456</Id><Topic><Title>The Riccaro Money Flow Quotient maintains short sell on the shares of BA.</Title><Username>rbg5r</Username><Timestamp>1358379467393</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 18:37:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Riccaro Quotient stands by its short sale signal of BA .</Msg><Username>rbg5r</Username><Timestamp>1358383500843</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 19:45:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358383574517-457</Id><Topic><Title>BA Could see mid $50's</Title><Username>tekstockwatcher</Username><Timestamp>1358369808930</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 15:56:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well then at $55, it would equal your IQ.

One more thing you might want to take into consideration the next time you climb aboard one of those fine aircraft they build. This is a country who can't build a decent dependable car! Remember the " Renault " or the wonderful " Peugeot "? When I fly, I move my flight times and even dates to avoid getting on anything the French build.</Msg><Username>crazy4redsox1834</Username><Timestamp>1358385678269</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 20:21:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358385712405-486</Id><Topic><Title>MEMO TO MC NEARNEY</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1358369680882</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 15:54:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here is what the giant steaming pile of MBA kids know about airplanes: 1.

Jan Schakowsky, along with Rep. Henry Waxman and 43 House Members, introduced H.R. 261 the Public Option Deficit Reduction Act. This bill would offer the choice of a publicly-run health insurance plan, an option that would save more than $100 billion over 10 years. “Obamacare is already helping millions of Americans get the health care they need, but it can be made even better. The Public Option Deficit Reduction Act will give health care consumers more choice and lower their premiums. “It would provide premiums that are 5% to 7% lower than private insurance plans. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, it would decrease the federal budget deficit by $104 billion over 10 years. And, by providing a lower-cost alternative to private insurance, it would put pressure on all insurers to lower their premiums in order to compete. “American health consumers deserve a publicly-accountable, transparent, and lower-cost option. The bill we are introducing today would provide that choice and lower the federal deficit at the same time. We cannot let for-profit insurance companies continue to prevent American consumers and American taxpayers from benefitting from passage of the public option. I will work hard to make sure it is not just part of the debate about controlling health care costs but also part of the enacted solution,” said Rep.

When you think of the 787, the first "exotic" technology that comes to mind is the composite structure. Some level of use of composites had already been in place, but Boeing jumped past simply applying this to some sections and made almost the entire aircraft out of it. Li-ion batteries have been around since the 1970's with "go for it" consumer applications starting in the 1990's. It is now all very common. Lead Acid dates back to 1881, Ni-Cad to 1956, and NiMH was introduced commercially in the 1990's. Li-ion batteries reduce weight and volume which are always at a premium for fuel efficiency and customer salable space. Batteries go through charge and discharge cycles and some kinds of cycles are benign and other cycles wear them out faster. The lead-acid batteries deteriorate with micro-cycles (less than full cycle), Ni-Cad has a "memory issue", and NiMH batteries have a high self-discharge rate ("stand loss") as well as are only good to a 50% depth of discharge (DoD) (i.e., worth a half of use). Remember that we were told to always take Ni-Cad batteries down low in charge and then fully re-charge; don't partially charge as that changes their performance. Li-ion apparently are more tolerant when cycled in any manner that is necessary and they have an 80% DoD capability -- they are superior in performance. The problem with Li-ion battery cells is that they are "fussy" when it comes to the voltage that is applied across the cell when charging. The other batteries' cells are less fussy. So cell voltage regulation (balancing) is critical. That is the job of the charge controller as well as any electronics integrated into each cell. Cells are strung into a series and "share" the charge from the controller across the entire string. Problems arise when a cell performs differently such that higher charge voltages are applied to that cell or the other cells than is tolerable. The older technologies naturally tolerate the overcharge. Li-ion cells do not like overcharging at all and will fail. Voila! Fire. The charge control at the cell and pack level is critical. So, Boeing will fix this. It is fixable. And it works extensively all over the place in many applications. And it is desirable to continue with Li-ion and not revert to antiquated technologies. The satellite industry has moved in this direction and it makes sense for an aircraft such as the 787 with its extensive use of electrical/electronic systems to employ this weight saving technology. It just has to be done right.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1358391982457</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 22:06:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358391998266-550</Id><Title>Problems</Title><Msg>Just found this article: "The FAA action, and its review, come after an extraordinary string of mishaps, including a battery fire, two fuel leaks, three electrical faults, a cracked cockpit windscreen, an engine oil leak and brake problems that have raised safety concerns with the new carbon-plastic composite aircraft."

The residue covered the battery and splattered over nearby instruments inside the forward electronics bay. It left a 12-foot-long dark streak from the battery to an outflow valve through which some of the spray vented overboard during the flight. The people with knowledge of what was found inside the forward electronics bay after the incident said the battery was not blackened and cracked open like the battery in the Japan Airlines 787 fire a week earlier at Logan airport in Boston. “It’s not as bad as the earlier incident,” one person said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It looks like there wasn’t a fire. But there was a significant overheating.” Two further sources confirmed that there was no fire inside the airplane. The residue may have been from smoke or from hot, vaporized electrolyte, the potentially flammable chemical inside the battery. But even without a fire, “it’s still a problem” that the electrolytes sprayed out of the battery box, said one person.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1358392679845</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 22:17:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358392759318-557</Id><Topic><Title>Boys and Girls...you all KNOW where this is headed don't you</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358378428398</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 18:20:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did you see where under the knew Soviet Style Edict, that Doctors have to be snitches on patients No wonder so many Drs are leaving the profession. .</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358392759318</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 22:19:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358393422012-558</Id><Topic><Title>FACTS contradict what the hand wringing politicians would have us believe !!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358335756968</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 06:29:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump!!!</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358393422012</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 22:30:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358393606574-559</Id><Title>BA will drop big time tomorrow, every one is grounding the planes</Title><Msg>who will take loss?</Msg><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1358393606574</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 22:33:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358393614278-560</Id><Topic><Title>“Change the batteries”</Title><Username>dreamriverfilms</Username><Timestamp>1358384152650</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 19:55:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A grain of sand to a mountain - smart sold first news --this is not a love -- read analysis ---</Msg><Username>redwoodtoo</Username><Timestamp>1358393614278</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 22:33:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358393832661-561</Id><Title>FAA Ground ALL 787's</Title><Msg>bummer for BA. i can hear them now around the round table, "hmm, who's decision was it anyways to build this pos?"</Msg><Username>junkyemail22</Username><Timestamp>1358393832661</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 22:37:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358393841982-562</Id><Title>Place an Energizer Bunny on each flight</Title><Msg>$65 by Monday</Msg><Username>mcgiver844</Username><Timestamp>1358393841982</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 22:37:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358394003253-563</Id><Topic><Title>Brings a new meaning to that famous phrase "We Have Ignition"</Title><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1358388976605</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 21:16:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lolol... such a stupid comment....

The only thing to save them was to get deliveries increased and that is why they have been pushing the factory workers beyond what is safe to try to ramp up deliveries. NOW THIS and a strike very likely starting on Feb 2. Heads need to roll at Boeing management and even that will probably not help at all. Sell now there are much better INVESTMENTS at this time than a company at war with its employees and a plane that they will not admit has serious flaws untill one crashes taking 280 lives. THEN WHERE WILL YOUR INVESTMENT BE?</Msg><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1358398271377</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 23:51:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358398464212-593</Id><Topic><Title>BA will drop big time tomorrow, every one is grounding the planes</Title><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1358393606574</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 22:33:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is good, but insurance does not bring back the customers, and reputation...A LOSS.</Msg><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1358398464212</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 23:54:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358398544392-594</Id><Topic><Title>what co makes those batteries?</Title><Username>lburgguy999</Username><Timestamp>1358382547771</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 19:29:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yuasa Japan make the cells. Are you sure that they make the battery assembly? Are you sure it isn't Thale that builds the "package"? Although the cells are probably failing, I'd bet they are not the cause of the failure. I'll bet it turns out that the cells are just fine.</Msg><Username>habu_driver</Username><Timestamp>1358398544392</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 23:55:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358398609483-595</Id><Topic><Title>BA will drop big time tomorrow, every one is grounding the planes</Title><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1358393606574</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 22:33:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can you insure the loss of 800 orders after a 30 Billion invetment?</Msg><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1358398609483</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 23:56:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358398624836-596</Id><Topic><Title>“Change the batteries”</Title><Username>dreamriverfilms</Username><Timestamp>1358384152650</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 19:55:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A 787 is slighty......oh, I mean, a multitude times more complicated than a Cessna citation.

If it's due to lithium-ion batteries, that'll be costly as well, possible design change. If its due to excessive pressure on the lithium-ion batteries, I don't have a clue what then. Take your pick? Either way, this could be long before you really know the source of the issue and then the fix. Long term, though I'm watching where this might fall and then I'll step in, until full scope of the issue is known, I'm staying the heck away from it.</Msg><Username>div_investor</Username><Timestamp>1358398748353</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 23:59:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
