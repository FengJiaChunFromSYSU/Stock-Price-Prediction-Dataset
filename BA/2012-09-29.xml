FAA has already addressed this issue with requirement for ultrasonic inspections every 90 days (which GE will no doubt pay for). GE already has a new coating process in place and will replace the affected engines as parts become available. So this will be a non issue.</Msg><Username>jamiehogan2</Username><Timestamp>1348917831475</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 07:23:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348920780606-3</Id><Topic><Title>Just So You Know: Voting Democratic Places the Eternal Salvation of Your Soul In Serious Jeopardy</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_777</Username><Timestamp>1348864842842</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 16:40:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just so you know the guys you cite are RWNJ's and would have been Tbaggers if the Tbaggers had been around at the time Jesus Christ, M Gandhi, were liberal progressives</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1348920780606</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 08:13:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348923429243-4</Id><Topic><Title>President Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel are lifetime members of the same gay bath house in uptown Chicago</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1348873983605</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 19:13:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Ex Reporter from Kent is a member though correct ?</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1348923429243</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 08:57:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348925074770-5</Id><Topic><Title>President Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel are lifetime members of the same gay bath house in uptown Chicago</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1348873983605</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 19:13:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you saying that Mr Emmanuel and President Obama are gay????

The conditions are shrinking earnings at the world's second-largest package delivery company. Factories are making fewer items for FedEx to ship and customers are opting for cheaper delivery options to save money. FedEx on Tuesday cut its outlook for global growth and industrial production while slashing the forecast for company earnings. And CEO Fred Smith suggested trade has slowed to levels seen during the last two significant economic downturns.</Msg><Username>jetstream_2010</Username><Timestamp>1348941554202</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 13:59:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348944857650-23</Id><Topic><Title>What percentage of revenue and or profits is the dreamliner?

Do the math, a 200 million plane sold on time and without any rework is not a profit of even 5% as there is a undiscloesed discount for multiple orders from customer so make that 3% so 3% on a 200 million dollar net profit for the perfect sale is only 6 million per plane as you can see the Boeing shareholders will never break even that is why Boeing stock is down over 4% year to date and the DJ is up 10% and apple is up about 70 % year to date Boeing has too much cost of building their planes to make any real money and never will with the Boeing killer the 787 outsorcing business plan, incidentally that is what killed MD and MD was the guiding light after they canned Phil Condit . So no matter how much floodgates the fowl reports pumps at a debt load of 20,000 million a 3 million net profit or even a 5.7 million net profit on all Boeing delivered planes will never in our lifetimes break even. So if you own boeing stock yoru not going to make any money Apple was a 35 dollar stock when Boeing was a 65 dollar stock many years ago now Boeing is still a 69 dollar stock and has never been a 700 or a 600 or a 500 or a 400 or a 300 or a 200 a more than a very low for a very briekf time even a 100 dollar stock and it never will. enogh said about flood gates of plane deliveries the only flood gates for the shareholder is 20,000 million food gates of debt on just one plane that could at best account for only a few percent of the profit now 99% of boeing profit comes from one plane the 737 and it is old and the chinese will have their 737 buster selling by 2015 so long Boeing your done , you know it and the stock buying public knows it too.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1348946130394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 15:15:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348946414316-27</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney Blurts Out the Truth About Neo-Conservatism</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_777</Username><Timestamp>1348864963262</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 16:42:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed.</Msg><Username>instant_karma48</Username><Timestamp>1348946414316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 15:20:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348946968896-28</Id><Title>""*****Fed's Fisher says U.S. "drowning in unemployment"*****""</Title><Msg>America, The "FAUX Recovery" WAS Never REAL!!!!!!!!!!!

One reason for the problems we face today is that we have stopped seeing taxes as an essential institution in this capitalist economy for if taxes could be raised on those who can most afford to pay them, public services would not have to be cut. We should see taxes as an integral part of a moral capitalist economy, providing health, education and social care outside the market. People should not be afraid to join Warren Buffett in saying the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.</Msg><Username>natsu4fun</Username><Timestamp>1348965196891</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 20:33:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348966369720-40</Id><Title>Pentagon seeks competition for F-35 program</Title><Msg>Fri Sep 28, 2012 8:35pm EDT * Pentagon plans to meet with companies Nov. 14-15 * Seeks possible competitors for simulators, support equipment * No deal yet on next batch of production planes By Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Friday moved toward bringing in other companies to operate and maintain its most expensive weapons program, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a step that could reduce revenues for the current prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp. The move is the latest action by the Pentagon to drive down the cost of the new single-engine, single-seat warplane, whose operations and maintenance costs are currently projected to reach a staggering $1.11 trillion over the coming decades. Last week, top Pentagon and Air Force officials publicly slammed Lockheed's performance on the new radar-evading jet, whose development and production alone are slated to cost $396 billion. The officials said they were looking at ways to introduce more competition to the program.</Msg><Username>armageddon_ycqm</Username><Timestamp>1348966369720</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 20:52:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348971404754-41</Id><Title>To Cripple Boeing or not?</Title><Msg>That is the question. Will Speea workers drive Boeing into bankruptcy, like auto workers did to GM, or as the airline unions had done to American Airlines? How long will America tolerate runaway unions that thoughtlessly decimate businesses by going on strike? Thoughtless because runaway unions don't understand the loss of jobs they destroy that businesses worked so hard to create. Thoughtless, because the unions supported Obamacare so that every American could have healthcare. The cost of Obamacare is coming to unduly burden companies like Boeing and union workers are not willing to share in the cost of a program they demanded.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1348971404754</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:16:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>19</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348972138790-42</Id><Topic><Title>To Cripple Boeing or not?</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1348971404754</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:16:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another bit of ignorance from mbfield, but there's nothing new there as he has been reminded of this repeatedly.
