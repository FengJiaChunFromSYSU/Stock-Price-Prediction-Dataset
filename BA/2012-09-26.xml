The anxiety has been similar in Florida, where Republicans are concerned that President Obama is gaining the upper hand in the fight for the state’s 29 electoral votes. Those fears are affirmed in the findings of the latest Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News polls of likely voters in both states, which show that Mr. Obama has widened his lead over Mr. Romney and is outperforming him on nearly every major campaign issue, even though about half said they were disappointed in Mr. Obama’s presidency. The polls, along with interviews with supporters and advisers in the nation’s two largest battleground states, lay bare an increasingly urgent challenge facing Mr. Romney as he prepares for his next chance to move the race in his favor, at the first debate with Mr. Obama next week. Mr. Romney’s burden is no longer to win over undecided voters, but also to woo back the voters who seem to be growing a little comfortable with the idea of a second term for Mr. Obama. As Mr. Romney arrived in Ohio on Tuesday for a two-day bus tour and the president was set to campaign here on Wednesday, the poll also found potential openings where Mr. Romney could gain support. More voters say he would be better than Mr. Obama at tackling the budget deficit — the only major issue where he had such an edge — and a majority agree with his assertions that the government is doing too much of what should be left to individuals and businesses. But Mr. Romney is facing mounting hurdles in these two critical states, which hold nearly as many electoral votes as the rest of the swing states combined. Mr. Romney’s lead among older Americans has shifted toward an advantage for Mr. Obama; his competitiveness with Mr. Obama on who would better handle the economy has dipped into slightly negative territory; more view Mr. Romney unfavorably than favorably — the opposite is true for the president — and majorities say Mr. Romney does not care about the problems of people like them. Here in Columbus, where both campaigns are advertising heavily, the sense that Mr. Romney is still failing to connect with average, working-class voters is causing concern among some supporters. At the Maranatha Baptist Church, which sits in the middle of an industrial area on the outskirts of town, the Rev. Timothy Kenoyer said that even though he believed Mr. Obama was auguring an era of “socialism” — and that an economic malaise had set into his neighborhood — he was pessimistic about Mr. Romney’s chances. “If Romney was a middle-class man, or not incredibly wealthy, that would be a contributor to a greater degree of accessibility,” Mr. Kenoyer said in an interview at his office. Accusing the mainstream news media of favoring Mr. Obama, he said he would vote for Mr. Romney, based more on the Republican Party platform. He added, “He doesn’t fire me up.” [etc. etc....]</Msg><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1348652460532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 05:41:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348652979444-7</Id><Topic><Title>Forgot</Title><Username>georgewbushisachickenhawk</Username><Timestamp>1348628252209</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 22:57:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice list.

With the S&amp;P 500 closing on Monday at 1,456, Janjuah has been forced to review his timing. “My stop loss on my risk-off ‘short S&amp;P 500’ trade, initiated on 21 August at an S&amp;P 500 level of 1425, has been triggered,” said Janjuah in a research note in which he outlined why he is still a long-term bear. “It was extremely informative to see that post the QE-infinity announcement, which drove the S&amp;P above 1,450 on the day of the Fed action on 13 September, and after an opening high of 1,475 on 14 September, the S&amp;P sold off and got down to a 1,450 low last week! And then — confirming that 1,450 was an important level, and is now a critical pivot point for the S&amp;P — mutedly bullish price action on last Friday activated the stop loss," he wrote. Given underlying concerns over growth, debt and policymakers' phlegmatic reaction to the debt crisis, Janjuah believes any upside from here will be limited to a 10 percent gain. He stands by his 800 call. “Until and unless the S&amp;P 500 index [.SPX 1441.59 --- UNCH (0) ] demonstrates a weekly close below 1,450, I believe it is premature to go aggressively short risk — tactically at least — at this precise moment,” said Janjuah, who believes that could happen with months, or even weeks. “The important message now is to accept that, in my view, risk assets are in a bubble, which of course can extend, but which can reverse sharply and suddenly. Up here, ‘valuation metrics’ are not going to help much.” Janjuah believes 10 percent to 15 percent losses for equities could come in a “heartbeat.”</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1348659013854</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 07:30:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348665776800-10</Id><Title>Why American youth so Stupid to enslave their Generation with Debt?</Title><Msg>This velly, velly good reason for not vote for Obama.

It might have been nice if Obama had pointed out that pretty much the only nations on earth where slavery still exists are Muslim nations ---- but he’s just not that into recognizing the atrocities that exist in the Muslim world. You need understand they’re victims. Obama also mentioned the upcoming 150th anniversary of Lincoln’s signature on the Emancipation Proclamation, saying that the proclamation said that “… all persons held as slaves would henceforth be forever free.” Uhhhhhhh … no. no no.

But Romney appears to be in deeper trouble in Ohio than elsewhere. Why?</Title><Msg>(CNN) -- Polls show Mitt Romney trailing President Barack Obama in just about every one of the swing states where the 2012 campaign is being waged. But Romney appears to be in deeper trouble in Ohio than elsewhere, an alarming development for Republicans who know that the candidate's White House chances begin and end with the kind of middle-class voters who reside in places such as Akron, Cincinnati and Zanesville. So why exactly is Romney trailing? Two surveys released in recent days, one from the Ohio Newspaper Association and another from The Washington Post, crystallized the challenge facing Romney as he embarks on his second straight day of campaigning in the Buckeye State. The topline numbers -- Obama led by 5 points among likely voters in the Ohio poll, and a startling 8 points in the Post poll -- only tell part of the story. Fresh polls give Obama advantage in four battleground states Romney's favorable rating is underwater. Almost two-thirds of voters approve of Obama's decision to bail out the auto industry, a staple of Ohio's manufacturing economy. The president leads Romney by a wide margin on the question of who would do more to help the middle class. Romney: My ads have been 'spot-on' Who has the 2012 campaign momentum?

Rather I refer to the fantasies that Obama employs to deal with a very real world he inhabits. The president just told Univision that you “cannot change Washington from the inside.” In other words, the president just shattered his own four-year fantasy that he, like Lincoln, would take the train from Illinois to D.C., not just to remake America, but also to change the very way things are done there. Now Obama accepts that the second coming of an Illinois savior has failed, not because he tried to change the ethics of Washington (he never did), but because upon arrival he almost immediately did in Washington what he was used to doing in Chicago. And so lobbying, insider politics to help campaign bundlers, private deals to pass health care, the revolving door, and nonstop campaigning all replaced hope and change. I suppose in place of change from the “inside,” he now envisions more “outside” executive orders like the de facto Dream Act, having the EPA shut down more coal plants, stopping more federal energy leases, granting more recess appointments, and extending more executive privilege. Shattering Glass The president’s illusions about the economy have, one by one, been exploded. Do we even remember the 2010 “summer of recovery”? Or “millions of new green jobs” that ended in Solyndra-like realties? “GM is alive, Osama bin Laden is dead” — well, sort of, in the sense that the government can take any insolvent company, inject $25 billion into it, and keep it alive until the next election.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1348667640323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:54:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348667756216-17</Id><Topic><Title>Health care premiums are rising faster under Barack Obama than during George Bush........</Title><Username>chinamanpro</Username><Timestamp>1348667127771</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:45:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>****And that heads the folks towards a single payer system that is a catastrophe.**** Is that in the Affordable Health Care bill?

LOL ============================ Democrats convened in Charlotte, NC, will double down on their claim that Bain Capital is really the Bain crime family. They will accuse Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Bain’s other “greedy” co-founders of stealing their winnings, evading taxes and lighting cigars with $100 bills on their yachts. But Bain’s private-equity executives have enriched dozens of organizations and millions of individuals in the Democratic base — including some who scream most loudly for President Obama’s re-election. Government-worker pension funds are the chief beneficiaries of Bain’s economic stewardship. New York-based Preqin uses public documents, news accounts and Freedom of Information requests to track private-equity holdings. Since 2000, Preqin reports, the following funds have entrusted some $1.56 billion to Bain: * Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund ($2.2 million) * Indiana Public Retirement System ($39.3 million) * Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System ($177.1 million) * The Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension System ($19.5 million) * Maryland State Retirement and Pension System ($117.5 million) * Public Employees’ Retirement System of Nevada ($20.3 million) * State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio ($767.3 million) * Pennsylvania State Employees’ Retirement System ($231.5 million) * Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island ($25 million) * San Diego County Employees Retirement Association ($23.5 million) * Teacher Retirement System of Texas ($122.5 million) * Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System ($15 million) These funds aggregate the savings of millions of unionized teachers, social workers, public-health personnel and first responders. Many would be startled to learn that their nest eggs are incubated by the company that Romney launched and the financiers he hired. Leading universities have also profited from Bain’s expertise. According to Infrastructure Investor, Bain Capital Ventures Fund I (launched in 2001) managed wealth for “endowments and foundations such as Columbia, Princeton and Yale universities.” According to BuyOuts magazine and S&amp;P Capital IQ, Bain’s other college clients have included Cornell, Emory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Notre Dame and the University of Pittsburgh. Preqin reports that the following schools have placed at least $424.6 million with Bain Capital between 1998 and 2008: * Purdue University ($15.9 million) * University of California ($225.7 million) * University of Michigan ($130 million) * University of Virginia ($20 million) * University of Washington ($33 million) Major, center-left foundations and cultural establishments also have seen their prospects brighten, thanks to Bain Capital. According to the aforementioned sources, such Bain clients have included the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the Doris Duke Foundation, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Ford Foundation, the Heinz Endowments and the Oprah Winfrey Foundation. Why on Earth would government-union leaders, university presidents and foundation chiefs let Bain oversee their precious assets? “The scrutiny generated by a heated election year matters less than the performance the portfolio generates to the fund,” California State Teachers’ Retirement System spokesman Ricardo Duran said in the Aug. 12 Boston Globe. CalSTRS has pumped some $1.25 billion into Bain. Since 1988, Duran says, private-equity companies like Bain have outperformed every other asset class to which CalSTRS has allocated the cash of its 856,360 largely unionized members. Is Bain really a gang of corporate buccaneers who plunder their ill-gotten gains by outsourcing, euthanizing feeble portfolio companies and giving cancer to the spouses of those whom they fired? If so, union bosses, government retirees, liberal foundations and elite universities thrive on the wages of Bain’s economic Darwinism. If, however, these institutions relish the yields that Bain Capital generates by supporting start-ups and rescuing distressed companies, 80 percent of which have prospered, then this money is honest — and Team Obama isn’t.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1348673344960</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348673839712-28</Id><Title>take an asprin Republicans</Title><Msg>and hold it between your legs until election day .</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1348673839712</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:37:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348674852908-29</Id><Title>UPGRADE TO BUY TGT 87 , BUY IT HEAVILY</Title><Msg>HUGE UPSIDE</Msg><Username>patrickstock</Username><Timestamp>1348674852908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:54:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348675733858-30</Id><Topic><Title>take an asprin Republicans</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1348673839712</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:37:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>viva viagra for DEMOROACHES</Msg><Username>mishaelena</Username><Timestamp>1348675733858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:08:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348676958401-31</Id><Topic><Title>take an asprin Republicans</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1348673839712</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:37:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>After November you will need two aspirin Harry, one to hold between your legs and the other as a suppository.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1348676958401</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:29:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348676976446-32</Id><Title>Little-known fecal transplant cures Republicans</Title><Msg>end of story</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1348676976446</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:29:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348677166629-33</Id><Topic><Title>take an asprin Republicans</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1348673839712</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:37:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can't wait to see you here on 07 Nov, you dumb and brainwashed fool.</Msg><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1348677166629</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348677448896-34</Id><Topic><Title>Socialist Chickens coming Home to roost.</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1348670239907</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 10:37:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can assure you that a lot of that lead will coming YOUR way.You'll deserve it too.</Msg><Username>lucid_luke</Username><Timestamp>1348677448896</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:37:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348677679073-35</Id><Title>Navy SEALs to Obama: We Aren't Bumps in the Road</Title><Msg>Navy SEALs are hitting back against President Obama again for his comments this week that the events in Libya, including the murder of four Americans, were "bumps in the road." Navy SEALs Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were among those brutally murdered in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya on 9/11. Former Navy SEAL Ryan Zinke, an outspoken critic of President Obama, released the following statement on his Super PAC website: The President refuses to admit that his policy of appeasement and apology has failed. The murder of our Ambassador and two former Navy SEALs is more than a “bump in the road,” it is a global catastrophe where America is seen as being weak and vulnerable by our enemies. This President has failed to establish a red line for Iran’s nuclear ambitions and has failed to recognize the scale and implications of the attacks against us. Reagan had it right: don’t negotiate with terrorists and recognize the clear and present danger of not being willing to act or lead from the front.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1348677679073</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:41:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348678595533-36</Id><Title>Jan. 1 budget 'cliff' threatens Boeing tanker</Title><Msg>One way out of a money losing contract.

The Emanicaption Proclamation did NOT free all the slaves in the (10) Confederate States. The decree only applied to the areas in the rebel states that were NOT yet under Federal troop control , after the deadline made by Lincoln to return to the Union had passed - and certain areas were excempt from the decree, such as New Orleans. By this time in the war, significant portions of the South were under Federal control. Ironically, in the areas that Federal troops controlled, slaves were not (yet) "freed" but were considered "contraband property" - strange, but true! Please address your apology for YOUR ignorance directly to our great President Obama. As an aside, human trafficing is hardly restricted to the 'Muslim' world, so, your thought that the President should be hammered because he did not specifically single them out, is disingenious, at best.

Anything less is weakness which can be exploited Most people would agree that a nuke is a suitably big stick- even if NOT used- it is a great incentivizer . . A lot of this background can be found for example in history- the ottoman empire- and in fairly recent times books like 7 pillars of wisdom - El Arenz of Arabia for example.

They've equivocated over recent days, as the himself president has begun to hedge -- finally allowing that other forces may have had a hand in the destruction. Today, national security correspondent Eli Lake has a bombshell exclusive in Newsweek/The Daily Beast that destroys the administration's official story and points to an intentional cover-up: Within 24 hours of the 9-11 anniversary attack on the United States consulate in Benghazi, U.S. intelligence agencies had strong indications al Qaeda–affiliated operatives were behind the attack, and had even pinpointed the location of one of those attackers. Three separate U.S. intelligence officials who spoke to The Daily Beast said the early information was enough to show that the attack was planned and the work of al Qaeda affiliates operating in Eastern Libya. Nonetheless, it took until late last week for the White House and the administration to formally acknowledge that the Benghazi assault was a terrorist attack. On Sunday, Obama adviser Robert Gibbs explained the evolving narrative as a function of new information coming in quickly on the attacks. "We learned more information every single day about what happened,” Gibbs said on Fox News. “Nobody wants to get to the bottom of this faster than we do.” The intelligence officials who spoke to The Daily Beast did so anonymously because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. They said U.S. intelligence agencies developed leads on four of the participants of the attacks within 24 hours of the fire fight that took place mainly at an annex near the Benghazi consulate. For one of those individuals, the U.S. agencies were able to find his location after his use of social media. “We had two kinds of intelligence on one guy,” this official said. “We believe we had enough to target him.” Another U.S. intelligence official said, “There was very good information on this in the first 24 hours. These guys have a return address. There are camps of people and a wide variety of things we could do.” A spokesman for the National Security Council declined to comment for the story. But another U.S. intelligence official said, “I can’t get into specific numbers but soon after the attack we had a pretty good beat on some individuals involved in the attack.”</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1348684949986</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 14:42:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348685166084-45</Id><Topic><Title>Socialist Chickens coming Home to roost.</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1348670239907</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 10:37:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nearly all of that lead will be self-aimed the day after the black guy is re-elected.</Msg><Username>orly_taint</Username><Timestamp>1348685166084</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 14:46:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348685323184-46</Id><Topic><Title>Dear Ruler Gets the History of Slavery Wrong</Title><Username>chinamanpro</Username><Timestamp>1348666716688</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:38:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You might as well talk to roadkill...</Msg><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1348685323184</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 14:48:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348685582932-47</Id><Title>Our Ambassador Died and Obama Lied</Title><Msg>American Youth: Obama may be enslaving us with deb, he may be a lair and his Attorney General may be corrupt but geeeez he's so cool!</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1348685582932</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 14:53:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348685870940-48</Id><Topic><Title>Bombshell Report: US Knew Benghazi Raid Was a Terrorist Attack Within 24 Hours</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1348684949986</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 14:42:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just More Evidence of Obama and His UN Ambassador Out Right Knowingly Lying to the American People!

A Failed Presidency! Household Incomes Down More than 8% Under Obama...</Title><Msg>Household Incomes Fall In Aug., Off 8.2% Under Obama By JOHN MERLINE , INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY Posted 09/25/2012 03:55 PM ET In another sign that the economic recovery under President Obama is not producing gains for average Americans, median household incomes fell 1.1% in August to $50,678, according to a report released Tuesday by Sentier Research. Since the economic recovery started in June 2009, household incomes are down 5.7%, the Sentier data show, and they are down more than 8% since Obama took office. "Even though we are technically in an economic recovery, real median annual household income is having a difficult time maintaining its present level, much less recovering," said Sentier co-founder and former Census Bureau official Gordon Green. Earlier this month, the Census Bureau released its annual report showing that the number of people in poverty was nearly 3 million higher in 2011 than in 2009, an increase of 6%. That report also found that average incomes for middle- and lower-income households fell in 2011 after adjusting for inflation. They rose only for the wealthiest 20% of households. Middle-Class Squeeze The average inflation-adjusted income for households in the middle 20% is now lower than it's been since 1995, the census report found. Meanwhile, another report released Tuesday finds that per-capita health costs jumped 4.6% last year, marking a turnaround from previous years, which had seen annual cost increases moderating. The Health Care Cost Institute report found that rising prices are a "major driver" of the cost increases. And a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released this month found that the number of uninsured climbed 1 million in the first three months of 2012 compared with last year. Food-Stamp Nation Other bad signs: The number of people on food stamps is up more than 220,000 in the first half of this year and up almost 12 million — or 34% — from June 2009 to June 2012. The number of people in the labor force has fallen more than half a million in the past two months, with the participation rate down to 63.5%, a rate not seen in the past 30 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Almost 83,000 signed up for federal disability benefits in September, and more than 736,000 have joined in the first nine months of this year, according to the Social Security Administration. That's a higher enrollment rate than the first nine months of the Obama presidency. Analysts say the higher disability enrollment rates are in part a reflection of workers' inability to find jobs.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1348688110789</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 15:35:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348688173842-54</Id><Topic><Title>Twit Rmoney, you're disgusting.</Title><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1348686308513</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 15:05:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you think capitalizing the first letter of a word makes you sound more intelligent or don't you know any better?

Ahmadinejad: Arab Spring will spread to Asia, Europe, Africa and America Fifty-five percent of small business owners and manufacturers would not have started their businesses in today’s economy, according to a new poll that also reports 69 percent say President Obama’s regulatory policies have hurt their businesses. “There is far too much uncertainty, too many burdensome regulations and too few policymakers willing to put aside their egos and fulfill their responsibilities to the American people,” said Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, which commissioned the poll along with the National Federation of Independent Businesses. “To fix this problem, we need immediate action on pro-growth tax and regulatory policies that put manufacturers in the United States in a position to compete and succeed in an ever-more competitive global economy.” The poll reports another ominous statistic for job creation: “67 percent say there is too much uncertainty in the market today to expand, grow or hire new workers.” Why? Because “President Obama’s Executive Branch and regulatory policies have hurt American small businesses and manufacturers,” according to 69 percent of the business owners surveyed. Here are the key findings in the poll, as highlighted by NAM: 67 percent say there is too much uncertainty in the market today to expand, grow or hire new workers. 69 percent of small business owners and manufacturers say President Obama’s Executive Branch and regulatory policies have hurt American small businesses and manufacturers. 55 percent say they would not start a business today given what they know now and in the current environment. 54 percent say other countries like China and India are more supportive of their small businesses and manufacturers than the United States. “Instead of smoothing the way, our government continues to erect more barriers to growth through burdensome regulations that increase costs for small businesses and all Americans,” NFIB president Dan Danner said. Those statistics suggest that even Democratic and independent small business owners criticized Obama, because only 46 percent of poll participants identified as Republicans, per Roll Call. “It’s clear that small business owners and manufacturers are becoming increasingly more frustrated by the federal government’s inability to solve America’s economic problems,” Bill McInturff, whose Public Opinion Strategies conducted the poll. “Manufacturers place most of the blame squarely on policies coming out of Washington.”</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1348688393744</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 15:39:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348688559094-57</Id><Topic><Title>Do one of you Romney clowns want to make a 10,000 dollar bet on the outcome?</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1348671959206</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:05:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mir-roguns offered to bet anyone $10 million.

Is Obama a Jesus Disciple or a Muslim? When he ran the first time he said he was Bi partisan and a Deficit cutter...but he hasn't done any of those even when his Party had control of both the House and Senate. He passed Obamacare but now he is giving Waivers to companies who supported him. I talked to some crew of the Aircraft Carrier Ronald Reagan yesterday who told me he is trying to restrict voting ballots to the military. They also told me that veteran retirees are not happy either since Obama wants to hype their Tricare premiums after the election. Obama also said for Putin to hold off on a treatee until after the election. The Bush DOJ prosecuted the Black Panthers for voter intimadation was awaiting sentensing then Obama withdrew the case and the Black Panthers were set free. Obama also claims a victory for jobs in claiming 4M jobs so far in his term but that cost American Tax Payers $800B or $700,000 a job.....makes me think He thinks Americans are stupid. This is like a bad employee who needs to get fired if it were not for all the homosexuals and 47% on Welfare and the poor kids enduring this aweful Educations system caused by these Politicians whoring themselves to Teachers Unions for vote, teaching not required.

According to fivethirtyeight: Mr. Obama has received a number of favorable polls in Ohio lately, and the most recent ones suggest that his advantage may be continuing to expand there. On Tuesday, The Washington Post published a poll showing Mr. Obama with an eight-point lead in Ohio. Then on Wednesday morning, a poll published by Quinnipiac University, The New York Times and CBS News put Mr. Obama 10 points ahead there. Mr. Obama is unlikely to win Ohio by an eight- or 10-point margin unless Mr. Romney’s electoral map has completely fallen apart. But the consensus of the data has nevertheless been quite favorable for Mr. Obama in Ohio. In three other polls since the Democratic convention that used industry-standard methodologies and called cellphones, Mr. Obama’s lead in Ohio was between five and seven percentage points.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1348691253719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 16:27:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348691322287-63</Id><Title>Romney is a piece of Crap!!</Title><Msg>lying #$%$ Mitt... pretending he cares about America!! ************************* WESTERVILLE, Ohio—Mitt Romney kicked off a day of campaigning in this battleground state by insisting his "heart aches" for struggling Americans and that he is better prepared than President Barack Obama to help those who are "hurting" under the tough economy. Speaking at a rally located in a swing district just outside Columbus, Romney kept repeating his empathy for people out of work and trying to pay their bills—insisting that he will do his "very best to help" those in need "when I am president." "I've been across this country, and my heart aches for the people I've seen," Romney told a crowd of several hundred people here. "There are so many in our country that are hurting right now. I want to help them." Relating the story of an unemployed woman he met at a rally on Tuesday, Romney insisted over and over that he has "what it takes to get the economy going again."</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1348691322287</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 16:28:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348691630839-64</Id><Topic><Title>Twit Rmoney, you're disgusting.</Title><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1348686308513</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 15:05:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the guy is a freaken twit</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1348691630839</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 16:33:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348691706794-65</Id><Topic><Title>take an asprin Republicans</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1348673839712</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:37:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>many likes</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1348691706794</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 16:35:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348693348347-66</Id><Topic><Title>47% is a reflection of Obama's performance</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1348690496171</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 16:14:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what about Congress? how many jobs did they create today?
