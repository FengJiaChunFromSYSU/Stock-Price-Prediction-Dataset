That bill board is today over Times Square. It was placed there through donations to a campaign called Rethink 9/11. In fact, that group has placed posters and signs across the world, from Australia, to Canada, from San Francisco to right here in New York City. So what is Rethink 9/11? Wouldn’t only a fringe group of people would still question 9/11? Perhaps not, because today we will tell you about new polling that shows a majority of those polled either question the official 9/11 story or don’t believe it at all. Is that possible? The first step toward truth, is to be informed. Here in New York City, today at the site of the 9/11 Memorial, promises to never forget what happened the morning of September 11th, 2001. But never forgetting doesn’t mean that you don’t rethink what you have been told.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378890227522</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 05:03:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378894369450-6</Id><Topic><Title>another past Boeing airline company customer is going all Airbus , or how another sparti bites the dust</Title><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1378858753111</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 20:19:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not to worry Wayne ... Boeing has a line of customers a mile long clamoring for its A/Ps and there are still plenty of all-Boeing operators out there. It's no coincidence that some of the most successful airlines in the world are big-time Boeing operators (e.g. Alaska Airlines, Lion Air, Ryan Air, Southwest Airlines, etc). We literally cannot build the A/Ps fast enough. In Renton, we're building 38 737NGs a month. A year from now we'll be turning out 42 a month and there are studies underway to explore the possibility of going to MUCH higher production rates. Mighty Airbus can claim a lot of things. What they can't claim is to have designed and built THE best selling commercial A/P in HISTORY. That claim goes to Boeing and the 737. Still nothing from Ethics ... You told Don all you had to do was make a phone call and it'd be a "done deal". ROFL!!! Got any more tall tales, fables or outright lies for us? We're all sitting on pin and needles waiting for more.

(NYSE:BA) had some good news to report Monday, According to Bloomberg, in an interview on Bloomberg Television, Randy Tinseth, Boeing’s vice president of marketing, reported that the plane maker was planning on shipping more than 120 aircraft carriers to China this year, a significant uptick from previous numbers. Save Time Make Money! A new stock idea each week for less than the cost of a trade. CLICK HERE for your Weekly Stock Cheat Sheets NOW! China is currently the second-largest aircraft market in the world and is forecast to take over the U.S.’s status as the world’s single biggest aircraft market sometime before 2032. Emerging markets like China are especially important to Boeing’s continuing growth, and that’s why the report saying the Chicago-based company will boost plane deliveries to Chinese customers by 50 percent this year is especially exciting. In 2012, Boeing shipped 80 carriers to the country — this time around, as mentioned before, it is ready to up that figure to 120, and that’s thanks to increasing air travel demand in China.</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1378898957705</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 07:29:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378901433891-11</Id><Topic><Title>President Peace Prize, Having Stumbled and Unable to Learn ...</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1378866491141</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 22:28:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Putin should be a clear winner of the Nobel Peace Prize when this is all over with on Syria.

It marks a wake-up call for Colorado Democrats, who are suddenly coming to the realization that they’re not invincible after all. In a session dubbed “one of the most liberal ever” by the Durango Herald‘s Joe Hanel, Democrats sprinted to the left on gun control, and virtually every other policy in the left-wing agenda. The Morse recall results are a swift kick in their proverbial nuts. A reminder to legislators that getting elected office doesn’t give you a free pass to do whatever your progressive paymasters demand of you. And, as the Morse recall demonstrates, it’s ultimately the voters who control a politician’s fate, despite the competing intentions of a fat walleted few. We speak, of course, of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has bankrolled the gun control agenda from the get-go. Even his billions can only buy so many friends…and votes.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1378908793261</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 10:13:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378910018316-20</Id><Topic><Title>More 787 electrical problems.</Title><Username>brad_welsh</Username><Timestamp>1378859869515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-09-10 20:37:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It shows the continued problems with the 787.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The gulf between the richest 1 percent and the rest of America is the widest it's been since the Roaring '20s. The very wealthiest Americans earned more than 19 percent of the country's household income last year - their biggest share since 1928, the year before the stock market crash. And the top 10 percent captured a record 48.2 percent of total earnings last year. U.S. income inequality has been growing for almost three decades. And it grew again last year, according to an analysis of Internal Revenue Service figures dating to 1913 by economists at the University of California, Berkeley, the Paris School of Economics and Oxford University. In 2012, the incomes of the top 1 percent rose nearly 20 percent compared with a 1 percent increase for the remaining 99 percent.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1378911937825</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 11:05:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378912113367-28</Id><Topic><Title>Both areas fromerly represented by recalled Giron and Morse are deep blue.</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1378908793261</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 10:13:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This will probably change the color of the State here in the next election in spite of all the filthy liberals moving in from places like California and New York.

Kerry, in an interview with MSNBC, Sept. 5, 2013 This is at least the second time since becoming secretary that Kerry has asserted that he opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq while serving as a Democratic senator from Massachusetts. The first time the Kerry made this claim, during a student forum in Ethiopia, his statement mysteriously disappeared from the official State Department transcript. On matters of consequence such as war, Kerry’s positions over the years have been rather “nuanced,” according to the Post. But the verdict is: Four Pinocchios. Many politicians have a tendency to look back at their past statements with rose-colored glasses. But given that Kerry has now twice in recent months made the claim that he opposed the war in Iraq, this is clearly not a case of a momentary slip-up. For Kerry, the uncomfortable fact remains that he voted to authorize the use of force against Iraq, he believed the intelligence that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and he said there was little choice but to launch an invasion to disarm him. Kerry may have been highly critical of Bush’s diplomatic efforts in advance of the invasion, but that is not the same thing as opposing the war when it started. It’s time for the secretary to stop making this claim. In trying to make a distinction between his vote to authorize the war and his later dismay at how it turned out, Kerry earns Four Pinocchios.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378918405535</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 12:53:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378918845415-46</Id><Title>The Democrat's Weiner Came up Short Again</Title><Msg>Will he go back to being a typical Democrat pervert.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378918845415</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 13:00:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378919201403-47</Id><Topic><Title>What Happed to all those Global Warming caused Hurricanes?</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1378914881105</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 11:54:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By Hayley Dixon 9:55AM BST 08 Sep 2013 There has been a 60 per cent INCREASE in the amount of ocean covered with ice compared to this time last year, they equivalent of almost a million square miles. In a rebound from 2012's record low an unbroken ice sheet more than half the size of Europe already stretches from the Canadian islands to Russia's northern shores, days before the annual re-freeze is even set to begin. The Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific has remained blocked by pack-ice all year, forcing some ships to change their routes. A leaked report to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) seen by the Mail on Sunday, has led some scientists to claim that the world is heading for a period of COOLING that will not end until the middle of this century. If correct, it would contradict computer forecasts of imminent catastrophic warming. The news comes several years after the BBC predicted that the arctic would be ice-free by 2013.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1378919201403</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 13:06:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378919296790-48</Id><Topic><Title>Kerry lies Again Saying He Opposed the Iraq War</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378918405535</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 12:53:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama tells so many lies he can't remember the ones he told.

The first enumerates only the evidence in favor of an attack. I’m not allowed to tell you what’s in the classified summary, but you can draw your own conclusion. On Thursday I asked the House Intelligence Committee staff whether there was any other documentation available, classified or unclassified. Their answer was “no.” The Syria chemical weapons summaries are based on several hundred underlying elements of intelligence information. The unclassified summary cites intercepted telephone calls, “social media” postings and the like, but not one of these is actually quoted or attached — not even clips from YouTube. (As to whether the classified summary is the same, I couldn’t possibly comment, but again, draw your own conclusion.) Over the last week the administration has run a full-court press on Capitol Hill, lobbying members from both parties in both houses to vote in support of its plan to attack Syria. And yet we members are supposed to accept, without question, that the proponents of a strike on Syria have accurately depicted the underlying evidence, even though the proponents refuse to show any of it to us or to the American public. In fact, even gaining access to just the classified summary involves a series of unreasonably high hurdles. We have to descend into the bowels of the Capitol Visitors Center, to a room four levels underground. Per the instructions of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, note-taking is not allowed. Once we leave, we are not permitted to discuss the classified summary with the public, the media, our constituents or even other members. Nor are we allowed to do anything to verify the validity of the information that has been provided.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1378923489923</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 14:18:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378923550023-70</Id><Topic><Title>Wheres the Evidence of Syria using WMD</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1378923489923</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 14:18:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And this is just the classified summary. It is my understanding that the House Intelligence Committee made a formal request for the underlying intelligence reports several days ago. I haven’t heard an answer yet. And frankly, I don’t expect one. Compare this lack of transparency with the administration’s treatment of the Benghazi attack. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, to her credit, made every single relevant classified e-mail, cable and intelligence report available to every member of Congress. (I know this, because I read them all.) Secretary Clinton had nothing to hide. Her successor, John Kerry, has said repeatedly that this administration isn’t trying to manipulate the intelligence reports the way that the Bush administration did to rationalize its invasion of Iraq. But by refusing to disclose the underlying data even to members of Congress, the administration is making it impossible for anyone to judge, independently, whether that statement is correct. Perhaps the edict of an earlier administration applies: “Trust, but verify.” The danger of the administration’s approach was illustrated by a widely read report last week in The Daily Caller, which claimed that the Obama administration had selectively used intelligence to justify military strikes in Syria, with one report “doctored so that it leads a reader to just the opposite conclusion reached by the original report.” The allegedly doctored report attributes the attack to the Syrian general staff. But according to The Daily Caller, “it was clear that ‘the Syrian general staff were out of their minds with panic that an unauthorized strike had been launched by the 155th Brigade in express defiance of their instructions.’ ” I don’t know who is right, the administration or The Daily Caller. But for me to make the correct decision on whether to allow an attack, I need to know. And so does the American public.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1378923550023</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 14:19:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378923588297-71</Id><Topic><Title>Wheres the Evidence of Syria using WMD</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1378923489923</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 14:18:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We have reached the point where the classified information system prevents even trusted members of Congress, who have security clearances, from learning essential facts, and then inhibits them from discussing and debating what they do know.

The two hijacked jets that were flown into the World Trade Center towers that day had taken off from Logan. Gov. Deval Patrick, who did not know in advance about the drill, calls the timing of it "dumb." But he adds that he retained confidence in the leadership of the Massachusetts Port Authority, the public agency that runs the airport. The runway fire drill, announced on the airport's Facebook page, drew harsh condemnation online. The port authority has apologized in a statement and says it "understands that it may have offended many of those touched by the events of Sept. 11."</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378926880981</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 15:14:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378927010776-89</Id><Topic><Title>CURVEBALL: WOMAN BEHIND CASE FOR SYRIA STRIKE FIRED FOR LYING</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1378926223594</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 15:03:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And yet we know nothing of Barry!</Msg><Username>dafarmer9460</Username><Timestamp>1378927010776</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 15:16:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378927874135-90</Id><Topic><Title>CURVEBALL: WOMAN BEHIND CASE FOR SYRIA STRIKE FIRED FOR LYING</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1378926223594</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 15:03:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Doesn't Obama have a Ph.D?

But first, some background. Yesterday afternoon, I offered the following analysis: Did Kerry's comments transform themselves from a gaffe into official policy in less than an hour? ... Earlier this afternoon, the Senate began debate over an authorization of force resolution that's losing steam on Capitol Hill. A third poll out today details widespread public opposition to a Syria intervention, which has only increased since the administration began its media push in favor of military action. With those political realities as a backdrop, the administration might very well lunge at this opportunity to extricate the president from his self-inflicted "red line" trap. If Assad is willing to at least make a show of turning his chemical weapons over to the "international community" at the behest of his friends in Moscow, the result would amount to a bizarre, serendipitous, and imperfect win-win: Dangerous weapons would (theoretically) be confiscated from the regime, the US could claim that our "pressure" led to this concession, an unwanted intervention would be avoided, and the "red line" conundrum would be essentially resolved. Just this morning, the White House was staring a bruising political defeat in the face. Kerry's screw-up may have provided an off-ramp. All that's left is for Obama to hail this "progress" during his interviews tonight, scrap or totally re-write his Tuesday address, and withdraw the war resolutions from Congress ... Would Harry Reid -- who invoked Hitler and Satan in arguing in favor of bombing Syria just this afternoon -- be willing to perform a complete about-face to do Obama a solid? One would expect so...I suspect Team Obama will line up behind the Kerry/Putin "breakthrough" in fairly short order, declare victory, then sprint away from Syria. Less than 24 hours later, what have we seen? With public opinion still sliding, and the Congressional whip count in disarray, (a) President Obama has hailed the gaffe-caused Russian proposal as a "breakthrough," (b) the usual suspects have begun congratulating Obama for the alleged "progress" to which he's contributed exactly nothing, (c) Harry Reid has dutifully delayed Wednesday's Senate vote on the unpopular resolution, and (d) the media is laying the groundwork for a clean pivot away from this whole mess. And what a mess it is. Here's Julia Ioffe, writing in the liberal New Republic, recapitulating the unmitigated "clusterf--k" over which Obama has presided: The Russians immediately jumped on the impromptu proposal, calling Kerry to check if he was serious before going live with their proposal to lean on Syria. An hour later, they trotted out Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Mouallem, who said he too was down with the proposal, which was a strange way to get the Syrians to finally admit they even had chemical weapons to begin with. Before long, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, the English, and the French were all on board, too. Meanwhile, back in Washington, the White House was just as surprised as anyone. Asked if this was a White House plan that Kerry had served up in London, Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken was unequivocal. "No, no, no," he said. "We literally just heard about this as you did some hours ago." While the Russians are already cutting deals and drumming up promises from the Syrians—with whom, as they've insisted for years, they have no leverage—and as the world lines up on the off-ramp, the White House was still marshalling its case for a military strike, trotting out National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and poor Tony Blinken, who was left making the case for two mutually exclusive things: "We'll talk to the Russians," he kept repeating even as he hammered on the intelligence and the need to degrade, deter, et cetera, et cetera....This, in other words, is no light at the end of the tunnel. This, to borrow a phrase from a Congressional staffer at his wits' end, "is an unmitigated clusterf*ck." Kerry's mindless musings -- upon which the Russians and Syrians instantly seized as an American offer -- don't present a workable geopolitical, military, diplomatic or humanitarian "solution" in any sense of the word. See, for instance, this analysis of how disarming the regime of every shred of its WMD programs -- in the midst of a vicious civil war -- is pretty much impossible. What the new plan does afford Barack Obama is an acceptable political escape route -- and he's eager to take it. Yesterday's spectacle developed so quickly that various elements within the administration weren't singing from the same hymnal as it unfolded. Now that everyone's in line, the faux-triumphant climb down is in full swing. Remember when the White House said the United Nations couldn't be counted on in Syria? Remember when Assad was the spawn of Hitler and Satan whose actions demanded swift punishment? Remember when Kerry's brain fart was a "major goof," rather than a stroke of genius? That's all gone. Obama's punted this back to the UN, is totally cool with a deliberate pace, and considers SatanHitler's alleged acquiescence meaningful "progress." Kerry's also now lying about how this is all playing out exactly as he intended when he devised his brilliant plan days ago (even though that's not what happened at all, according to both our State Department and the Russian foreign ministry; but then again, Kerry lies). But wait. Hold the presses. Putin is just trolling our president at this point: Guy Benson</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1378935675671</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 17:41:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378936288532-112</Id><Topic><Title>This Administration is a 3 ring circus</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1378932545516</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 16:49:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Would I be lying if I said President Obama is a liar?</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1378936288532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 17:51:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378936922920-113</Id><Topic><Title>I Never thought I'd Say it but.....Thank God for Obama</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1378911937825</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 11:05:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I never thought I'd see it....... but I think the hooze agrees with you.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1378936922920</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 18:02:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378937404926-114</Id><Topic><Title>I Never thought I'd Say it but.....Thank God for Obama</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1378911937825</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 11:05:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"while rich guys like myself who are in the top 1%" Just the 1%?

In the piece — headlined "A Plea for Caution From Russia" — Putin warned that a potential strike by the United States in Syria could unleash a new wave of terrorism, increase violence and further destabilize the Middle East and North Africa. Noting that there are "few champions of democracy in Syria," Putin urged the United States to abide by the laws of the United Nations Security Council — and not rely on what he described as a "dangerous" sense of American exceptionalism. Advertise | AdChoices "Under current international law, force is permitted only in self-defense or by the decision of the Security Council," Putin wrote. "Anything else is unacceptable under the United Nations Charter and would constitute an act of aggression." Enumerating a list of countries in which the United States has intervened militarily in the past — including Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq — Putin points out that "force has proved ineffective and pointless." "In the United States, many draw an analogy between Iraq and Syria, and ask why their government would want to repeat recent mistakes," he wrote. "Millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan 'you’re either with us or against us,'" Putin added. In Syria's case, Putin emphasized, the two-year conflict is not a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between the regime of President Bashar Assad and an assortment of "enough Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government" with the assistance of foreign weapons.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378951475663</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 22:04:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378951622384-131</Id><Topic><Title>putin just stuck it to U.S</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378951371074</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 22:02:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In Syria's case, Putin emphasized, the two-year conflict is not a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between the regime of President Bashar Assad and an assortment of "enough Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government" with the assistance of foreign weapons. The Russian president even went as far as to claim the poison gas attacks — which he does not deny took place — were at the hand of opposition forces "to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists." Of Russia's support of Assad, Putin wrote he favored a "peaceful dialogue" under the Security Council's provisions. "We are not protecting the Syrian government, but international law," he wrote, adding that any kind of military strike — even a tailored one as the Obama administration had described — would incur civilian casualties. Putin failed to mention that Russia, along with China, are often the biggest impediments to Security Council action — or that Russia's last military base outside of the former Soviet Union is located in Tartus, Syria. The Russian strongman's plea comes directly on the heels of President Barack Obama's own address to the American people. On Tuesday, Obama spoke to the country on prime-time television on Syria, announcing that he would put off a military strike and work with Russia, China and American allies to get Syria to give up its chemical weapons. Russia reshaped the Syria crisis by proposing two days ago that Syria could try to avoid an American attack by handing its chemical weapons over to international control. Putin said he welcomed Obama's interest in continuing the dialogue on Russia's proposal -- but not before he cautioned against the case of American exceptionalism he said Obama made in his Tuesday speech. "It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation," he wrote. This was not Putin’s first op-ed in the New York Times. . .</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378951622384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 22:07:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378951985652-132</Id><Topic><Title>putin just stuck it to U.S</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1378951371074</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 22:02:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lets see now its Putin ( KGB ) v Obuma-Kerry. battle of wits One side is unarmed... so who do you believe??

He post was nothing but bragging that he loves to torment RWNJs. Is that a meaningful post to you? Again you stumble over your own hypocrisy when you lecture me on meaningful posts. As for acting superior I suggest that a person who brags that he is like a cat slapping mice around is the one guilty of acting superior. I propose that a person who pretends to be Paul McCartney and royalty is the one suffering from a need to be superior. I would suggest that that a person who needs two hand fulls of IDs to give himself a bunch of thumbs up for his inane posts suffers delusions of grandeur and is ego maniacal. Hoodz deserves every bit of my contempt and everyone elses Why wouldn't I make fun of such a person? Especially when he has been doing it to others for far longer than I have You want to lecture me about taking shots at a person who has done nothing on this board for 7 years but take shots at others and pretend to be superior and judgmental. Your lack of self awarenesss and lack of awareness of Hoodz's behavior on this board over the years is so bad that you have to be blind to not see your hypocrisy when you lecture me. People like you and Hoodz are self absorbed arrogant children who never grew up yet think you have a code that the rest of us should live by. You couldn't be more FOS.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1378954738586</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 22:58:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378954943632-136</Id><Title>Im telling women they are "RACIST" if they dont have sex with me</Title><Msg>...the women who claim they are Liberal are falling for it.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378954943632</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 23:02:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>19</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378955766125-137</Id><Title>Sad...rest of World turning to Russia as the good guys</Title><Msg>...and it gives me no pleasure to say it</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1378955766125</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 23:16:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378956563046-138</Id><Title>Obama Can't Be The Worlds Policeman</Title><Msg>So the job will be outsourced to Putin.</Msg><Username>obamastamps</Username><Timestamp>1378956563046</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 23:29:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
