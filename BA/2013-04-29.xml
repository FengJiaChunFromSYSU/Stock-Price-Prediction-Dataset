The so-called "ghost money" was meant to buy influence for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) but instead fuelled corruption and empowered warlords, undermining Washington's exit strategy from Afghanistan, the newspaper quoted U.S. officials as saying. "The biggest source of corruption in Afghanistan", one American official said, "was the United States." The CIA declined to comment on the report and the U.S. State Department did not immediately comment. "We called it ‘ghost money'," Khalil Roman told the New York Times. "It came in secret and it left in secret" from 2002 until 2005. For more than a decade the cash was dropped off every month or so at the Afghan president's office, the newspaper said. Handing out cash has been standard procedure for the CIA in Afghanistan since the start of the war. The cash payments to the president's office do not appear to be subject to oversight and restrictions placed on official American aid to the country or the CIA's formal assistance programs, like financing Afghan intelligence agencies, and do not appear to violate U.S. laws, said the New York Times. There was no evidence that Karzai personally received any of the money, Afghan officials told the newspaper. Much of the money went to warlords and politicians, many with ties to the drug trade and in some cases the Taliban, the New York Times said. U.S. and Afghan officials were quoted as saying the CIA supported the same patronage networks that U.S. diplomats and law enforcement agents struggled to dismantle, leaving the government in the grip of organized crime. The country's two most powerful institutions receive billions of dollars from donors annually but struggle to reduce desertion.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1367225047730</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 04:44:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367238128219-5</Id><Topic><Title>ALAS!...

People are suckers for government propaganda. If the government tells them terrorists are a threat, they usually believe it despite the fact dying or even getting injured in a terrorist attack is at best a remote possibility. Authorities and cop shops all around the nation are gearing up for the next phase of the police state. Now that the establishment media has successfully convinced millions of Americans that al-Qaeda and Chechen immigrants are out to get them, it’s time to ramp up the Stasi police state. For instance, in Pittsburgh, the cops are encouraging folks to call 911 if they “see something.” Actually seeing something is more likely now because the new terrorists look like a lot of Americans – white people from Europe. In the old days before Boston, it was difficult to see a terrorist. Most people on the street in America don’t wear turbans. They don’t look like Muslims from the 14th century. All of that changed on April 15, 2013, though. “With the recent explosions in Boston, we are reminded once again that we must remain vigilant and aware of what is going on around us in our communities,” Allegheny County Chief of Emergency Services Alvin Henderson told CBS Pittsburgh on Friday. All of the non-stop fear mongering since the Boston Marathon has paid off in spades. There were 186 reports of “suspicious activity” the week before the Boston Marathon. There were 311 reports of suspicious activity in Allegheny County the week after the bombings, according to CBS News. No actual terrorist bombs were found, of course. People are now seeing bombs where none exist. All the fear and dread is great for Homeland Security and the military contractors busily preparing to fill the skies with drones and put up thousands and thousands of cameras and microphones on utility poles from Bangor, Maine to Escondido, California.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367240221526</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 08:57:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367240887192-8</Id><Title>Producers Flee Blue States and Head for the Freedom of Red States.</Title><Msg>Americans are migrating from less-free liberal states to more-free conservative states, where they are doing better economically, according to a new study published Thursday by George Mason University's Mercatus Center.

The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a bipartisan association of conservative state legislators, recently released its fourth edition of “Rich States, Poor States,” by the well-known Reagan economist Arthur B. Laffer, the Wall Street Journal’s Steve Moore, and Jonathan Williams of ALEC. The study looks at factors that affect state prosperity and economic outlook, such as tax burdens and population change. What’s clear is that red or red-leaning states dominate the top positions while blue states have the dubious distinction of dragging in last. In the economic outlook section, for example, the top 20 states are bright red or lean red, while eight out of the bottom 10 are very blue: New York, Vermont, California, Hawaii, New Jersey, Illinois, Oregon and Rhode Island. Most of the “poor states” states, as ALEC calls them, have the highest personal income tax rates and the largest unfunded state pension liabilities. But instead of taking the red-state approach by lowering taxes and/or cutting spending, the blue states tend to want to raise taxes even higher, just like their White House mentor. The result of their overpromising and overspending, and their knee-jerk response to solving their fiscal problems by raising taxes, is that people are increasingly fleeing the blue states. As commentator Michael Medved points out: “Between 2009 and 2010 the five biggest losers in terms of ‘residents lost to other states’ were all prominent redoubts of progressivism: California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, and New Jersey. Meanwhile, the five biggest winners in the relocation sweepstakes are all commonly identified as red states in which Republicans generally dominate local politics: Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia.”</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367241540739</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:19:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367241782542-11</Id><Title>Americans Leaving Blue States for Red; New York Least Freest State of All</Title><Msg>By John Merline | Investor's Business Daily | March 28, 2013 Americans are migrating from less-free liberal states to more-free conservative states, where they are doing better economically, according to a new study published Thursday by the George Mason University's Mercatus Center. The "Freedom in the 50 States" study measured economic and personal freedom using a wide range of criteria, including tax rates, government spending and debt, regulatory burdens, and state laws covering land use, union organizing, gun control, education choice and more. It found that the freest states tended to be conservative "red" states, while the least free were liberal "blue" states. The freest state overall, the researchers concluded, was North Dakota, followed by South Dakota, Tennessee, New Hampshire and Oklahoma. The least free state by far was New York, followed by California, New Jersey, Hawaii and Rhode Island.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367241782542</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:23:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367242010739-12</Id><Title>Democrats Still Denying Washington Has a Spending Problem</Title><Msg>In case you haven't checked lately, the U.S. National Debt has hit a whopping $16.8 trillion and is climbing higher by the second. To make matters worse, President Obama recently proposed another increase in spending for his 2014 budget. Why? He doesn't think Washingon has a spending problem and neither do many of his fellow Democrats helping to push his agenda. Call them the debt crisis dissenters. The two parties are miles apart on how to cut the deficit and national debt: Republicans want to slash spending even more. Democrats want to raise revenue. And then there are the other Democrats — the ones who reject the entire premise of the current high-stakes fiscal fight. There’s no short-term deficit problem, they say, and there isn’t even an urgent debt crisis that requires immediate attention. POLITICO suggests these "debt crisis dissenters" will actually hurt President Obama when it comes to striking a grand bargain on taxes and spending cuts, but the fact is, Obama isn't interested in real reductions in spending in exchange for tax cuts as part of a grand bargain in the first place. This is clear with his calls for $1.1 trillion in tax hikes not to pay down the deficit, but to pay for new spending. Despite near-universal support (88 percent) for spending cuts, Obama's budget increases spending significantly. Over a ten year window, it spends more than the already-unsustainable current path...by hundreds of billions of dollars -- basically matching the rate of Senate Democrats' accelerated spending. The Ryan budget calls for $41 trillion in spending over ten years. The current trajectory calls for $46 trillion. Obama's plan wants to spend $46.5 trillion over that time horizon. This includes more than $200 billion in new spending over the next two years alone, wiping out the scheduled sequester reductions, and then some. When push comes to shove, there are zero genuine deficit reductions in this budget, due to nearly $1 trillion in additional spending. There are only higher taxes to (partially) fund ever-ballooning Washington spending.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367242010739</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:26:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367242474856-13</Id><Title>Shorts always try in the Mornings to get it down but Boeing will be up later$$$$</Title><Msg>Boeing$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1367242474856</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:34:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367243012695-14</Id><Title>Second Coldest Start To Spring In US History - So Much for Global Warming</Title><Msg>According to the Real Science website the only year when the spring started colder was 1975.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367243012695</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:43:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367243419047-15</Id><Title>Russian Scientists: 'We Could Face Cooling Period For 200-250 Years'...</Title><Msg>‘We could be in for a cooling period that lasts 200-250 years.

According to scientists from the Pulkovo Observatory in St.Petersburg, solar activity is waning, so the average yearly temperature will begin to decline as well. Scientists from Britain and the US chime in saying that forecasts for global cooling are far from groundless. Some experts warn that a change in the climate may affect the ambitious projects for the exploration of the Arctic that have been launched by many countries.

The report, “Presidential Calendar: A Time-Based Analysis,” used the official White House calendar, Politico’s comprehensive presidential calendar, and media reports through March 31, 2013 to calculate its results. GAI’s findings may actually understate Obama’s recreational hours. Last year, Obama told CBS News that playing golf is “the only time that for six hours, I'm outside." But instead of six hours, GAI counted a round of golf as taking just four hours. Likewise, for presidential vacation hours, researchers attributed just six hours of any day of vacation to leisure activity.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367243814221</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:56:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367244025922-18</Id><Title>SHOCK POLL: Americans fear government more than terror...</Title><Msg>According to a pair of recent polls, for the first time since the 9/11 terrorist hijackings, Americans are more fearful their government will abuse constitutional liberties than fail to keep its citizens safe.

BA had gone up150 percent over the last 4 years, more (over 200 percent) if one had gotten in near the bottom, like many current Boeing employees do in the Savings Plan, when they dollar-cost-average, buying more stock when the price is low and less when it goes higher. I apologised for the IGZ mistake. Do you still maintain that the market "closes early" on the day before Good Friday? I made a mistake and you made a mistake. But you said the BA bottom was 55 and that is clearly way off base. I'll accept your apology. Also, I mentioned TOPS was up 34 percent on March 22th. However that was after the market had closed. So I had told this board about a stock that had gone up "at least 25 percent" after the fact. Have you ever done that on this board, I.e., mention some stock you "bought" and made a killing on? And you didn't have to tell the board about it before because you don't want to tell the board "hacks" how to make money like you do.

In an analysis of the presidential diary and newspaper reports, the Government Accountability Institute found that Mr Obama has spent 976 hours since his January 2009 election on holiday and playing golf. In contrast, he has only spent 474.4 hours in economic meetings. "As a government watchdog group, we just tabulate the numbers and let others decide how to interpret them," said Peter Schweizer, president of GAI, which compiled the report. "People understand that presidents have the most stressful job in the world and need a break from time to time. There will be some who will be encouraged by the numbers and some who will wish the president spent more time in economic meetings."</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367247361874</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:56:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367247542052-39</Id><Topic><Title>Barack Obama spends double the time playing golf than on the economy</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367247361874</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:56:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does Obama spend all his weekends in Crawford Texas playing golf just curious</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367247542052</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:59:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367247713411-40</Id><Title>SHOCK POLL: Readnecks fear government more than terror...</Title><Msg>Readnecks dont seem to be aware that the American government is elected by the American voters which includes even the readnecks themselves--- but then thats the way it is when you are a southern readneck</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367247713411</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 11:01:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367247810382-41</Id><Topic><Title>Barack Obama spends double the time playing golf than on the economy</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367247361874</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:56:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And that's a good thing.

Republicans gained 63 seats in the House, six United States Senators, six governorships, and nearly 700 seats in state legislatures nationwide. Conservatives had their temporary political revenge, we were told, but Democrats would get the last laugh because Obamacare was sure to become more popular once Republicans' scurrilous smears against the law were shown to be false. How's that working out? Democratic senators, at a caucus meeting with White House officials, expressed concerns on Thursday about how the Obama administration was carrying out the health care law they adopted three years ago. Democrats in both houses of Congress said some members of their party were getting nervous that they could pay a political price if the rollout of the law was messy or if premiums went up significantly. President Obama’s new chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, fielded questions on the issue for more than an hour at a lunch with Democratic senators. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, who is up for re-election next year, said, “We are hearing from a lot of small businesses in New Hampshire that do not know how to comply with the law.” In addition, Mrs. Shaheen said, “restaurants that employ people for about 30 hours a week are trying to figure out whether it would be in their interest to reduce the hours” of those workers, so the restaurants could avoid the law’s requirement to offer health coverage to full-time employees. The White House officials “acknowledged that these are real concerns, and that we’ve got to do more to address them,” Mrs. Shaheen said. Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on health care, said he was extremely upset with Mr. Obama’s decision to take money from public health prevention programs and use it to publicize the new law, which creates insurance marketplaces in every state. Obamacare is impossibly complicated to comply with, is impeding hiring, and is causing businesses to lay off workers and cut back on other employees' hours? Why, who could have possibly seen that coming? Oh, that's right -- every single critic of Obamacare could. And did.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1367256634732</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 13:30:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367256720270-65</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Lead the Best-Run States in America, Democrats Dominate the Worst</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367018105034</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 19:15:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republican run states are basically government subsidized shlit holes.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1367256720270</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 13:32:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367256728437-66</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Lead the Best-Run States in America, Democrats Dominate the Worst</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1367018105034</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 19:15:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jUST take a gander at the huge debt, and lousy economic situation Wisconsin was in before Gov.

Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said he told White House officials on Thursday that he was concerned about big rate increases being sought by the largest health insurer in his state. The company, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, has sought increases averaging 25 percent for individual insurance policies that will be sold in the state insurance exchange, and it is seeking increases of about 15 percent for small businesses. The company said the higher premiums reflected costs of complying with the new law. Obamacare is hiking up people's premiums? Why, who could have possibly... Katie noted last week that other Hill Democrats are nervously conceding that the, ahem, "Affordable Care Act" doesn't actually contain costs either. Shocking, I know. The Left is spooked because the law they force-fed the American people is shaping up to be a "train wreck" and a "third world experience," to quote the law's chief author and administrator, respectively. And now the more problematic elements of the president's top legislative "accomplishment" are slated to roll out next year; the supposedly popular bits were front-loaded for political reasons. (And how is that going thus far? Let's ask a bunch of people with pre-existing conditions for their verdict). Obamacare remains unpopular, and Democrats are grappling with growing fears that a 2010-style backlash may befall them in 2014, when the law they advertised as a legislative panacea is exposed as an unaffordable, unwieldy, logistical headache -- all in real time.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1367263212124</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 15:20:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367263933467-87</Id><Topic><Title>Panic: Democrats Fear Another Obamacare Backlash</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1367256634732</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 13:30:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Democrats should fear what they've done to the country, not just ObamaCare.

At least two of the companies claim no — for now — despite a report from Moody's Investors Service that predicts otherwise. Moody's claimed in the August report that because the companies have large pension obligations relative to their market capitalization, they're good candidates for selling their pension plans to annuity plans for a handsome write off. That would primarily affect current employees who were grandfathered into their pension plans before the companies switched to alternative retirement programs. Those employees would no longer accrue benefits — though they would receive all benefits owed up until the point of termination, as required by federal law. Presumably they would be eligible to participate in the companies' alternative retirement plans, like a 401(k) plan. A standard formula used by financial experts to gauge risk and compares pension obligations to market capitalization. As the theory goes, if the former is a high percentage of the latter, then the company has reason to worry. In the case of the five defense contractors named in the report, Lockheed’s obligations amounted to 125 percent of its market capitalization at the end of 2011. The obligations at the other four were 128 percent for Northrop, 108 percent for Boeing, 244 percent Exelis and 108 percent for Raytheon. Those are not terribly encouraging statistics, explaining why Moody’s predicted for the four government contractors. After the worst downturn in automotive history GM plans to purchase a group annuity contract through bankster Prudential Financial Inc. for retirees in its $33 billion pension plan, and Ford is offering 7.5 years salary before taxes for its retirees with 25+ years of service.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1367280087438</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:01:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367282857409-115</Id><Topic><Title>How to turn a Conservative into a Liberal</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367275440017</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:44:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The notion of a death panel is absurd.

The Examiner's Tim Carney witnessed the closing argument: “Every one of those babies died in utero.” That is the pillar on which abortionist Kermit Gosnell’s defense rests. Defense attorney John J. McMahon’s closing argument Monday boiled down to this: Gosnell’s supposed crimes were really just late-term abortions. The question in Gosnell’s case, McMahon said, is not “whether he was an abortion doctor,” or “is abortion bloody and ugly?” The question is whether Gosnell killed babies after they were born or while they were still in utero. One of Gosnell’s alleged victims was named Baby Boy A by the grand jury. He was so big that Gosnell allegedly joked “he could have walked me to the bus station.” “They have no case” regarding “Baby A because it was killed in utero,” McMahon said Monday. Gosnell, through the abdomen, injected a chemical called digoxin into the baby “to prevent a live birth. The was the goal of Dr. Gosnell with [the mother’s] consent: to kill the baby in utero.” Gosnell's attorney also told jurors that other measures -- such as snapping infants' necks and snipping their spinal cords -- were precautionary measures carried out on already-dead babies: One baby was delivered into a toilet at Gosnell’s clinic. A clinic worker testified “I took the fetus out of the toilet. I snapped the neck. …” McMahon argued Monday that “not one line” of testimony in that case “indicates the baby was alive at any time.” Yes, Gosnell snipped many baby’s necks after delivery — but he had killed the baby in utero hours before with a shot of digoxin, the defense argued. Of course, other lurid testimony from the trial contravenes the defense's core assertion. Nurses at the clinic have testified -- among other things -- that one baby screamed during a live-birth "abortion," and that another appeared to be "swimming" in the toilet into which it was delivered, as if he or #$%$ was "trying to get out." These are horrifying, but important, details. Dead fetuses don't make moaning noises. They don't try to escape. They don't fight to breathe while being tossed into shoeboxes and discarded. Plus, the "they were already dead" excuse doesn't explain Gosnell's macabre trophies (he stored the severed feet of his victims in jars around the office), nor does it cover the demise Gosnell's adult victim. Defense attorney John McMahon clearly recognizes these gaps in his case, which is why he closed with a rant against the "racist" prosecution. Cries of racism are especially rich, considering that Gosnell enforced a policy of de facto racial segregation at his unsanitary death mill, where white women were treated far better than women of color. But the very fact that prosecutors are forced to meet the burden of proving these infants were delivered alive simply draws attention to the baffling and unjust standards constructed by our abortion laws. If a fully-formed unborn infant is poisoned in utero, chopped to pieces, then vacuumed out of the womb, that's legally permissible. It's a textbook late-term abortion. But if that very same infant happens to be delivered alive before the lethal blow is struck, it's murder. Thus, a murder trial hinges almost exclusively on the determination of the scene of the crime. If the killings of the exact same victims took place in location X, they're santitized into a "medical procedure." But if they took place in location Y, they're felonies. According to a witness, Gosnell once offered the following assessment of one of his victims: “This baby is big enough to walk around with me or walk me to the bus stop!” But that very baby was not "big enough" to be sheltered from legalized pre-birth killing in many states. How is this ethically, medically, or morally defensible? Only the Democrat Party knows.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1367285694820</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 21:34:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367286270524-126</Id><Topic><Title>Slow growth creates debt, not the other way around</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367283075415</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:51:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooz Reich misses a few problems with his analysis.

They want what they term "sustainability" which requires a more austere standard of living and reduction in population . Next the US is facing peak population and a shift to an aging population. Therefore there are fewer productive participants to foster the growth that Reich suggests will reduce debt. For example when Social Security began paying out, there were 16 people that were paying into SS for every person collecting. Today it is 3 paying in to SS for every one collecting and soon it will drop to 2 paying into SS for every one collecting. Tell me were growth is going to come from when the % of population that is productive is shrinking and the number of people collecting SS keeps going up? Also families are not having 5 to 10 kids like they did post war. I think Reich is kidding himself in believing we can see the kind of explosive growth we once had. Recently we've had only bubble economies that are unsustainable like we've had during the tech boom and the housing market boom and we go from boom to bust. Counting on the idea that rapid systematic growth will return like the poest war heyday to reduce our debt, is a fools game.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367286270524</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 21:44:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367286416613-127</Id><Topic><Title>Ron Paul casts lot with extremists, conspiracy theorists</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367283315761</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:55:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tea Party members believe in the founding principles of this country ....such as Liberty the Bill of Rights and the Constitution...in other words everything that America stands for....wouldn't that make them MAINSTREAM and socialists like yourself the real extremists ?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367286416613</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 21:46:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367286496168-128</Id><Topic><Title>Slow growth creates debt, not the other way around</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367283075415</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:51:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simple understanding.

Are you still dllusional about there being a "Radical Right"? lol! Ron Paul has a lot of good ideas and spells out very well the destruction being done by the far left in power, but he has some notions regarding national defense that many conservatives don't buy into. And Paul is not a racist. You and the left are racists for playing the race card.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1367289189073</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 22:33:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367289305207-135</Id><Topic><Title>Ron Paul casts lot with extremists, conspiracy theorists</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367283315761</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:55:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did McVeigh become a prominent leader for any political party like Bill Ayers or get a adjunct professorship at Columbia like Kathy Boudin?
