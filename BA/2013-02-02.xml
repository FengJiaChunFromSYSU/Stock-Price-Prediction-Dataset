That leaves murky at best the pathway for getting Boeing’s most advanced jetliner airborne again." The CEO of Boeing claims that he sees no impact of the groounding on the bottom line, but he said in 2003 the 787 would fly in two months it was over two years until the 787 flew with many problems. 7-8-2003. Some airplan analysts say the grounding is a direct charge to Boeing of 5 billion dollars , most likely some place between the cool aide of Boeing CEO spin and the professional paid airplane analysts' most likely. Now that does not cover the next grounding , just this one, the entire plane is a outsourced nightmare, no rational stock holder should risk the future on this failed company outsourcing plan. Look the 747 update was 2 years late and an additional 2 billion over budget and is not selling like promissed, if Airbus gets their A380 cracking wing supports fixed then even less 747 will sell. The 787 needs over 1500 plane to break even maybe 200 and only has 800 on the books , the fact is right now this plane can not break even and can not fly Boeing stock has been at a i year loss of 1% that is called a dead cat bounce stock .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359781974743</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 00:12:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359782614949-3</Id><Title>SpaceX offers to perform engineering for Boeing</Title><Msg>SpaceX offers to perform engineering for Boeing to resolve the battery thermal issues.</Msg><Username>mcmem</Username><Timestamp>1359782614949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 00:23:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359783202295-4</Id><Topic><Title>SpaceX offers to perform engineering for Boeing</Title><Username>mcmem</Username><Timestamp>1359782614949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 00:23:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so sad paypal and a electric car company reaching out to the hollowed out Boeing company, in TA Wilsons time Boeing was a engineering company now it is a outsourcing failure company</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359783202295</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 00:33:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359783784838-5</Id><Title>The Boeing Executives should be put on the Henry Ford 5 dollar per day wage !</Title><Msg>On January 5, 1914, Henry Ford announced a minimum five dollar salary for all elegible employees working eight-hour days. It was conceived as a profit-sharing plan which would motivate Ford employees to adopt efficient and productive habits at both the factory and the home. The Ford Sociological Department was created to administer the plan by sending field agents into the community to visit workers at home to determine the quality of their home lives. It was believed that influencing the behavior of employees at home would turn them into better workers. All employees over 22 were eligible for the plan, which included a shortened work day from nine to eight hours in addition to the opportunity to earn five dollars per day. In order for a worker to be eligible to receive his share of the company's profits he "must show himself to be sober, saving, steady, industrious and must satisfy the...staff that his money will not be wasted in riotous living." Workers who didn't comply risked being payed half as much for performing the same work as their co-workers, and could eventually lose their jobs. cc Stonechiper, Condit, McNerney</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359783784838</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 00:43:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359786374704-6</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Stock is ready to go to 80? not going to happen not since 2008</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359775758770</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 22:29:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't that about the same as calling someone "foulmouther"?

And a look back at the CEO of Boeing, in 2007, W. James McNerney Jr. earned a total compensation of $12,904,478, which included a base salary of $1,800,077, a cash bonus of $4,266,500, options granted of $5,871,650, and Other $966,251 His total compensation in 2008 increased to $14,765,410, which included a base salary of $1,915,288, a cash bonus of $6,089,625, and options granted of $5,914,440 In 2009, his compensation decreased to $13,705,435, which included a base salary of $1,930,000, a cash bonus of $4,500,300, options granted of $3,136,251, stock granted of $3,136,242, and other compensation totaling $1,002,642 So far he has been wrong all the way, outsourcing did not work, 787 3.5 years late 32 billion over budget, 747 2 billion and 2 years late and the max, 777X should follow the pattern of late and over budget since the same leader is calling all the shots.

Probably not, BTW both the fire and the box and one of the battery locations are in the tail section. Depending upon how hot the fire gets the box may not be salvagable, here is the modern box "Modern day FDRs receive inputs via specific data frames from the Flight Data Acquisition Units (FDAU). They record significant flight parameters, including the control and actuator positions, engine information and time of day. There are 88 parameters required as a minimum under current U.S. federal regulations (only 29 were required until 2002), but some systems monitor many more variables. Generally each parameter is recorded a few times per second, though some units store "bursts" of data at a much higher frequency if the data begins to change quickly. Most FDRs record approximately 17–25 hours worth of data in a continuous loop. It is required by regulations that an FDR verification check (readout) is performed annually in order to verify that all mandatory parameters are recorded. This has also given rise to flight data monitoring programs, whereby flights are analyzed for optimum fuel consumption and dangerous flight crew habits. The data from the FDR is transferred, in situ, to a solid state recording device and then periodically analyzed with some of the same technology used for accident investigations. In other cases the data is downloaded from the aircraft's Quick Access Recorder (QAR), either by transfer to a portable solid state recording device or by direct upload to the operator's headquarters via radio or satellite. FDRs are usually located in the rear of the aircraft, typically in the tail. In this position, the entire front of the aircraft is expected to act as a "crush zone" to reduce the shock that reaches the recorder. Also, modern FDRs are typically double wrapped, in strong corrosion-resistant stainless steel or titanium, with high-temperature insulation inside. They are usually bright orange. They are designed to emit an underwater locator beacon for up to 30 days, and can operate immersed to a depth of up to 6,000 meters (20,000 ft)"</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359803475401</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 06:11:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359808120006-21</Id><Title>Boeing Airplane deliveries compared to Stock Market price and the DOW,S &amp;P ,NASDAQ</Title><Msg>With the Dow hitting a new break out above 14000, and Boeing being one of the Dow 30 stocks any investor should know that Boeing is a dog of the Dow for the last week and last year and the year to date the Dow is up for the year up 6.91% while Boeing is a dead cat bouce stock down on all three time periods, that should give any Boeing investor of Boeing management enabler cause to pause the spin story. So the facts all three average are up the Dow is up 6.91% year to date(one month) and over 10% for a full year while boeing, a Dow stock is down for the year to date, for one month down 2.85% and for one year down about 1% Boeing has been ina dead cat bouce place for a long time. On 1-8-2013 Boeing was a 74 and change stock today it is a 74 and change stock, nothing to own something to short, no , a stock to go long nope , it is a dead cat bouce stock. Both the other averages have made substantial gains over the Dow over the same time frames ytd one month or one year , S and P is up over 6% for the YTD and about 15% for one year. the NASDAQ is also up 5.29% YTD and up over 11% for one year. Al three averages can be purchased with a ETF that follow them less risk as diversified portfolio and far better return than Boeing stock price. and Airplan deliveries do not mean a thing. Most investors know that the 747 and the 787 are overcost by 35 billion and over 5.5 years late and not selling as hoped if you combine both product lines. The reason fro the grounding is cheap outsourcing by Chicago Management,the MD-GE plan that bankrupted MD and will in time Bankrupt Boeing. Read Hart-Smith on the caution from him a highly respected senior Boeing Engineer to Boeing managment. It said do not outsource in the bottom line and the stinking thinking was the business model in a RONA failure. This is essentially a ratio of income to assets and one way to make that ratio bigger is to reduce your assets. The drive to increase RONA thus spurred a push within Boeing to do less work in-house — hence reducing assets in the form of facilities and employees — and have others do the work. The result loss of control of the engineering of the product, loss of profits but 100% cost of any outsourced failure to produce or fly the plane and that is just what happened, except it gets worse the 787 plan is not allowed to fly. So how is that outsourcing working for the Boeign stockholder now ? I can tell you the stock was 74 dollars and change on 1-9-2013 when I opinioned that the stock was in the kill zone and institutions were selling off and now and the stock seems to still be a 74 dollar and chage stock. BTW I trade the stock chart, not the dog and pony show of Chicago, I move in and out and make money, last week as I pointed out twice I was trading a biotech that had just passed a key trial, that is like the opposite of a 787 grounding for pop news it was Keryx Biopharmaceuticals it went up 107% in one week, not hard to jump on right after the news came out and jump off for a few day trades . Apple was a great 15 year ride until Steve Jobs died, the reason the stock is going down is twofold the institutions have started to unload, based upon the MD-GE Boeing failure managment model. That means Steve Jobs took only 1 dollar per year in Executie pay and the rest in stock price appreciation. His professional replacement is taking the boeing excessive pay, benefits and retirement. Once you give any executive more than they can ever spend , the shareholders have a corporate parasite leading the company. If yo do a historical review of the CEO of Boeing he made more money the day he came to Boeing than he would ever need and at that time Boeing was doomed to failure. And that is exactly what has happened to all Boeing investors compared to better stocks like apple when Steve Jobs was alive . Teh plane delivery statistic is meaningless without the fact that al the 747 and 787 delivered are at a 35 billion dollar cost, they were budgeted for a 5-12 billion maximum cost to develop, if not for the 737 and the 777 Boeing would be bankrupt now . Sadly the GE-MD outsource plan is to update the 737 to a MAX and like the 747 the 777 is going to be Xed so we all know the 747 became a 2 billion dollar excess spending and 2 year late plane on shareholder dime when updated, guess how much extra cost and time the 737 and the 777 will cost and be late .

Goldsborough Yesterday, as the Iraq war claimed at least its 512th American victim, the public accounting for this unending conflict finally began. David Kay, the former chief weapons inspector in Iraq, announced to Congress "we were all wrong" about Iraq's so-called weapons of mass destruction. While in Britain, Lord Hutton, heading the investigation into the suicide of arms expert David Kelly, exonerated Blair of "sexing up" intelligence on Iraq, but suggested the Blair government "may have subconsciously" influenced intelligence to exaggerate the case for war. Even with Saddam Hussein in jail and Iraq occupied, this testimony is important. Public opinion was only swayed when President Bush and Prime Minister Blair warned of the imminent threat of Iraq's WMD. Such WMD, Kay made clear, simply did not exist. Whatever Saddam once had, had been destroyed. "There's a long record of being wrong," he told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Blair had claimed Iraqi WMD could be deployed to strike at Britain "within 45 minutes." The Bush administration went still further, and repeatedly: Bush said Iraq had "stockpiles" of WMD, continued to "possess and produce" them and had "dispersed rockets" with them. Vice President #$%$ Cheney claimed Iraq was "amassing WMD to use against us." Secretary of State Colin Powell said "we know Iraq has at least 7 mobile facilities to make biological weapons." Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld said, "we know where the WMD are." All of this was wrong, which is why Kay's statements have caused such upheaval. Even last week, Cheney claimed "the jury is still out" on WMD, and Powell said finding WMD was still an "open question." Kay, a frank, non-political scientist who left his job last week because the weapons search was downgraded, blamed his employer, the CIA, for mistaken information. He has called for an overhaul of the agency. At the same time, Kay made the same charge that was the focus of Britain's inquiry: that intelligence was exaggerated by the politicians. Warnings from agents about the reliability of information were dropped in order to exaggerate the threat. Caveats, said Kay, "tended to drop off as the reports would go up the food chain" inside government. "Alarm bells should have gone off when everyone believes the same thing. No one stood up and said, 'let's examine the footings for these conclusions.' " We know of the caveats dropped in one case: the CIA had warned the White House that information about an alleged Iraqi purchase of uranium from Africa was unreliable. Despite the warning, Bush used the information in last year's State of the Union message. That case bears a resemblance to the Kelly case. The name of CIA agent Valerie Plame was allegedly leaked by the Bush administration to punish her husband, Joseph Wilson, the former diplomat who revealed that the African uranium story was bogus. Like Kelly, Plame was "outed" in retaliation. So far, Bush has blocked an investigation comparable to Hutton. The Senate's inquiry has been perfunctory. In the narrower FBI investigation into the Plame affair, Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself because of his personal ties to White House aide Karl Rove, named as a possible source of the leak of Plame's name. Doubting whether the FBI can investigate a case involving the administration, a group of former CIA agents has asked Congress to take charge of the Plame investigation. The charges against Blair could have brought him down, and he claimed vindication Wednesday. Technically, he's right, for Hutton exonerated him of the charge of "sexing up" the Iraq danger and for Kelly's death. Kelly killed himself when caught in the middle of a power struggle between Blair and the BBC. Most of Hutton's blame falls on the BBC for its "sexing up" broadcast, and the network's chairman promptly resigned. But though Blair was acquitted by Hutton of a "dishonorable, duplicitous, underhand strategy" for war and survives another day, he is hurt. He was caught in a lie over the "outing" of Kelly. Exposing Kelly, a man authorized to speak on background to the media, was heartless and unethical. Hutton concluded that Kelly "did not realize the gravity of the situation he would create by discussing intelligence matters with Andrew Gilligan," the BBC's defense reporter. Hutton skated delicately around the issue of Blair's "subconscious" pressure on intelligence chiefs to tell him what he wanted to hear about Iraq's alleged WMD, but one of Hutton's witnesses was not so delicate. The most damning charge made by Blair � that Iraq could deploy WMD within 45 minutes � was strongly doubted by British intelligence (MI6) agents. In unprecedented testimony, MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove � officially known only as "C" and whose face is unknown � told Hutton telephonically from a secret location that Blair "misinterpreted" the 45-minute allegation. Asked by Hutton for clarification, Dearlove said the intelligence was meant only to refer to "battlefield" weapons, not to strategic weapons that might pose a threat to Britain. Like the British, Americans at some point will demand a complete investigation into the origins of the Iraq war. We have had investigations into wars far less contentious than this one, and owe it both to ourselves and to history. Political failures, not military or intelligence ones, are at the root of the Iraq war. The consequences of the manipulation of intelligence will not be easily corrected: America, and to a lesser extent, Britain, is bogged down in a debilitating military occupation with no end in sight. The importance of truth on Iraq is so the public can understand the consequences of Bush's pre-emptive war policy. War, which can kill millions and create burdens that last for generations, is the most serious of human endeavors. It must always be a last resort against real threats, not imagined or exaggerated ones. In Iraq, war was Bush's first resort. As Kay testified, inspections and disarmament were working. Americans have the right to know the truth and make political judgments on the basis of it.

It's more a matter of what you don't see is what you'll end up getting. Getting, as in up the you-know-what! I'm talking about getting socialism shoved up our capitalist backsides, for one thing. It's simple: We are about to go over the so-called fiscal cliff. Why? Because Congress can't figure out how to stop spending money it doesn't have. Forget the whole revenue side of the equation. It's only part of the mix of fixes, and the only fix that matters ain't fixed. Stop spending money you don't have and you don't have to tax people more to pay for a bunch of #$%$ they don't need, don't want, and don't even know they're getting. Oh, that would be because on top of what we are getting there's even more that we're not getting. Congress' paymasters are getting pork and beans for whatever they want because that's how our Congress gets elected, by greasing the wheels of insiders to get taxpayer money for their private purses, enough to plentifully pay for campaigns. But that's only the "private" side of spending. The spending scheme has mushroomed by expanding (and paying sickeningly outrageous wages and benefits) an ever-growing number of government workers. And by expanding entitlements beyond what we are entitled to. And by expanding welfare and "social programs." Yes, I am including 99 weeks of unemployment, and accompanying food stamps, and free money for unwed mothers to have more kids so they can collect more free money, and free day care, and all the other free stuff that ain't free if someone (that's you and me) is paying for it. All that spending creates a class of people, a voting class. And, guess what they vote for? Duh, that would be more free stuff. So what's this got to do with the Fed? I'm glad you asked... Just Like Magic Because Congress wants to glad-hand out these freebies, the private ones and the public ones, to get votes and all the personal wealth that comes with their political positions. And they do not want to take away anything with the other hand (that would be raise taxes to pay for their spending), so they wink at the Federal Reserve, and lo and behold the Fed prints the money to pay for it all. It's just like magic. No, it is magic. Congress spends and doesn't have the money to pay up. So it borrows. It borrows from the Fed, people! If there was no Fed to print money and give it to Congress, the crooks on the Hill wouldn't get away with what they take for granted as their political right, which is to spend money they don't have to pay us to keep them in office. Yesterday, the Fed stripped off its cloak of invisibility and said they were going to keep easing (how low can rates go?). In fact, they are going to step up their Treasury bond buying spree. Our government doesn't have any money, but needs billions everyday, so the Fed simply winks at them, they issue debt in the form of bonds, and the Fed buys them all up. Revenue problem solved! So under what authority does the Fed operate? How do they have the right to print money and pay for stuff that Congress didn't get permission from the public for (because they didn't come to us and ask if they could raise taxes on us to spend money on what they think is good for themselves)? Oh, that right was given to them... by Congress. Back in 1977 Congress gave the Fed a "dual mandate." They said, besides your job to "maintain price stability and preserve the currency as a store of value," we now want you to "promote effectively the goal of maximum employment." And just like that (it actually started back in 1946, but that's another story for another time) the Fourth Branch of Government was officially sanctified. Screw the Public, Feed the Banks The Fed says we're going to keep the printing presses running to fund Congress' schemes (what fiscal cliff?) until unemployment is 6.5%, or inflation is above 2.5%, or until all the banks in America that control us and Congress tell us to stop because they have enough profits to buy more politicians and relax more rules and fund their next gigantic scam. What the Fed calls more "transparency" in articulating their new monetary policy guidance schemes is nothing more than tearing off one cloak of invisibility only to find another underneath. Which unemployment measure are they going to look at? How are they going to interpret U6, or how many people are counted or not counted in the ranks of people in the job market? Does the birth/death model need to be looked at, or ignored? Targeting unemployment is their way of saying there's not going to be enough money for banks to get really fat again if spending is cut back, or if taxes rise, so we're going to do what we do, which is screw the public and feed the banks. About that inflation in our future, we'll worry about it when we get there. About that preserving the currency thing, we'll worry about it when we get there. The Fed only cares that its puppet masters (that would be the big banks and maybe all the banks) have enough money to lend (to the government) to collect their interest to enslave the population into paying them back by socializing America to keep them fat. You see, in capitalism, the banks would be allowed to fail. And fail they would. But in a socialist world, failure is not an option.

Next look at a stock chart, and do a comparison with Boeing short and long term. Here are the numbers. BA stock price change for 5 days minus .21%, WNR up 16.9%, for one year Boeing stock price down .47% ,that is called a dead cat bounce stock, WNR for one year up over 100%, as you can guess Boeing is not good, for longer periods of time. But WNR for three years is up 719% and the stock price reasonable only 35 dollars. Now is the product going to be in demand, yes! Is there any delay or over budget on WNR product, none in fact WNR just cut its costs of production. While Boeing is 33 billion over expected budget and over 3.5 years late on their best hope for a future success the 787, oh and grounded and a SPEEA strike to look forward to this month and a pension cost of 1.5 billion dollars . This is a report that a Boeing enabler can read, a retired Boeing person can write, it is a report that a angry failed person can read, it does not matter the facts are there and they are correct. Pick your stocks with a stock chart, otherwise your picking your stocks with your opinion not the facts. There are a lot of haters on the Boeing message board who are called the rapid response Boeing Mismanagememt team, they jump on users with personal attacks and make false claims against any user who is willing to state the facts. These tactics do not work, but they try like a failed company stock price (Boeing) going no place . the Dow the NASDAQ and the S and P are all up . For the Boeing Management Enablers, why would any stock market investor want Boeing stock? It has been in a 5 year dead cat bounce from a little over 80 to 55 dollars and no movement. The news is terrible, the 787 is the first grounding of a plane not caused by a crash and killing of passengers. This is terrible public relations news and a huge public black eye for this cheap outsourced failure due 100% to outsourcing. Read Hart-Smith’s report to management, Mr Hart Smith was a senior Boeing Engineer He said, outsourcing a complex product will lead to bankruptcy like it is with the current group of Boeing Management employee’s. There is a business model that proves this fact, Hart-Smith was there, it was the MD classic study on another airplane manufacturing company bankruptcy. Too bad the current CEO of Boeing a Harvard graduate was already out of school as it is a required reading at the Harvard MBA Business School now. On stock picking, Apple was great until Steve Jobs died, 15 years of buy and hold, now Apple is being run by a professional CEO parasite like with Boeing. A parasite is a top employee who takes excessive pay up front , retirement , bonus and perks while the stock goes no place or down. Steve Jobs took 1 dollar per year and let his management make all his money in stock price appreciation.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359838663072</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:57:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359839733406-60</Id><Topic><Title>BOEING SHOULD REMOVE THE WINGS OF THE 787 AND THEY WILL HAVE A PLASTIC BUS READY FOR SALE</Title><Username>communicator_777</Username><Timestamp>1359832246774</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:10:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're unfair, really unfair!

Where and when is the $150 dollar price you opinion about then ? and BTW in 100 years Boeing has never been a 150 dollar stock and if you stratch it for a very brief time was a very low 100 dollar stock in much better days.

Lost in this “debate” aired on the Pentagon’s favorite psy op platform, CNN, is the real reason the founders considered the Second Amendment the cornerstone of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights – a nation well-armed makes it more difficult for statist control freaks to impose their tyrannical designs on the people. It’s also an issue of political sovereignty. “I believe that individual citizens are sovereign, not because of a grant of authority by the state, but because of a grant of authority by God,” writes Gary North. “The state therefore does not have the right to confiscate the firearms of the people, precisely because the state did not make the original grant of sovereignty to the people.” I’m sure CNN’s false left-right paradigm stand-ups David Frum and Roland Martin would be outraged over the self-evident truth that you have an unalienable right to own a firearm and defend yourself not only against the criminals Mr. Frum insists do not exist but also the government</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359847514943</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 18:25:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359849242119-81</Id><Title>Boeing Pension obligations, the CEO pension and the workers pensions a comparison, and stock price</Title><Msg>The Pension Obligations For Boeing a stock In The Dow Jones First, I would look at the extent of the shortfall, I would make my own earnings projections to determine whether it's possible for the company to grow its way out of the way pension problems. So how about Boeing as of 2012 Boeing pension obligations are 68 billion and instead of keeping current for years on the pension funding Boeing paid excessive pay, bonus and pensions at 100% to only the top executives . While the Boeing stock price is down or flat for a year , the 787 is grounded and the SPEEA union will most likely strike to get what they bargained for in the past on pensions , Boeing needs to put in 1.5 billion to fund the pensions this year. How is Boeing doing for the top executives? So how to make sure your executive has no incentive to make any money for the shareholders pay him too much money that he keeps no matter what happens to the investors.”. Boeing's ability to promote its pension offer was further undermined by the compensation package awarded to McNerney when he left 3M to take over as Boeing CEO in July. McNerney will receive $72 million if he stays at Boeing until 2011. Done ! Most galling to average workers is the $22 million in retirement benefits due to McNerney Now Boeing wants to change the pension for the SPEEA workers , while the CEO gets no cutback. And CEO pay Boeing wants to give the SPEEA grop maybe a minimal pay increase , while the CEO how is he doing on pay ! CEO Jim McNerney's compensation jumped 34 percent last year as the board of the big airplane maker rewarded him for delivering the new 787 , delivering should be flying without being grounded for 4 years . So how is that 34% reward working for Boeing shareholder now ? How about using the Boeing shareholders plane for personal use,? Boeing also spent $324,504 so McNerney could use the company jet for personal travel, and $47,039 for personal use of ground transportation. It also paid for his home security and tax preparation, does Boeing pay for rank and file workers tax return and for their home security ? Sure seem to be a king not a employee retirement deal , the shareholders have lost money on Boeing stock for the year down 1% while all the major averages are up 10 to 15 %.

It appears to me that they can not meet the 100% fire-free safety requirements needed for the 787 with their current time constraint (near zero), and will have to switch to an alternative battery. Perhaps they have planned for this. The composite article below seems to indicate that Boeing will not have an easy time solving their battery problems, or convincing others that they are truly safe. In the end, they likey will have to replace this lithium battery with another type, probably non-lithium. BA will be interesting to follow, because it is so critical to the USA's place in the aerospace world, and, when they resolve this problem, should be a solid investment. So far, in this rally, the stock has held up, but we have sold our position.--Lou --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Boeing Lithium-Ion Battery Problems Investigators also are delving into Boeing’s supply chain. The National Transportation Safety Board said Friday that it would send an investigator to France to test a part that connects the battery to the plane’s wiring. In all types of battery design, safety is a top priority, lithium-ion batteries contain safety devices to prevent overheating, but if contaminants enter during production, the safety systems will fail. That's why the planes have been grounded. Not only did the batteries overheat, their redundant safety systems didn't kick in. Besides the battery, this connector is the fourth component to come under scrutiny in the jet’s innovative electrical system. Investigators have also inspected the plants that made the battery charger and a controller unit, which are both in Arizona, as well as a facility that makes the battery’s monitoring unit in Japan. The battery itself, using a volatile lithium-cobalt chemistry, is made by GS Yuasa in Japan. In releasing an update on Friday, the board said it was still testing the battery that ignited on a Japan Airlines 787 while parked at Boston’s Logan International Airport on Jan. 7. Another 787, owned by All Nippon, made an emergency landing in Japan on Jan. 16 after the pilots received warnings of a battery problem and smelled smoke. Electric cars have had their share of public battery missteps--most notably when the Chevy Volt and Fisker Karma extended-range electric vehicles were found to catch fire under certain circumstances, prompting investigations. Under high temperatures, lithium-ion batteries can ignite or explode. If one cell short-circuits and overheats, it's possible for the heat to spread and affect other cells. But, before making a connection between Boeing's battery issues and passenger EVs, it's worth noting that the Dreamliner's lithium-ion batteries use different cathode materials than the batteries found on most electric cars. According to Green Car Reports, the cobalt oxide (CoO2) battery chemistry found on the Dreamliner "has the highest energy content, but it is also the most susceptible to overheating that can produce 'thermal events' (which is to say, fires)." The report goes on to note that the only other electric car to use cobalt oxide battery chemistry is the Tesla Roadster, which is no longer for sale. Boeing's battery problem can be traced back to 2005, when Dreamliner engineering stages were still ongoing. At the time, only lithium-ion cells made of cobalt oxide (CoO2) were deemed air-worthy. Since then, the FAA has approved additional cathodes, including the safer lithium iron phosphate compound (LiFePO4). LiFePO4 batteries are being used by some EV manufacturers like Chinese automaker BYD, who claim their Fe batteries offer "excellent safety performance" because of the material. Using cobalt oxide (CoO2) as a cathode material has begun to fall out of favor, as lithium iron phosphate, nickel, manganese and other metals have been found to be safer, although cannot offer the same capacity.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1359851779120</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 19:36:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359852456536-83</Id><Topic><Title>BOEING SHOULD REMOVE THE WINGS OF THE 787 AND THEY WILL HAVE A PLASTIC BUS READY FOR SALE</Title><Username>communicator_777</Username><Timestamp>1359832246774</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:10:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You made me laugh, thanks.</Msg><Username>copyright_member</Username><Timestamp>1359852456536</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 19:47:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359852670478-84</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing will fix the 787</Title><Username>barbing1965</Username><Timestamp>1359843042009</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 17:10:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Try NWBO and IMUC.

Did you know that the increase in the number of Americans "not in the labor force" during Barack Obama's first four years in the White House was more than three times greater than the increase in the number of Americans "not in the labor force" during the entire decade of the 1980s? The mainstream media would have us believe that 157,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy in January. Based on that news, the Dow broke the 14,000 barrier for the first time since October 2007. But if you actually look at the "non-seasonally adjusted" numbers, the number of Americans with a job actually decreased by 1,446,000 between December and January. But nowhere in the mainstream media did you hear that the U.S. economy lost more than 1.4 million jobs between December and January. It is amazing the things that you can find out when you actually take the time to look at the hard numbers instead of just listening to the media spin. Back in 2007, more than 146 million Americans were employed. Today, only 141.6 million Americans are employed even though our population has grown steadily since then. When the government and the media tell you that we are in a "recovery" and that unemployment is lower than it was a couple of years ago, I encourage you to dig deeper. The truth is that even the government's own numbers tell us that the percentage of the U.S. labor force that is employed continues to fall and that the U.S. economy is heading into a recession. The Obama administration and the media have been lying to you about unemployment and about the true condition of our economy. After you see the numbers that I have compiled in this article, I think that you will agree with me. First of all, let's take a look at the percentage of the civilian labor force that has been employed over the past several years. These numbers come directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As you can see, this is a number that has been steadily falling since 2006... 2006: 63.1 2007: 63.0 2008: 62.2 2009: 59.3 2010: 58.5 2011: 58.4 In January, only 57.9 percent of the civilian labor force was employed. Do the numbers above represent a positive trend or a negative trend? Even a 2nd grader could answer that question. So how in the world can the Obama administration and the mainstream media claim that the employment picture is getting better and that we are in a "recovery"? But most Americans believe what they are told. It is almost as if we are in some kind of a "matrix" where reality is defined by the corporate-controlled propaganda that is relentlessly pumped into our brains. The only way that the government has been able to show a declining unemployment rate is by dumping massive numbers of Americans into the "not in the labor force" category. Just check out how the number of Americans "not in the labor force" has absolutely skyrocketed in recent years... 2006: 77,387,000 2007: 78,743,000 2008: 79,501,000 2009: 81,659,000 2010: 83,941,000 2011: 86,001,000 In January, there were supposedly 89,868,000 Americans that were at least 16 years of age that were not in the labor force. That number has risen by more than 8 million since Barack Obama first entered the White House, and that is highly unusual, because the number of Americans "not in the labor force" only increased by 2,518,000 during the entire decade of the 1980s. You sure can get the numbers to look more "favorable" if you pretend that millions upon millions of American workers simply "don't want a job" any longer. The truth is that if the labor force participation rate was at the same level it was at when Barack Obama was first elected, the official unemployment rate would be well above 10 percent. But that wouldn't do at all, would it? 7.9 percent sounds so much nicer. And of course even if you do have a job that does not mean that you are doing okay. If you can believe it, in America today 41 percent of all workers make $20,000 a year or less. To me, that is a mind blowing statistic. It would be incredibly challenging for anyone to live on $20,000 a year, much less try to support a family. If you live in Washington D.C. or New York City and you have a "good job" working for the establishment, you may not realize it, but there are tens of millions of American families that are really hurting out there. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 146 million Americans are either "poor" or "low income" at this point, and most of those people actually do have jobs. For much more on the "working poor" in the United States, please see my previous article entitled "35 Statistics About The Working Poor In America That Will Blow Your Mind". If something is not done, the middle class will continue to disappear and poverty in America will continue to explode. In a previous article, I noted that during Obama's first term, the number of Americans on food stamps increased by an average of about 11,000 per day. How bad do things have to get before people realize that we are living through a nightmare? Sadly, most Americans still have faith in the system. Most Americans are still convinced that our politicians will somehow find a way to turn things around. Most Americans will gather around their television sets this weekend and watch the Super Bowl and laugh at all the funny commercials without even thinking about how America is literally falling apart all around them. But there is one group of Americans that is acutely aware of how bad things have really gotten. Small businesses have traditionally been the primary engine of job growth in this country, but right now small business owners all over the nation are facing a tremendous crisis. Millions of small businesses are on the verge of extinction, and yet our politicians just continue to pile on more taxes, more rules and more regulations. A recent Gallup poll found that 61 percent of all small business owners in America are "worried about the potential cost of healthcare", and that an astounding 30 percent of all small business owners in America are not hiring and fear that they will go out of business within the next 12 months. In a previous article entitled "We Are Witnessing The Death Of Small Business In America", I detailed how small businesses in America are being systematically wiped out. Small businesses are dying all around us, and the number of new small businesses continues to decline. According to economist Tim Kane, the following is how the decline in the number of startup jobs per one thousand Americans breaks down by presidential administration... Bush Sr.: 11.3 Clinton: 11.2 Bush Jr.: 10.8 Obama: 7.8 Is that a good trend or a bad trend? All of this is so simple that even the family pet should be able to figure it out, and yet most Americans seem oblivious to all of this. They just keep gobbling up the mainstream media propaganda and they just continue to go out and wildly spend money. It is almost as if we didn't learn any lessons from 2008. Even while household spending in Europe has moderated, household spending in the United States continues to soar. Just check out the chart in this article. And guess what? The infamous "no money down mortgages" are back. If we wait long enough, perhaps "interest only mortgages" will make a comeback as well. Unfortunately, I am afraid that time is running out. we have been living in the biggest debt bubble in the history of the world, and it is only a matter of time until it bursts. 2008 was just a "hiccup" compared to what is coming. Our politicians and the Federal Reserve were able to keep the house of cards from completely crashing down back then, but they are not going to be able to avert the economic horror show that is rapidly approaching. I hope that you are getting prepared. Back in 2008, millions of Americans suddenly lost their jobs, and because many of them did not have any savings, many of them suddenly lost their homes. One of the most important things that you can do to prepare for the coming crisis is to build up an emergency fund. If things suddenly go bad, you don't want to lose your house and everything that you have always worked for. In addition, anything that you can do to become more self-sufficient and more independent of the system is a good thing, because the system is failing. The years ahead are going to be much more chaotic than what we are experiencing right now, and when the next crisis strikes you will be very thankful for the time and the energy that you put into preparing. So what are all of you seeing in your own areas? Are businesses shutting down? Are people having a hard time finding good jobs?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359853877570</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 20:11:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359853879045-89</Id><Topic><Title>i Noticed - America is doing Great !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359835486461</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:04:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Obama could just get rid of all the Republicans he could assume total control.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1359853879045</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 20:11:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359853932926-90</Id><Topic><Title>i Noticed - America is doing Great !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359835486461</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:04:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And THAT would be outstanding and healthy ?...for Obama to assume TOTAL control ?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359853932926</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 20:12:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359854136788-91</Id><Topic><Title>The Federal Reserve's Magic Act is Destroying America</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359834214066</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:43:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which is ITSELF an AdHominem.

Rieder, president Pacific NW Labor History Association Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, had interesting words and thoughts about labor. It seems to me that most of his thoughts on labor tend to fall to the portside of political discourse — at least way to the left of our contemporary Republican party. Given that these words are more than 15 decades old, you must forgive the narrow gender view. These quotes attributed to Lincoln are taken from “Great Labor Quotations” by Peter Bollen, Red Eye Press, c 2000. “If a man tells you he loves America, yet hates labor, he is a liar!” “There is no America without labor, and to fleece the one is to rob the other.” Makes me think of our serf-like service industries. “I know the trials and woes of working men and I have always felt for them. I know that in almost every case of strikes, the men have a just cause for complaint.” (To a delegation from the blacksmiths’ union, 1863) “Thank God we have a system of labor where there can be a strike. Whatever the pressure, there is a point where the working man may stop.” (From a Hartford, Conn., speech March 6, 1860.) “Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration.” (To Congress, Dec. 3, 1861) Personally, I can’t image these words coming from a Democrat, much less a Republican. And finally, this message, though its language is a little archaic: “No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty, none less inclined to take or touch ought which they have not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them, till all liberty shall be lost.“ (To Congress, Dec. 3, 1861) Lincoln was someone for whom I, for one, could cast my vote.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1359856826256</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 21:00:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359857414211-98</Id><Topic><Title>September Morn: 9-11 movie with Woody Harrleson and Ed Asner refutes official verion</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359855430162</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 20:37:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right - Left...its all propaganda going down the picket line...9-11 was a pretext to start taking your rights away...Bush took care of the 4th amendment...Obama is taking care of the rest...including the second amendment</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359857414211</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 21:10:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359857803105-99</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing will fix the 787</Title><Username>barbing1965</Username><Timestamp>1359843042009</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 17:10:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wayne, better check the BA "Historical Prices" around Jan, Feb 1966.
