On ABC’s “This Week,” Boehner said he agrees with President Obama that there is no immediate crisis concerning the country’s debt. Boehner told ABC’s Martha Raddatz: We do not have an immediate debt crisis. But we all know that we have one looming. And we have-- one looming-- because we have entitlement programs that are not sustainable in their current form. They're gonna go bankrupt. Washington has responsibility-- to our seniors and our near seniors-- that we firm up these programs so that they're there for the long term. Because if we don't do it, not only will they not get benefits, we will have a debt crisis right around the corner. We have time to solve our problems. But we need to do it now. Later, on “Face the Nation,” Paul Ryan agreed, even boasting that the United States is handling debt better than European countries and has a “resilient economy.” Then he admitted to CBS’s Bob Schieffer: We do not have a debt crisis right now, but we see it coming. We know it’s irrefutably happening. And the point we’re trying to make with this budget is let’s get ahead of this problem. Meanwhile, the Republican Party continues to push through a budget that emphasizes cuts to the so-called “entitlement” programs. Ryan’s proposed budget would cut more than $4 trillion from the federal budget — bringing government spending to the lowest levels since 1948. And it’s balanced mostly on the backs of the poor, as he proposed to slash Medicare, Medicaid and other social welfare programs like food stamps. His plan would also repeal Obamacare. Overall, 66 percent of his proposed budget cuts would be cuts to those with low and middle incomes.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1363624081947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:28:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363624157468-69</Id><Title>I love it when I wake up in the morning and Obama is President !</Title><Msg>better than any Republican !</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1363624157468</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:29:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363624391650-70</Id><Topic><Title>I love it when I wake up in the morning and Obama is President !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1363624157468</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:29:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we know sparty....maobowa claus for able bodied n mentally confused</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363624391650</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:33:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363624430268-71</Id><Title>Contract votes due today</Title><Msg>From Newswires: Ballots from the 7,500 technical engineers are due to be counted in Seattle Monday evening, with results expected around 10 pm Pacific Time (01:00 a.m. EDT).</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1363624430268</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:33:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363624469332-72</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans: There's No Debt Crisis, We Just Want to Screw the Poor</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1363624081947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:28:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>life according to maobowans</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363624469332</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:34:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363624692891-73</Id><Title>RBC raises BA price target to $94 (from $84)</Title><Msg>NEW YORK (AP) -- An RBC Capital Markets analyst raised his price target on Boeing Monday, saying the airplane builder should benefit from a new version of its 777. Analyst Robert Stallard wrote that Boeing stock has been stuck in the $70s for three years and has finally broken above $80. He said he thinks investors have been looking for companies that will benefit from a broader business upturn but have missed out on the recent run-up in stock prices. Boeing fits those criteria, he wrote. Stallard wrote that Boeing shares have risen "despite well-known 787 issues." Boeing's 787 has been grounded for two months while it works on a fix for smoldering batteries, including a fire on one parked plane. Stallard wrote that his estimates assume a six-month delay, "and we think investors have similar expectations." Boeing has also said that it is close to a decision about whether to pursue an upgraded version of its 777. Boeing shares fell 86 cents to $85.57 in afternoon trading. It was around $75 as recently as Feb. 25. Stallard's new price target is $94, up from $84.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1363624692891</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:38:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363624884862-74</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans: There's No Debt Crisis, We Just Want to Screw the Poor</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1363624081947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:28:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HAHAHAHA Another ECON 101 deficit liberal dimbulb.

In America, we've prided ourselves on abandoning those privileges of class some 237 years ago, following that little uprising in the 13 colonies. And we again congratulated ourselves at 12:01 pm Eastern Time on January 20, 2009, just moments after Barack Obama was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States and as he committed to making his administration the most transparent and open in history. But more than four years later it is time to ask questions. The most transparent administration ever? The most transparently political, yes. The most open government? If you have the money to buy access, yes. Since last weekend, Mr and Mrs Regular Citizen have been denied the access people used to be granted to tour the White House, purportedly because of the clampdown on federal spending since the "sequester" that imposed cuts across the board. These tours, most recently guided by volunteers though monitored by paid Secret Service staff, have been an American tradition since John and Abigail Adams, the first White House residents, personally hosted receptions for the public. And their cancellation is an austerity measure that saves a pittance, while more frivolous taxpayer funding for items like the White House dog walker continues. Meanwhile, noble Americans can buy time with the president for a suggested donation of $500,000 to his new campaign group, Organising for Action. Yes, the announcement offering access to the president for cold, hard cash was made openly and with total transparency. But it was also made without shame.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1363627426578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:23:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363627867041-85</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes 500 Rich List Acquiring BA Shares!</Title><Username>james.tingle</Username><Timestamp>1362414215788</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:23:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very helpful report !!</Msg><Username>parker.diana</Username><Timestamp>1363627867041</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:31:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363627873978-86</Id><Title>cramer says sell</Title><Msg>Time to back up the truck!</Msg><Username>sdietrich</Username><Timestamp>1363627873978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:31:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363628021139-87</Id><Topic><Title>BA Insider Trading Reported !!!</Title><Username>doris.shealey</Username><Timestamp>1361811207875</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 11:53:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very helpful report !!</Msg><Username>parker.diana</Username><Timestamp>1363628021139</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:33:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363628043766-88</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's White House 'open to rich, closed to poor'...</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1363627426578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:23:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"GOP has got to learn how to lie" ROTFLMAO!</Msg><Username>instant_karma48</Username><Timestamp>1363628043766</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:34:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363628326316-89</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's White House 'open to rich, closed to poor'...</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1363627426578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:23:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Democracy only works with a well informed electorate.

Sounds a bit like an ultimatum addressed to FAA. The Boeing executives sought to allay fliers' fears about the 787 by repeatedly stressing their commitment to safety. They said it would take too long to figure out what had specifically caused the problems but that a new design of the battery would ensure 787s are safe." The first time, in testing, that it burned down a Building.... There would have been no continuing problem when the plane was finally delivered.... It would have been fixed years and months before) It would have been taken apart piece by piece AND FIXED... To not stop the fires but rather containing them in a metal box....Is so Second Rate...it is unimaginable... They could switch to traditional batteries but that would be logical and when was the last time Boeing was logical? Honestly, I don't know why people are investing their money into the stock of this company. I sure do not want to fly in a 787 until they adopt a tried and true battery system (perhaps non-lithium) that doesn't catch fire. So you can contain a fire, Note to self: Check airline reservations for scheduled aircraft and bump if 787...

But U.S. proxies weren’t down nearly as much as international bourses – or as initially indicated. Related: Why Cyprus Is a Bigger Deal Than You Think In fact, U.S. stocks might be solidly in the green now if it weren’t for another development that bears watching: Weakness in financials. Monday's slide is also being attributed to Cyprus, which has revived fears of "contagion" emanating from Europe and the related counterparty risk faced by banks. But bank stocks were under pressure before the Cyprus "bail in" hit the headlines. Starting late Thursday, the financials had a really bad weekend when a Senate report found JPMorgan had misled regulators (and investors) in its disclosures surrounding the now infamous London Whale trade. Related: 'London Whale' Isn't Dead Yet: JPMorgan Is Out of Control, Rosner Says The bank’s disclosures “were incomplete, contained numerous inaccuracies, and misinformed investors, regulators and the public” said Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), chairman of the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The 300-page report was just an appetizer for Friday’s hearing, when JPMorgan executives were grilled under oath and former CFO Douglas Braunstein essentially admitted the bank kept regulators in the dark about its mounting losses. “Things went terribly wrong,” testified Ina Drew, who ran the firm’s Chief Investment Office before stepping down under pressure after the London Whale losses first surfaced last spring. The Senate report and subsequent testimony could expose JPMorgan to additional litigation risk, which is a problem for a number of big banks these days.

But state lottery officials say the origin of the new name has nothing to do with sex. “The benefit of buying this ticket is that it’s quick, easy and fun,” Gerry Reid, director of the Maine Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations, told the paper. “That’s what an instant ticket is.” The state lottery sells the instant tickets—priced between $1 and $20—at about 1,300 retail stores, generating about $30 million a year for the state's general fund. The newspaper interviewed a cashier who said he tested the new name by asking customers if they would like a Kwikie. “I tried that on a couple of women," Tom Borden, a cashier at Fox Brook Variety in Dover-Foxcroft, said.

A British forensic archaeologist has unearthed fresh evidence to prove the existence of mass graves at the #$%$ death camp Treblinka - scuppering the claims of Holocaust deniers who say it was merely a transit camp. Some 800,000 Jews were killed at the site, in north east Poland, during the Second World War but a lack of physical evidence in the area has been exploited by Holocaust deniers. Forensic archaeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls has now undertaken the first co-ordinated scientific attempt to locate the graves.

Why the delay? If anything of substance would have been found, like mass graves as in the Alex Bay essay – an impossibility since Treblinka was a transit camp and will remain so.........until the mass graves are found – we would be able to marvel at them daily in some form or another. Will there now be an announcement that, ahem, restorations need to be done at Treblinka, so more Kitsch can be added, making real investigations impossible? And when this is done, the CSC report will be released, neat signs planted in the locations she has identified as, horror, mass graves. The only reasonable explanation for the delay, we have had the same happen at Belzec with Sobibor no doubt to follow, as soon as Haimi is done. That this is an inside job is a given. I too became suspicious when I learned that CSC had dug up some Jewish artifacts and then showed an interest in Treblinka. To remove all doubts and to quiet Revisionists, why not invite one and all to investigate? After all, Treblinka was “obviously” a extermination camp, or so we are ordered to believe. But there will never be a real investigation, the Industry knows that there is nothing there to suggest that it was anything other than a transit camp. Thus the snow job, and as long as the sheeple fall for it, and they do, why not continue?</Msg><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1363649511515</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 19:31:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363649640207-153</Id><Topic><Title>Radical left and radical right all controlled by Israel and Mossad.</Title><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1362682592889</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 13:56:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why Colls is waiting until 2017 to release her thesis is a good question.

The technical unit split with engineers represented by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace in the Feb. 19 vote. The 15,500 engineers approved a new four-year contract, even though the union had recommended rejection over the pension issue. Chicago-based Boeing left its "best and final" contract offer on the table for the technical workers and urged approval. It has said a switch away from pensions is vital to the company's competitiveness. "It is time for all of us to come together and focus on the challenges facing the company," Boeing said in its message to workers on the contract. The union bargaining unit made no recommendation on how members should vote the second time. It said Boeing was unwilling to make any improvements because the contract had been narrowly rejected in the first vote.
