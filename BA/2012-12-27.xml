Despite the rising revenues and profits over the last 7-8 quarters, the stock has hardly climbed up. It seems like the investors are not impressed with the production capabilities of the company. The company's revenues are recorded on the basis of contract accounting. Therefore, the production rate holds massive importance for the company. Moreover, approximately 40% of the cash is paid by the final customer after the plane is delivered, the production rate is also important for the cash flows of the company. The market perceives that the company has been unable to expand its production facilities to match a rise in the demand for commercial aircrafts. Therefore, , the investors are concerned about the company and its huge failure on the 787 and 747, both planes were over budget and late , 787-3 years late and 30 billion over the expected budget no profit on BEP until 2021, 9 years away) and the 747 2 years late and 2 billion over the expected budget . So each 787 delivered actually cost the shareholder 116 million loss. That is bad even worse the SPEEA union strike will cost the shareholders 250 million per each day of the strike. Too bad changing BA to BAC would have made any Boeing investor 108% gain this year to date while BA gets any investor only 3.64% gain . DJIA is up almost 8% the Boeing company lags by over 4% with the cutbacks in military and the excessive executive employment costs stay away from Boeing or be at a loss to the overall market.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1356594147004</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 02:42:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356594715086-11</Id><Topic><Title>What We need is a fiscal-cliff</Title><Username>republicanfascists</Username><Timestamp>1356586604949</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 00:36:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what retroactive provisions...</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1356594715086</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 02:51:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356599045971-12</Id><Topic><Title>Ho Ho Ho 9-11 was an Inside Job</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356548594224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 14:03:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh oh oh Orly Orly Orly...

Bloomberg: “The NRA's Washington leadership has long been out of step with its members, and never has that been so apparent as this morning. Their press conference was a shameful evasion of the crisis facing our country. Instead of offering solutions to a problem they have helped create, they offered a paranoid, dystopian vision of a more dangerous and violent America where everyone is armed and no place is safe. Leadership is about taking responsibility, especially in times of crisis. Today the NRA's lobbyists blamed everyone but themselves for the crisis of gun violence. While they promote armed guards, they continue to oppose the most basic and common sense steps we can take to save lives - not only in schools, but in our movie theaters, malls, and streets. Enough. As a country, we must rise above special interest politics. Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns. That's why 74 percent of NRA members support common sense restrictions like criminal background checks for anyone buying a gun. It is time for Americans who care about the Second Amendment and reasonable gun restrictions to join together to work with the President and Congress to stop the gun violence in this country. Demand a plan.”</Msg><Username>proud_2bn_atheist</Username><Timestamp>1356605829001</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 05:57:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356607735767-18</Id><Topic><Title>A SANE Mayor:</Title><Username>proud_2bn_atheist</Username><Timestamp>1356605829001</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 05:57:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you proud to be a Communist?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1356607735767</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 06:28:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356608679342-19</Id><Topic><Title>A SANE Mayor:</Title><Username>proud_2bn_atheist</Username><Timestamp>1356605829001</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 05:57:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you calling Mayor Bloomberg a Communist?

It pushes the idea that government can pick and choose which rights codified in the Bill of Rights it wishes to recognize or discard on any given day. This delusion is predicated on the concept that if a popular majority can be emotionally whipped into a frenzy over one particular right, then that right can simply be discarded and stricken from the Bill of Rights. But no such power exists to discard any portion of the Bill of Rights, at least not without proper ratification by three-fourths of the fifty states. There is no such power found solely in the federal government. There is no such power placed solely in the executive branch, nor in Congress, nor in the White House. The Bill of Rights describes a set of individual rights and liberties which are not granted by government, but recognized as DIVINE rights given to use by our Creator. Because government never granted the rights in the first place, it has no authority to take them away. “The Framers of the Bill of Rights did not purport to “create” rights. Rather, they designed the Bill of Rights to prohibit our Government from infringing rights and liberties presumed to be preexisting.” – William J Brennan Jr. The individual liberties described in the Bill of Rights cannot be infringed, nor deleted, nor overridden by popular opinion… not even loudly screamed opinion. America is not a nation ruled by the tyranny of the mob. It isn’t even a democracy — it’s a republic, where certain inalienable rights describe the protection of each individual, even if that individual is the lone voice of sanity in a majority gone mad. The Bill of Rights protects individuals from the tyranny of mob rule — a phenomenon that routinely rears its head in any society where historical illiteracy is rampant and the masses are lulled into a state of complacency by charismatic but dishonest leaders. It was the extended amendments attached to the Bill of Rights that outlawed slavery, guaranteeing individual freedom to those of African descent even in a time and place when the majority of voting citizens believed slavery was socially acceptable. And it was the Second Amendment that put firearms into the hands of those recently-freed slaves, ensuring that they could defend themselves against attackers of any color through the powerful expression of armed defense (aided by the laws of physics and certain materials from the table of elements, notably lead). Another amendment beyond the Bill of Rights granted women equal voting rights in an age when the majority believed women should not be allowed to vote. It was the Bill of Rights that decriminalized prohibition, ending a dark era of mass criminalization of everyday citizens who suffered under the oppression of government law enforcement gone bad. Yet today, incredibly, many African-Americans and women are actively assaulting the very document that first secured their own freedoms. They now wish to take their freedom and power and use it to enslave someone else by revoking other people’s rights under the Bill of Rights. This is the ultimate social betrayal, and it is a powerful demonstration of the principle that those who do not respect freedom for others do not deserve it for themselves.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356618383866</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:26:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356618442711-37</Id><Title>Liberal policies, all for the greater good</Title><Msg>Yeh, Right.

Its protections are not subject to the whims of majority opinion, nor the screaming demands of hyperventilating media personalities. All the social media trolls and opinion writers in the world can comment all they want on the Second Amendment, yet the individual right to keep and bear arms remains immutable. Just like the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment is not negotiable. No Governor, Senator or President has any power whatsoever to banish the Second Amendment, and any who attempt to oppose it only brand themselves as criminal traitors to the United States of America. Any active effort to eradicate the Second Amendment outside of law — without going through the proper process of state ratification for Constitutional amendments — is, by definition, an act of sedition against the United States of America and its people. Ironically, many who viciously attack the Second Amendment do so by invoking their free speech protections under the First Amendment. Yet they seem blind to the realization that the First Amendment itself is only made possible by the Second Amendment which balances power between the People and the government, ensuring that the individual right to bear arms serves as a check and balance against the monopoly of violence every government inherently seeks. Disarmament of the populace is always the first step to depriving them of their civil rights and human rights. Without the right to bear arms, there is no right to free speech, no right to due process, no right to trial by jury and certainly no right to be secured against unreasonable search and seizure. A government with a monopoly of force is a government that respects no boundaries and honors no limits. Grasping this point requires competent thinking, which is why so many who now flourish in America on the popularity of pop culture idiocy fail to understand it. It is intellectually lazy to blame gun rights for violence, requiring no depth of thought or reason. Only someone of higher awareness and possessing the aptitude for multi-layered thinking can realize the critical importance of distributed firepower in stopping government violence against the People. As Ron Paul recently said, “Government security is just another kind of violence.” Ron Paul gets it. He understands that an imbalance of power in the hands of government inevitably leads to mass violence waged against the People. Those who are currently screaming for the population to be disarmed do not realize that in seeking to prevent one kind of violence (school shootings), they are unleashing a far more disastrous and horrifying violence by allowing the government to monopolize physical power over the citizens. This is a mistake that has been repeated throughout history, often at the cost of tens of millions of destroyed lives.

That’s why it is the second highest amendment, right after the right of free speech, indicating its crucial priority in the enumeration of sacred rights that must be protected at all costs. The Bill of Rights does not require your endorsement The validity of the Bill of Rights does not require your endorsement. In fact, it encourages tolerance of those with whom you disagree. If you do not believe in the freedom of speech for those with whom you disagree, then you do not believe in it at all (a derivation of a quote from Noam Chomsky). If you do not believe in freedom of speech, then you do not believe in the Bill of Rights. And if you do not believe in the Bill of Rights, then you are not, at heart, an American. You are something else, something less evolved. Something archaic and outmoded. The Bill of Rights is the single most important milestone in the history of civilized society because it lays out, with near perfection, the divine principle of INDIVIDUAL rights and liberties that come directly from the Creator rather than from a “King” — also known as a dictator. “To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.” – Theodore Roosevelt Ratified in 1791, the Bill of Rights lifted human civilization out of the tar sands of tyranny and into the enlightenment of liberty. It was divinely inspired and stands eternal as the key milestone of human compassion, justice and equality. To oppose the Bill of Rights is to oppose human progress. That’s why the Bill of Rights is the single most progressive document that has ever been recognized by any nation. “If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter.” – George Washington Why the Bill of Rights extends through all time and innovation Importantly, the rights described in the Bill of Rights extend through all time and cover all innovations and technological advances. It was not written to cover only those things that existed in 1791, but rather to serve as a template of liberty encompassing innovation, advancement and all future expressions of those rights, regardless of what devices or technologies may come into existence. The Right to Free Speech, for example, does not merely protect speech written on scrolls or rolled out of a Gutenberg press. It covers all expressions of free speech, including speech expressed through devices that did not exist in the late 1700′s: e-books, websites, blogs, television programs, bumper stickers and more. This very website, Natural News is a pure expression of the First Amendment. It would seem foolish and wrongheaded to argue that the First Amendment only applied to the printing press of the day and not to modern-day websites or e-books, yet that is exactly what many misguided people argue today when they say the Second Amendment only applies to “Muskets and bayonets.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356618542967</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:29:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356618567239-40</Id><Topic><Title>The Bill of Rights is not negotiable – SHARE this urgent declaration</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356618383866</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:26:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Second Amendment guarantees your right to keep and bear the firearms of your time.

Those who oppose the Bill of Rights are enemies of America Some misguided, if not treasonous, U.S. Senators, lawmakers and public servants in the executive branch of government currently suffer under the dangerous misconception that the Bill of Rights only exists because they allow it to. They foolishly believe that they can selectively pick and choose which rights to nullify via new legislation or by the stroke of an executive pen. This delusion is not merely wrong-headed and arrogant, it poses a grave threat to the Republic and all its future generations. Enemies of the Bill of Rights are enemies of America. Whether those enemies be found in the media, in Congress, in the Oval Office or on the streets of America, they are unworthy of being called “Americans” at all. Those who despise liberty do not deserve liberty. Those who deliberately and maliciously attack the Bill of Rights do not deserve the protections of the Bill of Rights. Those who despise the Constitution and its Bill of Rights are publicly indicating they would prefer to live as subjects, not Citizens. I propose that any who attempt to denounce Bill of Rights protections for others must first surrender their own rights and freedoms. Do not speak of taking away my Second Amendment rights while you enjoy the protections of the First Amendment. Surrender all your rights and freedoms first, because only then have you achieved the necessary moral consistency from which you can demand others be deprived of their rights. Relocate to North Korea, in other words, and become a subject of Kim Jong-un and then continue your assaults of the Bill of Rights as a Korean gulag blogger. Because only then will you know how much you have lost, and how much you should have valued the liberties you so carelessly abandoned. The Bill of Rights is not negotiable.

"If we're going to insure all Americans, which is a worthy and appropriate cause, then somebody has to pay for it," Bertolini said of the expected premium increases under Obamacare. Bertolini said that insurance premiums could double in some places just on the basis of what types of policies people buy today. Anticipating a criticism, Bertolini said that higher premiums wouldn't mean higher profit margins for insurance companies. The reason is that it will actually be more expensive to insure people due to some of the Obamacare mandates. During the Obamacare debates, the Congressional Budget Office projected that premiums would rise due to the legislation, though not to the extent that Bertolini has now predicted. The CBO found that premium differences might roughly stay the same - may go up, may go down - in the group (employer-sponsored) markets, while seeing a fairly significant (10-13%) rise for the individual markets. While this doesn't seem like a particularly big deal, one of the facets of Obamacare is that it might cause employer dumping into the individual market, where people will see these increased premiums. The CBO's analysis is not iron-clad, obviously, but it's very valuable as a way to put statements like Bertolini's into context. It's very likely that insurance premiums are going to rise system-wide. It's just a question of how much.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1356625506301</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:25:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356625596318-71</Id><Title>Aetna CEO: Obamacare Could Double Insurance Premiums</Title><Msg>We knew that.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1356625596318</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:26:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356625682818-72</Id><Topic><Title>Can Government Elitists Really Spnd Your Money Better Than you Can???</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1356622267332</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 10:31:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Genna....not a very popular figure on this board</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356625682818</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:28:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356625878178-73</Id><Topic><Title>Everything Is Negotiable, spartacus...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1356623109534</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 10:45:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Case has NEVER been settled on Eligiblity Dik, only on "standing" The Worlds greatest forensic experts all say its a not only a forgery but a REAL BAD ONE AT THAT.

"Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education.

Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.

The slavery in the Bible was not based exclusively on race. People were not enslaved because of their nationality or the color of their skin. In Bible times, slavery was more a matter of social status. People sold themselves as slaves when they could not pay their debts or provide for their families. In New Testament times, sometimes doctors, lawyers, and even politicians were slaves of someone else. Some people actually chose to be slaves so as to have all their needs provided for by their masters. The slavery of the past few centuries was often based exclusively on skin color. In the United States, many black people were considered slaves because of their nationality; many slave owners truly believed black people to be inferior human beings. The Bible most definitely does condemn race-based slavery. Consider the slavery the Hebrews experienced when they were in Egypt. The Hebrews were slaves, not by choice, but because they were Hebrews (Exodus 13:14). The plagues God poured out on Egypt demonstrate how God feels about racial slavery (Exodus 7-11). So, yes, the Bible does condemn some forms of slavery. At the same time, the Bible does seem to allow for other forms. The key issue is that the slavery the Bible allowed for in no way resembled the racial slavery that plagued our world in the past few centuries. In addition, both the Old and New Testaments condemn the practice of “man-stealing” which is what happened in Africa in the 19th century. Africans were rounded up by slave-hunters, who sold them to slave-traders, who brought them to the New World to work on plantations and farms. This practice is abhorrent to God. In fact, the penalty for such a crime in the Mosaic Law was death: “Anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be put to death” (Exodus 21:16). Similarly, in the New Testament, slave-traders are listed among those who are “ungodly and sinful” and are in the same category as those who kill their fathers or mothers, murderers, adulterers and perverts, and liars and perjurers (1 Timothy 1:8-10). Another crucial point is that the purpose of the Bible is to point the way to salvation, not to reform society. The Bible often approaches issues from the inside out. If a person experiences the love, mercy, and grace of God by receiving His salvation, God will reform his soul, changing the way he thinks and acts. A person who has experienced God’s gift of salvation and freedom from the slavery of sin, as God reforms his soul, will realize that enslaving another human being is wrong. A person who has truly experienced God’s grace will in turn be gracious towards others. That would be the Bible’s prescription for ending slavery.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356626797038</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:46:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356626864076-77</Id><Topic><Title>The Pophet of Profits tacking South</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1356560822974</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 17:27:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good point.......when every thing heads south there will be people waiting to pick up the pieces for pennies on the dollar.......the pennies will be needed for the survival of those desperate people who laughed at those who prepared.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1356626864076</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:47:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356626889603-78</Id><Topic><Title>CNN's Piers Morgan calls for Amendment to the Bible</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356619466121</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:44:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Old Testament condones slavery.

The number of private or "non state" workers rose 23 percent in 2012, while state sector employment dropped 5.7 percent, according to a report from Economy Minister Adel Yzquierdo Rodriguez. The unemployment rate grew to a record 3.8 percent, not including Cubans who did not seek work. The wide-ranging year-end report to the National Assembly, which met in Havana last week, indicated the government is quietly making progress toward its goal of moving toward a more market-oriented economy while maintaining the socialist system in place the last half century. Just a few years ago, the state employed more than 85 percent of Cuba's labor force, but that is changing as the government battles heavy indebtedness, economic stagnation, poor retail services and pilfering. The report said the government cut 228,000 public jobs in 2012, on top of the previously announced 137,000 in 2011, closing in on its goal to slash 20 percent, or nearly a million jobs, from its bloated payrolls, by 2016. At the same time, the number of private, or "non-state" workers as Cuba calls them, rose to 1.1 million jobs, double the number reported two years ago. The majority of the non-state workers, or about 610,000, were farmers, whose numbers have grown under Castro's agricultural reforms, which include leasing state lands to individuals. The goal is to stimulate local food production and cut the need for budget-draining food imports. The rest of the non-state workers are mostly in small retail businesses or self-employed such as carpenters, seamstresses, photographers and taxi drivers. RUNNING THEIR OWN BUSINESS The cash-strapped state is closing thousands of its small retail outlets such as barbershops and cafeterias, notorious for economic inefficiency and employee theft, and offering to lease the premises to employees or others interested in running their own business. Starting in 2013 the state plans to turn more than 200 medium-sized businesses, from shrimp breeding and produce markets to construction and light manufacturing, into private cooperatives. The experiment will be expanded if successful. Yzquierdo reported that unemployment was a record 3.8 percent in 2012, or a bit more than 250,000 out of a potential labor force of 6.8 million people. He admitted that the figure did not include a million Cubans who he said "did not actively seek employment." Cubans often complain that the communist island, with its wide-ranging social benefits, is a place where too many live off the dole, a situation Castro has complained about in a number of speeches and vowed to change. "Our state cannot and should not continue maintaining companies, productive entities, services and budgeted sectors with bloated payrolls (and) losses that hurt the economy, are counterproductive and form bad work habits," a trade union federation statement said in 2010, when plans were first announced to push state employees into the "non-state" sector. Many of those without jobs still enjoy free health care, education, subsidized food ration and other government services while also dealing in Cuba's vast black market, engaging in minor business activity and trading on the margins of the law. Clara, a 36-year-old Havana resident, was laid off two years ago from her job as a secretary for a state-run security company, given one month's pay, another month of unemployment benefits and then left to fend for herself. Instead of looking for another job, she decided to do manicures and hair styling, working under the radar without getting the small-business license required by the state. Clara said she charged 24 pesos (1 dollar) for a manicure and about the same for hair styling, and brought home maybe 500 pesos, or about $20 per week. That is considerably more than the $15 a month she earned with the government, but not enough to get legal.

Scripture does reveal that slavery is not ideal, both in Old Testament laws forbidding the enslavement of fellow Israelites, the law of jubilee, and in New Testament applications of Christ. In fact, the Bible teaches that the feeling of superiority in general is sin (Philippians 2:1-8)! The abolition of slavery is thus not only permissible by biblical standards, but demanded by biblical principles. The pre-fall statement that should guide and ultimately abolish such (and any) practices of superiority is the declaration that all humans—men and women—are made in the image of God. On this principle, the Bible even lays the foundation for progressing far beyond what was possible in New Testament times by addressing the very economic discrimination and favouritism of which slavery is the worst expression (James 2:1-9; 5:1-6). Of course, lamentably, it must be admitted that the Church has taken many centuries to live out what Scripture taught long ago, and no doubt we continue to drag our feet. The time delay between the Word of Scripture and its implementation in society is often due to the “holy huddle” mentality prevailing among Christians who are largely unconcerned about issues outside of their immediate periphery. Another reason many Christians continue to remain silent in the face of injustice is the platonic view of the cosmos we have adopted, implying that life in the hereafter is the only issue to be addressed, while we watch the world go by in its destructive way. Both mentalities are sadly misguided.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356655632434</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 19:47:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356655753164-138</Id><Topic><Title>CNN's Piers Morgan calls for Amendment to the Bible</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356619466121</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:44:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker, to him who is but a potsherd among the potsherds on the ground.

Gerbil, Let me help you with the facts. There are about 5000 Greek copies of the New Testament writings in existence today, copies made within 100 years of the original writings, and they are 99.5% consistent. Copies that are about 1900 years old. What we have today is what was written back in the first 100 years after Jesus was born. The Old Testament was written in Hebrew. The Dead Sea scrolls affirmed the accuracy of the Old Testament original writings. The King James version is very accurate and is extensively in use today by those that care about God's Word. But it has some archaic English idioms of the 1600’s – which are difficult for some to understand today. If you care to educate yourself on the Bible and the accuracy of translations, search for "biblos" (comparisons on translations) and "CARM" (manuscripts).

I was going to post something similar to Spart's post. This is a tough subject. I think that we sometimes forget that we look at history through a filter on these things. Who here really understands what God “thinks” about slavery? Hooz quotes a verse that blithely iterates the manner by which slavery would be managed. Step back for one moment. Slavery across the known world was common practice for thousands of years. And even in Jesus’ day. Right or wrong. The slaves which the Israelites held were (mostly) people from Canaan that were otherwise condemned to die by God for their gross sinfulness. They were conquered and would have been driven out into the desert or killed. The fact that they were not killed was due to disobedience to God on the part of the Jews. God had not intended that the Canaanites be slaves, but be killed. Now, we can intone some sort of hypothetical righteousness, but the fact remains that what America implemented as slavery was specifically prohibited in the Bible – going into another country and taking slaves back into your land. And this country has suffered judgment as a result, I believe. Taking on slaves to manage human suffering, no matter how cruel sounding, may be viewed (by today's standards) as far better than abject slaughter.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1356658268530</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 20:31:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356659150620-147</Id><Topic><Title>Mahatma Ghandi's Quote concerning Gun Control</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356654640028</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 19:30:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump it</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356659150620</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 20:45:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356659161652-148</Id><Topic><Title>We're saturated in guns</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1356656532498</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 20:02:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will follow Wu's lead as he's so deeply concerned about babies dying.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1356659161652</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 20:46:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356659649385-149</Id><Topic><Title>We're saturated in guns</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1356656532498</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 20:02:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wu - with the help of God you should call for a ban on assault weapons killing aborted babies.

Finally, after weeks of delay, the Senate will start debate on the dangerous FISA Amendments Act at 10 am Eastern and vote on its re-authorization by the end of the day. The FISA Amendments Act is the broad domestic spying bill passed in 2008 in the wake of the warrantless wiretapping scandal. It expires at the end of the year and some in Congress wanted to re-authorize it without a minute of debate. The good news is—thanks for your phone calls, emails, and tweets—Congress will now be forced to debate it, which means we can affect its outcome. In case you forget just how dangerous the FISA Amendments Act is to your privacy, here’s how we described it last week: The FISA Amendments Act continues to be controversial; key portions of it were challenged in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court this term. In brief, the law allows the government to get secret FISA court orders—orders that do not require probable cause like regular warrants—for any emails or phone calls going to and from overseas. The communications only have to deal with “foreign intelligence information,” a broad term that can mean virtually anything. And one secret FISA order can be issued against groups or categories of people—potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of Americans at once. Any Senator who wants to stay true to the Constitution should vote no on its re-authorization, but in the alternative, there are four common sense amendments up for debate tomorrow that would go a long-way in curbing the law’s worst abuses. The Wyden Oversight and Transparency Amendments Sen. Ron Wyden, one of the most ardent defenders of civil liberties in the Senate, has been asking the NSA for months for information on how the FISA Amendments Act has impacted Americans. The NSA has so far refused, yet, as the New York Times reported in 2009, we know the NSA was still intercepting domestic communications in a “significant and systematic” way. We also know the secret FISA court ruled, on at least one occasion, that the government had violated the Fourth Amendment when conducting surveillance under the FAA. Yet the NSA has rather unbelievably claimed releasing the number of Americans whose privacy has been violated would violate those same Americans’ privacy. Ron Wyden’s amendment would force the NSA to come clean and give a general estimate of how many Americans have been affected by this unconstitutional bill, and finally give us information Americans deserve. In addition, another Wyden amendment would clarify that the acquisition of American communications is prohibited without a warrant. Sen. Wyden has accused the government of conducting “backdoor searches,” whereby the government collects communications of foreign individuals talking to Americans, but later goes back into the government’s database of intercepted communications and reviews the Americans’ comunications. Sen. Wyden hopes this clarification to the law will help guard against further intrusive spying on American communications. The Rand Paul Fourth Amendment Amendment Republican Senator Rand Paul has commendably been one of the few voices unequivocally denouncing the FISA Amendments Act as a violation of the Fourth Amendment. To that end, Sen. Paul will be introducing “the Fourth Amendment Protection Act” which will re-iterate that all US communications, whether sought by US intelligence agencies like the NSA or any government agency, are protected against unwarranted searches and seizures—even if they are held by third party email providers like Google.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356663583050</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 21:59:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356664018130-163</Id><Topic><Title>Why We Should All Care About Today’s Senate Vote on the Warrantless Domestic Spying Bill</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356663583050</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 21:59:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why should we ever care what you, the board whackjob, thinks?</Msg><Username>freedumber</Username><Timestamp>1356664018130</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 22:06:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356664085086-164</Id><Topic><Title>WHY is President Barry giving Assault Weapons to Al-Qaeda (Confirmed)?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356049251554</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 19:20:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Embrace the Horror...we have a Government giving guns to AlQaeda, run by the CIA to use as a proxy Army in Syria and Libya....and the AlQaeda flag flies atop Bengazi.

But despite his self-righteous zeal, one of his body guards was arrested for something Moore and the anti-gun fanatics support – government firearms registration. From Fox News back in January, 2005: Filmmaker Michael Moore’s bodyguard was arrested for carrying an unlicensed weapon in New York’s JFK airport Wednesday night. Police took Patrick Burke, who says Moore employs him, into custody after he declared he was carrying a firearm at a ticket counter. Burke is licensed to carry a firearm in Florida and California, but not in New York. Burke was taken to Queens central booking and could potentially be charged with a felony for the incident. Moore’s 2003 Oscar-winning film “Bowling for Columbine” criticizes what Moore calls America’s “culture of fear” and its obsession with guns.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356664264977</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 22:11:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356664378155-167</Id><Topic><Title>Why We Should All Care About Today’s Senate Vote on the Warrantless Domestic Spying Bill</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356663583050</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 21:59:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Continued from the Top ! The Merkley FISA Court Amendment Both in 2010 and 2011, Obama administration officials promised to work to declassify secret FISA court opinions that contained “important rulings of law.” These opinions would shed light on whether and how Americans’ communications have been illegally spied on. Since then, the administration has refused to declassify a single opinion, even though the administration admitted in July that the FISA court ruled that collection done under the FAA had violated the Fourth Amendment rights of an unknown number of Americans on at least one occasion. Starting with the precept that “secret law is inconsistent with democratic governance,” Sen. Jeff Merkley’s amendment would force the government to release any FISA court opinions that contain significant interpretations of the FISA Amendments Act so the American public can know how it may or may not be used against them. The Leahy Sunset Amendment About the only good part in the original FISA Amendments Act was the provision that stated it would expire after four years so Congress could fully debate its use and abuse before reauthorizing, if reauthorization was even necessary. Unfortunately, Congress has been resisting the debate, and the new bill would extend the FAA for five more years. That means the law would not sunset again until President Obama is out of office. Senator Leahy’s amendment would shorten the law’s length to three years. While any extension of a law that results in unconstitional spying is unacceptable, the shorter the re-authorization, the better. Please use Free Press' call-in tool to talk to your Senator's office on the phone or use EFF's action center to email your Senators. Tell them to vote for these privacy-friendly amendments and to vote no on warrantless domestic spying.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356664378155</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 22:12:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356664469219-168</Id><Topic><Title>WHY is President Barry giving Assault Weapons to Al-Qaeda (Confirmed)?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356049251554</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 19:20:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think we just now figured out an important link.
