Whether Democrats like it or not, this issue concerns the Constitution. To begin with, whether Democrats like it or not, this issue concerns the Constitution -- where stuff was written down for a reason. That's not to say that expanding background checks or banning "assault rifles" would be unconstitutional (though you may believe they both should be). It's to say that when you begin meddling with protections explicitly laid out in the founding document, a 60-vote threshold that slows down stampeding legislators is the least we deserve. The Founding Fathers worried that "some common impulse of passion" might lead many to subvert the rights of the few. It's a rational fear, one that is played out endlessly. Obama, who understands how to utilize public passion better than most, flew some of the Newtown families to Washington for a rally, imploring Americans to put "politics" aside and stop engaging in "political stunts." This is, by any measure, a preposterous assertion coming from a politician piggybacking tragic events for political gain. It would have been one thing, I suppose, if the gun control legislation written in the aftershock of a gruesome massacre had anything to do with the topic at hand. But what senators came up with would have done nothing to stop the shooter in Newtown -- or the one in Aurora, Colo. Passions can be aggravated by events, but in this case, events have little to do with the policy at hand.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1366348347831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 01:12:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366350714158-3</Id><Topic><Title>Yeah sdmiller4747 admits he seen it</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1366336714798</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 21:58:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get out along with the horse you rode in on.

The resignation, first reported by KSDK, came a day after the Senate rejected a series of amendments to a gun control bill, including a bipartisan deal to expand background checks for gun sales. The NRA had vigorously opposed all those measures. "The NRA I see today has undermined the values upon which it was established," wrote Busch. "Your current strategic focus clearly places priority on the needs of gun and ammunition manufacturers while disregarding the opinions of your 4 million individual members." Reached for comment on Busch's resignation, NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told The Huffington Post, "We disagree with his characterization, but we wish him all the best." Busch joined the pro-gun organization in 1975 and has spoken before of his love of hunting. But the NRA has moved in a direction that Busch would not follow. "One only has to look at the makeup of the 75-member board of directors, dominated by manufacturing interests, to confirm my point. The NRA appears to have evolved into the lobby for gun and ammunition manufacturers rather than gun owners," he wrote.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1366396676313</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 14:37:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366396869248-61</Id><Topic><Title>boe5 on a 4 hour flight</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1366396294672</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 14:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Falmouthharbor, Good find!

The Federal Aviation Administration said it had approved a package of detailed design changes, a move that allows Boeing to issue a service bulletin and make repairs to the fleet of 50 planes owned by eight airlines around the world. Other global regulators also must approve Boeing's new design but were expected to act quickly once the FAA gave its blessing.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1366401440248</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 15:57:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366403209390-89</Id><Topic><Title>from Reuters on Faa approval.</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1366401440248</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 15:57:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds like it comes with 180 minute restriction, as before.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1366403209390</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 16:26:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366403312027-90</Id><Topic><Title>Giffords is a fighter, and NRA will be sorry</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1366327680542</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 19:28:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>= You far underestimated the luv Americans have for their freedom. = I "luv" freedom too.

If that were true why would they release the fact that one suspect was caught? Wouldn't they want to keep the populace terrified? Your batsh*t theories don't even make batsh*t sense. I'm really glad you tries to seem sane by not talking about your brain fever until all the "facts" were in. That's never troubled you before, doesn't trouble you now, and is uproariously funny.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1366411058846</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 18:37:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366411168893-107</Id><Topic><Title>Why was there a Bomb Treat EXERCISE BEFORE the Boston Marathon</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1366372765564</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 07:59:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I haven't posted on this thread, loony.

Uhhh!? Right after the attack? No one knew who did it - until sufficient video and photos had been collected to identify potential suspects - which was about a day or so. Unless the Russians knew in advance. My wife said that that must have been a mistake on the part of CNN. Maybe. Of course, it all depends upon what is meant by "right after the attack". "Right after" should be within a few hours, not two or three days later, when the suspects had been preliminarily identified and their relationship to Russia and the potential usefulness of Putin's offer would be apparent. And, it is always "possible" that Putin was simply making a friendly gesture of assistance - unaware of the Russian angle. Right.

Did you notice that I simply pointed out that I thought it was strange that Putin was offering help in the investigtion immediately after the bombing? His "help" could only be relevant if the perps were on his radar screen - for whatever reason - prior to the bombing. I thought that that was interesting - which was the point of the post. It was not an indictiment of the President. It was a comment on the Russians. Then you have to jump in there with unsavory comments involving the Bible - whether you realize that your not. I am simply advising you to reflect on what you are doing and saying relative to God's Word. Now, as with any advice, you can take it or leave it.
