The FAA said airlines would have to demonstrate that the lithium ion batteries involved were safe before they could resume flying Boeing's newest commercial airliner, but gave no details on when that could occur. Boeing could not be immediately reached for comment.( down from Boeing usual statement, we are aware of the issue and working with our customers, now, what customers?) All Nippon Airways Co Ltd said instruments aboard a domestic flight indicated a battery error, triggering emergency warnings. The incident was described by a transport ministry official as "highly serious" - language used in international safety circles as indicating there could have been an accident. Boeing shares fell 2 percent in after-hours trading to $72.80 after the FAA announcement. On 1-9-2013 I told this message board that the Boeing stock price was in a kill zone and any Boeing share holder should get out while they could. The 6 self appointed Boeing Mismanagement users here as usual, try to make up excuses and scapegoat anything they can come up with , personal attacks, harassment, silent thumbs down, but guess what as usual and par for the coarse I was right . By tomorrow you Boeing enablers could have saved yourself 5% which is what I made today on RIMM and sold for a day trade and STP another 5% and when the president started talking gun control another good gain on Smith and W., SMHC, over all I made over 15% today. Boeing for a year has lost all Boeing shareholders minus .35% and for this year today minus 1.35%. For any investor you are better off with a ETF of the NASDAQ, for a year up 15%, YTD up 3.25% , same for the S and P 500, the DJ average is up over 3%YTD, what are you thinking . boeing is not a long or a short, a dead cat stock get out now .

Within hours of the incident, the ANA executives are holding a press conference and apologizing profusely for inconveniencing their customers. You see them apologizing and bowing to the public, even though they could hardly be blamed for the incident. It's refreshing to see company executives apologizing so quickly after an incident. The 6 Boeing Managment Enablers that constantly police the Boeing message board and ty tactics that include, thumbs down, harassment,making false charges against users, and nitpicking can not make the stock go up or the 787 plane fly, it is a non union GE leadrship, MD business plan failure. Once more I pointed out on 1-9-2013 that the major institutions were selling the Boeing stock and Boeing stock was in the kill zone, if you figure it out boeing management Enablers, better ETF and stock to buy, the Boeing stock as stated is not a long or a short it is a dead cat bounce. However if the 787 needs a redesign the additional costs passed on to the Boeing shareholders and the fear of flying on a plane that catches fire by the public is not a good stock to own. The Boeing GE-MD mismanagement have done their spin story for 3.5 years and as I have said , along with the real SPEEA represented engineers the outsourcing and the 787 testing was lowered with the FAA going along. the NSTB will investigate the FAA and the Congress will investigate both agencies. If you larn to read a stock chart you would have known BA was at a sell point on the 9th of January. Phil Grande number 1 rated stock chart expert agreed with that on 1-9-2013 and A Boeing expert Hart-Smith told boeing executives that outsourcing would end up bankrupting BA. All the spin and harassment by the enablers of Boeing mismanagement will not work. In 10 years Boeing will be bankrupt ! I have been saying that for about 6 months now . So truth coers dog and pony ans sell the sizzle enablement of Boeing failed Management .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358410257481</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 03:10:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358410418064-31</Id><Topic><Title>Solution: Scuttle the Dreamliner and start over....</Title><Username>rogerjames55346</Username><Timestamp>1358401859034</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 00:50:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Daimler Benz bought Chrysler for $36 billion in 1998 and sold it for $7.4 Billion in 2007.

Let's wait for an announcement from the company's CEO to see how they want it to be done correctly at this moment.</Msg><Username>devoo1</Username><Timestamp>1358410685825</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 03:18:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358410903855-35</Id><Topic><Title>ALL 787 are grounded , next the 787 plane to be grounded for good !</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358402144902</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 00:55:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you think its demise is planned?</Msg><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1358410903855</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 03:21:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358411275879-36</Id><Topic><Title>ALL 787 are grounded , next the 787 plane to be grounded for good !</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358402144902</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 00:55:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amazing post.

Is the failure of Boeing planned? Don't know, but from a Hart-Smith report the result of the MD (bankrupt) business model (outsourcing) and the continuation of the "let’s get even with the unions" scapegoat, and outsource' business model, the plan or if it is a planned business failure is a moot question. 2. While there was a historical past to getting out of pension costs by bankruptcy, and transferring to the ERISA act of 1974, the PBGC a fund for paying less than the employee expected if the company fails, in pension payouts and transfer to the taxpayer. "The PBGC has a total of $102.5 billion in obligations and $79.5 billion in assets". The government is slow to move, and several companies have used this in the past to clear employee pensions by going bankrupt and then starting over. I have watched and know several pilots of a major airline in the USA have this happen to their retirement and twice too. , Airplane Companies know when the pilots are going to retire and plan the business failure and underfund the pensions. Boeing was sued and lost when they shut down a plant because there was a paper trail (email) that showed that management deliberately closed the plant just before most of the workers were very close to being vested. When I was working for the State of Washington many decades ago, I noticed that K-mart would fire each employee at 9 years 11 months and 20 days because at 10 years their pension was vested. I remember interviewing one K-Mart man, just fired, who was so self centered, he was crying to me about how he had helped K-mart document false reasons to fire other employees so they would not get their pension. That is an example of why workers at Boeing need a union. So the government is attempting to require the Companies to fully fund the pensions and companies like Boeing have restated their pension like the banks (to as they say, figures don’t lie but the people who do the figures scheme). Boeing has a huge pension payment requirement, I think Boeing retirees are all are continuing to live longer to force the mismanagement pay their pension money. Many Boeing retired people say they will live to 100 and marry a 18 year old at 95 to make sure she gets the continuation of the pension, a joke, that would be my opinion on getting even with Boeing ha if you want a conspiracy ha !At best Boeing will be a niche player in the future.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358419568523</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 05:46:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358419706060-55</Id><Title>Boeing's stock price will rebound today unless market takes a dump....back to $75!</Title><Msg>The problem will be taken care of soon , but Wall Street won't wait for it.

It has state of the instrumentation. United Airlines has been flying this plane with no problems. I put on the brakes and it did not stop the plane, did you put down the flaps, apply the thrusters?

The incentives of good pay and good retirement is no long there in the airlines companies. Technology has advanced more than the knowledge of these current older pilots. It's more than yelling, contact, flipping the prop and taking off, or the old technology by of the 70's and 80's.

Promising to follow the example of the founders in blocking the President from having the ability to legislate, the Kentucky Senator said he would introduce a bill next week that would “nullify anything the president does that smacks of legislation. And there are several of the executive orders that appear as if he’s writing new law. That cannot happen,” added Paul, noting that the courts struck down an attempt by Bill Clinton to do the same thing. Host Sean Hannity then listed a series of executive actions Obama had taken during his term without congressional approval, notably the authorization of military action against Libya. Senator Paul agreed that Obama was acting unconstitutionally and with “arrogance” in pursuing his political agenda outside of Congress. “He couldn’t get cap and trade through Congress and now he’s trying to do it through regulatory fiat, so there’s a lot of precedent for this, said Paul, warning that Obama was “garnering so much power and arrogance that he thinks he can do whatever he wants.” Turning to the issue of legislation that would ban assault weapons, Paul voiced his view that such a bill would not be successful due to a small number of Democrats in pro-gun states who would be forced to vote against such proposals out of fear of alienating their constituents. “I think there’s a good chance we can stop his legislative action, I’m concerned that he will try to do through regulatory fiat what he can’t pass through legislation,” remarked the Senator. Responding to Rep. Hank Johnson’s suggestion that the NRA are only opposing Obama because he is black, Paul pointed to the recent case, McDonald v. Chicago, in which an African-American attempted to assert his second amendment rights in the face of opposition from the city of Chicago, leading the Supreme Court to affirm that the right to “keep and bear arms” did apply to individuals and that cities could not overturn this right. Paul also pointed out that many of the early gun control laws were used to disarm black people. Paul warned that Obama was behaving like a king in acting through executive fiat with total disregard for Congress. “I’m afraid that President Obama may have this king complex sort of developing, and we’re going to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Paul said, echoing comments he made earlier in the week when he slammed Obama for “usurping the Constitution,” and “running roughshod over Congress.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358425535882</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 07:25:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358425666969-80</Id><Title>75 dollars Puts</Title><Msg>Whoever bought them on Tuesday are going to be rich today.

Each cell requires a charge controller, the chemistry defines these controllers. Were they Lithium Cobalt, LiFePO4? Is there a software issue and they were being overcharged/undercharged? There should have been a secondary power monitor downstream of the power management controller with some kind of warning system. These days power management systems are as smart and more complicated than many computers were in the middle 90's. They need to take the entire system, lay it out on a table, put it under the same environment as being at altitude, tie into it, and run the system. They need to put together a strike team of designers along with the PE's for the systems involved and push all of the other engineers out of the way the first time this happened. They should have had a fix in place in a couple of weeks and should have immediately implemented it on ALL aircraft. Upper Management screwed the pooch on this one as someone thought they could manage the issue while keeping the planes in the air. Hey Boeing, how'd that work out for ya? Fire whoever that person was, get a handle on the problem, make a cogent statement of the issue to the public, fix the problem, and move on.

"Jason Gursky, senior analyst, aerospace and defense at Citi Research says, historically, new aircraft face such issues. He cites the example of European aircraft maker Airbus' super jumbo A380 passenger jet, which was released commercially in 2007, and faced a series of issues "right out of the gate," and was also grounded." -CNBC Not to mention, more news coming out about Boeing being Airbus AGAIN in terms of orders, so there's some medium-term growth to throw into the mix: " Gross orders stood well ahead of the company's 2012 target of 650 jets but compared with Boeing's comparable figure of 1,339 new aircraft, giving Airbus a market share of 41 percent. Boeing led on net orders with 921 aircraft." This stock is the epitome of overreactions after small occurrences are blown right out of proportion.

His ultimate goal was and is to disarm the American people --- not because he didn’t want them to have the means to defend themselves against thugs and predators, but because he knew – as most liberals know – that the true intent of the Second Amendment was to preserve for the American People the right to resist, with arms if necessary, an oppressive government. Liberals are all about oppressive government --- why in the world would they want the people to be able to resist? Take a lesson from Obama’s recent tax increase victory. What did he do as soon as the GOP caved and gave him his tax increase? He IMMEDIATELY said that now he wanted to raise taxes on the evil rich even MORE! Same things with gun control. Give him what he asked for here, and he will immediately step forward to ask for more. Again … his goal is to remove the Second Amendment from our Constitution. Yesterday’s propaganda routine was a well-choreographed display of arrogance, masked as a heartfelt gesture “for the children.” Obama did, indeed, surround himself with four adorable children while addressing his plans for victim disarmament. He read from their letters – which were likely written at the direction of some unionized government school teacher. The West Wing is no longer in the business of governing; it is in the business of running a well-oiled propaganda machine. After reading some of the letters, Obama says … These are our kids. This is what they’re thinking about. And so what we should be thinking about is our responsibility to care for them, and shield them from harm, and give them the tools they need to grow up and do everything that they’re capable of doing — not just to pursue their own dreams, but to help build this country. This is our first task as a society, keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged. And their voices should compel us to change. If our first task as a society is to keep our children safe, then why did Obama go on to propose measures that limit the means of protection for the parents of these children? What Obama was really saying was, “Our first task as a society is to ensure that you, faithful citizens, rely on the government for everything in your lives and that includes protection of your life, liberty and property. You will not be judged based on your individual efforts to keep your child safe, but rather on your compliance with government directives which we will tell you are designed to keep you safe.” As predicted, Obama proposed universal background checks for all gun sales, including private sales. Considering a private individuals inability to conduct a background search, this will likely lead to the end of private gun sales in America. At the very lease it will lead to a database of all private sales and purchases. This database will be a precursor to confiscation … just as it was in New York City. Oh … and do you think that street thugs are going to run background checks on each other before guns change hands? Obama wants to restore a ban on military-style assault weapons and impose a 10-round limit for magazines. He then cited the horrific Aurora movie theatre shooting as an example of why we need to limit these magazines. Do you think the law was going to stop a deranged man such as that from getting his hands on such weaponry capable of producing such carnage? Nope. But the people defending themselves from such firepower will be limited. Hence the real name for Obama’s proposal: Victim Disarmament. Obama then took not one, not ten, but 23 executive actions on the issue of victim disarmament. Jamie Dupree has the entire list. I love that one of the executive actions is: “Publish a letter from ATF to federally licensed gun dealers providing guidance on how to run background checks for private sellers.” The same ATF that lost all of those guns they walked into Mexico? Yeah, they sure are a reliable source for how to track guns … Oh and did you notice that Obama managed to call for more government spending? I know! Let’s use this crisis to expand the size of government! After all, America’s greatness comes from government spending! The proposed package is $5.4 billion and includes things like “$10 million for the Centers for Disease Control to conduct further research, including investigating the relationship between video games, media images, and violence.” And before we move on, a few stats on victim disarmament: A survey found that Americans use guns to frighten intruders away from a home break-in about 500,000 times annually. Armed citizens shoot criminals more than twice as often as police each year (1527 to 606). A survey of male felons in 11 state prisons across the USA found that 57% of felons polled agreed that "criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police." Inch by inch, these liberals will manage to disarm or at least weaken responsible, self-reliant Americans.

It takes someone with a real pair to "run" these companies. These days you get Ivy League degrees running these companies instead of someone who actually knows what the widgets are. They have no concept of what the nuts and bolts of the product are, when things go wrong they rely on their minions to handle the issue and most of what they hear is a looks like roses scenario. CEO's need to have the balls and the knowledge to run the company, not just rely on a bunch of powerpoint slides. That is not the case in most multinational companies, the guys at the top have no idea what is happening at ground level. Trust me when I say this, I watched Motorola, and McDonnell Douglas go down in flames for it. It is not for lack of corporate capability, it is the ineptness of a bunch of business majors and bean counters. They have their role, but an engineering company should not be run by anything other than someone who truly understands engineering and is a ruthless personality. They have to lead, leave the board of directors meetings for the good ole boy network.</Msg><Username>fightthefiight</Username><Timestamp>1358434403360</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 09:53:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358434494449-136</Id><Topic><Title>The Batteries were exposed to EXTREME COLD weather....The casing is cracking due to fatigue.

This includes both military and civilian aircraft. They have been used for years without incident. Here's some of the reasons why LiBs are used: Much lighter than other energy-equivalent secondary batteries. High open circuit voltage in comparison to aqueous batteries (such as lead acid, nickel-metal hydride and nickel-cadmium). This is beneficial because it increases the amount of power that can be transferred at a lower current. No memory effect. Recharge them over and over. Self-discharge rate of approximately 5-10% per month, compared to over 30% per month in common nickel metal hydride batteries, approximately 1.25% per month for Low Self-Discharge NiMH batteries and 10% per month in nickel-cadmium batteries. Components are environmentally safe as there is no free lithium metal. BA's problems are incidental and will be fixed very quickly. I'm waiting to see where BA bottoms-out and add shares. OBTW, there's a long list of orders for 737s, plus the military orders which may endure Fed budget cuts.</Msg><Username>deathdealer77fa</Username><Timestamp>1358436312425</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 10:25:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358436328830-166</Id><Title>common sense</Title><Msg>common sense is the less common of the senses</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Cold and Severe Cold Climatic Categories. These areas include northern North America, Greenland, northern Asia, and Tibet. In the Cold Climatic Category, the temperature during the coldest month in a normal year may be colder than the Basic Climatic Category cold extreme of -32°C (-25°F). In the Severe Cold areas, the temperature during the coldest month in a normal year may be colder than the Cold Climatic Category extreme of -46°C (-50°F). Temperatures colder than -51°C (-60°F) occur no more than 20 percent of the hours in the coldest month of the coldest part of the area (northern Siberia) where temperatures as low as -68°C (-90°F) have been recorded. Because extremely low temperatures are not controlled by a daily solar cycle, they persist for a long enough period of time to cause materiel to reach equilibrium at extremely low temperatures ------ Cold soak temperatures must simulate these. - 1. Normal environment considerations. All combat and combat support systems should be designed for at least the Basic Climatic Category, meaning that design temperatures will include the outdoor ambient air temperatures range of -32°C through +43°C. See figure C-1 and table C-I. 2. Extreme environment considerations.

My father was a Senior VP of one of the largest Fortune 50 firms for many years. There was only one thing in life that annoyed him more than missing a 18 point buck during deer season. The growing ranks of freshly minted MBA hirees who tried to make their mark by coming up with insane cost saving ideas to boost qtrly profits. Sometimes they won the day and a $50,000 cost saving move, ended up costing the company $25,000,000. Happened often. During college I worked a union and non union job in the same industry. It was like night and day. Unions are so good and vital to America. The forces out to destroy them are as anti American as can be. In my non union job, I worked 12-14 hours a day on my feet, with a 20 minute lunch. One year later, I got the same type job in a union shop. The pay was 100% more, 8 hour max work day, with 30 minute lunch and two 20 minute breaks. Double time on Sunday, Triple time on holidays. It was also a professional work setting.</Msg><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1358447376030</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:29:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358447527575-256</Id><Topic><Title>Typical overreaction..Listen to experts not fools</Title><Username>usa_mustang_ford</Username><Timestamp>1358433677097</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 09:41:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It became a glitch in 1908.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1358447527575</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:32:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358447536579-257</Id><Topic><Title>ALL 787 are grounded , next the 787 plane to be grounded for good !</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358402144902</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 00:55:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Waynedick...why is the stock up all of a sudden....u will be grounded for sure...and 787 will fly!

Yesterday, as you may have heard, Goldman Sachs announced that it's pulling Boeing off its "conviction buy" list on worries that the company's Dreamliner issues make the stock a riskier bet than it previously thought. Goldman still rates the stock a lesser flavor of "buy," of course. But not everyone's so sanguine about the company's troubles. This morning, rival banker BB&amp;T announced that it is throwing in the whole towel, and cutting Boeing shares to "underweight" (Wall Street-speak for "sell"). Is it right to do so? Maybe not. From a numbers perspective, Boeing certainly looks good. The stock's got a P/E ratio of only 13, alongside a 12% growth rate and a temptingly high 2.5% dividend yield. In any other circumstances, I'd say these numbers justify a pretty strong buy rating for a company as dominant as Boeing. It's the unknowns, though, that worry me. Can Boeing fix its electrical, and other problems, with the Dreamliner? Can it do so before customers begin canceling their orders for the plane? Will the FAA sign off on the fix? Most crucially of all, will Boeing even have engineers available to make progress on this problem, seeing as it seems intent on provoking a labor strike by its SPEEA engineers union? Given all the open questions, it's hard to consider Boeing much more than a hold right now. And BB&amp;T might be right: Boeing just might be a sell.</Msg><Username>yourkk</Username><Timestamp>1358450690154</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 14:24:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358450702256-290</Id><Title>Bulls, buy with both hands?

Boeing has all hands on deck to find a solution. Was the battery selection the prime problem? If so the time table to correct this will take time. A long time. If the battery manufactuer was at fault, or the manufacturer of the charging system needs to make changes to the quick charge of these batteries, then the solution may be soon. I would be looking at the charging system. Why do I feel this is a problem? Because in all cases the problem showed up on the ramp or shortly after takeoff in all the other cases. The batteries were being super charged on the ground. The batteries at that time started to overheat or leak. I feel the quick check should be to monitor the electrical system bay prior to each takeoff by a trained technician. Remember that the 787 has been flying for a while now and these problems, although serious, has been few.

YES, OPERA! John Madigan, CEO of the Tribune Company at the time, and a fellow opera buff, pulled off what was considered a major coup at the time by persuading Condit to move Boeing's HQ to Chicago over Seattle and Dallas where they had production facilities and air fields. Everyone was very surprised at this. Shortly afterward, Mayor Daley attecked his own city and tore up the Meigs Field in-city little airport near their HQ. Boeing execs could not even use their little jets alone the big ones without a long crueling car ride to Indiana. Previously, Conduit could be airborne in less time than the president of the US - 15 minutes from his office in Seattle and right next to Boeing facilities and run-ways. The move to Chicago was one of the MOST INSANE IDEARS EVER at Boeing!!! Conduit was often seen hanging around the Chicago Opera House during the day and rehearsals in that it was next door to Boeing HQ and it is said he spent more time there than at Bowing HQ! A comment from a news story at the time: "As Condit and others in the executive team explored these themes, they began to look more closely at the role of Boeing’s corporate headquarters, and if its job was being hampered by proximity to Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ factories."</Msg><Username>boulmichone</Username><Timestamp>1358456066819</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 15:54:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358456167459-332</Id><Topic><Title>PREDICTIONS for BOEING !!</Title><Username>johnsonandrew384</Username><Timestamp>1358447476581</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:31:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>awesome report!</Msg><Username>garywhite553</Username><Timestamp>1358456167459</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 15:56:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358456693824-333</Id><Topic><Title>Dreamliner uses Lithium Ion Batteries - These are unstable &amp; can start fires</Title><Username>hysailr</Username><Timestamp>1357918332765</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:32:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While fighting a war over Oil in Iraq Chevron Scooped up and shelved Key Battery Technology. maybe its time Chevron/Texeco stop sitting on the MIT lithium nickle manganese battery, licenced to sea-somthing? subsidiary of Jonson controllers of which Chevron/Texeco took in hostal takeover 2008 .. puts out an amazing 241volts at 350 amp hours.. charges at 440volts=10minutes.. charges at 220=4hours... charges at 110=8hours...

Costs of the 787 grounding, the airlines will charge Boeing at least 50 million per day for lost revenue, the SPEEA strike would cost Boeing shareholders 400 million per day. The other Boeing engineers from California are not experienced 787 engineers. the bottom line, the pension take away is not a option for Boeing Managment at this time. The Boeing stock buyback is all that is supporting the stock price now, on 1-9-2013 Phil Grande said Boeing stock is being sold off by major institutions, and it was in a kill zone and that is right.

The 787 not only has a hydraulic system, it has multiple, independent hydraulic systems (three I believe but I'd have to check to be sure of the number) and they operate at 5,000 psi versus the more traditional 3,000 psi. It also has a RAT (Ram Air Turbine) in the unlikely event that all normal sources of hydraulic power are lost. The 787 is more reliant on electric power in part because the brakes are electric, as is the leading edge anti-ice system. On more traditional airplanes, the brakes are hydraulic and leading edge anti-ice is pneumatic (i.e. warm bleed air taken off the engines and passed up to the leading edges of the wings to prevent ice from forming). Also, the batteries in question are NOT the primary source of electrical power for the flight controls or anything else. The plane has electric generators on the engines for that type of thing. The batteries are part of a back-up system and at most are used to start the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit, small turbine engine in the tail) when you're on the ground and ground power isn't available.</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1358457645635</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:20:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358457697548-346</Id><Topic><Title>Didn't the previous loser CEO Albaugh say the 787 was rushed</Title><Username>corp_gold</Username><Timestamp>1358455351489</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 15:42:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YEA 5 years behind scedule,,,,,,,lmao</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1358457697548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:21:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358457737903-347</Id><Title>Anyone know Why we went up today</Title><Msg>with all this bad news flying over, under and around Boeing???

You’d be wrong. While the long-range, mid-size jet isn’t in heavy use yet, the repercussions of this grounding will be felt across the aerospace industry. Obama Drops Satellite Ban, Gives Aerospace Industry A Lift David M. Ewalt Forbes Staff NASA Expanding ISS With Bigelow Aerospace Inflatable David M. Ewalt Forbes Staff The Dreamliner’s troubles began with an incident in Boston on January 7, when a battery on an empty 787 caught fire. On January 11, the FAA ordered a comprehensive review of the 787’s critical systems. But on January 16 another Dreamliner was forced to make an emergency landing after n-board alarms indicated smoke in an electrical compartment, and passengers reported a burning smell in the cabin. As a result, the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive requiring that operators of U.S.-registered Boeing 787 aircraft temporarily cease operations, and demonstrate that the Dreamliner’s batteries are safe before resuming operations. “The AD is prompted by this second incident involving a lithium ion battery,” the FAA said in a statement. “The battery failures resulted in release of flammable electrolytes, heat damage, and smoke on two Model 787 airplanes. The root cause of these failures is currently under investigation. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical systems and structures, and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment.” Because the Dreamliner’s problems appear to be a complex issue involving entire electrical subsystems, it could take months to complete an investigation into the Dreamliner’s problems and get the jets back into the air. “We are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity,” Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said in a statement after the directive went into effect. “We will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787′s safety and to return the airplanes to service.” The grounding may be most obviously bad news for Boeing, but the damage will be spread far beyond the Seattle aerospace giant. The only U.S. airline immediately affected by the directive is United Airlines, which flies six of the affected 787s. United has already switched out the jets with similar-sized Boeing 767, and all the flight delays caused by the swap appear to have worked their way out of the system. But United has 44 more Dreamliners on order, so an extended grounding –or any evidence that this is a larger systemic problem– could cause problems in the future. The same goes for several other U.S. companies — American Airlines recently ordered for 42 Dreamliners, Delta Air Lines has 18 of the jets on order, and several leasing companies also have outstanding orders, including AIG</Msg><Username>beancounter_2003</Username><Timestamp>1358458437349</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:33:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358458665370-358</Id><Topic><Title>Dreamliner uses Lithium Ion Batteries - These are unstable &amp; can start fires</Title><Username>hysailr</Username><Timestamp>1357918332765</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:32:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tech, In addition to understanding what happened at Securaplane, here is a thought on perhaps a subtlety related to operational use. The ANA configuration provides AC outlets to the passengers for charging devices (like cell phones or computers) which are in the region of a couple tens of watts (.1 to .2 amp at 120 VAC). Are they disabled when the engines are turned off? Are they current limited? In addition to not liking overvoltage, the Li-ion batteries also do not like to be overloaded (exceeding load/discharge current). I could envision the cleaning crew erroneously plugging their vacuum cleaners into the passenger outlets, perhaps two or three of them at a time, rather than the utility outlets and drawing down the batteries at excessive rates and causing accelerated degradation.

Boeing's newest, flashiest jet was grounded worldwide on Thursday after one plane suffered a battery fire and another had an emergency landing because pilots detected a burning smell. The two incidents prompted airlines and regulators around the world to ground the planes until a fix for the battery problem is found that satisfies the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. It's not clear how long the investigation — or the fix — will take, but it won't be cheap for Boeing. Meanwhile, airlines that had sought the prestige of flying the world's most sophisticated plane are instead stuck with one they can't use. Poland's airline LOT said Thursday it may seek compensation from Boeing Co. for the grounding of its two 787 Dreamliner planes. The airline suffered the highest-profile embarrassment of any of Boeing's customers on Wednesday night, when it was showing off new service between Warsaw and Chicago. The plane's captain learned of the FAA grounding order while the flight was on its way from Warsaw to Chicago. The airline had to cancel the return trip — and a ceremony at O'Hare that was to include airline officials and Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Passengers who were eager to ride the airline's first flight back to Warsaw ended up looking for a hotel room instead. Boeing currently builds five 787s every month. It hasn't delivered any since Jan. 3, before the first fire. Boeing Co. spokeswoman Lori Gunter said no deliveries were scheduled during that time. She declined to talk about planned deliveries. All Nippon Airways said its 18th 787 is due at the end of this month, but it won't take delivery until the 787 flights resume.</Msg><Username>beancounter_2003</Username><Timestamp>1358458802332</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:40:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358458868267-363</Id><Topic><Title>Engines falling off Dreamliner</Title><Username>puterub</Username><Timestamp>1358452585398</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 14:56:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The stock really is more resilient than it's been in years.

The company also reported that its share buyback plan, approved in 2007, will restart in 2013. The money used to fund the dividend hike and share buybacks is from the increased cash flow from its new 787 plane and a positive growth outlook. Well then that improved cash flow is not good The Boeing Co. (BA), producer of commercial airliners, said it will buy back as much as $7 billion of its common stock, the latest leg of a share-repurchase program under which the aerospace company has bought back $8 billion worth of its shares since the program was resumed in 2004. On 1-9-2013 Phil Grande wared that Boeing stock was being sold off my institutions and the stock was in the kill zone and not to buy the stock based upon charts. Now the Boeing company is buying back their shares as the company like any company would to demonstrate to the public their confidence in Boeing. Read what is going on the 787 fleet is grounded the plane is 3.5 years late and 30 billion over budget, 747 is overcost by 2 billion late by 2 years and not selling as planned. You have a chance to divest yourself of Boeing stock now , only rookie inestors will be holding the bag if the 787 needs another engineering fix. If the boeing company does not allow the SPEEA union to keep their pension and extend that to the new hires there will be a 400 million cost per day to Boeing on a strike. Now the 787 grounding is costing Boeing 50 million loss of revenue per day . It has nothing to do with shorting or emotional factors . the stock price is being supported by limited buy back and that comes from the shareholder.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358459878214</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:57:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358459929783-375</Id><Title>TODAY THE EUROPEAN UNION GAVE THE GROUNDING ORDER FOR THE 787 ON ITS TERITORY</Title><Msg>EOM...</Msg><Username>copyright_member</Username><Timestamp>1358459929783</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:58:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358460128530-376</Id><Topic><Title>NTSB returns 787 to JAL for repair</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358288908712</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 17:28:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wayne get over it.

Obama Can, Too</Title><Msg>By JOHN HOWARD SYDNEY, Australia IT is for Americans and their elected representatives to determine the right response to President Obama’s proposals on gun control. I wouldn’t presume to lecture Americans on the subject. I can, however, describe what I, as prime minister of Australia, did to curb gun violence following a horrific massacre 17 years ago in the hope that it will contribute constructively to the debate in the United States. I was elected prime minister in early 1996, leading a center-right coalition. Virtually every nonurban electoral district in the country — where gun ownership was higher than elsewhere — sent a member of my coalition to Parliament. Six weeks later, on April 28, 1996, Martin Bryant, a psychologically disturbed man, used a semiautomatic Armalite rifle and a semiautomatic SKS assault weapon to kill 35 people in a murderous rampage in Port Arthur, Tasmania. After this wanton slaughter, I knew that I had to use the authority of my office to curb the possession and use of the type of weapons that killed 35 innocent people. I also knew it wouldn’t be easy. Our challenges were different from America’s. Australia is an even more intensely urban society, with close to 60 percent of our people living in large cities. Our gun lobby isn’t as powerful or well-financed as the National Rifle Association in the United States. Australia, correctly in my view, does not have a Bill of Rights, so our legislatures have more say than America’s over many issues of individual rights, and our courts have less control. Also, we have no constitutional right to bear arms. (After all, the British granted us nationhood peacefully; the United States had to fight for it.) Because Australia is a federation of states, the national government has no control over gun ownership, sale or use, beyond controlling imports. Given our decentralized system of government, I could reduce the number of dangerous firearms only by persuading the states to enact uniform laws totally prohibiting the ownership, possession and sale of all automatic and semiautomatic weapons while the national government banned the importation of such weapons. To make this plan work, there had to be a federally financed gun buyback scheme. Ultimately, the cost of the buyback was met by a special one-off tax imposed on all Australians. This required new legislation and was widely accepted across the political spectrum. Almost 700,000 guns were bought back and destroyed — the equivalent of 40 million guns in the United States. City dwellers supported our plan, but there was strong resistance by some in rural Australia. Many farmers resented being told to surrender weapons they had used safely all of their lives. Penalizing decent, law-abiding citizens because of the criminal behavior of others seemed unfair. Many of them had been lifelong supporters of my coalition and felt bewildered and betrayed by these new laws. I understood their misgivings. Yet I felt there was no alternative. The fundamental problem was the ready availability of high-powered weapons, which enabled people to convert their murderous impulses into mass killing. Certainly, shortcomings in treating mental illness and the harmful influence of violent video games and movies may have played a role. But nothing trumps easy access to a gun. It is easier to kill 10 people with a gun than with a knife. Passing gun-control laws was a major challenge for my coalition partner: the rural, conservative National Party. All of its members held seats in nonurban areas. It was also very hard for the state government of Queensland, in Australia’s northeast, where the National Party was dominant, and where the majority of the population was rural. The leaders of the National Party, as well as the premier of Queensland, courageously supported my government’s decision, despite the electoral pain it caused them. Within a year, a new populist and conservative political party, the One Nation Party, emerged and took many votes from our coalition in subsequent state and federal elections; one of its key policies was the reversal of the gun laws. For a time, it seemed that certain states might refuse to enact the ban. But I made clear that my government was willing to hold a nationwide referendum to alter the Australian Constitution and give the federal government constitutional power over guns. Such a referendum would have been expensive and divisive, but it would have passed. And all state governments knew this. In the end, we won the battle to change gun laws because there was majority support across Australia for banning certain weapons. And today, there is a wide consensus that our 1996 reforms not only reduced the gun-related homicide rate, but also the suicide rate. The Australian Institute of Criminology found that gun-related murders and suicides fell sharply after 1996. The American Law and Economics Review found that our gun buyback scheme cut firearm suicides by 74 percent. In the 18 years before the 1996 reforms, Australia suffered 13 gun massacres — each with more than four victims — causing a total of 102 deaths. There has not been a single massacre in that category since 1996. Few Australians would deny that their country is safer today as a consequence of gun control. John Howard was prime minister of Australia from 1996 to 2007.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1358461200897</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 17:20:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358461212030-388</Id><Topic><Title>Obama runs guns to the Cartels and NRA supports guns for citizens so</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1358461053599</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 17:17:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You one of those that thinks the UN's black helicopters are coming?</Msg><Username>dellhead.geo</Username><Timestamp>1358461212030</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 17:20:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358461252399-389</Id><Topic><Title>Should White People Get Reparations?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1358457965925</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:26:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... prove it that your white...!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358461252399</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 17:20:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358461536945-390</Id><Title>Driving Gun &amp; Ammo Prices Up</Title><Msg>The only thing Pro Gun idiots have succeeded - is driving the prices up and the inventory down !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358461536945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 17:25:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358461564806-391</Id><Topic><Title>The dreamliner and why the batteries are so crucial.....</Title><Username>stockwizard10</Username><Timestamp>1358434832146</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 10:00:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for the detailed explanation.

A fuel leak. A cracked windshield. One electrical fire. Then another. An emergency landing in Japan. A safety investigation imposed by the FAA. Then two premier customers—Japan’s two main airlines, ANA and JAL, ground their fleet of Boeing [BA] 787s. Then the FAA grounds all 787s used by the only American carrier. Now other regulators around the world follow suit, grounding all 50 of the 787s delivered so far. The regulatory grounding of an entire fleet is unusual—the first since 1979—and relates to a key to the plane’s claimed energy-efficiency: the novel use of lithium ion batteries, which have shown a propensity to overheat and lead to fires—fires that generate oxygen and hence are difficult to put out. And keep in mind: Boeing’s 787 project is already billions of dollars over budget. The delivery schedule has been pushed back at least seven times. The first planes were delivered over three years late. In fact, out of a total of 848 planes sold, only 6 percent have been delivered. Yet grave as these issues seem, they are merely symptoms of a deeper disease that has been gnawing at the US economy for decades: flawed offshoring decisions by the C-suite. Offshoring is not some menial matter to be left to accountants in the backroom or high-priced consultants armed with spreadsheets, promising quick profits. It raises mission-critical issues potentially affecting the survival of entire firms, whole industries and ultimately the economy. Not just Boeing: an economy-wide problem Thus Boeing is hardly alone in making flawed offshoring decisions. Boeing is just the latest and most spectacular example of an economy-wide problem. “Many companies that offshored manufacturing didn’t really do the math,” Harry Moser, an MIT-trained engineer and founder of the Reshoring Initiative told me. As many as 60 percent of the decisions were based on miscalculations. As noted by Gary Pisano and Willy Shih in their classic article, “Restoring American Competitiveness” (Harvard Business Review, July-August 2009), offshoring has been devastating whole US industries, stunting innovation, and crippling capacity to compete long-term. Pisano and Shih write: “The decline of manufacturing in a region sets off a chain reaction. Once manufacturing is outsourced, process-engineering expertise can’t be maintained, since it depends on daily interactions with manufacturing. Without process-engineering capabilities, companies find it increasingly difficult to conduct advanced research on next-generation process technologies. Without the ability to develop such new processes, they find they can no longer develop new products. In the long term, then, an economy that lacks an infrastructure for advanced process engineering and manufacturing will lose its ability to innovate.” Pisano and Shih have a frighteningly long list of industries that are “already lost” to the USA, including: compact fluorescent lighting; LCDs for monitors, TVs and handheld devices like mobile phones; electrophoretic displays; lithium ion, lithium polymer and NiMH batteries; advanced rechargeable batteries for hybrid vehicles; crystalline and polycrystalline silicon solar cells, inverters and power semiconductors for solar panels; desktop, notebook and netbook PCs; low-end servers; hard-disk drives; consumer networking gear such as routers, access points, and home set-top boxes; advanced composite used in sporting goods and other consumer gear; advanced ceramics and integrated circuit packaging. The list of industries “at risk” is even longer and more worrisome. Now unless Boeing can quickly fix the technical issues afflicting the 787, its entire airline business will also be “at risk”. Manufacturing airplanes could even become an addition to the list of industries “already lost.” These issues are a wakeup call not just to Boeing but to every CEO whose firm or whose suppliers have been or will be involved in offshoring. Every CEO must learn seven lessons. 1. Use the right metrics to evaluate offshoring In analyzing offshoring, firms must get beyond rudimentary cost calculations focused on short-term profit,, such as the cost of labor or the ex-factory cost and incorporate the total cost and risk of extended international supply chains. This is easily done with the help of the Reshoring Initiative, whose website includes an analytical tool enabling companies to calculate the full risks and costs of offshoring. It’s called the Total Cost of Ownership Estimator[TM]. And the price is right. It doesn’t require hiring high-priced consultants: it’s free. The Estimator poses a series of questions. What’s the price of the part from each of the destinations? How far is it away? How often are you going to travel to see the supplier? How much intellectual property risk is there? How long do you think you are going to make it? It uses the answers to calculate twenty-five different costs. When they are added up, that’s the Total Cost of Ownership. Most companies have tended to make their sourcing decisions based on the wage rate or the ex-works price or the landed cost, and leave out another twenty cost categories. The Estimator makes it easy for the company to calculate the other twenty costs. “Often what firms find,” says Moser, “is that whereas the offshoring price is perhaps 30 percent less than the US price, all these other costs add up to more than 30 percent. If they are willing to recognize all of them, then they can see that it may be profitable to bring the work back.” “For instance,” says Moser, “I took the last 27 cases where users compared China to the US. On average, the US price was 69 percent higher than the production price in China. It turned out that the US total cost of ownership was 4 percent lower. So it made a huge difference to make that calculation. That’s an indication that a substantial portion of the work that has been offshored would come back if people would use the right metrics.” 2. Review whether earlier outsourcing decisions made sense Let’s back up a bit and note that Boeing’s problems have been visible for some time. In August 2011, my article drew attention to the perilous offshoring course on which Boeing was embarked. In December 2012, fellow Forbes contributor Jonathan Salem Baskin wrote: “The company was convinced by one or more management consulting firms to outsource design and production of the 787’s components. While this idea might make sense for sourcing coffeemakers, it was a nonsense approach to assembling perhaps the most complicated and potentially dangerous machines shy of nuclear reactors. I’m sure blather from Harvard Business Review supported the idea that distances between factories in Seattle and Outer Mongolia were no farther than a VOIP chat, but the reality was a mess. Parts didn’t fit together with others. Some suppliers subcontracted work to their suppliers and then shrugged at problems with assembly. When one part wasn’t available, the next one that depended on it couldn’t be attached and the global supply chain all but seized up. Boeing had to spend $1 billion in 2009 to buy one of the worst offenders and bring the work back in-house.” “The grounding — an unusual action for a new plane — focuses on one of the more risky design choices made by Boeing, namely to make extensive use of lithium ion batteries aboard its airplanes for the first time,” write Christopher Drew, Jad Mouawad and Matthew Wald in the New York Times: “The 787’s problems could jeopardize one of its major features, its ability to fly long distances at a cheaper cost… The maker of the 787’s batteries, Japan’s GS Yuasa, has declined to comment on the problems so far. “ What was Boeing thinking when they opted to embrace such extensive offshoring? Moser believes the error lay in using the wrong measure of the impact of offshoring on earnings. “Many companies that offshored manufacturing didn’t really do the math,” Harry Moser, an MIT-trained engineer and founder of the Reshoring Initiative told me. “A study the consulting company, Archstone, showed that 60 percent of offshoring decisions used only rudimentary cost calculations, maybe just price or labor costs rather than something holistic like total cost. Most of the true risks and cost of offshoring were hidden.” For many companies, it’s time to redo the math, and then verify whether they still have the expertise to bring manufacturing back. 3. Don’t outsource mission-critical components “Boeing has acknowledged, says Moser, “that its biggest problem was in outsourcing not only manufacturing but also a lot of the engineering. There were multiple tiers of outsourced companies who were supposed to be making their designs consistent so that the parts fit together. And they didn’t fit together. If Boeing had taken full responsibility for the engineering and then had jobbed the parts out and gotten them made to print, their problems would have been a lot less severe. It seems like they had this brilliant idea of outsourcing a lot of engineering with the manufacturing. There’s almost nothing as complicated as a Dreamliner. “For example, an iPhone isn’t nearly as complicated. The downside risk isn’t as great. Apple has succeeded with outsourcing almost everything to Foxconn, mainly because they first completely manufacture the new product in the US. They make sure it’s right, while Foxconn is working in parallel with them, developing their tooling and whatever. So Apple has a finished product and they say to Foxconn: make it just like this! What Apple has done has worked amazingly well, because they have the capability to do the perfect prototype here, before it gets offshored to Foxconn. Most companies don’t have that. “Thus Boeing didn’t have a finished product. So there were all kinds of risks of things not coming together. The tendency is too often for companies to try to do the engineering over here and the manufacturing over there. Eventually the innovation declines and the risk increases, as outlined by Pisano and Shih.” 4. Bring some manufacturing back Moser estimates that when the total costs are included, around 25 percent of manufacturing that is currently outsourced could be profitably brought home, if the manufacturing expertise still exists. Looking ahead, changes in relative economics are likely to increase that percentage. It is important to take into account rapid changes in relative costs. Oil prices are three times what they were in 2000. Natural gas in the US is a quarter of what it is in Asia. Chinese wages are five times what they were in 2000 and are expected to keep rising rapidly. And in any event labor is a steadily decreasing percentage of the cost of manufacturing. Reshoring is already happening to a limited extent. Apple [AAPL] announced recently that it will resume manufacturing of one of the existing Mac lines in the US next year. GE [GE] is spending some $800 million to re-establish manufacturing in its giant facility—until recently, almost defunct—at Appliance Park, in Louisville, Kentucky. Whirlpool [WHR] is bringing mixer-making back from China to Ohio. Otis is bringing elevator production back from Mexico to South Carolina. And Wham-O Toys is bringing Frisbee-molding back from China to California. Based on the reshoring articles in the ReshoreNow Library, Moser calculates that at least 50,000 manufacturing jobs have recently been reshored in the last three years. Where companies see that it could be profitable to bring manufacturing back, they will need to ensure that they either have or can rebuild the necessary expertise—sometimes a daunting challenge. 5. Adequately assess the risk factors of offshoring In Boeing’s case, as Jonathan Salem Baskin notes: “It didn’t help that the outsourcing plan included skipping the detailed blueprints the company would have normally prepared, and allowing vendors to come up with their own. Delivered components arrived with instructions and notes written in Chinese, Italian, and other languages. Oh, and they decided to build the airplane out of plastic along with other novel materials and technologies, so it would have been a big experiment even if Boeing approached manufacturing like it always had.” Clearly firms have underestimated the risk of having extended international supply chains. I asked Moser whether Total Cost of Ownership Estimator can help firms get a better handle on that risk. “The TCO Estimator assigns no factor values apart from freight,” says Moser. “The user assigns all the factors. The user answers questions about the delivery time, and the price. That enables the Estimator’s algorithm to assess the inventory and the inventory carrying costs. There’s a section on opportunity cost. If the firm will lose orders because it can’t deliver, then put a value on that. There are sections on natural disaster risk and political risk. “ If Boeing had been using this earlier what would be the implications? If they underestimated the delay risk or the technical risk as low, the Estimator would have reflected the underestimation of the risk. “The Estimator would have encouraged them to try to estimate each of the risks,” says Moser. “When you have twenty-five of them, you only have to put in 1 percent in each to balance the savings you might get from going offshore. “If you are buying pencils, not much intellectual property risk; if you can’t get it from this source, you can get it from somewhere else. The margins aren’t big, so you don’t lose so much. You don’t have much image to lose. But when you are making airplanes, there’s a lot of risk. Instead of having one size fit all, the Estimator lets you adapt for each product, each market, and make a more holistic and informed decision. “The Reshoring Initiative site also offers resources. Library contains articles about transportation industry and equipment, and firms can understand where production was reshored and why. They might conclude: ‘Looks like a lot of companies are having problems with these things. Maybe we should increase our risk levels?’ “The Initiative also has information on what other users have found on the distribution of average costs. If they look at that, they might realize that some costs and risks have been underestimated. So the Estimator can help them make better decisions.” 6. Adequately value the role of innovation Much of the offshoring that has taken place has assumed that the outsourced items are “little do-hickeys” with low value and so didn’t really matter much in the overall scheme of things. The little do-hickeys are worth pennies or less and have next-to-no margin. While those “little do-hickeys” might seem cheap in themselves, the lessons to be learned in improving their manufacture in the end can turn out to be highly valuable. (In cost accounting and economics, which usually don’t explicitly value knowledge, this loss is invisible and so doesn’t get taken into account.) Firms often haven’t thought through how often they are going to redesign this product. “If it’s a bracket and you’re not going to redesign it for 30 years, it doesn’t matter very much,” says Moser. These days however there are very few components that are good for another thirty years. “If it is something that you are updating every six months or every year, then that becomes a lot more important. It’s the difference between a commodity and something that’s design-driven. The result of answering those questions is an ‘innovation cost of being at a distance.’ The Reshoring Initiative has resources so that firms can develop the understanding to make better decisions.“ The opportunity cost of lost innovation can be significant. Thus when GE decided to bring manufacturing of its innovative GeoSpring water heater back from the “cheap” Chinese factory to the “expensive” Kentucky factory, the cost of production went down. “The material cost went down. The labor required to make it went down. The quality went up. Even the energy efficiency went up. GE wasn’t just able to hold the retail sticker to the ‘China price.’ It beat that price by nearly 20 percent. The China-made GeoSpring retailed for $1,599. The Louisville-made GeoSpring retails for $1,299. GE’s water heater as originally designed for manufacture in China had a tangle of copper tubing that was difficult to weld together. In the past, GE had been shipping the design to China and telling them to “make it”. Confronted with making the water heater themselves, they discovered that “in terms of manufacturability, it was terrible.” So GE’s designers got together with the welders and redesigned the heater so that it was easier and cheaper to make. They eliminated the tangle of tubing that couldn’t be easily welded. By having those workers right at the table with the designers, the work hours necessary to assemble the water heater went from 10 hours in China to two hours in Louisville. “For years,” Charles Fishman writes in a great article in The Atlantic, “too many American companies have treated the actual manufacturing of their products as incidental—a generic, interchangeable, relatively low-value part of their business. If you spec’d the item closely enough—if you created a good design, and your drawings had precision; if you hired a cheap factory and inspected for quality—who cared what language the factory workers spoke? … It was like writing a cookbook without ever cooking…. there is an inherent understanding that moves out when you move the manufacturing out. And you never get it back.” What is only now dawning on the smart American companies, Lou Lenzi, head of design for GE appliances says, is that when you outsource the making of the products, “your whole business goes with the outsourcing.” 7. Get to the root of the problem: maximizing shareholder value While several decades of outsourcing were under way, why didn’t these smart managers think about the importance of innovating and protecting intellectual property? Why didn’t these well-educated managers realize that it was important to have designers, engineers, and assembly-line workers talk to each other? Why didn’t these MBA graduates realize that outsourcing might be mortgaging the future of their firms? “There was a herd mentality to the offshoring,” John Shook, the CEO of the Lean Enterprise Institute, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “And there was some bullshit. But it was also the inability to see the total costs—the engineers in the U.S. and factory managers in China who can’t talk to each other; the management hours and money flying to Asia to find out why the quality they wanted wasn’t being delivered. The cost of all that is huge.” When managers manage with a spreadsheet rather than real-world knowledge about what is actually going on in the factory and what were its possibilities, they overlook hidden costs of the erosion of skills, the loss of quality and constraints on innovation. They also missed the potential added value to customers that could be generated by designing and manufacturing things differently. They also missed the costs and risks of an international supply chain, which is increasingly out of step with the shorter, faster product cycles. Why did all these smart, highly educated people make all these mistakes? The root cause of these errors is a focus on the dumbest idea in the world: maximizing shareholder value. Focusing on short-term shareholder value ended up destroying vast quantities of long-term shareholder value. A focus on maximizing shareholder value leads the firm to do things that detract from maximizing long-term shareholder value, such as offshoring, favoring cost-cutting over innovation, and pursuit of “corner cutting” and “bad profits” that destroy brand equity. The net result can be seen in the disastrously declining ROA and ROIC over the last four decades in large US firms as documented by Deloitte’s Shift Index. The errors of offshoring are thus not isolated events. They are the result of the underlying philosophy of shareholder value, rather than the true purpose of every firm: create value for customers. The resurrection of American manufacturing will require more than simply bringing back production to America. Global manufacturing is at the cusp of a massive transformation as the new economics of energy and labor plays out and a set of new technologies—robotics, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, and nanotechnology—are advancing rapidly. Together these developments will spark a radical transformation of manufacturing around the world over the next decade. The winners in the rapidly changing world of manufacturing will be those firms that have mastered the agility needed to generate rapid and continuous customer-based innovation. Success in this new world of manufacturing will require a radically different kind of management from the hierarchical bureaucracy focused on shareholder value that is now prevalent. It will require a different goal (adding value for customers), a different role for managers (enabling self-organizing teams), a different way of coordinating work (dynamic linking), different values (continuous improvement and radical transparency) and different communications (horizontal conversations). Merely shifting the locus of production is not enough. Companies need systemic change—a new management paradigm. Pursuit of maximizing shareholder value at Boeing led to offshoring that has caused massive damage to shareholder value. The eventual scale of the damage can only be guessed at today. The remedy lies not in pointing fingers at Boeing’s management, but rather in treating the economy-wide disease that caused the problem.

That is how Boeing took over it was late to the jet engine airplane but learned about window cracking. If Frank Malone wanted to pick on Airbus he should have gone with the A380, cracking. however Airbus has sold and delivered more airbus A380 than boeing has sold and delivered 747 since about 2005. so not much for Frankmalone 90 to crow about, but he should pick his fights better. On the Airbus lithium batteries compared to the Boeing batteries "Bregier noted the A350 requires only half the battery power of a plane like the 787, which is the first commercial aircraft to make extensive use of batteries to drive its electrical systems and be fuel-efficient. "There are some architectural differences and the suppliers are different," said Bregier. "As Boeing said, the battery is not the issue, it's the way you integrate it to the power system." Airbus has had its own share of technical problems that have delayed the rollout of a key military aircraft, costing billions in extra costs, as well as security issues concerning the wing ribs of its superjumbo A380 jets. Especially the part about different suppliers the second to market sometimes is first in long term gains !

Whats your point? Boeing has not taken pensions away from the new managment, that is a take away. If Boeing wants the best and brightest they need to compete with Airbus who has a great pension and medical plan , pays more wage and has more vacation BTW Airbus has 62% market share of the real profit point for both Boeing and Airbus, its the the 737 market, seems like boeing should have been concentrating on the 737max not building a firestarter 787. While the 787 is costing Boeing a loss of 300 million per delivered plane and now 50 million per day in lack of use , for the 787 customers and will cost 400 million per day of strike. I guess you can have your opinion. the facts Boeing stock price had gone no place for one year airbus stock in the last year is up over 27% so do the math. sand p up 14.48%, dow up 8.9%, nasdaq up 14.95% both LMI and NOC up over 12% and almost 15% . Boeing shareholders are wasting billions of dollars and the stock buy back for 2013 is 2 billion so without that the stock price now would be much lower.

In 2002 -- five years after enacting its gun ban -- the Australian Bureau of Criminology acknowledged there is no correlation between gun control and the use of firearms in violent crime. In fact, the percent of murders committed with a firearm was the highest it had ever been in 2006 (16.3 percent), says the D.C. Examiner. Even Australia's Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research acknowledges that the gun ban had no significant impact on the amount of gun-involved crime: •In 2006, assault rose 49.2 percent and robbery 6.2 percent. •Sexual assault -- Australia's equivalent term for rape -- increased 29.9 percent. •Overall, Australia's violent crime rate rose 42.2 percent. Moreover, Australia and the United States -- where no gun-ban exists -- both experienced similar decreases in murder rates: •Between 1995 and 2007, Australia saw a 31.9 percent decrease; without a gun ban, America's rate dropped 31.7 percent. •During the same time period, all other violent crime indices increased in Australia: assault rose 49.2 percent and robbery 6.2 percent. •Sexual assault -- Australia's equivalent term for rape -- increased 29.9 percent. •Overall, Australia's violent crime rate rose 42.2 percent. •At the same time, U.S. violent crime decreased 31.8 percent: rape dropped 19.2 percent; robbery decreased 33.2 percent; aggravated assault dropped 32.2 percent. •Australian women are now raped over three times as often as American women. While this doesn't prove that more guns would impact crime rates, it does prove that gun control is a flawed policy. Furthermore, this highlights the most important point: gun banners promote failed policy regardless of the consequences to the people who must live with them, says the Examiner.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358466930793</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 18:55:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358467039039-423</Id><Topic><Title>The Riccaro Money Flow Quotient maintains short sell on the shares of BA.</Title><Username>rbg5r</Username><Timestamp>1358379467393</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 18:37:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i find it funny that once someone takes a position, anything contrary to that position gets met with brainless ridicule. you gave a great day.

I'll tell you whats wrong with your plastic AP and how to fix it. First a short story. I know about these batteries because of something Boeing was doing. This capability to soft wire your cell phone so they can look and listen even if the cell phone is turned off. Well Boeing did that to me for an long time (they still do it). They would turn it on for a while then off. Sometimes if they wanted to keep track with the GPS they would leave it on for longer periods of time. The cell phone battery would run down fast and get real hot. If you needed to use it and put it on the charger, it would get smoking hot. See where this is going. The batteries and system in the 787 are inadequate. Too small of battery for the use its going through, too much charging(rapid turnover) for the battery to stand. To fix it, you need more battery and strict limitations on the amount and rate of recharge. Now get some smart electrical engineer on this and kindly send me a fee for the services I have rendered. Or will you steal that also?</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1358469181976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 19:33:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358469272720-429</Id><Topic><Title>Obama has never denied it a clash between Israel and Obama</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1358456141941</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 15:55:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post......For those who say False Flag attacks never happen should google "USS Liberty"...I srael sank USS Liberty and tried to blame Arabs.....Reichstag Fire, 9-11, Gulf of Tonkin or Fast and Rurious....False Flag attacks ARE a huge tool in the arsenal of the New World Order....much of which is manipulated by Globalist Bankers ...some of whom have I sraeli influence.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358469272720</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 19:34:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358469504411-430</Id><Topic><Title>Jon Stewart Trashes NRA: They Must Be A Michael Moore-Run Covert Op To Make Gun Owners Look Stupid</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1358450607576</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 14:23:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Have you got a job yet or still sponging off the Government?

They don't think clearly or at all and they are only in it to enrich themselves. There is no such thing as an MBA running a company successfully. Especially a company that makes a complex system. So here we have been told for years of how hard it is to find a qualified CEO without paying them absurd compensation and it turns out they were always worthless (HP anyone). Just as I suspected all along. CEO pay should be tied to 20-40 times the average pay of a person that actually does the work period. No extra perks because they are such a genius which the PR generated by the CEO hype-sters wants you to believe. Over the last 40 years the CEO pay has run up to astronomical numbers and now this article from a pimp CEO magazine tells us that, no CEOs were not worth a dime of the money they were paid. Sure wall street loved them because those parasites that produce nothing love to make money from "investing" in stocks they have convinced CEO's to perform massive layoffs and outsource work so the share price can go up. Why do you think Jim McNerny and the BOD has authorized Boeing to spend 2 billion on a stock buy pack. Don't you think that money should be invested in Boeing. It is because the parasites on Wall Street pay CEO to gut and kill a productive company. Why does anyone think that paying a CEO 20 million dollars a year will cause the CEO to care about the company? What is his motivation to care? All his needs are taking care of for a life time in one year. It doesn't matter whether he/she runs the company into the ground or not. He doesn't even have to think. He just hires some outside consultant (with company money) to tell him what to do.</Msg><Username>zevach</Username><Timestamp>1358473934238</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:52:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358473991405-450</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing just caved to the SPEEA union demands</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358473304340</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:41:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For the 6 Boeing management enablers , how does that work for you now !

Boeing’s actions reiterate the company’s growing disrespect for the engineers and technical workers who are essential to working issues and restoring confidence in the 787.While the company agreed to extend parts of the existing contracts, the offers put retirement benefits for all 23,000 engineers and technical workers, including retiree medical, at risk. In addition, Boeing’s corporate negotiator said the company will end the pension for future employees. Although the offers contain improvements, both the Professional and Technical Negotiation Teams unanimously recommend rejection. “We are profoundly disappointed the company is taking advantage of our good-will offers to push through unwarranted cuts, put existing retiree benefits at risk and eliminate the pension for future employees,” said Ryan Rule, Professional Negotiation Team member. SPEEA members will vote on the company’s offers in the coming weeks. Ballots are likely to include a request to grant the Professional and Technical Negotiation Teams authority to call a strike. Boeing rejected SPEEA's offer after stating publicly that the company does not need SPEEA members for the FAA investigation or working the 787 issues. Last week, Mike Delaney, vice president of engineering for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said managers and engineers from other areas of the company could do the work. Aerospace industry analysts scoffed at this assertion because the 787 engineering work is performed by SPEEA engineers and technical workers. The company’s offers continue annual salary raise pools of 5 percent and maintain existing medical benefits. Boeing did agree to extend same-sex survivor pension benefits. SPEEA members rejected Boeing’s initial offer by 96 percent on Oct. 1, 2012. Today’s actions come after nearly a year of negotiations. In recent weeks, SPEEA members have been preparing in earnest for a major strike that could idle Boeing factories and send engineering and technical experts to the picket line. SPEEA represented engineers and technical workers are essential to solving the mounting issues with the 787, including assisting the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) investigation and restoring confidence in the 787. “Boeing corporate created the 787 problems by ignoring the warnings of the Boeing technical community,” said Joel Funfar, Technical Negotiation Team member. “Now, they propose to double down on their failed outsourcing strategy by outsourcing the engineering work required to solve the problems caused by previous rounds of outsourcing.” Negotiations, taking place at the SeaTac Hilton Hotel with the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), are ended. This negotiation process was tainted by numerous actions that are in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. Boeing has regularly tried to prevent members from discussing their working conditions with others and with SPEEA. The company engaged in unlawful surveillance of protected activity, confiscated pictures of members engaged in protected activity and has refused to provide information relevant to the negotiations. SPEEA and Boeing started meeting in April to negotiate new contracts for 15,550 engineers and 7,400 technical workers. In October, engineers rejected Boeing’s initial offer by 95.5 percent. Technical workers rejected the company’s offer by 97 percent. Existing contracts expired Nov. 25. Since negotiations resumed Jan. 9 after a month-long FMCS-imposed recess, union members have increased preparations for a possible strike. A 40-day strike in 2000 by SPEEA stopped deliveries and caused major factory and service bottlenecks at Boeing plants around the country. A local of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), SPEEA represents 26,300 aerospace professionals at Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, and Triumph Composite Systems, Inc. in Spokane, Wash.</Msg><Username>zevach</Username><Timestamp>1358474020711</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:53:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358474158721-452</Id><Topic><Title>The idea that the Sandy Hook massacre was faked is not only absurd, but also an insult to the victims</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1358381502396</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 19:11:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did you ever google "Sandy Hook - Batman" ...interesting...very interesting...but personally..I believe EVERYTHING my loving Government says</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358474158721</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:55:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358474179603-453</Id><Title>Boeing bows to SPEEA</Title><Msg>Jan 17 (Reuters) - Boeing Co agreed to extend the terms of its previous contract for 23,000 employees represented by an engineers union, except for new proposals that both parties agreed to during talks.

Maybe it is as simple as he just made it up to get some attention, or get onto Oprah or jerry sprringer or something....just saying There are so many holes in this story its actually insulting and the more "damage control" the press does by trying to convince everyone it really happened just tells us that it didn't happen. They've unleashed a beast with their stupidity and it intensifies all of the other holes in other shootings that seem to have the same pattern. That is very odd indeed, the evidence is on the video, you cant deny that by calling people crazy. Defiantly not a conspiracy any more is it lol. Wasn't it 6 children in the driveway?

Your other post that the system engineering may have been flawed is a good place to look. Soon they should be doing destructive analyses of the battery cells - the ones that failed and the ones that were in use in the same system (same aircraft and same circuit) and part of the same manufacturing "lot". Also, look at cells from other lots that have been in use this past year. Making Li-ion batteries work competently should not be that complex with all that has been learned over the past 40 years. All of the players have done this kind of work - though Securaplane seems to be somewhat of a wildcard. Apparently, the 787 is the first use of Li-ion batteries in a commercial aircraft and Securaplane therefore is doing this for the first time. A red flag to be sure. What is also different is the use. And that is what I was poking at. When you work the details of a system design, a reasonable "use case analysis" should be done for every case involving the system - in operations, maintenance, and repair. For example, you would not assume the design should only allow for initial installation and not also removal/re-installation of the engines. Therefore, your use cases should show both. And, consequently, you would design to both scenarios. In the case of the AC outlets for the passenger, the use cases should show individual use as well as aggregate (average and peak) use. Imagine that the "AC Outlet Use Cases" excluded unanticipated use such as connecting a high load device (like a vacuum cleaner, if that were permissible). It would be bad systems engineering to exclude the worst-case scenarios (such as excessive loads) simply because it is assumed to be not "likely" that a passenger would connect a hair dryer. Anyway, as crazy as that all seems, I would hope that Boeing delved that deep into the system to preclude such mis-operation. And, perhaps, they incorporated current limiting and disables to prevent misuse of the outlets. That is, if they thought about it.

The 787 draws a lot more power but the individual batteries are closer in size than you would think. The press release for the batteries reads very much like the Boeing one: The Cessna Citation CJ4, certified on March 12, 2010, is believed to be the first civil aircraft with a Lithium Ion main battery. The 26.4VDC, 44Ah Lithium Ion main battery weighs 54 lbs, a 35% weight saving over a Nickel-Cadmium battery. Using phosphate-based Lithium Ion cells, which have no positive feedback thermal runaway failure mode, system integration of the battery and aircraft architecture design is simpler. Electronics and software are needed to optimize life only, not to ensure safety. Emergency discharge with failed electronics is enabled with the selection of a less volatile chemistry, the use of an analog Module Management System for cell balancing and protection, and the use of a microcontroller-based digital Central Monitoring System that reports health. System safety failure hazard assessment is considered Major, and the battery software is certified to the requirements of RTCA DO-178B, Design Assurance Level C. New Battery Fault and Battery Fail annunciations supersede the conventional Battery Overtemperature messages to accommodate other non-temperature related failure modes. Heaters enable performance at cold temperatures while its aircraft-in-the-loop circuit ensures safety. The Lithium Ion battery and the Cessna Citation CJ4 electrical bus and avionics suite designs were integrated to optimize performance, safety, protection, and maintenance frequency. That's why it was surprising (and interesting) when a similar problem happened with the Cessna the fix was as simple as swapping out the Li-Ion with NiCad. Whether that is possible with the 787? I don't know. But I guarantee that a lot of people are working on evaluating the feasibility because that would be by far the cheapest and fastest solution with a lot of significance for the future direction of Boeing stock.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1358482326325</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 23:12:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358482541828-480</Id><Topic><Title>Why this stock is up?</Title><Username>holakonichiwa</Username><Timestamp>1358472106819</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:21:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simple.
