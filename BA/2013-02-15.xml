celebrated battle rifle manufacturers in America, was killed in a single-car accident under mysterious circumstances, a second well-known representative of the firearms industry was found dead. Initial reports said that on Jan. 6, 2013, 32-year-old Keith Ratliff, the producer of FPS Russia, a pro-gun and one of the most popular YouTube channels, was found tied up to a chair and shot in the back of the head in Franklin County, Georgia. Robbery did not appear to be the motive. But Brandon of Liberty &amp; Such writes that as more details emerge, one new fact seems to be that Ratliff was killed on a rural Georgia road, and not tied up in an office as earlier reported. He was armed at the time but somehow was not able to respond to the threat with his own firearms, which suggests that Ratliff knew the murderer. Later Chris Kyle..yet ANOTHER leading gun advocate was Breitbarted. For the record....I do not support the NRA...too many compromises with tthe second amendment. Larry Pratt and Gun Owners of America have done a FAR better job of defending the last line of defense in teh constitution.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360909636274</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 01:27:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360910167749-15</Id><Topic><Title>An insane tin foil hat wearing conspiracy Theorist</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360844701854</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 07:25:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its just another conspiracy theorist ...even though they have the LAPD stating on tape that they are "lighting the Burners and the fire is set"...and "lets burn this Mother F..er down" This country is morally bankrupt now.....</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360910167749</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 01:36:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360910586919-16</Id><Topic><Title>Can you name the Presidents who were Veterans?</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1360888175182</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 19:29:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You might want to cut FDR a little slack, what with that polio thing.

Unfortunately, even after thousands of years of politicians telling people what they want to hear; the people still beg to be told the same old lies. We don’t learn. In prime political fashion, Barack Obama–in his State of The Union–told the American people what they wanted to hear. “It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.” Wow, what an incredible thing! Barack Obama believes that a bigger government is not, in fact, what we need. I guess we should just take him at his word; not looking to his record at all. The man who–through Obamacare–engineered the biggest economic takeover since FDR; promoted multiple stimuli that failed to incite a recover; bailed out the auto-industry (GM still owes taxpayers $25 billion); and is playing Robin Hood by raising taxes on the top two percent, must really believe that bigger government is not the solution! Well, that takes care of that. Let’s break this down. When a President looks at the healthcare crisis, and rather than implementing basic, common sense solutions–like cross-state insurance, Tort reform, and means testing–he socializes medicine; he may favor bigger government. When a President looks at a $16 trillion debt, and rather than cutting back spending; he raises taxes on the top job creators; he may favor bigger government. And when a President issues 23 executive orders regarding guns, and surrounds himself with children while he signs the bill; he may be a dictator–I mean, he may favor bigger government. Barack Obama tells us what we want to hear, then moves right in the opposite direction. Whether or not he believes what he says is irrelevant. If what he says isn’t true, he is either lying or gravely misinformed. If he is misinformed–a nice way to say ignorant–he is unfit to be President. If he is lying, he is being treasonous.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360910899244</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 01:48:19

Airbus said it had taken the decision to prevent further delays in initial deliveries of the A350 amid uncertainty over whether investigations into Boeing's battery problems would lead to changes in regulations. Reuters had reported that Airbus was considering such a move to limit development risks on its $15 billion airliner. "We want to mature the Lithium-Ion technology but we are making this decision today to protect the A350's entry into service schedule," a spokeswoman said. Industry executives, insurers and safety officials had told Reuters the technology's predictability was being questioned at senior levels as investigators struggle to find the cause of incidents that led to the grounding of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.

Both are concerned with restraining the power to oppress, but they take opposite positions on the source of the oppressive power and remedy. The right is correct that government power is the problem, and the left is correct that private power is the problem. Therefore, whether power is located within the government or private sectors cannot reduce, constrain, or minimize power. How does the progressive Obama Regime differ from the tax-cut, deregulation Bush/Cheney Regime? Both are complicit in the maximization of executive branch power and in the minimization of citizens’ civil liberties and, thus, of the people’s power. Did the progressive Obama reverse the right-wing Bush’s destruction of habeas corpus and due process? No. Obama further minimized the people’s power. Bush could throw us in prison for life without proof of cause. Obama can execute us without proof of cause. They do this in the name of protecting us from terrorism, but not from their terrorism. Americans who have no experience with, or knowledge of, tyranny believe that only terrorists will experience the unchecked power of the state. They will believe this until it happens to them, or their children, or their friends. The view of human nature held by the right and the left depends on whether the human nature is located in the private sector or the government sector (“public sector”). For the right (and for libertarians) human nature in the private sector is good and serves the public; in the government sector human nature is evil and oppressive. For the left, it is the opposite. As the same people go back and forth from one sector to the other, one marvels at the transformations of their character and morality. A good man becomes evil, and an evil man becomes good, depending on the location of his activities. One of my professors, James M. Buchanan who won a Nobel Prize, pointed out that people are just as self-serving whether they are in the private sector or in government. The problem is how to constrain government and private power to the best extent possible. Our Founding Fathers’ solution was to minimize the power of government and to rely on contending factions among private interests to prevent the rise of an oligarchy. In the event that contending private interests failed, the oligarchy that seized the government would not have much public power to exercise. The Founding Fathers’ design more or less worked except for interludes of civil war and economic crisis until the cold war built up the power of government and the deregulation of the Clinton and Bush presidencies built up the power of private interests. It all came together with the accumulation of new, dictatorial powers in the executive branch in the name of protecting us from terrorists and with deregulation’s creation of powerful corporations “too big to fail.” Now we have a government, whose elected members are beholden to a private oligarchy, consisting of the military/security complex, Wall Street and the financial sector, the Israel Lobby, agribusiness, pharmaceuticals, and the energy, mining, and timber businesses, with the power to shut down people’s protests at their exploitation by robber barons and government alike. Vast amounts of government debt have been added to taxpayers’ burdens in order to fight wars that only benefit the military/security complex and the I srae l Lobby. More vast amounts have been added in order to force taxpayers to cover the reckless gambling bets of the financial sector. Taxpayers are denied interest on their savings in order to protect the balance sheets of a corrupt financial sector. Legitimate protestors are brutalized by police and equated by Homeland Security with “domestic extremists,” defined by Homeland Security as a close relation to terrorists. Today Americans are not safe from government or private power and suffer at the hands of both. What can be done? From within probably very little. The right blames the left, and the left blames the right. The two sides are locked in ideological combat while power grows in the private and public sectors, but not the benevolent power that the two ideologies suppose. Instead, a two-headed power monster has risen. If the power that has been established over the American people is to be shattered, it will come from outside. The Federal Reserve’s continuing monetization of the enormous debt that Washington is generating can destroy the dollar’s exchange value, sending up interest rates, collapsing the bond, stock, and real estate markets, and sinking the economy into deep depression at a time in history when Americans have exhausted their savings and are deeply in debt with high levels of joblessness and homelessness. The rise in import prices from a drop in the dollar’s exchange value would make survival an issue for a large percentage of the population. Overnight the US could transition from superpower to third world penitent begging for a rescue program. Who would grant it? The Russians encircled by US military bases and whose internal serenity is disrupted by inflows of American money to dissident groups in an effort to destabilize the Russian State? The Chinese, the government of which is routinely denounced by a hypocritical Washington for human rights abuses while Washington surrounds China with newly constructed military bases and new deployments of troops and naval vessels? South America, a long-suffering victim of Washington’s oppression? Europe, exhausted by conflicts and by Washington’s organization of them as puppet states and use of them as mercenaries in Washington’s wars for hegemony? No country, except perhaps the bought-and-paid-for puppets of Britain, Canada, Australia, and Japan, would come to Washington’s aid. In the ensuing collapse, the power of Washington and the power of the private robber barons would evaporate. Americans would suffer, but they would be rid of the power that has been established over them and that has changed them from a free people to exploited serfs. This is, perhaps, an optimistic conclusion, but those relatively few Americans who are aware need some hope. This is the best that I can do. The majority of Americans remain trapped in their unawareness, which implies a bleak future. The insouciance of the American population is its downfall.

The F.B.I. would not comment on the investigation, which formally began on Thursday evening. The Boeing Company reported the wire damage to the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday, but has not said whether it considered the damage deliberate, calling it only ''suspicious.'' But one person familiar with the company's internal investigation said the planes were sabotaged. ''We know something happened, and we eliminated the chance that it is unintentional,'' the person said. While wires are often bent or stretched during production, the recent cases involved wires being damaged intentionally in a variety of ways, the person said. When bundles of suspicious-looking wires were found, the person said, ''that's when we knew this was deliberate.''

Despite having the toughest gun control laws in the country Chicago remains one of the most violent and deadliest cities. A concealed carry law will make Illinois better and safer. Gun control advocates just need to look at Virginia. Between 2006-2011 gun sales went up by 73% and at the same time gun-related violent crimes fell 24%. Virginia Commonwealth University professor Thomas R. Baker, who specializes in research methods and criminology, said this proves that more guns do not in fact cause more violence. "While there is a wealth of academic literature attempting to demonstrate the relationship between guns and crime, a very simple and intuitive demonstration of the numbers seems to point away from the premise that more guns leads to more crime, at least in Virginia," said Baker. Baker examined six years of data from the Virginia Firearms Transaction Center that broke down the number of gun transactions for every federally licensed firearm dealer in Virginia. Background checks went up from 243,251 in 2006 to 420,829 in 2011. In 2006 there were 23,431 violent crimes in Virginia and dropped to 18,196 in 2011. Handgun purchases increased 112% between 2006-2011 and violent crimes committed by people using handguns dropped by 22%. Guns are a major part of Switzerland’s culture. Instead of a standing army they have a militia. Men between the ages of 20 and 30 are put into the militia and undergo military and weapons training, which means Switzerland has one of the highest gun ownership rates in the world. Yet, Switzerland has a low crime rate. In 2010 there were only 40 gun homicides. It’s estimated that two to three million guns are in circulation, but the number cannot be confirmed since there is not a national firearms register. The men are required to keep their guns in their home. Enlisted personnel receive the 5.56x45mm Sig 550 rifle while officers, medical and postal personnel could receive that gun, but also the 9mm SIG-Sauer P220 semi-automatic pistol. When their service is over the can opt to keep their weapons and other items. The rifle is sent to a weapons factory where the fully automatic function is removed, thus making it a semi-automatic or self-loading rifle. These same people keep hunting rifles and pistols in their houses as well. Gun control advocates tried to push through tougher gun control, but they failed. 20 of the 26 cantons and 56.3% of the voters rejected the idea of keeping the guns in armories. Shooting is a very popular sport in Switzerland with many towns and villages meeting for target practice at least once a week. Over 200,000 attend national annual marksmanship competitions every year.</Msg><Username>generaljackripper</Username><Timestamp>1360942843428</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 10:40:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360943052711-66</Id><Topic><Title>LEAKED BA Report Exposes FRAUD?!

Did you come up with your attitudes, opinions and beliefs on your own, or are they continually being shaped and molded by someone else? Could it be possible that you and everyone around you is actually hooked into a real life version of “the matrix” that is constantly defining your reality for you? Sadly, the truth is that almost all of us have willingly hooked ourselves into a colossal media system that literally tells us what to think. In the United States today, the average American watches 153 hours of television a month. We also spend huge amounts of time watching movies, surfing the Internet, reading books and magazines, playing video games and listening to music. Many Americans are so addicted to being “connected” that they will actually become physically uncomfortable if they are at home and there is total silence. Unfortunately, as I pointed out in a previous article, somewhere around 90 percent of the “information” that we are allowing to be endlessly pumped into our heads is owned by just 6 gigantic media corporations. So could it be possible that the thousands of hours of “news and entertainment” that you are allowing these gigantic corporations to fill your head with each year is having an effect on you? Does the mainstream media have more control over you than you ever dreamed possible? If you want to continue on in blissful ignorance, stop reading now, but if you want to take “the red pill”, keep on reading because the further down the rabbit hole you go, the stranger that things get. When you go to work or to school in the morning, what is everyone talking about? Usually, people are talking about something that they saw on television or that they heard about in the news. In our society today, the limited interactions that we do have with other people are usually defined by our mutual connection to the media. The mainstream media literally defines for us what is important and what is not. If the mainstream media does not talk about something, then it simply does not matter. I don’t know how many times over the years I have heard someone tell me some version of the following statement: ”If that was true we would have heard about it on the news.” Has anyone ever said something similar to you? The funny thing is that most of the time I won’t even mention something important that I may have heard in one of my articles unless I can back it up with a “mainstream source”, and I don’t even trust the mainstream media. I know that the mainstream media often distorts the facts and often tells outright lies, but I regularly link to them because that gives my articles more “credibility” in the eyes of those that are still fully hooked into the matrix. In a world where the big media corporations have so much power, is there any hope for us? As long as the big corporations that control the media are dominating and controlling the conversation, is there any chance that there will ever be a mass awakening among the American people? Our young people seem particularly addicted to being constantly “connected” to the media matrix that is being constructed all around us. The following is a brief excerpt from a recent article by Daniel Taylor… According to a 2010 LA Times report, young people spend on average 53 hours a week watching TV, playing video games, and sitting at the computer. Facebook users spend about 15 hours a month on the social networking site. People are walking – and driving – blindly while texting, sometimes walking into fountains and evenfalling off cliffs. Wow – our young people spend more than 200 hours a month connected to the mainstream media? But we only have about 480 waking hours a month to work with. If they are being exposed to that amount of continuous propaganda, what hope do our young people have? In the old days, kids actually played with each other in the streets and adults actually left their homes to interact with one another. But these days we spend nearly all of our time sitting passively in our homes staring at flickering screens. Is that a sign of a healthy society? We were created to be social creatures. We were designed to love and to be loved. But these days people “love” their favorite sports teams or they “love” their favorite television shows but we have an increasingly difficult time having real relationships with each other. Meanwhile, the global elite rely on the mainstream media to keep us distracted and to control the boundaries of public discourse. Most of the time, the mainstream media focuses on the latest celebrity scandal or the latest dogfights between the Republicans and the Democrats and they systematically ignore many of the more important things that are taking place out there. Let me just give you one example of how the mainstream media shapes the news. For decades, there was almost a complete and total media blackout on the Bilderberg Group meetings that happen every year. Top newspaper executives from the United States would actually attend these meetings, but then their newspapers would not say a single word about them. If anyone out there did bring up “the Bilderberg Group”, they were dismissed as wacky “conspiracy theorists” and were told that it simply does not exist. Of course now we all know that it does exist, although the mainstream media in the U.S. still mostly ignores it. In fact, this has been by design. The following is what David Rockefeller is alleged to have said during a Bilderberg Group meeting back in 1991… We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. … It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries. Even today, many prominent “journalists” in the U.S. mock people when they bring up the Bilderberg Group. For example, Lawrence O’Donnellof MSNBC says that he is “way too lazy” to look into the Bilderberg Group and that he “doesn’t know about it, so it must not exist”. For much more on the connection between the mainstream media and the global elite, please see this article: “Who Runs The World? Solid Proof That A Core Group Of Wealthy Elitists Is Pulling The Strings“. Instead of telling us what is really going on in the world, the mainstream media keeps us endlessly distracted. The following are just a few of the headlines that can be found on the front pages of major mainstream news sites right now… -College student creates condom delivery service -Michael Douglas is feeling ‘good’ -Golf tournament delayed by kangaroos -Rock ‘n’ roll hamburger experience -Lady Gaga cancels tour, set for surgery Wow – those are some examples of some really hard-hitting journalism right there. So why do most Americans continue to fall for this nonsense? Sadly, part of the reason is because we have become so “dumbed down” as a society. Recently, the Guardian conducted an evaluation of the reading level of every State of the Union address in U.S. history. What they found is that Barack Obama’s State of the Union addresses have had the second lowest reading level average in history, and that in general the reading levels of the speeches have been significantly declining over time. But it is not just our presidents that appear to be getting stupider. The truth is that our public education system is a total joke at this point. Many of our high school students are as dumb as a rock, and if you can believe it, 23 percent of all Americans cannot even read beyond a fourth-grade level. Of course the elite are quite pleased with this, because a stupid public is a public that is easier to dominate. When a large segment of the population can barely read and is accustomed to letting others do their thinking for them, it becomes easier to lie. For example, on Thursday Paul Krugman of the New York Times made the following statement… “Growing dependence on government is mostly a myth” Of course most of you that are reading this know that is a flat-out lie. The charts in this article clearly show that the number of Americans on food stamps is at an all-time high and the percentage of the population that is on food stamps is at an all-time high. Back in 1983, less than a third of all Americans lived in a household that got money from the federal government each month, Now, an all-time high 49 percent of all Americans live in a home where at least one person receives money from the government each month. For many more stats and charts that demonstrate the stunning growth of government dependence, please see this article and this article. Sadly, the truth doesn’t seem to matter too much to the media these days. The mainstream media tends to be incredibly arrogant, and most of the time they don’t even pretend to be “objective” or “neutral” anymore. Fortunately, more Americans than ever are becoming dissatisfied with the mainstream media and are starting to seek out alternative sources of information. According to a recent Gallup poll, the level of trust that the American public has in the mainstream media is now at an all-time low. So perhaps there is hope after all.

First, he invests in a bunch of liberal causes, helps get liberals elected to positions of power, gets them convinced that social justice depends on spending a country into oblivion. Shorts that country's currency, backs up the truck and rakes it in. He did it in France and the UK and now he's done it in the good ol'e USA. I have to admire his ingenuity even if his ethics stink. What’s amazing is how he’s been able to invest so heavily in the stupidity of liberalism, watch thousand of liberal’s lives being destroyed, make billions in the process and still be admired as a patron saint of liberal causes. You just have to admire that.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1360952221474</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 13:17:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360952587253-95</Id><Topic><Title>Soros Makes $1 Billion Since November on Currency War...</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1360952221474</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 13:17:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For got to mention, his latest triumph has been shorting the Japanese Yen.

This was up 6% in value terms in the fourth quarter to $66.2 billion, the highest fourth quarter on record. Global gold demand in the fourth quarter of 2012 was up 4% to 1,195.9 tonnes. Central bank buying for 2012 rose by 17% over 2011 to some 534.6 tonnes. As far as central bank gold buying, this was the highest level since 1964. Central bank purchases stood at 145 tonnes in the fourth quarter. That is up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2011, and the eighth consecutive quarter in which central banks were net purchasers of gold. The World Gold Council said: Central banks’ move from net sellers of gold, to net buyers that we have seen in recent years, has continued apace. The official sector purchases across the world are now at their highest level for almost half a century. If you want to know why Silver Wheaton Corp. (NYSE: SLW) is changing its mix to gold and silver, now you know. Investors of the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEMKT: GLD) and ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (NYSEMKT: SGOL) will want to pay attention to lower gold demand. There were some interesting observations: While Indian full year demand was down 12% on the previous year, the fourth quarter jump of 41% to 261.9 tonnes saved the day as jewelry and investment demand hit a six-quarter high. Demand for jewelry was up 35% to reach 153.0 tonnes, and strong retail demand led to 108.9 tonnes of investment buying. Chinese demand was flat due to the economic slowdown, but the slowdown there was said to be shorter than expected. Total demand was up 1% in the fourth quarter to 202.5 tonnes. Jewelry demand was up 1% to 137.0 tonnes in the fourth quarter, and investment demand was up 2% to 65.5 tonnes. The fourth-quarter 2012 average gold price reached a record level of $1,721.8 an oz., up 1% on the previous record average price in the third quarter of 2011. The fourth-quarter 2012 supply of gold from mines was up 2% year-on-year, while recycling was down 5% against the same period. Investment demand (the sum of ETFs and total bar and coin demand) was 424.7 tonnes, down 8% compared to the same quarter last year, but was 19% above the five-year quarterly average. Demand for ETFs and similar products in the fourth quarter was down by 16% on the corresponding quarter in 2011 to 88.1 tonnes, but was up by 51% on the full year. Jon C.

Remember this about rich billioinaire liberals like Buffet, and Soros. They no longer want to take risk. They start out becoming millionaires, and when they get to be billionaires they don't want to compete, and risk losing any of their vast wealth. That is why they support liberal causes, and support Obama. Obama gives them protection, favortism for all the money the contribute...called crony capitalism.

Jackson’s wife, Sandi, faces legal troubles under the arrangement. Formal charges against Jesse Jackson Jr. could be filed as soon as Friday and Tuesday at the latest. His plea has also implicated his wife, leading to tax fraud charges against her. The filing at the U.S District Courthouse in Washington will not require a court appearance by either Jackson. Plea agreements will be submitted to the court clerk and assigned to judges, who will set initial court dates. As CBS 2 Chief Correspondent Jay Levine reported last week, Jesse Jackson Jr. will plead guilty to one felony count of misuse of campaign funds and then let a federal judge determine his punishment, which according to the agreement could range from probation to five year in prison. Jackson’s deal calls for him to repay hundreds of thousands of dollars spent for things like travel and meals with a mistress and a $40,000 men’s Rolex watch he bought for himself. Jackson’s resignation from Congress was also part of the deal. But Jackson’s pleading guilty to using campaign funds for personal expenses could expose Sandi, his campaign manager, to tax-fraud charges. The congressman’s guilty plea says Sandi knew about improper purchases that apparently include breakfast snacks, cosmetic services, even beds purchased for campaign workers. Sandi Jackson is expected to accept responsibility for some things because, as the congressman’s campaign manager, she signed the tax returns. Both Jacksons could face penalties ranging from probation to jail time. But it’s hard to believe that, with two young children at home, both would be sent to prison.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1360955393752</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 14:09:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360955814888-108</Id><Title>Pelosi: Congressional pay cut undermines dignity of the job</Title><Msg>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that she opposes a cut in congressional pay because it would diminish the dignity of lawmakers' jobs.

At the same time a union is explioting the situaltion by filing a complaint with the NLRB.. Well no - its the management who is intimidating the employees- The Boeing Company was charged Wednesday (Feb. 13) with new Unfair Labor Practices (ULP) after company security, acting on management orders, banned engineers and technical workers from leafleting at the Everett factory. The actions are in addition to reports of managers holding mandatory meetings with employees to interrogate and intimidate them regarding the current contract votes by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), IFPTE Local 2001. “We are extremely disappointed in the company’s misconduct,” said Ray Goforth, SPEEA executive director. “Boeing’s contract proposals should pass or fail on their merits. This illegal intimidation must cease immediately.” Ballots were mailed Feb. 5 and will be counted Tuesday (Feb. 19) to determine if 15,550 engineers and 7,400 technical workers accept Boeing’s latest contract offers. Union leaders are recommending members reject the offers and grant their negotiation teams authority to call a strike if subsequent negotiations fail. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects employees’ rights to engage in concerted (union) activity and prohibits employers from interfering in these activities. Filed at the Seattle office of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the new charge reads: “The employer has interfered with, threatened and restrained its employees, members of the Charging Party’s bargaining unit, in the exercise of their Section 7 rights by, among other things, interrogating employees about how they are voting on the proposed contract and preventing employees from passing out leaflets related to the upcoming vote.” These charges are in addition to earlier charges (filed Jan. 2) the SPEEA filed after company personnel photographed union members marching at its Everett factory to support efforts to negotiate new labor contracts. Employer surveillance of union activities has consistently been ruled illegal by the NLRB because it has a tendency to intimidate employees into not exercising their rights to engage in union activities. An earlier charge by SPEEA filed in October, and now waiting action by the NLRB, relates to Boeing seizing employee cameras and photographs of the protected union marches, along with videotaping the events. Contract talks started in April 2012. In October, engineers rejected Boeing’s initial offer by 95.5 percent. Technical workers rejected the company’s offer by 97 percent. Existing contracts expired Nov. 25. A local of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), SPEEA represents 26,560 aerospace professionals at Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas, and Triumph Composite Systems, Inc. in Spokane, Wash.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1360962853117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 16:14:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360963359031-126</Id><Topic><Title>Yes, Virginia, there is... another spartacus</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1360889714897</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 19:55:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No man escapes when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails.

By the numbers, it was a terrific quarter and year for the jet maker. Most eyes, however, are affixed to two bad news stories. Most obviously, the 787 fleet remains out of commission as investigators try to get to the bottom of their mild "catching-on-fire" problem, while within the company, tensions between management and engineers are coming to a head. First, the good news. Sales grew 14% for the fourth quarter and 19% for the year, largely driven by increased deliveries of pricey wide-body aircraft. Core operating earnings (adjusted for a tax settlement in 2011) rose 9% and 13% for the quarter and year, respectively. Strong order growth and delivery execution in the year also allowed Boeing to regain the top spot as the largest aircraft manufacturer, which in recent years has been occupied by Airbus. Boeing also continued the strategically important pivot away from defense and toward commercial airplanes, ending the year with over 60% of revenue coming from commercial planes. Boeing's order backlog continued to grow in 2012, and portends an even stronger reliance on commercial planes: At $319 billion, commercial planes make up over 80% of the $390 billion backlog. On the other hand, as we've discussed before, the delivery of new wide-body planes like the 787 drives gross margins down initially because the first block of sales goes toward repaying development costs rather than the bottom line. As a result, operating margins for both the quarter and the year slipped slightly. Sparks on a plane Of course, all this positive financial news is undercut by the well-publicized global grounding of the 787 Dreamliner, a plane that more than any other holds Boeing's future. On the earnings call, McNerney assured analysts that the company was cooperating fully with the FAA investigation and that getting the Dreamliner back on track was the company's top priority. However, he reiterated that the production schedule for the 787 was unchanged, indicating a belief that battery problems will be trivial to solve and the manufacturing process won't need to be changed. I would note, here, that McNerney was similarly confident that failures on the 787 wouldn't affect the airworthiness of the plane, dismissing problems as "normal squawks" shortly before the entire fleet was deemed unsafe to fly. I continue to expect significant obstacles in scaling up production in order to meet demand. No nerds, no birds Even more worrying is the growing friction between management and engineers. Boeing wants to transition new hires away from a defined benefit pension plan and into a defined contribution plan, and this is sensible. Nobody can make absolute guarantees about the future, and employees should take some responsibility for their own retirement. However, Boeing has gone too far. When the engineering and technical workers' union contract expired in November, Boeing's new offer was frankly insulting. After a year in which Boeing's engineers had finally pulled off the delivery of the most technologically advanced plane ever made – an achievement for which McNerney himself received a 34% raise – Boeing offered its engineers and technical workers raises between 2% and 3%, compared to the previous contract rate of 5%. It astounds me that McNerney thinks his own work became 34% more valuable, while the people who actually built the plane should get "rewarded" with a worse contract. Unsurprisingly, the union took this as a slap in the face, and rejected the contract. Boeing has upped its offer several times, out of necessity, and is now offering the 5% raise that the union wanted in the first place, but through its heavy-handed bargaining position the company has not only alienated, but actually infuriated, the union. Union members refused the contract almost unanimously, even demonstrating against Boeing management using the slogan "no nerds, no birds." Union members are currently voting on a strike, which could be approved as soon as Feb. 19. Despite denials by management, I believe a strike would assuredly prevent the company from executing its planned production increase and drag the investigation into the 787 battery problems to a halt. More generally, Boeing's strength as a company stems entirely from its people. Boeing doesn't just need happy, working engineers to solve the battery problem, it will need them for big jobs like completing design of the 787-9, creating the 787-10, reengineering the 777 – really, creating any new product it ever wishes to make. At it's heart, Boeing is nothing more than the efforts of its engineers. McNerney has said that his top priority is fixing the battery problem, but that's nonsensical because, of course, he can't do that himself. His – and Boeing's – top priority needs to be keeping the talent happy. That they're not doing so should worry investors. Boeing has a multitrillion dollar market opportunity ahead, but the company's execution problems, as well as emerging competitors, raise questions over whether Boeing will live up to its shareholder responsibilites.</Msg><Username>ronanderson727</Username><Timestamp>1360981455161</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 21:24:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360982453197-166</Id><Topic><Title>Cornel West - Obama a 'war criminal'</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1360979574017</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 20:52:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dr. West mentioned that Obama has killed over 200 innocent children.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1360982453197</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 21:40:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360982743219-167</Id><Topic><Title>Cornel West - Obama a 'war criminal'</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1360979574017</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 20:52:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hear very little about what's going on in Afghanistan by the Liberal Media since Obama's been our Illegal Immigrant President.
