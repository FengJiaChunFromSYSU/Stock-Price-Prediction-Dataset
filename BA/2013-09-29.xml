Thorac Seattle 1953 comments September 28, 2013 at 10:18 AMRating: (9) (3) Report abuse To understand this incident we need to go back to 1996. Boeing (Phil Condit) had decided to buy McDonnell Douglas Airplane Co., and had MASSIVELY oversold the production of the entire Boeing Co AND it's suppliers in order to drive up the value of the stock in order to buy MDC, the MDC acquistion deal was done in Boeing stock, NOT cash. This was a fatal mistake, as it made John McDonnell and Harry Stonecipher the two largest individual stockholders and allowed them to take over the BOD and the CEO position (Stonecipher, a despot by any standard) deposed Condit as CEO.. ****</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1380429099924</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 00:31:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380429546382-2</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh: Bin Laden Raid “One Big Lie”</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380327374526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then why not learn to spell his name, Loon?</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380429546382</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 00:39:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380429578123-3</Id><Title>It will GAP DOWN NEXT Week looking at the CHART.....</Title><Msg>Dreamliner has been caught with some many issues....

So very wrong and the stupid one. The GOP/Tea Party understands and is fully aware of what a democracy is and therein lies what the true problem is for our country and that is you and the Democrats/Obamabots don't understand that we are not a democracy but a constitutional republic. There is a difference between a republic and a democracy and once a republic goes down the path of becoming a democracy it is only a matter of time before it becomes a socialist state. But the spoken goal of Obama is to fundamentally transform America and that makes me sad and fearful for our future. But I am hopeful that America will survive Obama and that hope currently lies with House of Representatives to check Obama. We are not a democracy where the minority has no protection or recourse from the omnipotent majority but a republic that protects the God-given unalienable rights and liberties of all the people in general as per the constitutional structure that our founding fathers built into our republic.</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1380438040039</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 03:00:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380447279795-7</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh: Bin Laden Raid “One Big Lie”</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380327374526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hersh exposed the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, he got the Abu Ghraib pictures of American soldiers brutalising Iraqi prisoners, broke the False Flag attempt by #$%$ Cheney (who wanted to start a war by dressing up Navy Seals to make them look like Iranians who would fire on their own Navv) and was instrumental in breaking the Edward Snowden/NSA affair.

Ventura will fly to New York this Wednesday to appear on Stern’s Sirius XM show, during which Ventura will formally request that Stern join him on the ticket. Ventura told the Alex Jones Show that he is deadly serious about running for the White House with Stern as his VP. Due to Ventura’s refusal to entertain the notion of taking money from special interests, Stern, whose radio show brings in around $100 million a year, will be in charge of fundraising. Although Ventura had to quit his radio show when he ran for Governor of Minnesota in order to comply with FCC regulations, Stern will not have to quit his current show because satellite radio is not subject to the same rules as terrestrial radio. However, Stern has indicated he will probably quit his current show in 2015 anyway, leaving the path clear for a presidential campaign to begin the same year. Off air, Ventura told Jones that Stern is one of the smartest people he knows and that his libertarian mindset make the two a perfect combination. It is likely that Ventura and Stern will attempt to secure the Libertarian Party nomination, which in 2012 was won by former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson. Stern previously ran for Governor of New York as a libertarian candidate in 1994, promising to fix the roads and repeal the death penalty.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380456662678</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 08:11:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380457082791-11</Id><Topic><Title>enough already about norwegian's downed dreamliner,every article geeze</Title><Username>skipaway</Username><Timestamp>1380380439990</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 11:00:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>elonmusk909, fred.james48 and a host of other IDs are all the same person, a guy who used to post as waynedickenson941.

Your anger at me for telling the truth is so great you just cant stand me.too bad for you don.Nobody cared who Mark Twain was but they loved Huck Finn another pseudonym ! did you agree with how MDC took over Boeing on phil Condit's stock purchase which led to his removal from Boeing BTW he paid way to much for a failed and bankrupt MDC and nothing he got worked, example while the JSF on paper was close,it looked so bad on that alone the DOD was never going to buy it a pregnant guppy looking failure! the enemy would have died laughing at it .. And the way the 737 got built with poor quality due to Phil exaggerating the production capacity to pump the stock price at the time Did transfer to allowing a bunch of workers into Boeing untrained., unskilled with little ability. I remember as a QA worker catching a newby who was not torqueing a fastener and when I asked him why it was loose. the newby said the lockwire holds it in position. wow I said that is a critical torque and the lockwire is only a backup safety feature if this fastener comes off the rudder could fail. He refused to torques it. I had to get the manufacturing supervisor to buy off on it and make a note on the pickup that the employee should be trained. I asked for a line check on every plane he worked that job on and it was denied. This was a day job and did not get inspected so I had to pick it up on swing shift. Who knows how many of these fasteners left the factory without a torque , just a finger tight. I do know several 737 planes crashed due to hard over rudder problems and most were due to the piston jam , but at least one crashed and that fastener backed off and the plane crashed into the ocean killing all on board it was that newbys work I bet.</Msg><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1380471765553</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:22:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380471989799-23</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380470612262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not sure where that one went but here is the quote of the last 6 Months: "“Let’s repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens,” Bachman People will die if this vote pass's</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380471989799</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:26:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380472169213-24</Id><Topic><Title>OK today its back to another problem with the LOT 787, the lemon saga of outsourcing continues and will never end</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380470139934</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 11:55:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wond is own</Msg><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1380472169213</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:29:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380472585695-25</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380470612262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She's almost as nuts as you are, Spart,</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380472585695</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:36:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380473274817-26</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380470612262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"She's almost as nuts as you are, Spart," Now THAT'S the quote of the day!</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380473274817</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:47:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380473317664-27</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380470612262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>P.S.

I worked full tiem all the way through college maintained a 3.7gpa and never took aloan to get through .Boeing, yep as I was promoted up in the company I did start as a mechanic on the 747 remember you doubted I was an incredible too, your doubt is only beat by your anger with me for telling the truth about Boeing and how much better TSLA and ACAD is and how much a fool you were on IGZ and how I used you for the AAPLE gains for any reader that came to the message board and yes I know your answer you were not a member under your current pseudonym then. ha ha ha as a con artist blending truth with fiction must make you think it works for you nope as I have said any reply to me and the mention of TSLA and ACAD just fuels my stock up the chart . did you miss the part about how MDC was purchased by Boeing stock and that made Mr M and Stonecipher the ruling members fo the BOD and led to Phil Condit being shown the door ! Same th and why Boeing lost control of the Boeing company to MDC ? yep you missed it .</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380473416768</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:50:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380473769529-32</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking: Jesse Ventura and Howard Stern to team up for 2016 Libertarian Presidential Run</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380456662678</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 08:11:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All true...at least they are Americans and not Kenyan Community Organizers.....At this point ..as America teeters on total collapse we need a flush of the system...get rid of the career politicians beholden to the New World Order banks and big interests..Stern and Ventura would at least know America needs to get rid of the corruption.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380473769529</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:56:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380473775335-33</Id><Title>Best to put elonmust909 and fred.james48 on ignore</Title><Msg>1) You want to be heard first respect others for what they have to say, 2) don't call a person immature because they have an opinion that you don't agree with, 3) Airbus is not perfect either, yet you ignore their imperfections.</Msg><Username>morisretired</Username><Timestamp>1380473775335</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:56:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380473822397-34</Id><Topic><Title>2011 in-flight 737 fuselage tear blamed on poor workmanship and how Boeing became MD</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380404911401</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 17:48:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lets bump this article on how MDC took over Boeing for donshuper50, vierzig_nachten,spartacus99991 and cbx6cylinder they are so angry with me now ha ha ha remember TSLA and ACAD and Airbus are better stocks than boeing</Msg><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1380473822397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:57:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380473912354-35</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380470612262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Being called the "Ducks" instills fear in all opponents, I'm sure.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380473912354</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:58:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380474018481-36</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380470612262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep drinking the fluoridated water and keep getting your vaccines Raven...Your getting real observable results</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380474018481</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 13:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380474348609-37</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380470612262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you knew how much it rained in Eugene, OR, it would make perfect sense.

A lot of this can probably be laid to the large number of vendors or subcontractors used to supply many of the components and sections of the plane. It is difficult to get all those workers to care as much about the product as the workers whose name is on the product. Some of the original suppliers that furnished parts for the 787 have already gone out of business or been incorporated by others.

I know I have never said Airbus was perfect I just state the facts, Airbus stock is better than Boeing stock and then give the reasons why airbus stock is better than Boeing stock, it is mainly due to the 787 airplane and once more, if you disagree read hart-smith first, that take me out of the picture, but it is the same reason. For Boeing the future is the 787, it is a failure of outsourcing and will not work- ever, that is the cornerstone for the company going forward. morisretied and it is a failure so far, behind schedule over cost, then grounded, and now a service nightmare for the customer , all true .</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380476201762</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 13:36:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380476300665-45</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380470612262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let it fail on its own? ..... you may for once be right</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380476300665</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 13:38:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380476391337-46</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380470612262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Ducks have been a force to be reckoned with the last few years. 100% chance of rain today.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1380476391337</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 13:39:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380477482279-47</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh: Bin Laden Raid “One Big Lie”</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380327374526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You poor man.

Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge. By April 1993, the Department of Veterans Affairs had only compensated 486 victims, although it had received disability claims from 39,419 soldiers who had been exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam.[73]" Other citations availbale upon request....

As it happens, steps one through eight were completed with relative ease. It was that ninth step that gave lawmakers trouble. House Republicans not only gathered on a weekend to take a vote that moves the government even closer to a shutdown, they did it in the dead of night. The Republican-controlled House voted around midnight on Saturday to keep the government open for a few more months in exchange for punting the rollout of Obamacare for a year -- the kind of shot at the health care law conservatives had wanted for weeks, even if it's sure to be rejected by the Democratic-controlled Senate. By all appearances, House Republicans are now actively seeking a government shutdown, specifically aiming for their goal rather than making any effort to avoid it. Indeed, the unhinged House majority appears to have gone out of its way to craft a spending bill designed to fail. The bill approved after midnight would deny health care benefits to millions of American families for a year, add to the deficit by repealing a medical-device tax industry lobbyists urged Republicans to scrap, and in a fascinating twist, make it harder for Americans to get birth control. As the New York Times report noted, "The delay included a provision favored by social conservatives that would allow employers and health care providers to opt out of mandatory contraception coverage." Yes, in the midst of a budget crisis, the House GOP decided it was time to go after birth control again. Wow. Senate leaders and the White House patiently tried to explain to radicalized House Republicans that voting for this would all but guarantee a government shutdown -- so House Republicans voted for it en masse. In fact, take a look at the roll call. Jonathan Bernstein asked on Friday, "Where are the sane House Republicans?" That question was answered quite clearly last night: literally every GOP lawmaker in the chamber voted for their government-shutdown plan. There were zero defections. This was not, in other words, an isolated tantrum thrown by an extremist faction of a once-great political party. This was rather an organized tantrum thrown by the entirety of the House Republican caucus. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Keep in mind, I use the word "tantrum" largely because Republicans told me to. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a close ally of House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in July, "Shutting down the government to get your way over an unrelated piece of legislation is the political equivalent of throwing a temper tantrum. It is just not helpful." Last night, Cole linked arms with his fellow conservatives and joined them as they jumped off the cliff together. Apparently, he discovered his affinity for tantrums over the last couple of months. Also note, we know with certainty Speaker Boehner didn't want this scenario. It was just earlier this month that he presented a proposal that would have avoided all of this, precisely because he didn't want to end up where we are now. But the Speaker, who has little influence or control over what happens in his own chamber, simply lacked the courage and the strength to govern responsibly. What happens now is less clear. The Senate could reconvene today, reject the House bill, and urge House Republicans to act like grown-ups tomorrow -- the last day before Monday night's shutdown deadline. Or more likely, the upper chamber will gather in the morning, try to pass the same bill senators passed on Friday, and leave the House with just hours to keep the government's lights on. Either way, House Republicans continue to fail at completing even the most basic of tasks. The public doesn't expect much of Congress anymore, but most seem to believe lawmakers should be able to keep the government's doors open. As things stand, that now appears unlikely.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380489963397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 17:26:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380490173339-94</Id><Topic><Title>CBS host embarrasses Rand Paul over simplistic view of Congress: ‘It’s more complicated’</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380485067584</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 16:04:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AFL-CIO never represented the majority of Americans, and they represent less now than they used to.

On the one hand, we have the Republicans in Congress and elsewhere who simply want to be in charge and to have their policies implemented. Ruthless up to a point, but within limits. The ones who are happy to go on “making sausage” as the old saw goes, with respect to legislation, policy, and budgets. In recent years, they don’t like to compromise, but they will when they’re forced to. Besides, it keeps the pork-barrel spending going. There’s also a baseline sense of civil responsibility among many of them. I personally don’t like John McCain, but he seems to me to typify this type of Republican. He and others like him won’t refuse to participate in the government just because they can’t get 100% of what they want. Sure, there are lots of us who feel what the McCain Republicans want is unreasonable, ill-advised, and often plain wrong — but that’s what elections are about. Even they still respect those, to enough of a degree to make a difference and keep the whole country from falling apart. Then there are the Tea Party Republicans. Not only do they hate anybody who isn’t them, half the time they can’t even agree on what it means to be an ideologically “pure” Tea Party member. Just witness the intra-party sniping over Senator Ted Cruz’s “Fauxlibuster” this past week. He really is not liked among most of his fellow GOP Senators, and if reports are to believed, they’re miffed that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid let Cruz be the public face of the Republican party for an entire news cycle. teabagger_with_hat Irony personified The Tea Baggers, as I prefer to term them, using their own original name for themselves, actually don’t care about elections; all that matters is winning. Gerrymandering, voter suppression, outright theft of elections when it can be gotten away with — it’s all cool. The ends justify any and all means, to them. Losing an election also doesn’t matter; it’s just an obstacle to be overcome. And their ends aren’t just unreasonable or ill-advised — they’re often monstrous. Like cutting food stamps. Or no disaster aid to stricken communities (especially if they didn’t vote GOP). Or insisting that the free market is just fine for poor, sick people without insurance. A lot of them will deny what they have in mind is a disaster in the making, but when you can get them to admit it, it’s like, “Yeah, that’s not a bug — it’s a feature.” Irrationally, the Tea Baggers want the United States government to shut down and to default on its public debts. For some reason, they don’t think it’ll result in a global economic disaster that’d make the Great Depression look like a mild head-cold. They advocate abolishing the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, the EPA, the FDA, gov’t funded research and development, the national parks and forest services — and yes, Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid. (The fact the GOP 2012 platform includes lots of Tea Bagger proposals isn’t a coincidence either.) People suffering and dying from poisoned water or food, or because they don’t have the money to pay for healthcare or retirement isn’t just some unforeseen side-effect: It’s the goal. It’s the core of the real Tea Party philosophy, as handed down from their plutocratic backers, such as the Koch Brothers: Being poor and powerless is to be deserving of punishment, suffering, and pain. To be poor is a sign of moral weakness; to be rich, is to be better than everyone else. To be rich and force the non-poor deep into soul-crushing serf-level poverty? Even better. So anyway, we have the two sides of the Republican party. One that’s been increasingly difficult for the rest of us non-Republicans to get along with, and the other literally impossible for anyone to get along with. Including the non-crazy Republicans (and there are plenty of them… it’s just they’ve been marginalized and scared into silence). // // // There have been signs of this “if we can’t rule the Village, we must burn it to the ground” mentality dating all the way back to when former House Speaker Newt Gingrich shut down the Federal government in 1995-6 for 28 days over a budget impasse. Although President Clinton suffered a popularity hit during the shutdown and was initially blamed for it, public sentiment later shifted against Gingrich — and the GOP by extension, including the failed candidacy of Bob Dole for president. The Republicans were hammered pretty badly in the 1996 elections. Doubling down with the Clinton impeachment didn’t help. Over the course of the last two decades, the extremist elements of the Republican party didn’t just become powerful: They also became feared within the party. So-called ‘moderates’ like Senator Olympia Snowe opted to retire. Others such as John McCain began adopting Tea Party positions — often because they knew if they didn’t, the Tea Party contingent would have absolutely no hesitation in pulling out all the stops to destroy them. The Tea Baggers will primary-challenge anybody who does not march in lockstep with them, 100% of the time, no matter the cost. Remember, McCain’s first choices for VP didn’t include the unfit-for-any-office Chill-Billy from Wasilla. His top two choices, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, were considered rather moderate, even by non-GOP standards. The hyper-conservative Tea Bagger contingent said no, absolutely not. Hell, Mitch McConnell is being challenged, with ads now airing that claim he’s a progressive liberal traitor to his party. Now we have GOP leaders such as House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell caught in the middle. They’re happy to play the games of political brinksmanship, but at the end of the day, they don’t want to destroy the government they’d like to be in charge of. Ultimately, their threats are bluffs. Everybody knows this. The Tea Party extremists see that looming cliff and are screaming to be allowed to drive right off it — with all of us strapped in the back seat. For them, it’s not a threat to be enacted if they don’t get what they want. It’s the goal. They’re jonesing to drive off that cliff. Here’s why I think the GOP may finally fracture, and it’s from stresses in several directions. First — and this was the eye-opener for me — Ted Cruz and guys like him have never had any respect for John Boehner. Now, Senator Cruz is openly urging House Republicans to defy their leader. (And stories are being floated that conservative House Republicans might want to replace Boehner with Cruz — technically legal, but utterly unprecedented.) Ordinarily, I’d say, great! Let’s make popcorn and settle in for the show. Unfortunately, this is more like one of those Sea World shows, the kind where if you sit too close to the tank, you know they’re going to make the dolphins splash everyone in the first ten rows. And we’re all in those front rows. Or, for another metaphor: Disclaimer: GOP piñata does not contain candy or joy. (Courtesy EN2008, via Flickr, used with permission) (Courtesy EN2008, via Flickr, used with permission) If the Tea Party Republicans achieve their ever-increasing list of unreasonable demands, we’re all soaked. If they don’t, they’ll attempt to force a shutdown and default — contrary to the wishes of many of their GOP colleagues — and we’re drowned. The United States defaulting on its public debt is it, the end, hasta la vista baby. What’s worse, a lot of them seem to think the second alternative is actually better, because they believe they’ll also achieve all of the first alternative as an additional direct consequence. Plus be in charge of everything when the village is done burning to the ground. Because for them, being in charge of smouldering rubble is preferable to any outcome other than being in charge. Make no mistake. Ted Cruz’s self-aggrandizing grandstanding wasn’t just just about him and what he (insanely) thinks is a realistic shot at the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. Nor was it really about Obamacare — which I do prefer to call the PPACA (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (sic)), in large part because the partisan identification of the law does have a significant effect on support. In a sense, it isn’t even entirely about overall U.S. budget priorities and government policy. It’s about a movement of politically radicalized Republican Tea Baggers who aren’t even a majority of their own party, demanding to have every one of their demands met, unconditionally. And as we’ve learned this week, even when it’s being made clear they will not get their demands, they’ll gladly go off and just keep adding to the list. Seriously, a minority of a party that controls only the House is demanding the opposition party-controlled Senate and Executive agree to a ridiculous veto-guaranteed Christmas list of anti-populist demands, or else it’s shutdown time (and presumably national debt default when that comes up, too). They’re doing this contrary even to the advice of their last presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, who has said that a government shutdown is not how his party should deal with the PPACA. Or anything. The reason I asked the question titling this post is because while we’ve seen signs before of the extremist Tea Bagger contingent undercutting GOP leadership, including Boehner and McConnell, this is the first time I can remember a prominent GOP upstart — Ted Cruz in this instance — openly telling GOP House members to defy their leader. What do I think will happen come October 18th? Well, I’ve been wrong many times before, but my guess is we’re going to see yet another suspension of the infamous “Hastert Rule.” Boehner’s an ideologue, but not an idiot. I’ll wager he’ll set up the House rules to allow the Senate “clean budget” continuing resolution to come to a vote, albeit with a few minor changes so he can save face with his party, but then depend on the House Dems and enough of his own Republicans to pass it. The inevitable result, no matter how this turns out, is the fractures within the Republican party are at the point where it would not surprise me to see the Tea Party Republicans split off, much as the Dixiecrats did to the Dems in the 1948, in opposition to anti-segregationist policies adopted by the Democratic party. Up to and immediately after October 18th though, it’s anybody’s guess. Let’s just say it’s not looking good for the Republicans…which I honestly can’t say I mind that much. For additional background, I highly recommend “End Days for the GOP,” by Michael Tomasky over on the Daily Beast. I’ll close with a quote from his must-read essay. They’ll almost certainly cave, just like they did on the fiscal-cliff deal. Or maybe they won’t. They lose either way. In the former case, all their big talk came to nothing. In the latter, they’ve driven the country down the sinkhole. And so, like I said up top, they’ll be seen either as in total disarray, or as complete saboteurs. You can only set so many houses on fire before people finally figure out that this isn’t happening by accident and you must be an arsonist. The GOP is now flirting with that moment. It can’t come soon enough.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380490467189</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 17:34:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380490558276-96</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty: Vaccinated against wisdom</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380476349898</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 13:39:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I didn't read anywhere there that Agent Orange was said to be "good for you."

The LOT problem comes a day after Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA on Saturday grounded a Boeing 787 so that officials from the Chicago-based company can examine what appears to be a technical problem. The worldwide fleet of 787 planes was grounded in January after lithium-ion batteries that overheated or caught fire following an incident on a flight by the Japanese airline All Nippon Airways.

The brochure for Boeing Co's aircraft repair service makes a simple assertion: "No one knows Boeing airplanes better than Boeing." But the first two Dreamliners, delivered in recent weeks and part of a planned fleet of eight, broke down more than half a dozen times in September, forcing Norwegian Air to lease back-up planes(Airbus planes !) on short notice or cancel flights. Norwegian Air grounded its 787s several times, citing problems with brakes, hydraulic pumps and power. On September 23, the carrier said one Dreamliner was beset with problems in the oxygen supply to the cockpit. A problem with a valve on the airline's second 787 was repaired around the same time, but only after delaying a flight from Oslo to New York. "Norwegian has contracted with Boeing to provide engineering, spare parts and maintenance services for its 787s," Boeing said in a statement. "We regret the inconvenience and disruption caused to the airline and its passengers as a result of this process." Norwegian Air was the first to sign up for Boeing's GoldCare maintenance contract for its 787s, and is still the sole 787 customer for the plan. The brochure says GoldCare "significantly reduces the risk of new airplane introduction surprises" and helps airlines keep the plane in service(.Attention; jjovaz and father z), Boeing not Norwegian is responsible for maintenance ! But the grounded planes have prompted Norwegian Air to voice its dissatisfaction with the aircraft. "The aircraft's reliability is simply not acceptable," Norwegian Air spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said on Saturday. "Our passengers cannot live with this kind of performance."</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380497901602</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 19:38:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380498681709-115</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty: Vaccinated against wisdom</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380476349898</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 13:39:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From Spart's point of view, that's not a consideration.

Of designing the 787 in house that has destroyed the Boeing company going forward, father_zosima, this led to MDC bankruptcy and Mr Mac and Stonecipher gained majority share because Phil Condit purchased the bankrupt MDC with Boeing stock, not money. Once these two shareholders who now had a majority of Boeing stock converted from MDC stock Phil Condit lost his job to MDC by vote of the BOD. so the Boeing company is failing now on the failed outsourcing strategy that bankrupted MDS Faterh_zosima you claim to love Boeing, but you failed to read hart-smith. Father _zosima , aka whstleffansms, get a clue stop making excuses for boeing failure . father you excuses are silly, like I was fired or am gay or have a lover or you are a close personal friend of Paul Allen and live in a mansion on an island you spelled wrong. Father_zosima, you are a troll and identify with losers here like spartacus99991,dufffymagoo, verizig_nachten, jjovaz, and their con job posts . boeing lags behind Airbus in plane orders, in stock price and both lag behind my long term stock holdings in TSLA and ACAD and some Airbus . Until Steve jobs died for many years I made my money in AAPL and the group above attempted to bully and con me with liar statements , I have turned it into a money making advertisement for TSLA and ACAD .

Whatever the merits of his product, there are reasons for the buyer to beware of his rhetoric. The president is being a bit slippery on the costs of coverage, in particular. His opponents are taking their own liberties as they talk up the ills of what they deride as "Obamacare" and defend their approach to the budget impasse that threatens to close parts of the government come Tuesday. On these points, caveat emptor: OBAMA: "Knowing you can offer your family the security of health care, that's priceless. Now, you can do it for the cost of your cable bill, probably less than your cellphone bill. Think about that, good health insurance for the price of your cellphone bill or less." — Speech in Largo, Md., on Thursday. THE FACTS: The family coverage you can get for the cost of a monthly cable or cellphone bill is going to expose you to a hefty share of your medical expenses. Looked at in terms of digital communications, it's more like dial-up Internet than 4G. The cell-phone analogy has become the talking point of the week for administration officials pitching people on the health care markets opening for business Tuesday. Obama said earlier that of every 10 Americans who are uninsured, "six out of those 10 are going to be able to get covered for less than $100 a month, less than your cellphone bills." He is referring to the cheapest of four major options offered by the new markets, the "bronze" plan. But, just like with auto insurance, premiums aren't the only potential expense for a consumer. Those who choose bronze will have to pay 40 percent of their medical bills out of pocket through deductibles and copayments. A family's share of medical costs could go as high as $12,700 a year, or $6,350 for individuals, on top of those cell-phone-like premiums.
