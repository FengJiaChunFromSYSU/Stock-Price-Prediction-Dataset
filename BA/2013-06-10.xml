State Department officials in Washington interfering with Inspector General investigations to avoid bad press, accountability and scandal? You don't say: CBS News has uncovered documents that show the State Department may have covered up allegations of illegal and inappropriate behavior within their ranks. The Diplomatic Security Service, or the DSS, is the State Department's security force, charged with protecting the secretary of state and U.S. ambassadors overseas and with investigating any cases of misconduct on the part of the 70,000 State Department employees worldwide. CBS News' John Miller reports that according to an internal State Department Inspector General's memo, several recent investigations were influenced, manipulated, or simply called off. The memo obtained by CBS News cited eight specific examples. Among them: allegations that a State Department security official in Beirut "engaged in sexual assaults" on foreign nationals hired as embassy guards and the charge and that members of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's security detail "engaged prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries" -- a problem the report says was "endemic." The memo also reveals details about an "underground drug ring" was operating near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and supplied State Department security contractors with drugs. And yes, things that happened were in fact illegal. Aurelia Fedenisn, a former investigator with the State Department's internal watchdog agency, the Inspector General, told Miller, "We also uncovered several allegations of criminal wrongdoing in cases, some of which never became cases." Keep in mind that State Department officials (and the Obama administration in general) are constantly citing "ongoing criminal investigations within a department" as a reason why they can't comment or take responsibility for a situation. It turns out, at least in the State Department, the so-called "internal investigation" was being sidelined by people within the Department. Prostitutes? Check. Cover-up? Check. Everyone still has a job? Check. A Kennedy covering up sex? Check. The State Department Inspector General's memo refers to the 2011 investigation into an ambassador who "routinely ditched ... his protective security detai" and inspectors suspect this was in order to "solicit sexual favors from prostitutes." Sources told CBS News that after the allegations surfaced, the ambassador was called to Washington, D.C. to meet with Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy, but was permitted to return to his post.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1370879479474</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:51:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370879783559-57</Id><Topic><Title>Hey America How's all theat Hope and Change Working out for you?</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1370873692986</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 10:14:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How are all those cliches and misinformation working for you?</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1370879783559</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:56:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370879985199-58</Id><Topic><Title>Why Kennedy was Killed</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1370797241357</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 13:00:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which one...joe, jack/john, bobby, teddy, john-john... remember, death is not the wurst they can do to you even if you know nothing peace be upon you and always remember IAM a pepper, he's a pepper, she's a pepper,,, you can be a Dr. Prepper too A person without a high-school diploma can join the military followed by a medical discharge and then by age 29 try and live out his days in a luxury Hong-Kong hotel who can have worked for the NSA, the CIA and several of their under-contractors and and still be able to copy some documents that really prove nothing than other what Congress/your-duly elected representatives had approved and IAM just a lowly disabled veteran... cost/benefit ratio out of whack</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1370879985199</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:59:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370880151825-59</Id><Topic><Title>Uh Oh.....another Scandal - State Department Officials Interfered With IG Investigations</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1370879479474</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:51:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another vapid cut/paste from Townhall.

CBS News reports that is has unearthed documents from the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), an internal watchdog agency, that implicate the State Department in a series of misconducts worldwide. The memo, reported by CBS News’ John Miller, cited eight specific examples, including allegations that a State Department security official in Beirut “engaged in sexual assaults” with foreign nationals hired as embassy guards and the charge and that members of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s security detail “engaged prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries” — a problem the report says was “endemic.” Former State Department internal investigator Aurelia Fedenisn told CBS News, “We also uncovered several allegations of criminal wrongdoing in cases, some of which never became cases.” Often times, other DSS agents were simply told to back off of investigations of high-ranking State Department members. Fedenisn told CBS that “hostile intelligence services” allow criminal behavior to continue. In one such cover-up, investigators were told to stop probing the case of a U.S. ambassador who was suspected of patronizing prostitutes in a public park. The memo states that the ambassador was permitted to return to his post despite having, “routinely ditched…his protective security detail” in order to “solicit sexual favors from prostitutes.”</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1370880987510</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 12:16:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370881642047-66</Id><Topic><Title>Uh Oh.....another Scandal - State Department Officials Interfered With IG Investigations</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1370879479474</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:51:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would sparty deny wrongdoing in the Obama State Dept?

(WTVR) — As Father’s Day approaches, children are reminded to appreciate their dads and the impact on their lives. Today dads around the city were honored a week in advance of Father’s Day. Celebrate Fatherhood 2013 was held this afternoon at the Collegiate School Aquatics Center. While these dads and their children enjoyed the moon bounce and competed in contests, an alarming amount of children in the area won’t have fathers around to celebrate the holiday. First Things First, an organization dedicated to keeping dads involved in kids’ lives, reports that 60 percent of all families in the city of Richmond are single-parent households. Within the African-American demographic, that number spikes up to 86 percent, a number that surpasses the national average. Father's Day is the most confusing day of the year for the children in these households.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1370882042291</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 12:34:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370882402967-68</Id><Title>For Many Black Children Father's Day like trying to Pin the Tail on the Donkey.....</Title><Msg>.......when the donkey has disappeared, vanished, made for the sunset.....gone for more food stamps.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1370882402967</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 12:40:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370883094158-69</Id><Topic><Title>White House Schedule</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363270937569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 10:22:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the Occupier continues to work hard against Employers and the American Family in the interest of transforming America. 10:30 AM The President and the Vice President receive the Presidential Daily Briefing 11:30 AM The President delivers remarks on the Equal Pay Act 12:00 PM The President meets with senior advisors 12:30 PM The President and the Vice President meet for lunch 1:00 PM Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney 1:30 PM The Vice President meets with Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi of Kosovo 2:10 PM The President makes a personnel announcement 4:30 PM The Vice President will swear in Jeffrey Chiesa as Senator of New Jersey 6:30 PM The Vice President will attend an event for the Democratic National Committee</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1370883094158</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 12:51:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370883518071-70</Id><Topic><Title>Why Kennedy was Killed</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1370797241357</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 13:00:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You were there,,,at the Gulf Of Tonkin ?

The credit rating service revised its outlook to "Stable" from "Negative," which means it’s less likely it will downgrade the country’s debt in the near future. It also backed the U.S. government’s "AA+" long-term and "A-1+" short-term unsolicited sovereign credit ratings. S&amp;P downgraded the U.S. government’s long-term credit rating in 2011 after a battle in Congress over whether to raise America’s borrowing limit. The ratings service said Monday that Congress managed to broker a deal late last year that allowed certain tax cuts to expire and cut spending. Meanwhile, S&amp;P says the economy has started to improve and is expected to continue to do so.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1370913165074</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 21:12:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370913289214-142</Id><Topic><Title>New contract</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1370907069524</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 19:31:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good award.

According to the Great Ron Paul: "Some of us were arguing back in 2001 with the introduction of the so-called PATRIOT Act that it would pave the way for massive US government surveillance – not targeting terrorists but rather aimed against American citizens. We were told we must accept this temporary measure to provide government the tools to catch those responsible for 9/11. That was nearly twelve years and at least four wars ago. We should know by now that when it comes to government power-grabs, we never go back to the status quo even when the “crisis” has passed. That part of our freedom and civil liberties once lost is never regained. How many times did the PATRIOT Act need renewed? How many times did FISA authority need expanded? Why did we have to pass a law to grant immunity to companies who hand over our personal information to the government?"</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1370914907071</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 21:41:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370915107590-153</Id><Title>I put on my twenty twenty hindsight glasses and looked back to the Great Ronnie Raygun</Title><Msg>Ronnie was so popular and old no one wanted to bet against him.

Missing bin laden and al Qaeda that’s a rookie mistake and he needs to be remembering on the white house hall of shame. The saxx playing kid dialed back off the unbridled cold war spending and looked at spending more on developing real technology for the future to keep the US at the pinnacle, the high mark, at the top. Slick Willy didn’t see any real benefit to building one moreuck multi-billion dollar sitting sitting target for China to sink. Example of a good use of tax payer bucks, the USS Enterprise, 50 years and she was probably able to carry on. The saxx boy had it by the right except his committed his first fatal mistake with the NAFTA SHAFTA. IMO that was his worst, letting Dung Shall Ping sleep in the Lincoln bedroom was a close second. The cigar / affair was really a mole hill the Con's asked Star to make into a mountain and make a statement " Hell no he can't ". The next day after the impeachment it was back to running the country again for slick willy. He also missed his chance to take out Osama. Then came the EF-6, the worst disaster to ever hit the USA, GW Shrub. If the old man or Clinton had shot Osama that would have made the Shrubs job at transferring the billions in wealth from the middle class into the wealthy class much more difficult. If anything could be done right it should have been Sadam hanging GW Shrub.
