Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) made the request in his opening statement at a hearing on security deficiencies that could have helped to prevent the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans during the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. Democrats are hoping to turn the tables on Republicans by pointing out that they have slashed funding for those sorts of efforts. “The chairman has said that our committee will examine not only the Libya attack, but security at our posts across the Middle East. Mr. Chairman, I fully support this effort,” Cummings said, according to his prepared remarks. “And if this is our goal, we have to examine the funding. “The fact is that, since 2011, the House has cut embassy security by hundreds of millions of dollars below the amounts requested by the President. The Senate restored some of these funds, but the final amounts were still far below the Administration’s requests. And they were far below the levels we enacted in 2010.” According to a Democratic staff memo obtained by The Hill, the House cut the two State Department accounts for “Worldwide Security Protection” and “Embassy Security, Construction and Maintenance” by a total of $459 million in 2011 and 2012 below the Obama administration's funding request. The Democrat-controlled Senate was able to reinstate $88.25 million — still $370.7 million lower than what the administration wanted.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1349956236773</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 07:50:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349956285911-9</Id><Topic><Title>hey romney boy</Title><Username>hwardeinhorn</Username><Timestamp>1349955754468</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 07:42:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey, Nitwit, Romney has No Plans to Make Abortion Illegal...</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349956285911</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 07:51:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349956485915-10</Id><Topic><Title>Republican lead House cut Embassy security and then complain about it</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1349956236773</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 07:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Democratic Controlled Senate Agreed to Cut the Budget as Well.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349956485915</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 07:54:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349956559593-11</Id><Topic><Title>LBJ started medicare</Title><Username>hwardeinhorn</Username><Timestamp>1349955922816</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 07:45:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep spreading the same dis-proven talking point.

Florida governor gives phone sex number for meningitis hotline [ TALLAHASSEE, Florida - In an embarrassing mistake, Florida Governor Rick Scott gave out a phone sex hotline number to Floridians seeking information on a deadly fungal meningitis outbreak. Scott was providing an update on the outbreak at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday when he announced what he said was the hotline's toll-free phone line, but gave out the wrong number. The governor's office was alerted by a public radio station in Tampa, WUSF, which was monitoring the cabinet meeting and posted the number on its website. The station said it was "quickly notified by a reader that the number instead connected to an adult telephone line." Callers are greeted with the recording of a woman's voice saying: "Hello boys, thank you for calling me on my anniversary."

This I something that Biden said in 2008: “For too long in this society we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over the common community.” This “common community” phrase is the core idea behind the word “communism.” No … I’m not one who screams communist at everyone with a (D) after their name, but I do recognize that the philosophy exists and I have a rather good understanding of the underpinnings of Lenin and Marx. One thing is clear … communism cannot co-exist with a society that values the individual. Now … since I have now presented you with a quote from Joe Biden, let’s try a few more quotes. See if you can figure out who uttered these lovely phrases. This will mean a lot more to those of you who actually value your worth as an individual rather than as merely another cog in the gears of society: Quote 1. “We must abolish the cult of the individual decisively, once and for all.” Quote 2. “We must stop thinking of the individual and start thinking about what’s best for society.” Any guesses? The surprise comes later. You need to hold on a few more moments while we discuss the war against individuality. Yes, a war – a war against the individual. A war that has been waged by the American left for decades. Why, you might ask, would anyone want to fight the concept of individuality? Good question. Simple answer. Individualism must be fought and suppressed because the concept of the individual is completely incompatible with basic liberal doctrine. Here’s the rub. If you recognize the existence of the individual, it then follows that you must also recognize the concept of individual rights. Among those individual rights are such pesky little nuances as – dare we say it – property rights! Among those property rights would be what our founding fathers might call the right to the fruit of your labors, or what we in our less flowery age would call the money you earn by busting your buns 60 hours a week. If, then, there is any recognition that you, as a real flesh and blood individual human being, have any right to the money you work for, what sort of excuse can the left come up with to seize those earnings for their wonderful vote-buying income redistribution schemes? So, you think I’m going a bit overboard here? Well, while you sit down and grip the arms of your chair for stability, let me tell you that a California congresswoman (Democrat, natch!) said back in the early 2000s that all wages really belong to the federal government. How’s that for individual property rights? Not convinced? You still don’t believe that there’s a full-blown war on individuality raging around you? Well then, allow me to invoke the name of one of Washington’s premier class warlords, none other than the Senate’s Prince of Bloviation, the late Ted Kennedy. The unlikely event that brought forth this Kennedy gem was the New England Patriots’ Super Bowl win in (I think) 2002. Naturally, Kennedy wanted a part in the celebration, so he pushed his way to the television cameras to extol the value of teamwork. Amazingly, Kennedy tells the nation that the Patriots set a wonderful example for us all to follow at a time when we, in America, are engaged in a “war against the individual.” His words, not mine. Go plow through The Boston Globe on the Monday following that Super Bowl win to find out for yourself. Do it! You need the research practice. Driving the point home just a bit more, what do you think this whole “diversity” thing is all about? Diversity committees – diversity seminars – diversity directors. What’s behind this love of “diversity”? Why was the University of Texas (liberal institution, in case you didn’t know) pushing “diversity” as an excuse for racial discrimination in student admissions? Easy enough. Diversity identity is group identity. Attention paid to diversity is attention paid to someone’s group status, not his or her individual identity. When you are identified according to group status, any claim to individual rights, or worth, for that matter, fade into meaninglessness. Let’s go back through history to see, other than Teddy Kennedy, just who we have out there blasting the concept of the individual. It’s a rough ride. Hold on. “There is the great, silent, continuous struggle: the struggle between the State and the Individual; between the State, which demands, and the individual, who attempts to evade such demands.” That gem is from our friend, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. “The main plank in the National Socialist program is to abolish the liberalistic concept of the individual and the Marxist concept of humanity and to substitute for them the folk community, rooted in the soil and bound together by the bond of its common blood.” The National Socialist bit should be your clue. Nazi was the acronym for Germany’s national socialist party. That quote is from Adolf Hitler. I’m reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich right now … you would not believe the hatred of individualism present in the Nazi regime. Now for the two quotes at the beginning of this Nuze bit: “We must abolish the cult of the individual decisively, once and for all.” I left out the first word of this quote. That word is “Comrades!” This from the lips of none other than Nikita Khrushchev. “We must stop thinking of the individual and start thinking about what is best for society.” Ahh. The best for last. The person who uttered those words is none other than Hillary Clinton back in 2003 when she was pushing her version of government controlled medical care. One more quote. A quickie from Ayn Rand: “The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities.” Are you ready to give up – to surrender – your individuality to the state? That is the essence of liberalism. You exist to serve the state. Remember the video at the Democrat National Convention? “The government is the only thing we all belong to.” What’s your take? Do you belong to the government? Or do you belong to yourself. That’s another choice you’ll be making on November 6th.

Fully 1/3 of federal taxes collected are in the form of payroll taxes. 82% of Americans pay either payroll taxes or income taxes or both. The rest, mostly the elderly or the poor, pay only sales taxes. In Romney Ryan's world, however, it is Mitt Romney who would pay nothing. Under Ryan's plan, Romney would have paid less than 1% in taxes on his $21.6 million in income. There is a reason more tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy aren't resonating with the public as a way to create jobs. It is a discredited policy that merely increases income inequality. When tax rates were raised in the 1990s, it resulted in budget surpluses, a record post-war expansion and an unemployment rate of less than 4%. When tax rates were cut in the 2000s, it resulted in a doubling of the national debt, anemic growth that ultimately failed and an unemployment rate of 10%. Romney Ryan will not balance the budget, because tax cuts are greater than spending cuts. It will decimate the safety net for the poor, sick and aged. It will hollow investment in research, education, infrastructure and health care. It chiefly benefits Romney Ryan and their super-pac sponsors. The voting public is keenly aware of this, much to Romney Ryan's chagrin.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1349962667313</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 09:37:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349962879816-20</Id><Title>mir_roguns SO THIS IS WHAT A REALLY RICH GUY DOES WITH HIS TIME???</Title><Msg>I am mir_rorguns and I am very rich so I spend my time on a stock message board posting old semi-true stuff all day because I don't have anything better to do.

Wynn, an outspoken critic of President Obama, didn't hold back in his latest criticism of the incumbent president seeking a second term. "I'll be damned if I want to have him lecture me about small business and jobs. I'm a job creator. Guys like me are job creators and we don't like having a bulls-eye painted on our back," Wynn said about Obama to Ralston. An excerpt of the interview is below. WYNN: I've created about 250,000 direct and indirect jobs according to the state of Nevada's measurement. If the number is 250,000, that's exactly 250,000 more than this president, who I'll be damned if I want to have him lecture me about small business and jobs. I'm a job creator. Guys like me are job creators and we don't like having a bulls-eye painted on our back. The president is trying to put himself between me and my employees. By class warfare, by deprecating and calling a group that makes money 'billionaires and millionaires who don't pay their share.' I gave 120% of my salary and bonus away last year to charities, as I do most years. I can't stand the idea of being demagogued, that is put down by a president who has never created any jobs and who doesn't even understand how the economy works.

Some of the firm's 3,000 employees reportedly feared they might lose their jobs if they did not make these political donations. Before that, in August, Murray reportedly forced coal miners at the Century Mine in Beallsville, Ohio, to give up a day's worth of pay to show up at a rally with Romney, according to the local news radio station WWVA. Then, too, some workers feared not attending could cost them their jobs. Murray, a climate-change denier, has a history of making questionable claims. In 2010, for one, he wrote a letter to employees in which he said that, if workers did not donate to Murray Energy's PAC, "the coal industry will be eliminated and so will your job."</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1349966665369</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 10:44:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349966889805-36</Id><Topic><Title>Mother of slain Navy SEAL Rips Roney To Pieces</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1349902931200</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 17:02:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another falsehood.

Unfortunately this is just an indication of how brain washed and simple minded a large number of Americans really are. The disfunctional classes in America, the poor, the double digit IQ folks, and many who need government support like public employees seem to believe anything that's put in front of them by people in authority no matter how ridiculous the statements mat be. This is sad, and as the founding fathers of our country clearly indicated, a country made up of people like this can not support a democratically elected republic for long. The decline in the USA is self evident for anyone to see. Let's hope that there are still enough good people to turn things around. Right now the future looks pretty bleak. I don't know if Romney is the one to lead us in the right direction, but I know that Obama will lead us to destruction.</Msg><Username>sheepshearer48</Username><Timestamp>1349967062870</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 10:51:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349967614925-38</Id><Topic><Title>mir_roguns SO THIS IS WHAT A REALLY RICH GUY DOES WITH HIS TIME???</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1349962879816</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 09:41:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>keep adding post to keep this at the top</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1349967614925</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 11:00:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349967615322-39</Id><Topic><Title>This is a positive sign for the Economy</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1349964871331</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 10:14:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The leftys actually believe these make believe numbers!

The cameraman asks the union member if he was at an earlier debate between Warren and her Republican opponent, Senator Scott Brown. "Uh-huh," the union member says, nodding. "Did you guys get fined if you weren't there?" the cameraman asks. "Yeah," the union member replies. "How much did you get fined?" the cameraman asks. "A hundred and fifty," the man says, although he later adds, "It's two-fifty if you don't go." Watch the video below: This isn't the first instance in a Massachusetts Senate race where unions have been accused of generating fake grassroots support for the Democrat. In 2010, before Brown's victory in the special election, a union member wearing a shirt supporting the Democratic candidate, Martha Coakley, told a local blogger on camera that he had been paid $50 to wear the shirt but that he was actually voting for Brown.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349982085108</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 15:01:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349982421893-72</Id><Title>Romney Pulls Ahead in Colorado, Pulls Even in Wisconsin Obama on His Heels!</Title><Msg>CBS NEWS/ October 11, 2012, 3:00 AM By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Anthony Salvanto, Fred Backus and Lucy Madison On the heels of last week's presidential debate, Mitt Romney has emerged with a one-point edge over President Obama in Colorado and has cut the president's lead in half in Wisconsin, according to a new Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll. In Wisconsin, where Mr. Obama led Romney by six percent last month, the president now holds just a three-point advantage, with 50 percent to Romney's 47 percent support. Last month, the president led Romney 51 to 45 percent. In Colorado, the two remain locked in a dead heat, with Romney leading Mr. Obama 48 percent to 47 percent, within the poll's margin of error. Last month, also within that margin, Mr. Obama had the one-point edge, with 48 percent to Romney's 47 percent. In Virginia, the presidential race remains essentially unchanged, with Mr. Obama holding on to a small lead over Romney, with 51 percent support to Romney's 46. In September, the president led Romney 50 percent to 46 percent there. All three polls, conducted from October 4-9, began surveying voters after the first presidential debate. Romney inches up in polls in Colo., Wis. By about four to one, voters in all three of these battleground states say Romney won last week's presidential debate, and sizable numbers say the debate made them think better of him. But majorities say the debate did not affect their vote. In Colorado, only 16 percent of likely voters said Mr. Obama won the debate, while 72 percent chose Romney. In Virginia, the breakdown was similar, with 70 percent choosing Romney and 17 percent selecting the president. In Wisconsin, 65 percent said Romney won and 17 percent said Mr. Obama did. The debate had a positive impact on voters' impressions of Romney. More than four in ten voters in these states who watched the first presidential debate (and 51 percent in Colorado) say it made them feel better about Romney. Fewer than one in 10 said that about Mr. Obama; more say it made them think worse of him. Among voters who say the debate will impact their vote, the advantage goes to Romney. Even though majorities in these battlegrounds say the debate will have no effect on their vote, twice as many voters said the debate would make them more likely to vote for Romney than said so of Mr. Obama. Among independent voters, about half in these battleground states say the debate gave them a better impression of Romney, and about a quarter in each state say it made them more likely to vote for him.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349982421893</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 15:07:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349983799764-73</Id><Title>Obama's Re-Election Fading Away...

"Biden’s trouble with the plagiarism began a stump speech in Iowa. At the end of the speech, Biden used a series of phrases that closely mirrored a previous speech by that of British politician Neal Kinnock. Though there are several reports that he had previously used and cited the source of those words, there seems to be a clear understanding that, in this one case, he did not. The result of this was that his Democratic challenger Michael Dukakis created an attack video splicing together Biden’s speech with that of Kinnocks. The attack was remarkably effective and can be described as a classic example of “YouTube politics” before the Web even existed. Not only was Biden’s reputation hurt by the initial scandal, reporters from Newsweek also turned up allegations of plagiarism dating back to when he was a student at Syracuse Law School, where he failed and was forced to retake a course due to an allegation of plagiarism. The end result was that Biden, who was already lagging in the polls, was forced to drop out of the race. Though Biden continued to serve in the Senate, these allegations have stuck with him for pretty much his entire career since then. In fact, when I first started Plagiarism Today, the most popular blog about plagiarism on the Web wasn’t about content theft or academic dishonesty, but about Joe Biden. This is why, when I heard that Biden was Obama’s VP pick, I knew immediately that this issue would come up in a very big way."

He's not part of a super PAC. He's not lobbying for or against any ballot measures. But billionaire Thomas Peterffy is spending millions on television ads this election season with one cautionary message: Avoid socialism. "I grew up in a socialist country and I have seen what that does to people. There is no hope, no freedom, no pride in achievement," he says with a soft Hungarian accent in the ad. "The nation became poorer and poorer, and that's what I see happening here." Peterffy told CNN he expects to spend $5-$10 million on the ad buy, depending on its effectiveness. The spot will run on CNN, CNBC, Bloomberg, and test markets in Ohio, Wisconsin, and possibly Florida. The one-minute spot, which began airing Wednesday and will continue through Election Day, has no mention of any specific politician or lawmaker. It's simply a plea for an end to what he sees as growing hostility to personal success - and to vote Republican. "America's wealth comes from the efforts of people striving for success. Take away their incentive with badmouthing success and you take away the wealth that helps us take care of the needy," he says in the commercial. Peterffy was born in Budapest in 1944 during the deadly Soviet offensive that ended in the capture of Hungary's capital the following year. From then, the republic remained under communist control until it gained independence in 1989. The new ad features images of Peterffy as a child in Hungary and the impoverished conditions in his native country. "As a young boy, I was fantasizing about one day going to America, making a success of myself. The American Dream," he says. Peterffy left his country and moved to New York in 1965, where-without knowing English–he got a computer programming job on Wall Street. He later purchased his own seat on the American Stock Exchange in 1977 and, fast forward a few years, found himself the creator of Interactive Brokers, one of the first electronic trading firms. Forbes Magazine now estimates Peterffy, 68, has a net worth of $4.6 billion. Peterffy is not alone in his fear of a socialist America. Some Republicans have launched vocal accusations against President Barack Obama for pushing what they call socialist policies. In part, they're referring to Obama's tax proposal that would ultimately raise taxes on the wealthiest two percent of the country but maintain tax cuts for households making under $250,000 per year. Obama and his re-election campaign argue they're not attacking success, rather they have a different viewpoint on how to create success. At the debate last week, Obama repeated his signature line, saying he wants to make sure everyone is "getting a fair share, everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules." In the new ad, however, Peterffy says such policies lead to a "slippery slope." "It seems like people don't learn from that past," he says. "That's why I'm voting Republican and putting this ad on television." According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the billionaire donated more than $60,000 to the Republican National Committee last year and contributed to Republican candidates including Mitt Romney, Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Linda McMahon in Connecticut, and House Speaker John Boehner. Other billionaires, such David and Charles Koch, as well as George Soros, have played prominent roles this election, spending millions on ads for their respective candidates. But the titans maintain a low-profile, never appearing in the ads themselves. Asked why Peterffy wanted to personally take out the ad buy–and star in the spot–he said he was concerned that Americans were unaware of the "downside" of a "less stratified society." "If people want to go that way, I want them to go with eyes wide open, aware of all possible consequences," he added.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1349985372024</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 15:56:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349985718427-77</Id><Topic><Title>CEO threatens to fire Employees if they Vote for Obama</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1349968769551</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 11:19:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From his email: "Of course, as your employer, I can't tell you whom to vote for, and I certainly wouldn't interfere with your right to vote for whomever you choose.

Arguing that the bankruptcy court ought not confirm a plan “whose principal purpose is tax avoidance,” attorneys said in filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware that the tax breaks would be worth more money than funds set aside for creditors. Taxpayers are on the hook for more than a half-billion dollars after the company filed for bankruptcy last year, just two years after winning a loan guarantee from the Department of Energy. What’s more, government attorneys said that as far back as 2010, Solyndra owners had “planned meticulously” to be able to use Solyndra’s net operating losses to offset future tax liabilities. “The only reason for the shell corporation to exist post-confirmation is to enable its owners to exploit these tax attributes, which would be lost in liquidation,” the IRS argued in court papers. One owner valued the so-called tax attributes at $150 million, dwarfing the $7 million to $8 million set aside by the reorganization plan for unsecured creditors, according to the government’s objection, which was filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the IRS. Under Solyndra’s reorganization plan, two big investors in the company, Madrone Partners LP and Argonaut Ventures, together would own nearly all of a shell company formed in the wake of Solyndra’s bankruptcy reorganization.

This leads to reductions in the inefficient and poorly coordinated care that existed because traditional Medicare pitted the physicians against the hospitals. For example physicians were able to bill Medicare for bedside visits in the hospital while the hospital was given a set benefit for Medicare in-patient treatment. There was an incentive for physicians to keep patients in the hospital longer to bill more for bedside visists which led to unnecessary extra days in the hospital which in turn cost the hospital more money. By working together, hospital length of stay was reduced which in turn reduced costs. This is all documented and health care outcomes are tracked and publically reported. Health care providers are doing an excellent job and it will eventually catch on in smaller states. Where I live 1/3 of the Seniors are already opting out of traditional Medicare and alot more will opt out in 2013 as the Advantage programs continue to get better and provide more services for less.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1349993006607</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 18:03:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349993019684-107</Id><Topic><Title>Are male Democrats just naturally feminine or ......</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1349989797427</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 17:09:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>= Are all Democrats Marxist leaning Socialistic Communists? = Do all Republicans ask such stupid questions?

Romney Now Leads Obama in Florida 51 to 44... Obama Cratering!</Title><Msg>Times/Bay News 9/Herald exclusive Florida poll: Romney 51, Obama 44 By Adam C. Smith, Times Political Editor Posted: Oct 11, 2012 06:00 PM Barack Obama's lackluster debate performance last week has dramatically altered the presidential race in Florida, with Mitt Romney opening up a decisive 7 percentage point lead, according to a new Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9/Miami Herald poll. The survey conducted this week found 51 percent of likely Florida voters supporting Romney, 44 percent backing Obama and 4 percent undecided. That's a major shift from a month ago when the same poll showed Obama leading 48 percent to 47 percent — and a direct result of what Obama himself called a "bad night" at the first debate. The debate prompted 5 percent of previously undecided voters and 2 percent of Obama backers to move to Romney. Another 2 percent of Obama supporters said they are now undecided because of the debate. "There's no question in my mind that debate made people stand up and pay attention, and it really wiped away any questions people had about Romney, whether they were undecided or soft for Obama," said Brad Coker of Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research, which conducted the poll for the Times and its media partners.

Democrats are winning the messaging war on Rep. Paul Ryan’s bid to overhaul Medicare, with a new Bloomberg poll finding 57 percent of Americans believe they would be worse off under his plan. Only 34 percent said they would be better off if Congress replaced “traditional Medicare” with a program to purchase private insurance with government subsidies, as Ryan has proposed. The poll also found Ryan is now the nation’s third most disliked Republican, with net unfavorable ratings that trail only former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. The poll found that 40 percent of Americans believe President Barack Obama has a better vision for the nation’s economic future, while 37 percent said Republicans do. More than half — 51 percent — said “we should see” how the national health care law works, while 35 percent want it repealed. And 49 percent surveyed approve of Obama’s overall job performance, while his approval rating on terrorism alone was measured at 69 percent.</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1349996517650</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 19:01:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349996674900-126</Id><Topic><Title>Five crazy things Paul Ryan actually believes</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1349996143016</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 18:55:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dik's Blue Wall Argument All Over Again...

Why? Carlos Slim, world’s richest man, gets richer supplying ‘Obamaphones’ to poor Posted: Oct 11, 2012 7:48 AM EDT Carlos Slim, world’s richest man, gets richer supplying ‘Obamaphones’ to poor A Mexican telecom mogul who holds the title of world's richest man, and one of President Obama's top donors are both getting even richer from the U.S. government program that supplies so-called "Obamaphones" to the poor. Carlos Slim, who has an estimated net worth of $70 billion, owns a controlling stake in TracFone, which makes $10 per phone for each device it provides to poor Americans. The company, whose president and CEO is Frederick "F.J." Pollak, also makes money from extra minutes and data plans it sells to subscribers who get phones and service through the government's Lifeline program. The program, which began in the mid-1980s, has exploded in the past four years after being expanded from supplying landlines to the poor to providing cellular phones. The phones came into the national spotlight after a viral video surfaced on YouTube in which a Cleveland, Ohio, woman praised the president, saying he needed to be re-elected because he gives out free phones. "Everybody in Cleveland, every minority, got an Obama phone. Keep Obama as president. He gave us a phone. He gonna do more," the woman said in the video. Slim's Movil America owns TracFone and recently snapped up service provider Simple Mobile for $100 million. TracFones and Simple Mobile service are huge players in the Lifeline program through the company's "SafeLink Wireless" brand. TracFone had 3.8 million subscribers through the federal program as of late 2011.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349998295885</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 19:31:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349999004243-131</Id><Topic><Title>Wow!

'Sorry, Team Obama: Scrutinizing the Libya Attacks Isn't Just Partisan Politics' by: Adam Serwer President Obama's deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter made the ill-advised assessment Thursday that the deaths of four Americans in an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was only a "political topic" because of Mitt Romney's campaign. Her remarks, first spotlighted by Andrew Kaczynski at Buzzfeed, drew an onslaught of retort. Cutter's defenders have insisted she was taken out of context. I've written before about the wrongheadedness of arguing that "tragedies" should be kept outside the realm of politics, because politics are in fact how societies negotiate solutions to difficult problems. The murder of Americans abroad is, by definition, an important political topic, and it involves key questions about the Obama administration's handling of matters in Libya.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1350009562951</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 22:39:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350010343973-140</Id><Title>ses satellite contract</Title><Msg>EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Oct. 10, 2012 -- Boeing [NYSE: BA] has been selected by SES S.A.

Reduce the national "gaff factor" and show Biden back to the Senate - if they will take him.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1350012432087</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 23:27:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350012480230-149</Id><Topic><Title>An analysis of the debate</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1350007445058</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 22:04:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Clobbering" is mild.
