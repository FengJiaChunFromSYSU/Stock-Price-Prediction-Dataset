Indeed, McNerny never suffered a financial penalty as the Dreamliner endured repeated, costly delays and became a case study in how not to outsource a revolutionary new airplane. Minow told me that if board members wanted to signal they are on top of the crisis, “they will have to take immediate steps: Adding a new director with expertise in engineering and operations, setting up an independent board committee to evaluate the aircraft thoroughly and determine that all problems have been identified...” In addition, the board should independently investigate the failures in communication and testing, “improving the alignment of pay and performance throughout the company. They should also designate one or more directors to meet with shareholders to answer their questions,” she said. None of this has happened. Instead, last week Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith stated that the earnings forecast, “assumes no significant financial impact resulting from the FAA directive on the 787 program.” He left the door open to the possibility. “If this assumption changes after we have gained greater fidelity, we will let you know,” Smith told analysts and reporters. The board is filled with heavy-hitters. Among its members: Reagan chief of staff and uber-schmoozer Ken Duberstein; retired Admiral Edmund Giambastiani (a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff); and former U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab; Nor is the board lacking in business expertise. David Calhoun is chief executive of Nielsen Holdings. It has four former CEOs: Lawrence Kellner (Continental Airlines), Arthur Collins (Medtronic), Ron Williams (Aetna) and Mike Zafirovski (Nortel). Linda Cook was a senior executive at Royal Dutch Shell. Boeing’s board even has a man experienced in crisis management and its perils: Ed Liddy. He was picked by then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to run AIG as the financial crisis was turning into panic. Although Liddy took a token $1 salary (plus expenses), the insurer was bailed out with $84 billion in taxpayer money. He defended a lavish company retreat at the St. Regis Resort in California. He presided over $165 million in bonuses handed out to employees at a company that nearly pushed the world economy into a depression. McNerney, Calhoun and Zafirovski all come out of high positions at General Electric, where McNerney was the runner-up to succeed Jack Welch as chief executive. Taken together, it’s a cozy board largely of elite professional managers and political movers. The risk of living in a bubble is significant. There’s no shareholder activist. No union member. No cantankerous John Smale to ask tough questions and demand change. Not one aircraft engineer. The latter is no cure-all: Phil Condit, who moved the headquarters from Seattle to Chicago and underestimated the Airbus threat among other blunders, was an engineer. He served as Boeing’s chairman and chief executive from 1996 until he was forced out in a scandal involving bidding for the Air Force tanker in 2003. It was also the last time this weak board showed any spine. CEO McNerNey stands behind the 787, because he sure is not going to fly on one for the new potential test fail. Besides with his 22 million fully funded retirement plan, he needs to steal the workers pension, after all they took less pay up front for a better pension at retirement, he needs that money for his next Bonus. The government wants him to pay 1.5 in pension underfunding and it just is not what the man on top would like to do RONA.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360041458639</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 00:17:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360042097507-2</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing asks FAA to allow Dreamliner test flights</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1360035467242</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 22:37:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>iSSAC HVE BEEN WORKING HARD ON TH\\IS SNO DEAL ENTIRE THING GO LIL SNO</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1360042097507</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 00:28:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360043051594-3</Id><Title>BLOW UP THE DEAN</Title><Msg>THIS INVOLVES EXTRA- CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES A PIECE OF CAKE A YOGURT AND A COKE WHEN IT IS RAINING THE DEAN IS NOT THERE</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1360043051594</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 00:44:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360043546457-4</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Board of Directors, the club, bad stock to own</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360041458639</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 00:17:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great article by Jon Talton of the Seattle Times.

Ted Nugent Goes Off on Piers Morgan During Fiery Gun Debate: ‘You’re So Full of #$%$’ Feb. 4, 2013 11:06pm Jason Howerton231 Rock legend Ted Nugent sat down with CNN’s Piers Morgan in a Texas gun shop on Monday to talk, well, guns. Nugent blasted Morgan over his apparent “obsession with guns” and told him to leave responsible American gun owners “the hell alone.” Morgan began the interview by asking his guest to explain to him, “in the least inflammatory way possible,” why any American needs to own an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Morgan had just gotten done shooting an AR-15 at a gun range and said he was surprised by the power it possessed. After first offering prayers to the Chris Kyle and Littlefield families, Nugent told Morgan to “take it to the bank” that he would never understand the true purpose of firearms. “You don’t understand that it’s a simple inanimate tool that tens of millions of American families own that have never caused a problem, never had an accident and will never commit a crime,” Nugent said. Morgan countered by saying 100,000 Americans get hit by gunfire each year. “Let me stop you there, because I’ve been hearing you say this and you’re so full of #$%$. Listen to me, that statistic includes bad guys shot by cops and intruders shot by homeowners. So that figure is bogus,” Nugent shot back. Then Morgan explained that 18,000 people commit suicide using a gun every year in the U.S., to which Nugent quickly replied: “Japan has a higher suicide rate and they aren’t allowed to get downwind of a gun. You’re turn.” “Do you care about murders?” Nugent pressed. “Or do you only care about about murders with guns?” “I care about all death,” Morgan replied. “I don’t think you do. I think you care about guns. I think You’re obsessed with guns,” Nugent said, before going off on a fiery diatribe defending gun owners in America. “99.99% of the gun owners of America are wonderful people that you are hanging around with here today. Perfectly safe. Perfectly harmless. Wonderful, loving, giving, generous caring people. Would you leave us the hell alone? Go after the nut jobs, go after the murderers, because I don’t know any. We need to lock up the bad guys and when people show dangerous, murderous intent, which everyone one of these mass murderers showed. All their neighbors, their family, their teachers, their fellow students, they all knew they were crazy but, Piers, we didn’t stop them because we’re worried about hurting their feelings. We have a mad man problem in America…” Completely unmoved by his remarks, Morgan said “I won’t leave you alone because this is a debate that needs to be had.” Nugent went on to call Morgan the “perfect poster boy” to stand up for the “things that make no sense at all to common sense people.” Nugent also blasted President Barack Obama’s proposals on gun control, saying he doesn’t agree with the president on any of his gun control plans. He also said he didn’t agree with universal background checks and argued that more guns equals less violence. He counted off several places with the strictest gun laws and sky high violent crime, including Chicago and Mexico.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360065520981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 06:58:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360066963967-38</Id><Topic><Title>Chris Wallace slams NRA’s Wayne LaPierre</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1360025900325</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 19:58:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah shut the phuque up.</Msg><Username>analgonquin11</Username><Timestamp>1360066963967</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 07:22:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360067166018-39</Id><Topic><Title>Murdered Navy SEAL Was Gun Control Foe</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360035447973</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 22:37:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.</Msg><Username>analgonquin11</Username><Timestamp>1360067166018</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 07:26:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360067463515-40</Id><Topic><Title>Murdered Navy SEAL Was Gun Control Foe</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360035447973</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 22:37:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Asre you some sort of alangonquin11 wanna-be?</Msg><Username>analgonquin11</Username><Timestamp>1360067463515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 07:31:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360067897376-41</Id><Title>BA above 80</Title><Msg>Once the 787 flys again!!!!!</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1360067897376</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 07:38:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360067914660-42</Id><Topic><Title>Murdered Navy SEAL Was Gun Control Foe</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360035447973</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 22:37:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Typical socialist hypocrite...pretending to be a sensistive Trendy, tree hugging, love thy neigbor, take all the guns to "protect the children "liberal" ...when in fact you just demonstrated what a #$%$ you are by celebrating the death of a man who honorably served America...go back to China you POS.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360067914660</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 07:38:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360068072978-43</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing asks FAA to try test flights,passenger flights months away</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360028352792</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 20:39:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey dell,,sooner or later BA will sue you....keep posting lies..</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1360068072978</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 07:41:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360070872040-44</Id><Title>BA HAS 800 PLANES MAY NEED TO SCRAP, 2 MONTHS NOW</Title><Msg>Most likely need to rewire and change battiers out for lead ones, air carries will want the money back......stop paying for them next</Msg><Username>slimjim2005007</Username><Timestamp>1360070872040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:27:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360070969704-45</Id><Title>YOU CANT REPRO A PLANE YOU CANT EVEN FLY......</Title><Msg>Most likjely seel them for scrap metal.....why pay for p[lanes they cant fly for 2 months now..........</Msg><Username>slimjim2005007</Username><Timestamp>1360070969704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:29:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360071072134-46</Id><Title>WHAT PART OF TESTING DID THEY MISS THE FIRST TIME IN DESIGNS</Title><Msg>Atleast 6 months of no flying.....lost millions soon</Msg><Username>slimjim2005007</Username><Timestamp>1360071072134</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:31:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360071318845-47</Id><Title>Obama Secret Memo: Governmentt Can Kill Americans</Title><Msg>A confidential document reveals the Obama administration believes it can legally order drone strikes on some American citizens.

Bill Stevens, a father of a Sandy Hook student who survived the massacre that took place in December, testified. Stevens explained why his daughter is safer at home than she is at school because "911" and "lockdown" are not enough to protect her from an evil person. Stevens also defended the right to bear arms which is not only written in the Second Amendment, but in the Connecticut constitution as well. He argued gun owners shouldn't be turned into suspects no matter how many firearms or rounds of ammunition they may choose to have and that politicians have no right to take away one's ability to defend themselves and their family. "You want to take my rights are away, lets go to court," Steven's said. "But criminals and tyrants, tyrants especially, beware. Lockdown is not an option at the Stevens residence and 911 will be dialed after the security of my home has been established. Why is that same security my daughter enjoys at home with her dad not available at school in Newtown? That is what you should be considering, not making her dad a criminal. Charlton Heston made the phrase 'from my cold dead hands famous' and I will tell you here today, you will take my ability to protect my Victoria from my cold dead hands."</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1360072077470</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:47:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360072265941-51</Id><Topic><Title>BA HAS 800 PLANES MAY NEED TO SCRAP, 2 MONTHS NOW</Title><Username>slimjim2005007</Username><Timestamp>1360070872040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:27:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL!</Msg><Username>duffymagoo</Username><Timestamp>1360072265941</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:51:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360072392632-52</Id><Topic><Title>HOW MANY PLANES WILL BA BUY BACK</Title><Username>slimjim2005007</Username><Timestamp>1359997261856</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 12:01:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ya got that right!</Msg><Username>duffymagoo</Username><Timestamp>1360072392632</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:53:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360072594770-53</Id><Topic><Title>BA HAS 800 PLANES MAY NEED TO SCRAP, 2 MONTHS NOW</Title><Username>slimjim2005007</Username><Timestamp>1360070872040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:27:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The desert is full up now with Boeing Boneyard planes.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1360072594770</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:56:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360072618131-54</Id><Topic><Title>History - What's Not Taught In Socialized Government Schools</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1360071836536</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:43:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK, so what do they indoctrinate you with in your incestuous home-schooling programs?</Msg><Username>rightholeleaking</Username><Timestamp>1360072618131</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:56:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360072737930-55</Id><Topic><Title>The Boeing Company CEO on MAD MONEY!</Title><Username>arnoldblacksmith</Username><Timestamp>1359747522328</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:38:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Be very afraid of this dangerous scam virus created by criminal elements as reported to yahoo legal !</Msg><Username>alphonite</Username><Timestamp>1360072737930</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:58:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360072797121-56</Id><Title>Anyone Thinking About Listening to Obama and the Democrats on Gun Control........</Title><Msg>.....better remember the lies they told to get Obamacare passed.

Under Obamacare, Americans will be required to buy health insurance or pay a penalty to the IRS. The IRS's assumption that the cheapest plan for a family will cost $20,000 per year is found in examples the IRS gives to help people understand how to calculate the penalty they will need to pay the government if they do not buy a mandated health plan. The examples point to families of four and families of five, both of which the IRS expects in its assumptions to pay a minimum of $20,000 per year for a bronze plan. “The annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children) is $20,000,” the regulation says. Bronze will be the lowest tier health-insurance plan available under Obamacare--after Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Under the law, the penalty for not buying health insurance is supposed to be capped at either the annual average Bronze premium, 2.5 percent of taxable income, or $2,085.00 per family in 2016. In the new final rules published Wednesday, IRS set in law the rules for implementing the penalty Americans must pay if they fail to obey Obamacare's mandate to buy insurance. To help illustrate these rules, the IRS presented examples of different situations families might find themselves in. In the examples, the IRS assumes that families of five who are uninsured would need to pay an average of $20,000 per year to purchase a Bronze plan in 2016. Using the conditions laid out in the regulations, the IRS calculates that a family earning $120,000 per year that did not buy insurance would need to pay a "penalty" (a word the IRS still uses despite the Supreme Court ruling that it is in fact a "tax") of $2,400 in 2016. For those wondering how clear the IRS's clarifications of this new "penalty" rule are, here is one of the actual examples the IRS gives: “Example 3. Family without minimum essential coverage. "(i) In 2016, Taxpayers H and J are married and file a joint return. H and J have three children: K, age 21, L, age 15, and M, age 10. No member of the family has minimum essential coverage for any month in 2016. H and J’s household income is $120,000. H and J’s applicable filing threshold is $24,000. The annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children) is $20,000. "(ii) For each month in 2016, under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the applicable dollar amount is $2,780 (($695 x 3 adults) + (($695/2) x 2 children)). Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the flat dollar amount is $2,085 (the lesser of $2,780 and $2,085 ($695 x 3)). Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the excess income amount is $2,400 (($120,000 - $24,000) x 0.025). Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the monthly penalty amount is $200 (the greater of $173.75 ($2,085/12) or $200 ($2,400/12)). "(iii) The sum of the monthly penalty amounts is $2,400 ($200 x 12). The sum of the monthly national average bronze plan premiums is $20,000 ($20,000/12 x 12). Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, the shared responsibility payment imposed on H and J for 2016 is $2,400 (the lesser of $2,400 or $20,000).”</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1360076792864</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 10:06:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360076943182-78</Id><Topic><Title>AFTER SOLVING BATTERIES PROBLEM OTHER MAJOR PROBLEMS WILL ERUPT FOR THE 787</Title><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1359992725444</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 10:45:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By insulting people the way you do tells only who you are, do you live in a cave, did you ever go to school and what kind of parents you had, did they teach you to insult people that way, I feel sorry for you, you are one bad element on this earth.</Msg><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1360076943182</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 10:09:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360077707988-79</Id><Topic><Title>BA would probably come to be the stock to watch this week.</Title><Username>howard.juan</Username><Timestamp>1360070108492</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:15:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looks legit</Msg><Username>hillschristopher621</Username><Timestamp>1360077707988</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 10:21:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360077895037-80</Id><Title>WAYNEDICK...TELL US...</Title><Msg>Waynedick...tell us...whats up with the stock price today?</Msg><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1360077895037</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 10:24:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360077947863-81</Id><Title>Problem will be solved by weeks end....$80.00</Title><Msg>GO LONG...</Msg><Username>buckman2777</Username><Timestamp>1360077947863</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 10:25:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360078305765-82</Id><Title>Engineers Have BA Management Over A Barrell</Title><Msg>Strike vote coming up.

"Why didn't you tell us about WNR a year ago?!" today, WNR on 50% less than normal volume after a 100% gain for a year WNR went up ...45% of a percent, the daily stochastic is at 93% and for 3 days now it has not broke up to a new high. queen-of-fartz, if you can read a stock chart you should know what to do. Mr fartz, yesterday I purchased ZNGA after watching it retreat to support in just two days wait, on less volume going down in price(can you read a stock chart) and today I made 7% but todays price has not broke above the prce of 5 and 6 days ago, stochastic is at 52% %K broke above %D(10 and 3) do you know how to read a stock chart, I have 7% of the othe guys money now, so do you know how to manage your gains ? Would giving you this information last year or yesterday done any good for you, nope you need to know how to read a stock chart or you would not be in Boeing.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360096471007</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:34:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360096661109-176</Id><Topic><Title>Can Medical Tourism Save Us From Obamacare?</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1359580497731</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 16:14:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmmmmmm......could "Investor Jerome Mirobe" be our Mir?</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1360096661109</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:37:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360096805438-177</Id><Topic><Title>scafflow of the Boeing message board</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360094974292</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:09:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for the FBI thumbs down</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360096805438</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:40:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360096940657-178</Id><Topic><Title>The best reason to own Boeing right now read it here</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360095264228</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:14:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ronanderson727 is that a complete and accurate report unlike the boeing shill, foulmouthharbor did by leaving out the sentance about month until passengers will fly the 787 on the test flights</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360096940657</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:42:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360097177427-179</Id><Title>Did Mir make the news???</Title><Msg>Read the post titled "Can Medical Tourism Save Us From Obamacare?"</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1360097177427</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:46:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360097240889-180</Id><Topic><Title>Hart-Smith update Boeing Shareholders pays for most of the outsourcing costs on failure</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359967958782</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 03:52:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>uniposter99 can I get a Smith-Hart 1-2-3, at least give the man some respect Smith -Hart, 1.2.3 give the man some respect Smith-Hart go critc go go critc go posteruni99, posteruni99, posteruni99 give me a 3-2-1 hand clap hand clap band start the pepe song on with uniposter9 ,on with uniposter 99 fight fight win win win rah rah rah it can you smell the team spirit FBI go go go we will win for Boeing it will fly quick click you pink shoes together 3 times todo</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360097240889</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:47:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360097422138-181</Id><Topic><Title>FLASH!

And found this on the WIKI. There are two versions of this kind of target shooting: "skeet", "trap", and "sporting clay". "Trap" involves the clay bird being shot from a single fixed position at ranges of 30 to 90 feet and varying angles. With "sporting clay", the there are multiple launchers and the terrain is arranged like a golf course to provide some realism, like for hunting fowl. Skeet is more constrained and less acute, but the target is thrown towards you, away from you, or crossing (with double targets). It is arranged with two "houses", one 3 ft and the other 10 ft high, and the targets are thrown into the air to 15 to 18 feet. The distance from the target is determined by the shooter standing at seven points along a semi-circle made by a radius of 63 feet. Obama is holding the rifle at shoulder height, say that is 5 feet off the ground. Based upon the elevation (with respect to ground) with which he is holding the rifle, the measured angle is 2.5 degrees. Thus, via trig, the "opposite side" of the 2.5 degree right triangle is 2.75 feet, or 5 + 2.75 = 7.75 feet of height. It is conceivable that he shot the skeet right out of the lower house, but not the tall house. That is all assuming that the skeet range at Camp David is set up according to regulation. So, it is possible that he is shooting skeet. Maybe it was a shot of him doing simple target practice and the White House was a little over zealous in its official description: From the AP: "The official White House photo released Saturday is dated Aug. 4, 2012. The caption says Obama is shooting clay targets on the range at Camp David. Obama is outdoors amid grass and trees with a rifle cocked in his left shoulder, his left index finger on the trigger and smoke coming from the barrel. He is wearing jeans, a dark blue, short-sleeved polo shirt, sunglasses and headphones."

President Obama has appointed numerous people to cabinet level positions without the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate, as is required by the Constitution. These individuals are given extraordinary power and independent funding, and are not under the scrutiny of Congress. The fact that Obama calls them Czars does not make them legal. He has also made illegal recess appointments of other members of his cabinet that required Senate approval. He simply declared that the U.S. Senate was in recess despite the fact that no such declaration had been made by the Senate. The President has no Constitutional authority to do this. 2. The push by Pres. Obama to pass healthcare legislation in the Congress of the United States that he was fully aware was unconstitutional. He has continued to use his powers and executive branch of government to implement this legislation despite the fact that a federal judge had declared the entire law unconstitutional, and ordered that it not be implemented. In addition, Obama has directed members of his administration to violate the right to freedom of religion protected by the 1st Amendment to the Constitution. Religious institutions such as churches and schools have been ordered to provide contraceptives and abortion inducing morning after pills to employees as part of the health care bill requirements. The fact that this is a direct violation of their religious teaching is of no concern to Obama. 3. Despite the fact that the United States Senate refused to pass the Cap and Trade bill, the President has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to use regulations to implement key portions of the bill, including those regulating so-called greenhouse gases. Obama himself has acknowledged that this will force energy prices in this country to skyrocket. He is taking these actions in direct defiance of the will of the people of the United States, the will of Congress, and the Constitution. The actions of the EPA include regulations that will force many coal burning power plants to close. 4. Through the Department of the Interior (DOI) Obama has placed a moratorium on offshore oil drilling or exploration off both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States and in parts of the Gulf of Mexico. He has also prohibited new drilling exploration on federal land in any states in the United States. These actions by the DOI have continued in direct defiance of several court orders issued by Federal Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans, Louisiana declaring that the department had no authority to issue such a moratorium on drilling in the Gulf. In fact, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (DOI) has been held in contempt by the same judge. The administration has claimed to be complying, but has tied up the drilling permits in so much red tape that the effect is the same. 5. Instead of allowing American companies to drill for oil domestically, Obama has betrayed the American people and authorized loans of billions of dollars to countries like Brazil and Mexico so that they can drill for oil, and then sell that oil to the United States. This will dramatically increase our dependence on foreign nations including Venezuela, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and even Libya that do not serve the interest of America or the American people. Obama has also refused to approve the keystone pipeline from Canada to the United States that would not only lessen our dependence on oil from countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, but create thousands of new jobs in the United States. The decision on the pipeline is one that belongs in the hands of the members of Congress, not the President. 6. President Obama has abdicated his responsibility to enforce the laws of the United States against illegal immigration. He has virtually declared our southern border an open border by declaring certain areas of federal land in states like Arizona as off-limits to federal, state, and local authorities. This is despite the fact that these areas are being used to bring in thousands of illegal immigrants, massive amounts of drugs, and also being used by foreign terrorists to infiltrate the United States. He has also ordered the border patrol not to arrest most illegal immigrants entering the country, and has stopped deportation proceedings against thousands of people in this country illegally. He is in effect instituting the so-called “dream act” bypassing the Congress of the United States which has sole authority over immigration matters. 7. The President and his Attorney General Eric Holder have clearly violated their oath of office by joining with foreign countries such as Mexico, Bolivia, and Columbia, in lawsuits against the sovereign states of Arizona, Georgia, and Alabama to stop them from enforcing the federal immigration laws. 8. President Obama has ordered the Federal Communications Commission to adopt regulations giving the federal government control of the Internet and its contents, including providing Obama with a kill switch that gives him authority to shut down the Internet if he sees fit. This is in direct violation of a decision by the United States Supreme Court that the FCC has no Constitutional authority to control the Internet. There were two bills pending in Congress to effectively give Obama the kill switch he wants over the Internet. When these two proposals, the Stop Internet Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) were withdrawn amid public outcry Obama announced he will sign an international treaty that purports to give him the same authority. He has signaled his intention to do this as an “Executive Act” and not bring the treaty to the Senate for ratification as required by Article 2, Section 2 of the Constitution. I believe he intends to take the same action in regard to the United Nations Small arms treaty and the UN Law of the Sea treaty that are both unlikely to get Senate approval. 9. One of the paramount responsibilities of the President of the United States and his executive branch of government is to enforce and defend laws adopted by Congress unless they are declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. Obama has decided that he should ignore this Constitutional mandate, and that as President he is more powerful than either the Congress of the United States or the Supreme Court. He has unilaterally declared that the Defense of Marriage Act passed by the Congress is unconstitutional, and further declared that he will not have the Justice Department defend it against lawsuits. His administration has also refused to enforce laws against voter intimidation and federal law that requires states to purge their voter registration lists of deceased individuals and those that are registered illegally. In addition, the Justice Department is refusing to allow states to enforce laws requiring proof of identity by voters at the polls. Obama has essentially said that he is the supreme ruler of the United States, and that the Congress and the Federal Judiciary are irrelevant. 10. It has been widely reported that acting through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms the Obama administration was involved for months in getting legitimate and law-abiding gun store owners along our southern border to supply weapons to straw buyers who the government knew would deliver them to the drug cartels in Mexico. This was billed as a sting operation against the cartels when in fact it was designed to produce fraudulent data showing that large numbers of weapons were going from the United States to the Mexican drug dealers. This data was then to be used, and is being used, to try to justify new gun control regulations to limit the rights of American citizens to keep and bear arms. It has nothing to do with arresting members of the drug operations. The administration has, in effect, armed our enemies, and one border patrol agent has already been killed by one of these weapons. Now, Obama continues to impose gun control laws by Executive order so he will not have to deal with Congress. The administration is also refusing to cooperate with the committees in the House of Representatives that are investigating the entire operation. It is even defying Congressional subpoenas. 11. The President of the United States is not authorized by the Constitution to take our nation to war without the consent of the Congress of the United States. The only exception to this is the authority granted to the President by Congress under the War Powers Act. This law allows the President to take immediate action without the consent of Congress if there is an imminent threat to the security of the United States, or its citizens. Although there was clearly no such imminent threat caused by the Civil War in Libya, the President committed members of the United States military to combat missions in a foreign country without the consent of Congress. He based his authority on a United Nations resolution, and a resolution by the Arab League. Now, the President has carried it one step further. During testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 7, 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta told Senators that the President has authority to take our country to war without the Congressional approval required by Article 1, Section 8, of the Constitution. The administration is taking the position that it can ignore Congress as long as it has United Nations approval or NATO approval. However, these actions may be the least of the worries facing the American people. The White House insisted that language be included in the recently passed National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that gives the President sole authority to order the military to arrest and indefinite detain American citizens on U.S. soil if the President suspects them of terrorist ties. This was amazingly passed overwhelmingly by Congress. It appears to be another situation where few members read the bill before voting on it. This was almost immediately followed by another unconstitutional executive order titled the National Defense Resources Preparation order. It is similar to orders signed by past Presidents, but this one includes language that appears to give Obama the authority to declare martial law in peacetime, and take over the allocation of everything from food and fuel to transportation and health care. This violates the Constitution in a number of different ways. 12. Last but not the least of my dirty dozen of impeachable offenses, is the fact that since taking office the President has used executive orders, laws pushed through Congress in the dark of night, and administrative actions by his departments to nationalize and control automobile manufacturers, banks, insurance companies, and portions of the healthcare industry. This is designed to take our country from a free enterprise economy to a socialist economy. There is absolutely no authority in the Constitution of the United States that allows the President to do this.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360121701854</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:35:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360122598644-245</Id><Topic><Title>scafflow of the Boeing message board</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360094974292</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:09:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't get it.
