The A320 family first went into service more than two decades ago. The Airbus A320 family includes the A318, A319, A320 and A321 models — passenger jets with 100 to 220 seats. It could be another few years before the last of the thousands of narrow-body, twin-engine jets in use in the U.S. and overseas are modified to counteract the problem. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an order in 2010 giving U.S. airlines four years to make the fixes. The FAA's European counterpart did the same thing in 2009. Safety regulators put the cost at $6,000 per plane. As United Flight 731 climbed out of Newark with 107 people aboard, the pilot and first officer were startled to find screens that display crucial navigational information were blank or unreadable and radios were dead. They had no way to communicate with air traffic controllers or detect other planes around them in the New York City area's crowded airspace. The January 2008 emergency was far from the first such multiple electrical failures. Also, pilots who post to a website operated by NASA have described at least seven more instances of multiple electrical failures that forced them to abort takeoffs or make unscheduled landings. It isn't known how many of the 633 A320-series jets operated by U.S. carriers are flying without the required modification because airlines do not have to notify the FAA about each. But United said earlier this year that it has completed work on more than half its fleet of 152 Airbuses covered by the FAA's directive, while USAirways said it has modified more than 60 percent of its 189 affected Airbuses.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1345640125000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 08:55:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345640310000-32</Id><Title>china india please have mercy on us</Title><Msg>http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175113/Michael_Klare_the_great_superpower_meltdown</Msg><Username>ericwaldron11433</Username><Timestamp>1345640310000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 08:58:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345641511000-33</Id><Title>Americans disapprove of Ryan’s Medicare voucher plan</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON -- More than seven in 10 Americans have heard of Republican vice president-designate Paul Ryan's proposal to eliminate traditional Medicare, and among them those who oppose the idea outnumber supporters, according to a poll released Tuesday.

Obama does later qualify his comment with his "support" of small businesses - whatever that means. During the “you didn’t build that” speech he was very explicit, surprisingly honest, when he said that there were folks, "along the way", like ditch diggers and school teachers and road builders, that made it possible for the small business to be successful. Simply nonsense. That is a "communal" and stereo-typical marxist view, harkening back to the days of the Soviet Union. His words: "If you've got a business -- you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen." It is an absolute stretch of the imagination to think that Obama is somehow politely assigning some nominal and perfunctory credit to ditch diggers, teachers, and road builders. He is outright telling businesses that he does not believe that they deserve credit for making their business happen.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1345653989000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 12:46:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345654020000-74</Id><Topic><Title>Difference Between Obama and Aikin</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1345647891000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:04:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can't be serious can you?

It is too bad that you cannot see the relationship between error (making a mistake, saying something stupid, or doing something bad) and offering a heartfelt apology, or in Obama's case, NEEDING to apologize. This President must be perfect because he has NEVER apologized for anything that he has done or his people have done or the gross inaccuracies of his PACs. An incredible feat for any human. However, he did make a speech in Cairo in 2009 to apologize for America.

By 2015 airlines are starting to look at aircraft built in China, and the end is near. Boeing will be delisted from the Dow Jones by 8-20-2017. The reasons are clear, Boeing has already accumulated too much massive debt, with late and failed programs, Boeing Management has paid themselves while refusing to fund worker pensions and now has over 2 billion in underfunded pensions Boeing’s failure is all due to outsourcing business model which was known to not work with another aircraft manufacturer that Boeing purchased .

An anti-Obama documentary based on conservative author Dinesh D’Souza’s book The Roots of Obama’s Rage will expand nationwide this weekend after doing notable business in select markets across the country -- including in liberally minded New York City. Overall, 2016: Obama's America grossed an impressive $1.2 million last weekend as it upped its theater count from 61 to 169 for a total gross of $2 million, the second-best showing of the year for a documentary after Bully ($3.2 million). That doesn't include nature documentaries Chimpanzee ($29 million) and To the Arctic ($7.6 million). It's already the No. 12 political documentary of all time -- a market that Michael Moore has cornered -- as well as the No. 2 conservative documentary after Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed ($7.7 million). On Friday, Obama's America, co-directed by D'Souza and John Sullivan, will be playing in 1,075 theaters in an aggressive expansion that comes on the eve of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., which gets underway Aug. 27. Obama's America, distributed by Rocky Mountain Pictures, first began rolling out in mid-July and has been slowly adding theaters. On Aug. 10, it opened in a number of markets, including New York and Los Angeles (including the conservative Simi Valley). Some in Hollywood were stumped by the amount of business the documentary did at the Regal Union Square Stadium 14 in lower Manhattan, situated in a liberal neighborhood where films from the likes of Moore have done huge business. Last weekend, Obama's America fell only 40 percent at the Union Square theater.

I have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year."

Further, he draws an equation between the violence of 9/11 and what he claims was U.S. torture. Completely absurd.

Illegal immigrants could reap more than $7B in tax credits this year, senator says Published August 22, 2012 March 20, 2012: Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, gestures during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP) Illegal immigrants could receive more than $7 billion this year in federal tax credits, according to one estimate, thanks to a loophole in the law that allows people not authorized to work to reap the government payments with no questions asked. Sen. Jeff Sessions' office calculated that, based on recent trends, illegal immigrants could receive roughly $7.4 billion through a provision known as the Additional Child Tax Credit. That's more than quadruple what the payout was four years ago, but the payments have been steadily increasing over the past decade. Though illegal immigrants are prohibited from receiving similar tax credits, a quirk in the law allows them to qualify for the child tax credit. And it's a "refundable" credit, meaning recipients can reap the money -- with average checks totaling about $1,800 -- even if they've paid no taxes. An aide to Sessions, R-Ala., the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said the issue is a "serious matter that deserves attention" and another sign of how "Washington is disconnected from reality." Illegal immigrants can qualify because even people not authorized to work in the U.S. are supposed to file returns with the IRS. If they don't have a Social Security number, they are provided what's known as an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number in order to file returns. And those filers are not excluded from claiming the Additional Child Tax Credit, which is offered to some families with children under 17 years old. A report last year by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found the claims added up to $4.2 billion in 2010. Sessions' office calculated the $7.4 billion figure based on the IG report numbers and White House budget numbers. The IG report last year recommended that Congress pass legislation to "clarify" whether the tax credits should actually be paid to those not authorized to work in the U.S. Sessions co-sponsored a bill earlier this year to bar illegal immigrants from receiving the credit, but the bill was blocked from reaching the floor by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Reid at the time said the bill targeted the children of low-income Hispanic families. Recent expansions to the credit under the stimulus law are set to expire at the end of the year.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345662825000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 15:13:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345662961000-120</Id><Topic><Title>Thought For The Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_85</Username><Timestamp>1345588908000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 18:41:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"How much of the Bible do you think are Gods words?"

Paul Ryan Mocks Obama's 'Imaginary Recovery' By Joy Lin Published August 22, 2012 Roanoke, Va. - Republican vice presidential pick Paul Ryan slammed President Obama for his "You didn't that" comment Wednesday, making a campaign stop just ten minutes down the street from where the president made the GOP-parodied remark in July. "He said last summer was going to be the summer of recovery," Ryan said. "It's a summer later and it's still worse. He said that the private sector is doing just fine, we need more government. This is President Obama's imaginary recovery. It's not here." In a reflection of how important Virginia plays into the Republican roadmap to winning the White House, Ryan was holding his fourth day of events in the swing state just twelve days into his candidacy. Ryan was introduced onstage by Chris McMurray, the owner of Crumb and Get it Bakery, who -- the campaign was quick to note -- made local headlines after declining a visit from Vice President Joe Biden, citing the president's remarks as reason to refuse the request. Romney's running mate continued to hammer the message that the administration's assessments of the economy haven't aligned the country's sluggish growth. In summer of 2010, President Obama and Vice President Biden embarked on a "Recovery Summer" tour, a series of stops which then White House senior adviser David Axelrod said would underscore how this summer would be "the most active Recovery Act season yet." This June, President told reporters the "private sector is doing just fine" but would later walk back his comments, saying "it's absolutely clear that the economy is not doing fine." All of this proved to be fodder for Ryan's argument.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345663581000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 15:26:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345663860000-123</Id><Title>The Breck Girl Not Invited this Year, eh?</Title><Msg>John Edwards Stiffed, Not Invited to Dem.

Edwards's old running mate, however, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, has been invited to the convention and will be delivering a speech. The Democratic convention official refused to explain why Edwards had not been invited to this year's convention in his home state. But one imagines Edwards was stiffed at least in part because of his high-profile legal problems and the fact that he fathered an illegitimate child as his wife was dying of cancer. Former President Bill Clinton is delivering the keynote address at this year's Democratic convention on September 5. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are expected to receive their party's official nomination the next day.

Middle class suffers 'worst decade in modern history,' report says Published August 22, 2012 Associated Press The middle class is receiving less of America's total income, declining to its smallest share in decades as median wages stagnate in the economic doldrums and wealth concentrates at the top. A study released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center highlights diminished hopes, too, for the roughly 50 percent of adults defined as middle class, with household incomes ranging from $39,000 to $118,000. The report describes this mid-tier group as suffering its "worst decade in modern history," having fallen backward in income for the first time since the end of World War II. Three years after the recession technically ended, middle class Americans are still feeling the economic pinch, with most saying they have been forced to reduce spending in the past year. And fewer now believe that hard work will allow them to get ahead in life. Families are now more likely to say their children's economic future will be the same or worse than their own. In all, 85 percent of middle class Americans say it is more difficult now than a decade ago to maintain their standard of living. Some 62 percent say a lot of the blame lies with Congress. A slight majority say a lot lies with banks and other financial institutions. Just 8 percent blame the middle class itself. "The job market is changing, our living standards are falling in the middle, and middle-income parents are now afraid that their children will be worse off than they are," says Timothy Smeeding, a University of Wisconsin-Madison economics professor who specializes in income inequality. He said that many middle-income families have taken a big hit in the past decade as health care costs increase, mid-wage jobs disappear due to automation and outsourcing and college tuition mounts for those seeking to build credentials to get better work. In the meantime, more-affluent families have fared better in net worth because they are less dependent than lower-income groups on home property values, which remain shriveled after the housing bust. Wealthier Americans are more likely to be invested in the stock market, which as a whole has been quicker to recover from the downturn. "These are the disaffected middle class who work hard and play by the rules of society, but increasingly see their situation declining by forces beyond their control," Smeeding said in an interview. "No matter who is president, the climb back up for the middle class and the recovery will be slow and often painful." The Pew study is just the latest indicator of a long-term trend of widening U.S. income inequality. The Census Bureau reported last year that income fell for the wealthiest -- down 1.2 percent to $180,810 for the top 5 percent of households. But the bottom fifth of households -- those making $20,000 or less -- saw incomes decline 4 percent.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345664106000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 15:35:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345664410000-126</Id><Topic><Title>Affirmative Action Queen, Obama, Mis-spells OHIO!</Title><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345661502000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 14:51:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He got mixed up with Oahu.</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1345664410000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 15:40:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345664698000-127</Id><Topic><Title>Obamaville..

Boeing was $73 now $72 and 100 spam Boeing airplane orders and bumps later, , plane orders means nothing. It is the cost and delay and massive debt that matters , . While the CEO of Boeing made more money for himself last year , than the Boeing company paid in taxes, the stock price does nothing. However apple has gone up 100 dollars in just 17 days, and the CEO of Apple, when he was alive, well Steve jobs took only 1 dollar per year in pay, the rest he made only if the shareholders made money on their stock appreciation . Get it Boeing pumpers, the CEO of Boeing makes money but the Boeing shareholders get nothing. How is that Boeing stock price working for you now that is more gain in half a month in dollars than the highest price ever recorded for Boeing stock. How is that spam user 100 bumps for the plane orders working for you boeing spam,posters working for you now.

Poordumb, Your point is not lost from a "logic" point of view, but the assertion remains as a matter of faith. However, after I posted I remembered that there was one additional incident of "direct writing" (likely by God). In Daniel, chapter 5, King Belshazzar, of Babylon, hosted a "feast" in which the gold and silver plates and goblets, taken from the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, were desecrated. The well known story of the "handwriting on the wall" took place (539 BC) in which Belshazzar then called upon the Prophet Daniel to interpret the written words. “This is the inscription that was written: mene, mene, tekel, parsine “This is what these words mean: Mene: God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. Tekel: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting. Peresh: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.” That night, King Belshazzar was slain and the Persians (present day Iran) conquered Babylon (present day Iraq). The Iranians and the Iraqis have bad blood going way, way back. As an instruction or admonition to anyone, it is best to not be "found wanting". Like King Belshazzar, we never know when is our last day on this earth.

Such discussions by union members are protected by the National Labor Relation Act (NLRA). Employers' efforts to curb these discussions violate federal law. In addition to this obvious violation of labor law, SPEEA has received numerous complaints from employees about managers telling them to remove and not display union material at their personal workstation. Employees also report finding union-related items removed from individual work areas when they arrive at work each day. SPEEA asks members to document any such conversations with managers or the removal of items from their desks and then relay the information to union officials. Information is being compiled by SPEEA.
