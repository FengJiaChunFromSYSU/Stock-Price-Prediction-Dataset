What's more, Feinstein says, the law won't affect Americans’ basic right to purchase and use weapons. "Senator Feinstein respects Cpl. Boston's service. She has heard from thousands of people – including many gun owners – who support her plan to stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of assault weapons and large capacity magazines, strips and drums that hold more than 10 rounds,” the statement from Feinstein’s office read. “As Senator Feinstein has said, the legislation will be carefully focused to protect the rights of existing gun owners by exempting hundreds of weapons used for hunting and sporting purposes."</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1357451558775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 00:52:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357456085494-2</Id><Topic><Title>Are Democrats Just Plain Stupid?</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1357418349346</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:39:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a word....Yes.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1357456085494</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 02:08:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357460253644-3</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Expanding Rapidly</Title><Username>bearnz1</Username><Timestamp>1357334652937</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 16:24:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>when buying a stock, it's the the issue of making planes it's an issue of makig profits and they are way off track.</Msg><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1357460253644</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 03:17:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357460845308-4</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Expanding Rapidly</Title><Username>bearnz1</Username><Timestamp>1357334652937</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 16:24:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Explain how they are way off track?

Anyone can drive by Boeing at both Renton and Everett plants and see Renton parking are full, just off 405, or from many locations around the factory. I can drive by the Everett factory on the Mukilteo(526) freeway at any time and notice the full parking lots, they have been full for several years , this is not news. Partly, Everett factory parking is full because the outsourcing failure on the 787 did create a huge need for extra worker's to fix the defective planes parts problem and to return all the 787 back to the factory to redo the failed 3 years late -787 planes and , rework them. .The full parking lot is proof that the outsourcing business plan goes against Boeing Managment in Chicago. The plan was to make more planes with less manpower, a failure ., The Boeing stock price you refer to is a loser for any investor.. The purpose of stock ownership is to make money. Boeing is not a long or a short . It is a dead cat bounce stock. STP for a quick profit up 40% in 5 days and 117% in one month and move on. bearnz1, if your going to discuss Boeing then at least take a look around the stock world, you could do worse but making 3% in a year is not anything to brag about. The Dow Jones average beats Boeing it is up by 8% for the last year. Another stock listed in the Dow 30 is Bank of America (BAC)has made more money in the last 5 days 5.8% than Boeing has made in a full year, and is up over 108% in the last year. It too is a Dow Jones Stock I have made mention of it several times FYI</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357477261556</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 08:01:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357481731295-8</Id><Topic><Title>Are Democrats Just Plain Stupid?</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1357418349346</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:39:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as they all are swallowing they figure intelligent folks will think there is something to it.

It’s always been the case that the power of political officials is at its greatest, its most unrestrained, in a state of war. Cicero, two thousand years ago, warned that “In times of war, the law falls silent” (Inter arma enim silent leges). John Jay, in Federalist No. 4, warned that as a result of that truth, “nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it . . . for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans.” If you were a US leader, or an official of the National Security State, or a beneficiary of the private military and surveillance industries, why would you possibly want the war on terror to end? That would be the worst thing that could happen. It’s that war that generates limitless power, impenetrable secrecy, an unquestioning citizenry, and massive profit.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357488112288</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 11:01:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357489253263-12</Id><Topic><Title>Hmmmmmm If the George Bush Tax Cut are What got us into This Situation.........</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1357411457491</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 13:44:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the truth is that Obama has no economic plan except to keep the government checks going out to his supporters in order to maintain his political power! Around 1970. in what was formerly Yugoslavia, a one dinar bill bought an orange. By around 1975, the government was printing ONE MILLION DINAR BILLS......for one orange. If this insanity continues here in the US, then maybe we, too, will read headlines like..."Today, in what was formerly the United States of America,....." There is no easy solution to our economic problems, but Obama is digging the hole much deeper! Soon the only course of action possible for politicians will be to inflate the dollar, because any other action will quickly lead to economic collapse. LMAO. We may be at that point already.

Why didnt bushJr stomp Iran for bringing IEDs into Iraq or arming the Straits of Hormuz (against all treaties), or try to deter their Nuclear ambitions when there bwere sufficient resources there? Generally the Democratic party is the one against expiditionary involvements while the Repubes are the creators and supporters of these indefinate wars/security state/FISA laws.

Many people are able to carry the familiarity factor and sympathy vote, if allowed to. Hugo Chavez is getting a lot of vote worthy sympathy right now.

And since I suspect many conservative voters in the early primary states have rather long memories -- his principled “Libertarian-Republican” approach to governance will only benefit his candidacy down the road. As a limited government, pro-markets conservative, I believe Rand Paul could appeal to liberty-loving moderates and independents all across the nation -- from New Hampshire to New Mexico -- despite the fact he is an avowed Tea Party supporter. But the question is: will he carry his father’s torch and actually run? For what it’s worth, I believe he will.

Here’s the most galling excerpt: Washington keeps proving the point. The political class has just spent two months on a down-to-the-wire nail-biting white-knuckle thrill-ride negotiation the result of which is more business as usual. At the end, as always, Dr. Obama and Dr. Boehner emerge in white coats, surgical masks around their necks, bloody scalpels in hand, and announce that it was touch-and-go for awhile but the operation was a complete success – and all they've done is applied another temporary Band-Aid that's peeling off even as they speak. They're already prepping the OR for the next life-or-death surgery on the debt ceiling, tentatively scheduled for next Tuesday or a week on Thursday or the third Sunday after Epiphany. No epiphanies in Washington: The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the latest triumphant deal includes $2 billion of cuts for fiscal year 2013. Wow! That's what the Government of the United States borrows every 10 hours and 38 minutes. Spending two months negotiating 10 hours of savings is like driving to a supermarket three states away to save a nickel on your grocery bill. It sounds foolish, doesn’t it? I mean, the Congress literally spends months debating the ins and outs of an impending “compromise” -- only to wind up with a deeply flawed bill that does virtually nothing to solve the greatest challenges of our time. (There’s also a zero percent chance that members of the upper chamber actually read every page of the legislation before they voted on it). Nice going, guys. Meanwhile, there’s also this important little nugget: On Monday, 300 million Americans did not know what their tax rates would be on Tuesday. That's ridiculous. Then, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell spent the night alone in a room with Joe Biden (which admittedly few of us would have the stomach for). And when they emerged they informed those 300 million Americans what their tax rates now were. That's unseemly. Then, in the small hours of the morning, the legislature rubber-stamped it. That's repulsive. There's a term for societies where power-brokers stitch up the people's business in back rooms and their pseudo-parliaments sign off on it at 3 a.m., and it isn't a "republic of limited government by citizen-representatives." No, no it isn’t. But at least now I fully understand why Congress’s disapproval rating has been hovering at -- or around -- historic lows since 2011. In any case, the point is how is it even possible that on Monday night pretty much no one -- except, of course, for those in high national office -- knew what their tax rates would be when they woke up the following morning? Is this really the way the founders expected the Congress to operate and conduct the public’s business? The answer is no, of course, but that doesn’t seem to bother them in the slightest. And why should it? They’re just doing what they do best: kicking the can down the road until the next crisis comes along, while taking all the credit for averting a man-made catastrophe they themselves created.

My point was more toward M.Mc's policy of not supporting ANYthing or ANYone that Mr Obama proposes, including Sen. Hagel. Isn't anyone good enough for some bypartisan support...? From what I know the Secdef takes directions from the President and carries out policy and does not make policy. I would think that an decorated Combat Infantry Sgt would know something about force protection, deployment requirements compared to missions and about the needed logistics. He probably also would understand all the hardships of deployment, medical and other needs for families and wounded and the deceased and for deployed troops and have positive his influence in procurements and future systems.</Msg><Username>tcmoiba</Username><Timestamp>1357530149201</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 22:42:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357530508372-81</Id><Topic><Title>If the U.S. were to mint a Trillion Dollar coin...</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357525340452</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 21:22:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We owe private BANKS...not US..and these bankes are DEFINITLY not US...but MultiNational corporations with no loyalty to America...and who have BY DEFAULT a most decidedly GLOBALIST agenda.
