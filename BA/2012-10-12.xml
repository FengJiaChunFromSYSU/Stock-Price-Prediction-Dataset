Granted, Ryan mastered his talking points, maintained his boyish manner, and conveyed the sincerity his handlers taught him to convey. But, he was in way over his head, and it showed. And he revealed his radical far right ideology.Paul Ryan's eloquent rhetoric can't hide his positions! The question for the American people: which man who you prefer to be a heartbeat away from the presidency?</Msg><Username>natsu4fun</Username><Timestamp>1350015356380</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 00:15:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350020347875-2</Id><Topic><Title>Biden schools Ryan</Title><Username>natsu4fun</Username><Timestamp>1350015356380</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 00:15:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ryan, by a mile.</Msg><Username>mr_johnson2u</Username><Timestamp>1350020347875</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 01:39:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350020934580-3</Id><Topic><Title>Look at todays stupidity on the message board:</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1350006147938</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 21:42:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The stupidity is you!!!</Msg><Username>davidathayer</Username><Timestamp>1350020934580</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 01:48:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350021322433-4</Id><Topic><Title>Biden schools Ryan</Title><Username>natsu4fun</Username><Timestamp>1350015356380</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 00:15:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought Joe was channeling Gary Busey and Charlie Sheen at the same time - I was waiting for him to say Tiger Blood and Winning while doing the Busey smile.

"We weren't told they wanted more security. We did not know they wanted more security there," Biden said. In fact, two security officials who worked for the State Department in Libya at the time testified Thursday that they repeatedly requested more security and two State Department officials admitted they had denied those requests. "All of us at post were in sync that we wanted these resources," the top regional security officer in Libya over the summer, Eric Nordstrom, testified. "In those conversations, I was specifically told [by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charlene Lamb] ‘You cannot request an SST extension.' I determined I was told that because there would be too much political cost. We went ahead and requested it anyway."</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350041068552</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 07:24:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350041208394-17</Id><Topic><Title>Biden didn't appear to be very truthful</Title><Username>floydian_slips_11</Username><Timestamp>1350034243803</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 05:30:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"A U.S. security officer twice asked his State Department superiors for more security agents for the American mission in Benghazi months before an attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, but he got no response. The officer, Eric Nordstrom, who was based in Tripoli until about two months before the September attack, said a State Department official, Charlene Lamb, wanted to keep the number of U.S. security personnel in Benghazi "artificially low," according to a memo summarizing his comments to a congressional committee that was obtained by Reuters. Nordstrom also argued for more U.S. security in Libya by citing a chronology of over 200 security incidents there from militia gunfights to bomb attacks between June 2011 and July 2012. Forty-eight of the incidents were in Benghazi."

Biden was more assertive, but he was "Al Gore-esque" obnoxious. Chris Wallace said that he had seen all Prez debates since the 1960's and had never seen that kind of behavior. "Unprecedented" is how he described it. Now some might like that. Here are some poll statistics from CNN (notice that I did not use FOX): "Forty-eight percent of voters who watched the vice presidential debate think that Rep. Paul Ryan won the showdown, according to a CNN/ORC International nationwide poll conducted right after Thursday night's faceoff. Forty-four percent say that Vice President Joe Biden was victorious. The Republican running mate's four point advantage among a debate audience that was more Republican than the country as a whole is within the survey's sampling error. According to the survey, 55% said that the vice president did better than expected, with 51% saying that the congressman from Wisconsin performed better than expected. By a 50%-41% margin, debate watchers say that Ryan rather than Biden better expressed himself." BB comments: I think that Biden did better than I expected - but not that much. And I also think that Ryan did quite well by comparison considering the 30+ years difference between the two in age and experience. About 38 years in the Senate plus four years as VP vs. 14 years in Congress (Ryan). What was demontrated is that Paul Ryan can stand on his own and can take on the Gaff Master. As to Hillary, we'll see what she did or did not "know" relative to the Libya attack and security arrangements before she can be viable in 2016. Kind of a shame. She is the hardest working one in the Obama Admin.

Smith, Times Political Editor Posted: Oct 11, 2012 06:00 PM Barack Obama's lackluster debate performance last week has dramatically altered the presidential race in Florida, with Mitt Romney opening up a decisive 7 percentage point lead, according to a new Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9/Miami Herald poll. The survey conducted this week found 51 percent of likely Florida voters supporting Romney, 44 percent backing Obama and 4 percent undecided. That's a major shift from a month ago when the same poll showed Obama leading 48 percent to 47 percent — and a direct result of what Obama himself called a "bad night" at the first debate. The debate prompted 5 percent of previously undecided voters and 2 percent of Obama backers to move to Romney. Another 2 percent of Obama supporters said they are now undecided because of the debate. "There's no question in my mind that debate made people stand up and pay attention, and it really wiped away any questions people had about Romney, whether they were undecided or soft for Obama," saidBrad Coker of Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research, which conducted the poll for the Times and its media partners.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350058373816</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 12:12:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350058408379-69</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks, Joe!!!!!</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1350054054295</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:00:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is great news.

You might want to revisit what you are thanking God for. Take a moment from your day and read Luke 1:39-41. There you will find the account of the unborn John the Baptist "leaping" in his mother's womb upon Mary, carrying the unborn Jesus, visiting John's mother. Sorry, but the notion that an unborn child as being unimportant, not human, or something to disposed, an apparent hallmark of the Democrat 2012 platfrorm, is just simply sinful.

Whoa: Barack Obama's lackluster debate performance last week has dramatically altered the presidential race in Florida, with Mitt Romney opening up a decisive 7 percentage point lead, according to a new Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9/Miami Herald poll. The survey conducted this week found 51 percent of likely Florida voters supporting Romney, 44 percent backing Obama and 4 percent undecided. That's a major shift from a month ago when the same poll showed Obama leading 48 percent to 47 percent — and a direct result of what Obama himself called a "bad night" at the first debate. The debate prompted 5 percent of previously undecided voters and 2 percent of Obama backers to move to Romney. Another 2 percent of Obama supporters said they are now undecided because of the debate. "There's no question in my mind that debate made people stand up and pay attention, and it really wiped away any questions people had about Romney, whether they were undecided or soft for Obama," said Brad Coker of Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research These numbers include a 24-point swing for Romney among independents, and a 13-point boost with women. Most telling, Romney now has a narrow lead with Hispanic voters, 46-44.

As part of a $780 million settlement, UBS was forced to turn over the names of thousands of its long-secret clients, who were then offered a partial amnesty: disclose their hidden assets, pay penalties and avoid prosecution. Romney – who had omitted the Swiss account on previous financial disclosures – suddenly came clean. Did he reveal his secret account to avoid prosecution for tax evasion? "He's not quite denied that," says Daniel Shaviro, a professor of tax law at NYU. The record of paying an IRS penalty on the Swiss account could explain why Romney has been so determined to keep his 2009 tax return under wraps.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350062985165</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:29:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350063071573-97</Id><Topic><Title>Romney is a two faced liar</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1350062217552</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:16:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republican party at its finest</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350063071573</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:31:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350063104552-98</Id><Topic><Title>Romney tax plan pure malarky</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1350055003046</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:16:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My stock portfolio has more than doubled in the past 4 years under Obama. and it is going higher, until Obama/Biden win in Nov. and CSCO reports unlike in 2000 when algore lost to a duhbya and CSCO went bust</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1350063104552</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:31:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350063282570-99</Id><Topic><Title>Good job Joe!!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350048052302</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 09:20:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>its the right thing to do!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350063282570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:34:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350063377512-100</Id><Title>hey, how about those Yankees...</Title><Msg>they are beatable by some birds from baltimore and/or tigers from detroit</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1350063377512</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:36:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350064354814-101</Id><Topic><Title>Romney tax plan pure malarky</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1350055003046</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:16:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I predict rioting in the streets if Obama is re-elected two years after he is done. that would be Jan. 2019 I predict rioting in the streets if Rmoney is elected after two years or Jan. 2015 if not WW III I prefer the former and the damn mf'ing Yankees to lose too preferably at the hands of the tigers from detroit I may even live that long...</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1350064354814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:52:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350064390543-102</Id><Title>TIC TOC your running out of time to protect your 401ks the whole market is ging to drop, Don't let them turn your 401l into a 201k again</Title><Msg>TIC TOC your running out of time to protect your 401ks the whole market is ging to drop, Don't let them turn your 401l into a 201k again.

We hear about orders but there is little out there about the timing of deliveries set by those customers. Somewhere there is a schedule of what planes are scheduled to be delivered on specific dates agreeed to by both Boeing and the customer. That schedule may be the reason for the sparce week 2.

Paul Ryan of putting two wars on the “credit card,” and then suggested he voted against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. “By the way, they talk about this great recession like it fell out of the sky–like, ‘Oh my goodness, where did it come from?’” Biden said. “It came from this man voting to put two wars on a credit card, at the same time, put a prescription drug plan on the credit card, a trillion dollar tax cut for the very wealthy.” “I was there, I voted against them,” Biden continued. “I said, no, we can’t afford that.” Then Sen. Biden voted for the Afghanistan resolution on Sept. 14, 2001 which authorized “the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States.” And on Oct. 11, 2002, Biden voted for a resolution authorizing unilateral military action in Iraq, according to the Washington Post.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350068138595</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:55:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350068446518-115</Id><Topic><Title>I always sell too early...</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1350067196165</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:39:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>let me get out my (lyin') Ryan Rmoney calcul8ter 71.63 - 69. 22 = 2.41 divided by 69.22 = = 3.481653% "my friend' fine feathered and tarred you be IAM from the fine state of IO-Way and the Wells Fargo wagon is commin' to town according to Robert Preston in the Music Man in the words of otters if ain't having fun riding the waves we don't know what you otter be shadow otter</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1350068446518</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:00:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350069242258-116</Id><Topic><Title>I always sell too early...</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1350067196165</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:39:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound like a repressed h0m0sexual... still!</Msg><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1350069242258</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:14:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350069373406-117</Id><Topic><Title>Boom: Romney Leads 51-44 in New Florida Poll - UPDATE: Up 7 In Virginia, Too</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1350062084511</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:14:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Momentun is Definitely with Mitt and Paul....

Per Biden at last night's debate: "When my friend talks about fissile material, they have to take this highly enriched uranium, get it from 20 percent up, then they have to be able to have something to put it in. There is no weapon that the Iranians have at this point. Both the Israelis and we know – we'll know if they start the process of building a weapon." So Biden seems to be of the opinion that Iran can go on its merry way and enrich the uranium to weapons level, but they simply do not have the bomb itself (the casing and trigger). Search on Iran+satellites+WIKI. There you will begin to see that Iran is not a land of dummys. Iran has relationships with the North Koreans who have already built a few such bombs. Ten years ago, Pakistan's chief nuclear scientist was providing nuclear technology to other rogue nations. And too much such information has found its way on the internet. By the way, the bomb only has to be as effective as the ones we dropped on Japan 67 years ago to do considerable damage. I won't say Biden is an idiot, but the facts speak for themselves.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1350073821082</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 16:30:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350074219803-134</Id><Topic><Title>According to Rmoney and his man-ho Ryan: we have not had a smaller Navy since 1916</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1350070666367</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:37:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chris, That is certainly a good question. From the debate: "BIDEN: Look, we don't cut it. And I might add, this so-called – I know we don't want to use the fancy word "sequester," this (not completed) And let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference announcing his support of the deal. He said, and I'm paraphrase, We've been looking for this moment for a long time. RYAN: Can I tell you what that meant? (CROSSTALK) RYAN: We've been looking for bipartisanship for a long time. BIDEN: And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for, the automatic cuts in defense if they didn't act." Ryan did vote for that but he made a fatal assumption that the Democruds (kind of a "repugnantcon" equivalent) would feel compelled to work together with the Republicans to correct that before it took place.

How come the Government does not take care of them ? Why do conservatives push for a all charity care system? ~~ The VA bureaucracy is notoriously difficult to navigate, and veterans are left to figure out on their own what benefits they are eligible for if any. As a result, many fall through the cracks -- more than 720,000 veterans do not take advantage of VA benefits for which they are eligible. To fill in the gap, veterans charities are a crucial resource -- providing financial assistance and job training, funding medical research and rehabilitative services, and helping veterans obtain government benefits. Every year, Americans give millions of dollars to such groups, expecting that the money will assist those who've served their country. But as a group, veterans charities are prone to abuse, profiteering and outright fraud, say philanthropy watchdogs. Almost half of the 39 veterans charities rated by the American Institute of Philanthropy in its April/May 2011 report received F grades, largely because they devoted only a small ratio of their expenses to charitable programs, in part due to excessive fundraising expenses. ~~~ Charities that spend up to 98 percent of their donations on expenses such as executive compensation should be regulated so most money can go to the Veterans. ~~~ I personally think our Purple Heart Veterans deserve much better!</Msg><Username>gin.haruko</Username><Timestamp>1350085335959</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 19:42:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350085555155-151</Id><Topic><Title>Big Joe and the Joyful Noise</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1350083726598</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 19:15:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like I have a chance I have scored first place in algebra I and several other classes excpet epagnolia (que : est Los Altos school disrict) it is October and I have swum yes , swum 10 miles per day to get away from here each and every after shcool besides the 2-3 mile to get here and back home each and every day and now they want to throw me into the gymnasiusm/multi-purpose room without paying these high school cheerleaders and pom-pom girl senujors when some band called Quicksilver Messenger Service was supposed to show up and some bandother bandraised their ante none of it, I will have none of this (OR THE FOLLOWING OCTOBERS) and, me dancing out of my one foot-square center-stage seat b-3 parlayed tghe band was called... hole hep o' trouble MSJodie Luck, Iam too young to #$%$, but may you find the the man of your dreams and it woul;d not hurt me if I got an 'A' in english for the entire year either... ps - did anyone record Santana I and parts of Santana II-III b4shut down run 4 your lives the LAPD are coming for ya'all that would be the Los Altos PD and some other in October time the G.Dead played on the back of a flat-bed trailor truck on Emmerson off of University Ave. Paly Alty Most every bank window was broken or other wise smashed into tiny paticles of glass wish i had been there too and the next several octobers too but by then we was -the big kahuna</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1350085555155</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 19:45:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350085905391-152</Id><Topic><Title>the numbers are out the Middle Class has been killed the last 4 years then Biden claims his failures are Romney Ryans failure</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1350049743389</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 09:49:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From checkn//gregjanetommax, the descendant of somebody near Austria in about 1936: "you are one parasite that should be extinguished like a cockroach."</Msg><Username>orly_taint</Username><Timestamp>1350085905391</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 19:51:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350086551288-153</Id><Topic><Title>the numbers are out the Middle Class has been killed the last 4 years then Biden claims his failures are Romney Ryans failure</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1350049743389</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 09:49:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He only said out loud what a shameful number of pseudo-religious Republicans think.</Msg><Username>sammy.shakedown</Username><Timestamp>1350086551288</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 20:02:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350087054614-154</Id><Topic><Title>Wounded Warriors Charity</Title><Username>gin.haruko</Username><Timestamp>1350085335959</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 19:42:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hear hear!</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1350087054614</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 20:10:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350087101323-155</Id><Topic><Title>any body see Obama's homosexual agenda?</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1350082484595</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 18:54:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Make sure to put this on your sandwich board and carry it around your town, park, city hall, and police station.
