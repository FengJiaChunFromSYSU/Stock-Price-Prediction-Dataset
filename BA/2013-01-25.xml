Silver, who runs The New York Times’ FiveThirtyEight blog, explained during an interview on ESPN’s “First Take” on Thursday how he came up with those two teams. “This is the Football Outsiders system, so I didn’t work on it directly, but they’re looking at individual plays, and putting football context around it ... applying some football common sense to the numbers, basically,” Silver said. He added, however, that he thought the two best teams were the Patriots and the Denver Broncos.

He was fired in 2007 for repeated misconduct. He says it was in retaliation for voicing concerns about the batteries but when he took Securaplane to court, he lost. [A federal administrative court judge ruled in favor of Securaplane]. Today, Securaplane manufactures the charging system for lithium-ion batteries used on 787 Dreamliners. Its plant in Tucson is one of the locations visited by investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board as they try to determine what went wrong with two Dreamliners earlier this month. "There is a lot more work to be done before we can determine a cause," said Debbie Hersman, Chairman of the NTSB. The fire at Securaplane in 2006 was well documented at the time. Boeing says it was the result of a [test set up improperly], and it was not a case where a lithium-ion battery simply exploded for no reason. Securaplane says its charging unit has been successfully tested in the Dreamliner. It disputes Leon's allegations. "There was a fire in the facility in 2006 during one test of a [prototype] of the battery-charging unit. However, the current Boeing 787 investigation is unrelated to the 2006 fire," said Fiona Greig, spokeswoman for Securaplane. "There is no connection between the Dreamliner battery issue and the dismissal of Michael Leon from Meggitt's US-based subsidiary, Securaplane."</Msg><Username>jwu2556</Username><Timestamp>1359100987529</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 03:03:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359108326510-18</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing knew about the 787 problem and put the flying public at risk CNBC interview</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359061160229</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:59:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure.

In an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Broun, a frequent critic of Obama noted “I think my role is to uphold support and defend our Constitution.” “The Constitution I uphold and defend is the one I carry in my pocket all the time, the U.S. Constitution,” Broun added. “I don’t know what Constitution that other members of Congress uphold, but it’s not this one. I think the only Constitution that Barack Obama upholds is the Soviet constitution, not this one. He has no concept of this one, though he claimed to be a constitutional lawyer.” the Congressman also said. Congressman Broun has been a thorn in the side of Obama’s agenda since day one. In 2009 he warned attendees of a town hall event that the Obama administration was planning to use a pandemic or a natural disaster to implement martial law in the United States. Speaking at the North Georgia Technical College auditorium, Broun said that the “socialistic elite,” as well as Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, were planning to exploit a crisis to create a favorable climate for their stalling political agenda. “They’re trying to develop an environment where they can take over,” he said. “We’ve seen that historically.” He also spoke out against Obama’s plan to create a “national civilian security force,” warning that the program sounded like a 21st century Gestapo and that it was part of a move towards a Marxist dictatorship. “That’s exactly what Hitler did in Nazi Germany and it’s exactly what the Soviet Union did,” Broun said. “When he’s proposing to have a national security force that’s answering to him, that is as strong as the U.S. military, he’s showing me signs of being Marxist.” Broun also cited the threat to the second amendment posed by the Obama administration and anti-gun Attorney General Eric Holder. “We can’t be lulled into complacency,” Broun said. “You have to remember that Adolf Hitler was elected in a democratic Germany. I’m not comparing him to Adolf Hitler. What I’m saying is there is the potential of going down that road.” As a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Broun has also been heavily critical of the TSA. In recent weeks he has sought to “pick up right where Congressman [Ron] Paul left off” by reintroducing “Audit the Fed” legislation for the current session of Congress.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359114124130</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 06:42:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359116103349-30</Id><Title>BA can be the next ten bagger!</Title><Msg>I personally simply wanted to share this service with absolutely everyone.

Again this was against the wishes of every engineer whoever worked on a large integration effort. An iron-bird is basically a total airplane built on the ground with all the systems in place. The benefit is you can test the airplane functions and get to them working together before they become a flying airplane. A great way to integrate 99.9% of all systems together. I wonder if there is any self-reflection in Chicago about all the mistakes were made looking at everything as a cost. The problem with MBA making all the decisions it is hard for them to quantify how nice it is to work in a total airplane when it is not an airplane. I even wonder if all the problems that showed up during flight test would have showed up in the iron-bird years before actual flight-testing. It is really scary to see all these execs get big bonuses yet there is never any consequences for the gigantic mistakes they made on the 787. The really causes are all swept under the rug. How many airplanes did they build which will never fly. Boeing could have saved tons of money if they had an iron bird. Oh well, water under the dam. When MBA are in charge knowledge is lost and rationalizations are made for bad decisions. Stonecipher and Condit were the idiots in charge when a lot of these stupid decisions were made. They were put out in palatial retirement and then the BOD brought in an MBA/political science guy to solve technical problems. Wow, if there was every a case study for the future. The saddest thing about the 787 fiasco is all the guys at the top will go out in style with no worry about their or their families future. All the 100,000s of Boeing workers and their suppliers will struggle to make ends meet and wall street will claim unions made Boeing go broke. MBA genius at its finest.</Msg><Username>zevach</Username><Timestamp>1359122917438</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:08:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359123009123-39</Id><Title>How much damage in Boston fire?</Title><Msg>Anyone have a link to any photos of the aft battery compartment.

The economy is smaller than it was in September 2011 and still 3.3pc below its pre-crisis peak. Making matters worse, there was scant evidence in the data that the economy is rebalancing from consumption to manufacturing. Output by Britain’s factories fell by 1.5pc in the quarter and by 1.8pc for the year as a whole – the first annual decline since 2009. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, described the situation as “dire” and added: “We believe the economy is essentially flat at the moment. We suspect that GDP will not return to the level seen in the first quarter of 2008 until the first half of 2015 – a gap of seven years.” However, the figures were distorted by a collapse in output in the extraction industries due to “to an extended and later than usual maintenance period at the UK’s largest North Sea oil field”, the Office for National Statistics said. Excluding the effect of the shut down, the economy only shrank by 0.1pc in the quarter, the ONS said, giving George Osborne some hope that the recovery will pick up this year.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1359124471545</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:34:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359126323237-48</Id><Topic><Title>Here Is Your #$%$?

How about that brand new 747-8 ( years late and billions over budget), and with defense spending slowing down, what could possibly be the reason for the unusual support of this stock.</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1359133937664</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 12:12:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359134004072-71</Id><Topic><Title>Fact-Check; claims on guns and gun Violence</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359065716523</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 17:15:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post.

First of all failures of the type they are seeing should be assumed to happen, and mitigated to the point of being a non-issue when they do a Chernobyl. The battery cases should be enclosed, heat shields should protect anything close enough to be damaged from a failed battery, and the cases should be vented to outside of the aircraft keep smoke out of the aircraft. Also battery sizes should be limited, to keep heat management from becoming unmanageable in failure and capacity archived by multiple battery packs which provide redundancy. If they had done it this way in the first place, these battery failures they are having would be a just maintenance issue as to why they are going bad so soon instead of the safety investigation they have become. AB for the new AB350 by the way I have heard is going to have a lot these design features, and should avoided having the issues BA is having. Also I have some questions about the charging, and monitoring systems as to the level of control they exercise, as all they have been able to tell us is the battery didn’t see any excessive voltages or current applied to the battery. On my radio controlled aircraft I monitor down to the individual cell level, and when one burns up I can give you a lot more info on what when wrong than BA can in this case, and so far have been able to detect catastrophic failures early on so that I could take them out of service before the battery caught on fire.</Msg><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1359135041280</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 12:30:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359135702622-74</Id><Topic><Title>Hey England, How's all that Socialism Working Out for You??????</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1359124471545</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:34:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Great Britain's economic problems are far more complex than any ignorant redneck economist can fathom!!!!!!!!!!"

Amidst all the cries of Barack Obama being the most prolific big government spender the nation has ever suffered, Marketwatch is reporting that our president has actually been tighter with a buck than any United States president since Dwight D. Eisenhower. Who knew? o, how have the Republicans managed to persuade Americans to buy into the whole “Obama as big spender” narrative? It might have something to do with the first year of the Obama presidency where the federal budget increased a whopping 17.9% —going from $2.98 trillion to $3.52 trillion. I’ll bet you think that this is the result of the Obama sponsored stimulus plan that is so frequently vilified by the conservatives…but you would be wrong. The first year of any incoming president term is saddled—for better or for worse—with the budget set by the president whom immediately precedes the new occupant of the White House. Indeed, not only was the 2009 budget the property of George W. Bush—and passed by the 2008 Congress—it was in effect four months before Barack Obama took the oath of office. Accordingly, the first budget that can be blamed on our current president began in 2010 with the budgets running through and including including fiscal year 2013 standing as charges on the Obama account, even if a President Willard M. Romney takes over the office on January 20, 2013. So, how do the actual Obama annual budgets look? Courtesy of Marketwatch- In fiscal 2010 (the first Obama budget) spending fell 1.8% to $3.46 trillion. In fiscal 2011, spending rose 4.3% to $3.60 trillion. In fiscal 2012, spending is set to rise 0.7% to $3.63 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the budget that was agreed to last August. Finally in fiscal 2013 — the final budget of Obama’s term — spending is scheduled to fall 1.3% to $3.58 trillion. Read the CBO’s latest budget outlook. No doubt, many will wish to give the credit to the efforts of the GOP controlled House of Representatives. That’s fine if that’s what works for you. However, you don’t get to have it both ways. Credit whom you will, but if you are truly interested in a fair analysis of the Obama years to date—at least when it comes to spending—you’re going to have to acknowledge that under the Obama watch, even President Reagan would have to give our current president a thumbs up when it comes to his record for stretching a dollar.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1359136813024</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 13:00:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359137435094-80</Id><Topic><Title>Here Is Your #$%$?

No, it is not about the woman's body. It is about the body of the new life. Abortion is selfish, sinful, and it is murder. That is what "choice" is all about.

"Keep condoms out of schools so adolescents won't have sex." Better to bring God and prayer back into the school system than to promote sinful behavior. "Support a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy." I believe that that is the current administration's policy. Which I do not support.

During their first meeting on Tuesday, Sandberg told Abraham that he had built claymore explosives with glass shrapnel while serving in war zones, and that the shrapnel could not be detected in bodies of the victims. The affidavit said that Sandberg “claimed a right-wing declaration of independence/constitutionalist political manifesto” and worried that the Obama administration’s current gun safety push was an effort to take away his guns. Sandberg explained to Abraham that he was ready to die and that an Marine Special Forces Reconnaissance team would need to take him out because civilian SWAT teams did not have the capability. He showed the ATF agent Kevlar ballistic panels and iron doors with “gun turret/cut outs” that he used to fortify his home in case of a siege. Sandberg said that he was in possession of a Berretta pistol, an H&amp;K .45 pistol, an AR-15 5.56 mm rifle and a .50-caliber rifle. And he suggested that at least one of the weapons had been illegally converted into a fully-automatic machine gun. “Sandberg also stated that he was in possession of several thousand rounds of ammunition and also in possession of uranium-tipped, armor-piercing ammunition,” the affidavit noted. ATF Explosives Enforcement Officer Gary Smith Certified Explosives Specialist Matthew Traver determined that three sample devices obtained from Sandberg qualified as destructive devices under federal law. Agents discovered a “Fire Obama” sign in his second floor window and a U.S. Marine Corps flag in his front yard when they raided his home. “Improvised Explosive Devices – IEDs – are against federal law, and with good reason!</Msg><Username>natsu4fun</Username><Timestamp>1359139559332</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 13:45:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359139612006-93</Id><Topic><Title>Congressman: “Obama Only Upholds The Soviet Constitution</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359114124130</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 06:42:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unbelievably STUPID tripe.

Deborah Hersman, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, made clear that investigators have found a series of "symptoms" in the battery damaged in a January 7 fire in Boston, but not the underlying cause of the problem. She also said the agency would be looking at the design of the battery compartment area of the plane and whether the certification standards had been strong enough. The comments were seen by safety experts within the aerospace industry as a clear signal that this is no longer just a teething issue for the new plane. That will raise questions about the financial impact for Boeing, which is still running its assembly lines and backing up aircraft to be delivered, and for airlines, many of which counted on getting the 787 for their expansion plans. "We are early in our investigation, we have a lot of activities to undertake," Hersman told a news conference. "This is an unprecedented event. We are very concerned. We do not expect to see fire events on board aircraft. This is a very serious air safety concern." She rebuffed multiple questions on how long the investigation would take, making clear it could be weeks or more. She also would not say when the 787 would fly again, which is in the hands of the Federal Aviation Administration. Former NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said the briefing made it clear the investigators had come up short in their hunt for the cause of the battery fire. "It's going to take them longer," he said in an interview. "Weeks or more Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group, said the NTSB briefing was a sobering reminder that investigators have not made much headway on finding a cause for the battery problems. "It was hard to find a lot of optimism on the call. It sounds like they're still in the middle of a lot of hard work and a lot of mysteries," Aboulafia said. "It just wasn't encouraging. Fire is the last thing you want on an airplane." At least one customer, Poland's LOT, has already raised the prospect of seeking compensation for its losses. Another, China's Hainan Airlines Co Ltd, said this week it was disappointed in the delays and that its expansion plans had been affected as a result. PUTTING OUT FIRES Rosenker, the former NTSB official, noted that other new planes had problems when they were introduced, but not fires, which makes this situation stand out. "Fire is something you don't fool with," he said. "You've got to understand that, particularly given the short period of time the aircraft has been flying." Boeing has said in the past that, because of their chemical composition, these batteries are difficult to extinguish once they catch fire. As such, the plane is designed to contain fires while they burn themselves out. Hersman, talking to reporters after the news conference, confirmed that there is no fire suppression system in the area where the battery burned, nor any way to access it in-flight. Asked if the lack of a fire suppression system in the battery compartment was a design flaw, she said: "We'll certainly be looking at the design and we'll be looking at the certification standards to determine if they were robust enough." Airbus said, we will draw the lessons from the 787," Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier told Reuters Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Billed as Europe's response to the Dreamliner, the A350 is due to enter service next year using lithium-ion batteries, but without the same reliance on electrical systems as the 787, something Airbus says will put less burden on the batteries. DELAYS PERSIST The 787 program was already years behind schedule before last week's grounding, which means Boeing cannot deliver newly manufactured planes to customers. Boeing had to prove to the FAA that these batteries would never ignite as part of the 787 certification and if they did ignite they would not explode.

Its CEO had resigned in a defense-contract scandal. And its stock had plunged to the lowest price in a decade. Two years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, financially troubled airlines were reluctant to buy new planes. Boeing needed something revolutionary to win back customers. Salvation had a code name: Yellowstone. It was a plane that promised to be lighter and more technologically advanced than any other. Half of it would be built with new plastics instead of aluminum. The cabin would be more comfortable for passengers, and airlines could cut their fuel bills by 20 percent. But once production started, the gap between vision and reality quickly widened. The jet that was eventually dubbed the Dreamliner became plagued with manufacturing delays, cost overruns and sinking worker morale. In interviews with The Associated Press, a dozen former Boeing engineers, designers and managers recounted the pressure to meet tight deadlines. Adding to the chaos was the company's never-before-tried plan to build a plane from parts made around the globe. The former Boeing workers still stand behind the jetliner — and are proud to have worked on it. But many question whether the rush contributed to a series of problems that led the Federal Aviation Administration last week to take the extraordinary step of grounding the 787. Other countries did the same. Even before a single bolt was tightened, the Dreamliner was different. Because executives didn't want to risk all of the billions of dollars necessary to build a new commercial aircraft, they came up with a novel, but precarious, solution. A global network of suppliers would develop, and then build, most of the parts in locations as far away as Germany, Japan and Sweden. Boeing's own employees would manufacture just 35 percent of the plane before assembling the final aircraft at its plant outside Seattle. The decision haunts Boeing to this day. The FAA's order to stop flying the Dreamliner came after a battery fire aboard a 787 in Boston and another battery incident during a flight in Japan. It was the first time the FAA had grounded a whole fleet of planes since 1979, when it ordered the DC-10 out of the sky following a series of fatal crashes. Inspectors have focused on the plane's lithium-ion batteries and its complicated electrical system, which were developed by subcontractors in Japan, France, Arizona and North Carolina. Boeing declined to comment about the past but said its engineers are working around the clock to fix the recent problems. "Until those investigations conclude, we can't speculate on what the results may be," the company said in a statement. "We are confident the 787 is safe, and we stand behind its overall integrity." For decades, Boeing has been responsible for the biggest advances in aviation. The jet age started in 1958 with a Pan American flight between New York and Paris that took just eight and a half hours aboard the new Boeing 707. In 1970, Boeing ushered in the era of the jumbo jet with the 747. The giant plane, with its distinctive bulbous upper deck, made global air travel affordable. Suddenly a summer vacation in London wasn't just for the rich. By the start of the 21st century, change was much more incremental. Consolidation had left the world with two main commercial jet manufacturers: Boeing and Airbus. Boeing executives initially had not considered government-backed Airbus a serious competitor. But in 2003, the unthinkable happened. Boeing delivered just 281 new jets. Airbus produced 305, becoming for the first time the world's biggest plane manufacturer. American jobs — and pride — were at stake. And that wasn't all. Airbus was starting to develop its own new jet: the A380, the world's largest commercial plane, capable of carrying up to 853 passengers, or the equivalent of at least five Boeing 737s. "They were scaring everybody," said Bryan Dressler, who spent 12 years as a Boeing designer. "People here in Seattle have been through the booms and busts of Boeing so many times, even the slightest smack of a downturn makes people very edgy." Airbus believed that larger airplanes were needed to connect congested airports in the world's largest cities. Boeing executives weren't so sure. They believed airline passengers would pay a premium to avoid those same congested hubs with long nonstop flights between smaller cities. Now they just needed to develop a plane that would somehow make such trips economical. It had been 13 years since Boeing started development of a new plane, the 777. The company had recently scrapped two other major projects: a larger version of the 747 and the Sonic Cruiser, a plane that would fly close to the speed of sound. A development team with a knack for assigning new planes code names based on national parks had just the thing: Project Yellowstone. The plane — eventually rechristened the Dreamliner after a naming contest — was unlike anything else previously proposed. Half of its structure would be made of plastics reinforced with carbon fiber, a composite material that is both lighter and stronger than aluminum. In another first, the plane would rely on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries to start its auxiliary power unit, which provides power on the ground or if the main engines quit. While other planes divert hot air from the engines through internal ducts to power some functions, the 787 uses electricity. Getting rid of those ducts is one thing that makes the plane lighter. There were also benefits for passengers. The plane's extra strength allowed for larger windows and a more comfortable cabin pressure. Because composites can't corrode like aluminum, the humidity in the cabin could be as much as 16 percent, double that of a typical aircraft. That meant fewer dry throats and stuffy noses. Before a single aircraft was built, the plane was an instant hit, becoming the fastest-selling new jet in history. Advance orders were placed for more than 800 planes. Boeing seemed to be on its way back. "Employees knew this was going to be a game changer, and they were stoked that the company was taking the risk to do something big," said Michael Cook, who spent 17 years as a computer developer at Boeing. But this was no longer the trailblazing, risk-taking Boeing of a generation earlier. The company had acquired rival McDonnell Douglas in 1997. Many McDonnell Douglas executives held leadership positions in the new company. The joke was that McDonnell Douglas used Boeing's money to buy Boeing. The 707 and 747 were blockbuster bets that nearly ruined the company before paying off. McDonnell Douglas executives didn't have the same appetite for gambling. So the only way the board of directors would sign off on the Dreamliner was to spread the risk among a global chain of suppliers. In December 2003, they agreed to take on half of the estimated $10 billion development cost. The plan backfired as production problems quickly surfaced. "I saw total chaos. Boeing bit off more than it could chew," said Larry Caracciolo, an engineer who spent three years managing 787 supplier quality. First, there were problems with the molding of the new plastics. Then parts made by different suppliers didn't fit properly. For instance, the nose-and-cockpit section was out of alignment with the rest of the plane, leaving a 0.3-inch gap. By giving up control of its supply chain, Boeing had lost the ability to oversee each step of production. Problems sometimes weren't discovered until the parts came together at its Everett, Wash., plant. Fixes weren't easy, and cultures among the suppliers often clashed. "It seemed like the Italians only worked three days a week. They were always on vacation. And the Japanese, they worked six days a week," said Jack Al-Kahwati, a former Boeing structural weight engineer. Even simple conversations between Boeing employees and those from the suppliers working in-house in Everett weren't so simple. Because of government regulations controlling the export of defense-related technology, any talks with international suppliers had to take place in designated conference rooms. Each country had its own, separate space for conversations. There were also deep fears, especially among veteran Boeing workers, that "we were giving up all of our trade secrets to the Japanese and that they would be our competition in 10 years," Al-Kahwati said. As the project fell further behind schedule, pressure mounted. It became increasingly clear that delivery deadlines wouldn't be met. Each success, no matter how small, was celebrated. The first delivery of a new part or the government certification of an engine would lead to a gathering in one of the engineering building atriums. Banners were hung and commemorative cards — like baseball cards — or coins were handed out. Those working on the plane brought home a constant stream of trinkets: hats, Frisbees, 787 M&amp;Ms, travel mugs, plane-shaped chocolates, laser pointers and lapel pins. Many of the items can now be found for sale on eBay. "It kept you going because there was this underlying suspicion that we weren't going to hit these targets that they were setting," said Matt Henson, who spent five and a half years as an engineer on the project. The world got its first glimpse of the Dreamliner on July 8, 2007. The date was chosen not because of some production milestone but for public relations value. It was, after all, 7/8/7. Tom Brokaw served as the master of ceremonies at an event that drew 15,000 people. The crowd was in awe. It was "beyond experiencing a rock star on stage," said Dressler, a former Boeing designer. "This thing is so sexy, between the paint job and the lines and the fact that it's here now and you can touch it." But like so much of show business, the plane was just a prop. It lacked most flight controls. Parts of the fuselage were temporarily fastened together just for the event. Some savvy observers noted that bolt heads were sticking out from the aircraft's composite skin. Boeing CEO Jim McNerney told the crowd that the plane would fly within two months. Instead, the company soon announced the first of what would be many delays. It would be more than two years before the plane's first test flight. To overcome production problems, Boeing replaced executives and bought several of the suppliers to gain greater control. Work continued at breakneck pace. "We were competing against time. We were competing against the deadline of delivering the first airplane," said Roman Sherbak, who spent four years on the project. Then on a cold, overcast morning in December 2009, it all came together. A crowd gathered at Paine Field, the airport adjacent to Boeing's factory. The Dreamliner climbed deftly into the sky for a three-hour test flight. But there were still plenty of glitches, including an onboard fire during a November 2010 test flight. Smoke had entered the cabin from an electronics panel in the rear of the plane. The fleet was grounded for six weeks. This month's safety problems appear unrelated. Deliveries were pushed back yet again. Passengers wouldn't first step aboard the plane until Oct. 26, 2011, three and a half years after Boeing first promised. That first, four-hour journey — from Tokyo to Hong Kong — was more of a party than a flight. Passengers posed for photos as they climbed stairs into the jet. Alcohol flowed freely. Boeing executives were on hand, showing off the plane's new features. Everybody, it seemed, needed to use the bathroom if only to check out the bidet and giant window inside. More airlines started to fly the plane. Each new route was met with celebration. Travelers shifted itineraries to catch a ride on the new plane. Boeing had hoped by the end of 2013 to double production of the Dreamliner to 10 planes a month. There are 799 unfilled orders for the plane, which carries a $206.8 million list price, although airlines often negotiate deep discounts. Then, this month, all the progress came to a jarring halt. First, a battery ignited on a Japan Airlines 787 shortly after it landed at Boston's Logan International Airport. Passengers had already left the plane, but it took firefighters 40 minutes to put out the blaze. Problems also popped up on other planes. There were fuel and oil leaks, a cracked cockpit window and a computer glitch that erroneously indicated a brake problem. Then a 787 flown by Japan's All Nippon Airways made an emergency landing after pilots learned of battery problems and detected a burning smell. Both Japanese airlines grounded their Dreamliner fleets. The FAA, which just days earlier insisted that the plane was safe, did the same for U.S. planes. Each new aircraft comes with problems. The A380 had its own glitches, including an in-flight engine explosion that damaged fuel and hydraulic lines and the landing flaps. But the unique nature of the 787 worries regulators. American and Japanese investigators have yet to determine the cause of the problems, and the longer the 787 stays grounded, the more money Boeing must pay airlines in penalties. "It's been a very expensive process, and it's not going to let up anytime soon," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group. "At this point, the aircraft still looks very promising. I don't think anybody is talking about canceling orders but people are nervous about the schedule." As investigators try to figure out the cause of the plane's latest problems the world finds itself in a familiar position with the Dreamliner: waiting.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1359147223657</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 15:53:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359147263908-123</Id><Topic><Title>The Freedom Of The People</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359082108324</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 21:48:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You must be a Kent Raven alias.</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1359147263908</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 15:54:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359147373850-124</Id><Title>SPEEA WIMPS</Title><Msg>Did speea go on strike yet?

I am not getting your point. But, just recently, I did re-read the Biblcal account of creation (Adam and Eve) with my new Bible, New International Version Life Application Study Bible. Lots of good notes and commentary. Maps. Etc. Now I am about to read chapter 18 ("Sodom and Gomorrah"). Trivia question: do you know what God changed Abram's name to Abraham? Abram - exalted father Abraham - father of many Genesis 17:3-8: Abram fell facedown, and God said to him, "As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations. No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations. I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you. I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. The whole land of Canaan, where you are now an alien, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.” Looks like the Iranians, Egyptian President Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Obama are barking up the wrong tree when they are telling Israel to get out.

It is true that various heinous things have been done in the name of God. That does not make God a partner to their sins, just a casualty of false statement. As to your particular statistic, I do not know if that is true or not, but none of them, not one, were done at the request of Jesus. In contrast to wars, there is a website (I don't know if it is accurate or not) that indicates that there have been 1.3 billion abortions, world wide, since 1980, and about 56 million in the United States since "Roe v. Wade" (1973). We can be fairly certain that those abortions were not carried out in the name of God, or in the name of Jesus, specifically.

OK, I know you can. So, why is it that you cannot understand what the Bible is saying when it says something straight out? No metaphors, no symbolism, no parables. How is it that I have "selfishly interpreted" what it says? I get that you don't like it. Now, if you and others reject what the Bible says, then that makes sense. Not good, especially on your last breath, but at least I can understand why you responded this way. It is an interesting point that you make: "The day that ANY law is based on YOUR selfish and prideful interpretation of YOUR religion is the day American freedom is truly murdered". Because I said that abortion was murder? Or because the Bible says that murder must be punished with execution of the murderer? We certainly have other laws that are based upon the Bible, like, "Thou shalt not steal" and "Thou shalt not give false tesimony against your neighbor." Etc. Apparently, sometimes the Bible makes sense, when we are not personally guilty of the sin that is codified as a crime, but anything else in the Bible (that one might be guilty of) is a "selfish and prideful interpretation" on another person's part.

Hooz, Well, that was an interesting run of logic. I do actually agree that school should not be a place to institute (coerce, force) God in anyone's life. I think that that Lord would agree with that as well. But we have become zealots to ensure that the mere concept of God, and worse yet, the mention of Jesus at Christmas, is verboten. Students are prohibited, in some cases, from having prayer, let alone Bible study, separately and privately, on school campus because of the fear of receiving a letter of intent to sue from the "hate God in this life" folks. Freedom to choose and freedom from choice are two different things. Right now, we (greatly) err on the side of "freedom from God" in our school system resulting from fear. It is pathetic, but it is also the work of Satan. Nothing good will come of this in the end.

What we found, and it still holds true, was that some studies had shown a statistical relationship between those factors — areas with a higher prevalence of guns had higher prevalence of gun homicides and homicides in general. But studies haven’t been able to show a causal relationship — that the mere presence of guns, as opposed to other factors, caused the higher rates of gun violence. It’s doubtful, however, that a study could ever beyond-a-doubt prove a causal relationship. As Sorenson explained, scientists can’t conduct a random experiment. So, instead, researchers are left with statistical models, which are “very fragile,” says Charles F. Wellford, who was chair of the committees that authored a lengthy 2004 report on this topic by the National Research Council of the National Academies. These models are subject to what control variables researchers use. “Everyone knows there’s other things than guns that cause crime,” says Wellford, a professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland. So these models become very complex and slight changes can cause very different results, he says. The National Research Council review of the available research on guns and crime found that studies comparing similar geographic areas, such as urban areas to urban areas, known as “case-control studies,” showed that “violence is positively associated with firearms ownership.” But when looking at larger areas, such as countries, the National Research Council report found “contradictory evidence.” Both types of studies, said the report, failed to address factors involved in buying a gun — it’s not a random decision. And gun ownership data itself is lacking — it comes only from public opinion surveys. Eighteen experts participated in the NRC report, including those in criminology, sociology, psychology, economics, public health and statistics. The NRC’s conclusion: “In summary, the committee concludes that existing research studies and data include a wealth of descriptive information on homicide, suicide, and firearms, but, because of the limitations of existing data and methods, do not credibly demonstrate a causal relationship between the ownership of firearms and the causes or prevention of criminal violence or suicide.” Wellford says the new literature that has emerged since that 2004 review “doesn’t change in any way the conclusions from our report.” Why can’t a statistical relationship prove a causal one? There are many other factors besides the presence of guns. Adam Lanza, the shooter in the elementary school killings in Newtown, “had lots of things going on in his life and one of them was access to multiple weapons,” says Wellford, himself a gun owner. “It’s hard to parse out what the effect is of having the gun, but there’s no question there’s some effect.” But is it 2 percent, 10 percent, 100 percent of the causal model? “We don’t know.” Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, says he would “bet a lot of money” that the prevalence of guns increases homicide, all other things being equal. “I think the evidence is very consistent with the notion that more guns have made us less safe.” But it’s “almost impossible” to prove a causal relationship. “All the data are consistent with a causal relationship, but it’s very hard to say anything is causal,” he says. Hemenway and coauthor Lisa M. Hepburn reviewed research from peer-reviewed journals and found that the evidence from studies of U.S. cities, states and regions “is quite consistent … where there are higher levels of gun prevalence, homicide rates are substantially higher, primarily due to higher firearm homicide rates.” But, again, the 2004 report said: “None of the studies can prove causation. They merely examine the statistical association between gun availability and homicide.” There’s also a chicken-and-egg question when it comes to gun violence. Did the violence come first, and then the guns followed, or the other way around? “I don’t think any of us believe the arrow points in one direction,” says Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California-Davis and an emergency room doctor. It’s “probably true that rising crime leads to a perception of increased threat and, therefore, an increase in the prevalence of gun ownership.” And it’s “also the case that making firearms more available is followed by an increase in firearm crime.” A study by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence found that seven of the 10 states with the strongest gun laws — by its own definition — also had the lowest gun death rates. Of course, there’s a chicken-and-egg issue with gun control laws, too — it’s easier to pass gun control laws in areas that already had low gun ownership, and harder to pass them in areas with more gun owners. One thing that is clear: Guns are effective lethal weapons. “If there were no guns, the lethality of crimes would be less,” says Wellford. “You can’t have a drive-by knifing.” In all cases of injury prevention, says Hemenway, the agent, or method, involved makes a difference. On Dec. 14, the day of the shooting in Newtown, another attack occurred at an elementary school in China. The attacker there had a knife, and injured 22 kids and one adult. But no one was killed. Why the stark difference in fatalities? “The answer is the type of weapon they had,” Hemenway says. The NRC report, like Sorenson, said that more research was needed. “The federal government has to invest some money in doing research on what role guns play in violence,” Wellford says. When we spoke with Wellford in 2008, he cautioned against drawing conclusions from statistics that didn’t prove causation. “Work that knowingly reports findings that do not meet a causal test knowing they will be used as if they do can only produce confusion especially in such contentious issues,” he said.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1359152029395</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:13:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359152169080-151</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals are the only ones........</Title><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1359150919733</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 16:55:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>only a dufuss would think the local weather has anything to do with global warming.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1359152169080</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:16:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359152467963-152</Id><Title>More Banks = More Bank Robberies</Title><Msg>Duh!</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1359152467963</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:21:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359152883161-153</Id><Topic><Title>More Banks = More Bank Robberies</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1359152467963</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:21:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooz that's impossible.

But, really, what tremendous harm has befallen anyone in society because the Principal of a grade school led the students in a word of prayer for one minute each morning? Asking God to bless the children and the teachers in their studies for the day, asking for the blessing on the nation and the President? How did this become so heinous that it requires and consumes the total life energies of individuals and groups that have gone on endless campaigns to harass schools until the students do not even know how to spell "God". I will draw your attention to some BA Board memebers who spell it as "Gawd". Q.E.D. Consider for a moment what this verse is saying: "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms." (Ephesians 6:12). The Apostle Paul is saying that this is not a physical war but one of spiritual. My heavy stated "hate God in this life" description may not apply to you personally, but be assured that that is what is behind the majority of the movement. It certainly is not about the love of God. You look at this as a "cleaner" version of understanding the intent of the founding fathers to separate church and state. Is that really how Jefferson would view what is being done today? Or is that what some want to believe? The Supreme Court certainly did not find the "separation of church and state" to be in danger because the Congress, how public and political does that get?, opens its sessions with a word of prayer. They even have a Chaplain dedicated to Congress. His name is Rev. Patrick J, Conroy. This is what he had to ask the Lord today: "Bless the Members of this Assembly with Wisdom; inspire them to act with Justice, and empower them to work toward legislative solutions to the many challenges facing our nation." I have to believe that that totally "frosts" the atheists. There is even a Senate Bible Study, led by a Chaplain Black. And the website that covers this is paid for with taxpayers dollars. Oh, no! So, I ask you, would Jefferson agree with this or seek to have it prohibited?</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359153927206</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:45:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359154171507-157</Id><Topic><Title>More Banks = More Bank Robberies</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1359152467963</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:21:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for picking up on my double entendre.

The three-judge panel’s ruling is a major blow to Mr. Obama. The judges ruled that the appointments he made to the National Labor Relations Board are illegal, and hence the five-person board did not have a quorum to operate. But the ruling has even broader constitutional significance, with the judges arguing that the president’s recess appointment powers don’t apply to “intra-session” appointments — those made when Congress has left town for a few days or weeks. They said Mr. Obama erred when he said he could claim the power to determine when he could make appointments. “Allowing the president to define the scope of his own appointments power would eviscerate the Constitution’s separation of powers,” the judges said in their opinion. The judges said presidents’ recess powers only apply after Congress has adjourned a session permanently, which in modern times usually means only at the end of a year. If the ruling withstands Supreme Court scrutiny, it would dramatically constrain presidents in the future. And the court ruled that the only vacancies that the president can use his powers on are ones that arise when the Senate is in one of those end-of-session breaks. That would all but eliminate the list of positions the president could fill with his recess powers. White House dissent White House press secretary Jay Carney called the ruling “novel and unprecedented,” and said it contradicts 150 years of practice by presidents of both parties. “We respectfully but strongly disagree with the rulings,” he said. But Noel Francisco, a lawyer at Jones Day who argued the case for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the company that challenged the NLRB appointments, said the court had returned to the Constitution’s intent, which was to make the recess appointment an emergency power for use only when Congress was not available. “Issues like this — it’s not about protecting the Congress from the president and the president from Congress,” Mr. Francisco said. “The Constitution draws these lines ultimately to limit the government to protect the people.” In their ruling the judges said their duty is not to speed up the workings of government, but to hold to constitutional principles. “If some administrative inefficiency results from our construction of the original meaning of the Constitution, that does not empower us to change what the Constitution commands,” the judges wrote. The judges said the recess power was created for a time when Congress met only a few months out of the year, and was designed for the president to fill vacancies during the long periods when Congress was not meeting. In modern times, when Congress is almost always capable of meeting, the recess powers should be more circumscribed. In the short term, the ruling invalidates one NLRB decision. But over the longer term it could invalidate a year’s worth of decisions by the independent agency, could undercut Mr. Obama’s new consumer watchdog agency set up in the 2010 Wall Street reform law, and could even call into question decisions made by some judges who were given recess appointments.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359155774806</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 18:16:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359156043477-165</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Moore: The NRA Is Doomed</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1359153619764</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:40:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Fat slob....(I mean Michael Moore not Chris Genna) is wrong again.

Chris, Did you wake up one day and suddenly care that your tax money was used by a Principal of a school to take a small moment of time to ask God to bless the students and the teachers in their day's activites? (We could draw contrasts with other things which the government does that consumes your tax dollars.) Usually, such prayers are non-denominational and non-sectarian, like, "Dear Lord, etc., etc., etc., and we ask this in Your name. Amen" I have never heard a Krishna complain about lack of equal time related to other religions. Their biggest beef was being kicked out of the airports to solicit for donations. I don't think that otherwise they care. The ones that do care are the atheists. Of course, if it doesn't mean anything to the majority of the people, then it doesn't really matter - one way or the other. Does it?

At least, I think so.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359158191969</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 18:56:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359158222675-178</Id><Topic><Title>Raise Your Hand if.....</Title><Username>aeronchampagne</Username><Timestamp>1359119323828</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 08:08:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm talking about 2 years from now - dumb #$%$</Msg><Username>aeronchampagne</Username><Timestamp>1359158222675</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 18:57:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359158238386-179</Id><Topic><Title>When Liberals Call you Names....</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1359148807489</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 16:20:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intellectually bankrupt, desperate, and totally stumped was when Mir(de) vapidly lectured on offshoring and trusts a few days ago.

Even what you call "non-sectarian" prayer would be Judeo-christian in nature and therefor unconstitutional.

Probably Jesus. But I suspect that you were not including Him. Actually, your question is so completely appropriate, it suddenly struck me. And I have even said this before. As to how man should "govern" himself, the Bible is 100% mute on that subject. King, dictator, "dear leader", president, whathaveyou. God does not dictate in that area. In fact, you will not find anything in the Bible about the "preferred" form of governance - except relative to the Jews and their desire to have a king, which God only voiced His opinion that He did not like it, preferring a "religious leader" like Moses, but He allowed them to have kings. And it did not go well for them. But, I think that that is not exactly what you meant. The Bible is about personal belief (of course, in Jesus for salvation) and personal conduct and sin and consequences for bad behavior. Over and over, the Bible points out the need to "nip the bad behavior in the bud", personally and as a society. In fact, there is a verse (you knew this was coming): "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil." (ASV, Ecclesiastes 8:11) Here the Lord is saying: identify the bad behavior and execute justice soon. That relationship between bad behavior and punishment is left up to man to carry out. God gives man that freedom to choose his form of governance, but God says, basically, make it work to minimize the sinful behavior. Now, what constitutes bad behavior? That is why I point out what the Bible says. It has a very long list of things God finds to be bad.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359159328718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 19:15:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359159589175-183</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Moore: The NRA Is Doomed</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1359153619764</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:40:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>can someone tell me. why it is everytime, there is a mass shooting in the USA. the first person to start yelling for more gun control.

This is what the "on-line" dictionary says: "Not limited to or associated with a particular religious denomination." I suppose, in the limit, one could somehow include "atheism" in that but that is a real stretch of the intent of the word. By the way, the Constitution does not prohibit prayer. You have over-stated what you think the principle of separation of church is intended to convey. The constitution says the following: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". Where do you read that a simple invocation of prayer to start school activities is a specific "act of congress" to establish religion? And, is not the court's ruling that prayer cannot be said at public venues itself a prohibition of the "free exercise thereof"? There are a lot of people walking on egg shells. In the end, prayer is "out" because that is what the majority of the people want.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1359160215023</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 19:30:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359160575924-185</Id><Topic><Title>Bulky, so now you want an electoral college</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1359156974566</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 18:36:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I did not say anything about Allah.

So go to a DJ ETF or better use the diversified NASDAQ for YTD up 4.31%,for one year up 11.7% or for 3 years up 46.68% or if you can pick a good stock you should be able to beat those major averages, remember boeing is holding the Dow back at a loos for the year and a loss for this year to date facts not boieng Mangment Enablers will make you money .

That also means Boeing won't know until mid-February whether workers will strike. Last week, negotiators for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace recommended that members turn down the company's "best-and-final" contract proposal. But the 22,950 engineers and technical workers, about half of whom work in Everett, have been waiting to hear from their 105 council members, who are elected to represent the union in the workplace. On Tuesday, council members put off making a recommendation until Jan. 31 and will spend the next week talking with members and reviewing the offer. Ballots are to be mailed the week of Feb. 4. SPEEA's bylaws specify a 10-day voting process, so that pushes the date SPEEA will tally ballots to mid-February. Meantime, Boeing executives planned to reach out to workers via a company-only webcast Wednesday to urge approval of the offer. SPEEA's contract vote comes at a crucial time for Boeing. The company's all-new 787 has been grounded and is the subject of a comprehensive review by the Federal Aviation Administration. Besides that pressing problem, Boeing is tackling production rate increases and development programs like the 787-9, 737 MAX and, for the U.S. Air Force, the KC-46A, a 767-based aerial-refueling tanker.So the Boeing Company Earnings report date is January 30 and expected to be a miss, next the 787 fire problem is not as yet determined, so sad, and then the strike vote so will boeing scapegoat the union for the outsourcing of the 787 you bet!

You know perfectly well that there are times to pray in a public venue, as is often done by a pastor or other person, in a public gathering for general request of blessings from God, and then in private, yes, in the closet, for you as an individual to tell the Lord what is on your mind. A private conversation. Jesus was admonishing his followers to not be pretentious about their piety. I certainly agree with that. Again, I told this to you before, I am glad that you are researching Bible verses. There is only blessing that can come from that. He says that His word will not return unto Him void, but that it will accomplish that which He pleases and accomplish the purpose for which He sent it." (Isaiah 55:11) Think about that.
