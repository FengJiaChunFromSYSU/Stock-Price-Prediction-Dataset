(BA) for comments its executives made at a media briefing on plans to get the grounded 787 Dreamliner flying again. NTSB, The General Counsel David Tochen wrote in a letter yesterday, warning Boeing about false and misleading statment . Or as we all know liar liar pants on fire. And remember Airbus is up 32% in stock price appreciation this year to date and B oeing is up under 12%. But ist gets worse for the Boeing hacks Airbus is up 157% in stock price appreciation for 3 years and just announced Airbus will compete with Boeing on stock price manipulation by buying 15% of Airbus stock back. BTW BA is up only 17% for three years and in related news Both Washington State Senators Cantwell and Murray cancelled the public safety hearings about the 787 so they can "vote " on other issues . sure you betcha Cantwell has received huge Boeing contributions to win reelection sometimes by less than .2% she is the Boeing girl.---- Maria ,a farm girl ( she had some tress in her front yard from Eastern Washington. Boeing has paid for her help, and Maria is looking forward to the uncle Norm retirement and consulting for Boeing when she retires. She is supposed to represent the people of Washington yet she supported Boeing moving to Carolina ? Patty Murray is also on th Boeing gravey train she was elected when her entitlement ended , she ran on the house maker with tennis shoes platform! So way to go Washington State voters you got what you deserve paid for corrupt politicians who support corrupt overpaid incompetent Boeing Executives</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363927516923</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 00:45:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363933698294-2</Id><Topic><Title>ever watch a black mans movie....booty time, I am gonna git you sucka</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1363823806407</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 19:56:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ever watch more than 2 black mans movies......the two you mentioned don't go far in promoting anything positive but believe me, there are more than 2</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1363933698294</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 02:28:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363956223864-3</Id><Title>U2′s Bono to Overtake Paul McCartney as World’s Wealthiest Rock Star</Title><Msg>Paul McCartney may be about to be surpassed as the wealthiest rock musician in the world by U2 frontman Bono. NME reports that the Irish rocker, who owns a 2.3 percent stake in Facebook, is expected to see his net worth increase significantly when the social-networking company goes public on Friday. Facebook is valued at more than $100 billion, which will make Bono’s share worth in excess of $1.5 billion. In comparison, the Beatles legend’s fortune is estimated to be slightly over $1 billion. Bono bought his Facebook shares for about $90 million back in 2009 through his private equity company Elevation Partners.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1363956223864</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:43:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363957024955-4</Id><Title>Democrat Controlled Senate Votes to Repeal ObamaCare Medical Device Tax</Title><Msg>Apparently, the Senate thinks the medical device tax in ObamaCare is a pretty bad idea and voted to repeal it last night. The Senate overwhelmingly passed a largely symbolic resolution calling for repeal of a 2.3 percent tax on medical device companies on Thursday, as more than 30 Democrats joined Republicans in approving it. The tax helps to fund President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law. It applies to a range of medical products - from bedpans to expensive heart devices - many manufactured in the home states of the senators backing the repeal. The Senate voted 79-20 to call for repeal of the tax, but the resolution is non-binding and will not change the levy. The symbolic measure will be attached to a non-binding budget measure drafted by Senate Democrats that is expected to pass on Friday. Full repeal of the tax may be difficult to achieve, given its $30 billion price tag and the opposition of key Senate Democrats, including Majority Leader Harry Reid.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1363957024955</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:57:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363957905788-5</Id><Topic><Title>BA rumored to be bought out!</Title><Username>smith.frank7</Username><Timestamp>1363260989034</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 07:36:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amazing info!</Msg><Username>h_burns21</Username><Timestamp>1363957905788</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:11:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363958887350-6</Id><Title>Democrats Still Bitterly Cling to their Gun Control and the Communist Manifesto</Title><Msg>Let's start with the assault weapons ban that does appear to be dying in the Senate. Is the White House still pushing to have that passed? Do you assume that it's now not going to happen? Biden: I am still pushing that it pass. We are still pushing that it pass. The same thing was told to me when the first assault weapons ban in 1994 was attached to the Biden Crime bill; that it couldn't possibly pass. It was declared dead several times. I believe that the vast majority of the American people agree with us. The vast majority of gun owners agree with us. That military-style assault weapons are – these are weapons of war. They don't belong in the street, and the recent decision declaring the right of someone to own a weapon in their home for self-protection, Justice [Antonin] Scalia acknowledged that you can constitutionally banned certain type of weapons. And, so, I haven't given up on this. Block: You are going to push for it. The Majority Leader Harry Reid says he doesn't even have 40 votes for the assault weapons ban. Biden: Look, last time we passed it we only had seven Republican votes in 1994. Block: But he doesn't have the Democrats. Biden: Well, again. I have never found that it makes any sense to support something and declare that there is no possibility of it passing. There is a lot happening. Attitudes are changing, and I think the president and I are going to continue to push and we haven't given up on it.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1363958887350</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:28:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363959677561-7</Id><Topic><Title>Big Sis Refuses To Answer Congress On Bullet Purchases...</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1363959232238</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:33:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Huelscamp is likely psychotic- he cant even pass muster with his own party and has been kicked off the committees he used to be a member of because of his looonatik ravings</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1363959677561</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:41:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363959787352-8</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Still Bitterly Cling to their Gun Control and the Communist Manifesto</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1363958887350</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:28:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rebel don't you ever have second thoughts when you provide full automatic weapons to criminals and the criminally insane?? why do you want to murder little children and their teachers</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1363959787352</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:43:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363960109330-9</Id><Title>If There's a way to Screw up a System, Democrats will find it and make it the Law</Title><Msg>Health Insurers Warn Premiums Could 'Rise Sharply'... Health insurers are privately warning brokers that premiums for many individuals and small businesses could increase sharply next year because of the health-care overhaul law, with the nation's biggest firm projecting that rates could more than double for some consumers buying their own plans. The projections, made in sessions with brokers and agents, provide some of the most concrete evidence yet of how much insurance companies might increase prices when major provisions of the law kick in next year—a subject of rigorous debate. The projected increases are at odds with what the Obama Administration says consumers should be expecting overall in terms of cost. The Department of Health and Human Services says that the law will "make health-care coverage more affordable and accessible," pointing to a 2009 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that says average individual premiums, on an apples-to-apples basis, would be lower. The gulf between the pricing talk from some insurers and the government projections suggests how complicated the law's effects will be. Carriers will be filing proposed prices with regulators over the next few months. Part of the murkiness stems from the role of government subsidies. Federal subsidies under the health law will help lower-income consumers defray costs, but they are generally not included in insurers' premium projections. Many consumers will be getting more generous plans because of new requirements in the law. The effects of the law will vary widely, and insurers and other analysts agree that some consumers and small businesses will likely see premiums go down.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1363960109330</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:48:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363960330493-10</Id><Topic><Title>If There's a way to Screw up a System, Democrats will find it and make it the Law</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1363960109330</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:48:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With out the affordable care act health care cost would spiral out of control like they have been for the last 20 years. yes its going to cost more to insure more people and it`s great to be an American !</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1363960330493</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:52:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363960449819-11</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Still Bitterly Cling to their Gun Control and the Communist Manifesto</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1363958887350</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:28:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's Obama's administration that's providing full automatic weapons to criminals and drug cartels so they can murder our Boarder Patrol agents......how insane is that? zosima, I've read some of your posts....you're the definition of insane.

The delays are being blamed on the inability of the new NHS111 service to cope with a high volume of calls. The 24-hour freephone number was set up for non-emergency inquiries and to relieve pressure on 999 operators as well as A&amp;E departments. But it was revealed today that some patients in London needing medical advice are waiting hours for a call back. Others are facing long delays before their call is answered then a 12-minute wait for handlers to process their details. Doctors’ leaders described the freephone system as a “disaster” and said it was increasing the workload for GPs. The British Medical Association warned the service put lives at risk. They blamed inadequate staffing for glitches and the fact call-handlers are finding the software time-consuming to use. Dr Laurence Buckman, who chairs the BMA’s GP committee, revealed he referred a patient to NHS111 when she called out of hours only for her to discover she could not get through. In the end, Dr Buckman, who is a GP in north London, advised her to go to casualty. He said: “This has been a disaster in the making. The concept of a single non-emergency number is a good idea: 111 could be perfectly okay. But the implementation has been poor and rushed through. I’m sadly waiting for the arrival of the first body. It’s going to be dangerous for patients.”</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1363960717936</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:58:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363960877756-13</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Still Bitterly Cling to their Gun Control and the Communist Manifesto</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1363958887350</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:28:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Zosima are you a wacko?

If we can get rid of Congress and the Supreme Court too, Barry can announce himself as the Czar Of The Former USA and bring us the hope and change people like Hooz want. Why have three branches of government to try to protect the will and the right of self-determinism when we can have a despot create a Stalinist Utopia and make all our decisions for us? lol One final observation.

Look at volumes one and two days after 787's grounded. They pump 20 millions shares in each day . That's the different between political sciences and physical sciences. In political sciences , money talk, if you could read chart , you'll make big money. In physical science, money is not the governing force. Not enough hydraulic force, landing gear won't open nor close. Advance electrical system required large and fast movement of energy , battery will baked. In natural science, pigs can't fly. Murphy's law is if anything go wrong, it will go wrong. Any thing go wrong will cost you more and longer than you thought. Bad feng shui will result in bad luck. For example, Chinese believed # 4 as bad luck, death , look at Apollo 13=4, 787=22=4, emergency on runway 22 ???. Now think of # 7s in 7E7 series, as wings of an air plane, and the middle number as body of an airplane. Think of airplanes as birds. All the 707, 717, 727, 737, 747, 767, 777 , all doing fine, because as with flying birds , they all got wings much larger than bodies, Now look at 787. the # 8, represent the body, bigger than #7 represent wings . think of the penguin. can they fly?? . In the flying business of Big Birds, they use all senses, they must be very alert at all times, not sleepy nor dreaming about lines nor circles. May be E RAPIDO or GLOBAL RAYA a better name for 7E7's When you design anything that fly, think like a bird. That is my opinion. I hope BA will get over this soon.

Even China and India realized that income equality was preventing their countries from emerging as an economic power. Your version of income equality is best demonstrated in countries like Cuba and Venezuela. You are anti-science and refuse to accept that emotions are a reckless waste of human energy. Almost all stupid human actions stem from emotion. For example most murders are a result of emotion. Then there is the moraL consequences of supporting the theft of other peoples future. Is it moral to deny a future to others in order to provide for someone in the present? What if your actions today cause the collapse of the country and cause hardship and starvation in the future? You ignore the examples of this already happening to people in Spain and Greece. The irresponsibility of actions based on mindless emotion is already causing strife elsewhere on the planet. Your an immature emotional fool and we all know that but the rest of us grew up and actually understand that you can't save everyone. If you really believe in income equality you would seek to give money you earn to some kid at McDonalds. I don't see anybody on your side doing that do you? Nan Pelosi just increased her net worth by $11 million last year. Did she share it with the homeless? Of course not because the idea is nonsense. How about John Kerry? Do you see him imposing a $50,000.00 a year income on himself and giving the rest to those earning under $50,000.00/year? Of course not because deep down they don't believe in income equality. Nobody does unless they are a complete anti-scientific moron.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1363969700887</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 12:28:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363969744059-36</Id><Topic><Title>BA will hit 90 by Friday..</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1363636610950</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 15:56:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Friday is here, will hit turbulence next week</Msg><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1363969744059</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 12:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363969753721-37</Id><Topic><Title>Exactly how heartless can the GOP be?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1363967266040</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:47:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Heartless enough to know the difference between government theft and voluntary charity.

Rape is immoral plain and simple, no matter what Congress says or does!" If you take that position, isn't it just as immoral when Congress legalizes the taking of one person's earnings to give to another? Surely if a private person took money from one person and gave it to another, we'd deem it theft and, as such, immoral. Does the same act become moral when Congress takes people's money to give to farmers, airline companies or an impoverished family?

Of course not. It says something about mental illness. If Holmes suddenly became a devout Pentecostal or Hindu in prison, would these bloggers be connecting the religion to the shooting in the way they are doing now?" This contrast is intended to "normalize" the question of what does it mean to develop faith following sin (in Holmes case a very big sin). But, the contrast does not nomalize anything because the alleged premise of Holmes' becoming a Muslim was that he was seeking "justification" for his sins rather than repentance and forgiveness. And the Koran is rife with exhortation for personal violence - in the name of Islam.

Boeing wants to put the fire in a box because Boeing is not in charge of the build on their plane the vendors are now the experts on the Boeing 787. But iot gets worse, Boeing is still responsible for a build process it does not understand or control. . The Boeing contractors are the independent experts on their software and hardware at the cheapest price possible mind you for the 787 components not Boeing. And it is even worse for Boeing shareholders, except the Boeing contractors do not bear the responsibility for failure on the 787 that is Boeings only responsibility. Boeing is now in defacto position of being the insurer for all the participants, like a insurance company is required to pay for a drivers error in a car wreck, Boeing is a insurance company who took way too much risk and Boeing planned the risk by picking the contractors in a very unsatisfactory risk analysis. Your investment has returned 12% year to dat and 17 % for three years based upon stock price much lower than the other company Airbus up 35% for the year to date and 157% for three years . The Boeing Chicago Management risk takers deserve all the failure credit . Hart Smith said it all. Try to get the software and the hardware solved now Mr. Boeing CEO, your risk assessment failed you did not listen to your risk expert hart-smith, you ignored your experts opinion and went ahead with the outsource it was a terrible idea as Boeings own expert pointed out a long time ago. The failure gets worse the CEO gave himself 20% pay raise while insulting his workers with a take away retirement plan. A great way to drive more present and future workers away from Boeing . Next the basic problem with the 787, it uses a lot of electricity not like the 777 which used more hydraulics and cables to control operating systems and could use the safer(nickel-cadmium) a tried a true safer battery but less powerful batteries. Third while Boeing might be able to go with the safer batteries it would take even more time to recertify another design and when Boeing changes a battery system then Boeing has to rework the software and then test an recertify the plane which takes a long time. The whole 787 business plan is based on lithium ion a battery unsafe at any speed on a plane , which is an example of failed management thinking because when designed lithium-ion battery ( because it was much more powerful not so much a lighter battery that is a small part of why the lithium –ion battery was selected it is 90% more powerful battery needed to operate the much more electric operated plane ) Now not only Boeing management knew that the lithium-ion battery was unsafe at any speed , the whole world knew that lithium ion batteries were unsafe to use on a plane. In fact Boeing had to get special permission to use the batteries which were not allowed to be carried in the cargo of a plane due to their ability to be a firestarter. Now Boeing is attempting to convince the NTSB, JTSB- the Japanese version, the FAA and Boeing is using its political clout to do this all behind closed doors. Senator’s Murray and Cantwell closed down the 787 public safety hearings. So now Boeing has been charged with making false and misleading statements about how the 787 will soon be flying by the regulator with egg on its face. That is like mouthing off to a judge prior to sentencing how much arrogance by Boeing can be done ? And the regulator is thinking you want to what ? You want me to sign off on putting a lithium battery in a fire safe box with a vent for the dangerous smoke and that will be a failsafe idea? Frankly the whole reason the 787 plane is needed is the long range routes over the ocean , the 787 plane with etops requirement is in terrible shape as any fire contained or not, requires a immediate landing and the 787 would be more than an hour away from land on many occasions so the fix is really a non working plan done in by the flaw in the design using to many contractors, and a unsafe at any speed battery, This battery was banned for years prior to Boeing executives idea that they could ignore the common sense of using a bad idea battery to run a plane that requires a lot of electricity to run a plane instead of 777 style systems.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363985404207</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 16:50:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363985876703-85</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats are getting Scary</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1363969161815</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 12:19:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here's a scary one for you: Obama quotes Radical Anarchist Saul Alinsky when in Jerusalem.

Kelleher and Mary Wisniewski CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago will close 54 schools and 61 school buildings by the beginning of the next academic year in the country's third-largest public school district, a move that education experts called the largest mass closing in the nation. The district will shutter 53 elementary schools and one high school, primarily in Hispanic and African-American neighborhoods. The district, which has a $1 billion annual deficit, has said it needs to close underutilized schools to save money. Enrollment in Chicago Public Schools has fallen 20 percent in the last decade, mainly because of population declines in poor neighborhoods. The district said it can accommodate 511,000 students, but only about 403,000 are enrolled. It said that nearly 140 of its schools are more than half empty. The controversial decision to close dozens of schools follows a bitter strike by Chicago teachers last September, fought partly over the Chicago Teachers Union's accusation that Mayor Rahm Emanuel was undermining community schools in poor areas of the city. The 61 closings account for about 10 percent of elementary school facilities, according to the school district. "Consolidating schools is the best way to make sure all of our city's students get the resources they need to succeed in the classroom," said Mayor Rahm Emanuel in a statement. The union objects to school closings, saying they destabilize minority neighborhoods and would not save money. "They keep saying that closing schools is going to save money," said Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis. "This will not save money. It's going to cost money and it's going to leave abandoned buildings, which is another recipe for disaster." During a news conference at Mahalia Jackson Elementary School, which is marked for closing, Lewis accused Emanuel of being on a ski trip when the announcement was made. "Mayor Rahm Emanuel should be ashamed of himself. Shanda!" Lewis said, using the Yiddish word for shame or scandal. Both Lewis and Emanuel are Jewish. The staff of the mayor, whose children attend private school, were not immediately available to comment on his whereabouts. Several parents don't want to see the schools closed. "It took three schools to find the right place for my grandchild," said Menjiwei Latham, a grandparent and guardian of a student at the Mahalia Jackson Elementary School, which serves special-needs students. DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN URBAN SCHOOLS Urban school districts around the country have been grappling with the issue of declining enrollment, according to a 2011 study on school closings by the Pew Charitable Trust. Over the past decade, 70 large or mid-sized cities have closed schools, averaging 11 per district, according to the National Education Association, a labor union for school teachers. This includes Washington, D.C., which closed 23 schools in 2008 and plans to close 15 more over the next two years. Philadelphia announced earlier this month that it would close 23 schools. Education experts contacted by Reuters on Thursday said no other single district has closed as many schools as Chicago would in the announcement. At the heart of the dispute over school closings in Chicago is the expansion of charter schools, which are publicly funded, but mostly non-unionized. The number of charter schools has risen even as neighborhood public schools are closed. The union said 88 percent of students affected by Chicago school closings or other actions in the past decade were African-American and most closed schools have been in poor neighborhoods. The union said 86 Chicago public schools have closed in the past decade. The district has not provided its own number. Chicago has promised a five-year moratorium on school closings, following this year. A commission appointed to hold public meetings and hearing community feedback on school closings over recent months recommended that no high schools be closed to avoid making students cross gang boundaries to get to a new school. Parents and school activists have complained that closing neighborhood schools endanger students because they are exposed to greater gang violence if they cross neighborhood boundaries. Chicago recorded 506 murders due to gang violence in 2012, and its homicide rate continues to draw national attention</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1363986098469</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 17:01:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363986175184-87</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Faulted by NTSB for Comments on 787 Battery Fix</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363927516923</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 00:45:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cbx, that is a stretch and a paranoid one at that , please read my latest post I explain why the 787 has a problem being allowed to fly and make your comments CBX , the FAA and the NSTB are there to promote flying not to kill i, but at a safe and sane way.

The reductions are part of a long-term plan and don't necessarily signal any shifts in production rates for either airplane, the company said. Boeing is doubling its output of 787 Dreamliner jets, even though the plane is grounded and cannot be delivered to customers. Boeing aims to produce 10 a month by year-end. All 800 people being laid off are represented by the International Association of Machinists. A union spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. Those positions would be the only layoffs as the Chicago-based company cuts employment by 2,000 to 2,300 this year at its Boeing Commercial Airplanes unit in the Puget Sound region, Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said. The rest of the reductions will be through attrition and redeployment, he said. The layoffs will mainly affect machinists doing so-called change incorporation work, or reworking aircraft that have left the factory, for the 787 and 747 programs in Everett, Washington. The amount of such work declines after production kinks get worked out, Alder said. More broadly, Alder said, Boeing plans to hire 8,000 to 10,000 other workers this year across the company and expects total employment to be steady or slightly lower across the company at the end of the year.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1363991847900</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 18:37:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363993727642-96</Id><Topic><Title>800 machinists to be laid off</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1363991847900</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 18:37:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good info.

I can't belive Engineering, Quality Control, Relablity Engineering, Systems Engineering etc. all approved the suppliers ATP and hopefully witnessed the results and then all this still happens.

An indicator of how off the gues can be is look up when the CEO said the plane would be in th air after roll out he said a coupe of months it was a couple of years so yes the time to redo is , in my guess not a few weeks or a few months but many months or a year. Now look at Airbus they are going to drop the lithium and their first flight is over a year off and yet I think their first test runs will be with lithium so it takes a long time to certify and chage the battery from the tried and trusted to the lithium ion inspite of all the dog and pony shows this is common knowledge issue , your question with all your control of the process is flawed and yes Boeing lost control and command of the engineering and the build they outsourced it, so they gave general guidelines and specifications which is very different for the 777 which was 100% engineers inside Boeing,</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363999122404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 20:38:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363999208122-105</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing's 787 grounding and why there is a problem now</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363985404207</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 16:50:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nicad should be lithium ion , but I hope you can figure out what I mean Wayne</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363999208122</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 20:40:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364000002319-106</Id><Title>Custerisis on translation please or how I can be a Boeing hack</Title><Msg>Custerisis on translation please I couldn't believe that I could actually understand what I was reading.

Too bad. We all need to try to make this a more professional posting site Sentiment: Strong Buy An Asiana Airlines freighter carrying lithium-ion batteries crashed early Thursday en route from Inchon, South Korea, to Pudong, China, after the crew reported a fire on board. Experts quickly zeroed in on the batteries as a possible cause. U.S. Federal Aviation Administration records point to 46 incidents of airplane fires linked to lithium-ion batteries, and has published rules for stowing them securely in flight. News reports said the 747-400 freighter carried 58 tons of electronics, lithium- ion batteries, paint and flammable chemicals. Officials of Asiana, Korea’s second-largest airline, said the crew reported a fire in the cargo bay to Shanghai air traffic control about an hour into the flight from Inchon. The plane reportedly crashed about nine minutes later after it turned around and headed for an emergency landing at an airport on Jeju Island, South Korea. Rescue boats found some floating debris, but the two-man crew has not been located. The FAA has published new rules for transporting your camcorder &amp; other batteries both as carry-on and as checked baggage. If you’re going to be carrying your own batteries on a flight in 2008 and beyond, it behooves you to read the new guidelines and, if necessary, call the manufacturer— because more than 25 grams of lithium content can get your battery confiscated. i.e. They may take your $500 160 WH Battery and keep it… In their new rules (when they actually published these new rules they don’t say- the announcement has no publication date) the tr</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1364005800584</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 22:30:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364006383214-111</Id><Title>rs2ms2tsks72 warning a Boeing hack at play</Title><Msg>rs2ms2ts2ks72 • Mar 18, 2013 4:04 AM • 1 • Reply Totally agree.

In real reality, rs2ms2ts2ks 72 unlike your false and miselading story BA is not a long or a short it is a dead stock compared to eadsy Airbus which makes their investors 35 and 167 percent gain ytd and for 3 years Boeing makes you 12% ytd so that is not a long or a short it is a tied up wasted investment and 17% for 3 years even worse Wayne BTW you easy to figure out you claim to have questions for me while you state your a sentimate buy on BA try try try once more and learn from your mistakes say high to foulmouthharbor and spartacus99991 for me Wayne</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1364006383214</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 22:39:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364009469376-112</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing's 787 grounding and why there is a problem now</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363985404207</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 16:50:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cessna used lithium batteries for one of their business jets, one of them caught fire on the ground and they switched to NiCad. Boeing wrote a fairly rigorous testing process for Lithium batteries for the FAA as an industry consultant and then decided not to follow it since it was not formally approved when the 87 was ready for certification. That turned out to be a bad decision and now they are doing the testing they should have in the first place as part of their plan to get the planes back in the air.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1364009469376</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 23:31:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364009646426-113</Id><Topic><Title>Ni-cad batteries used on A-380</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1364003142899</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 21:45:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NiCads are used on a lot of passenger planes including the A380 and the 777.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1364009646426</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 23:34:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364010911231-114</Id><Topic><Title>Ni-cad batteries used on A-380</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1364003142899</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 21:45:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, if you read some of the recent post some people are saying no nicads on any passenger jets.
