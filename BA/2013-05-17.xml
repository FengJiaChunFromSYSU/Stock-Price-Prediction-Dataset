It is called reading a stock chart and not listening to Boeing trolls. so if your wasting your money on Boeing stock , then from 94 to 96 is a gain of 2% on your Boeing investment in then days . while going from 55 to 92 is a return o f67% % in just 10 days not bad eh ! all you have to do is sell your Boeing stock and follow me, or learn to swing trade. I made a huge amount today on a coal shipper on the beating of earnings expectations very simple play. One day and out actually 40% in two hours and out. and will again later this month read my posts, it is easy if you get away from Boeing trolls and Boeing hacks and learn how to make money with good trade actions .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1368775722740</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 03:28:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368776112323-6</Id><Topic><Title>So how to trade a stock EGLE and,another 787 electrical problem on the 787 on a test flight</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1368720035744</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:00:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how about that Boeing hacks and trolls , you know how to be a troll and a Boeing hack knows how to publish gibberish about why a 4 year late 30 billion dollar over budget 787 plane is now flying or has more orders and make that into a good thing?

CBS News reported Thursday that leaked versions sent out by the GOP last Friday had visible differences than Wednesday's official batch. Two correspondences that were singled out in the report came from National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and State Department Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. The GOP version of Rhodes' comment, according to CBS News: "We must make sure that the talking points reflect all agency equities, including those of the State Department, and we don't want to undermine the FBI investigation." The White House email: "We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, particularly the investigation." The GOP version of Nuland's comment, according to CBS News: The penultimate point is a paragraph talking about all the previous warnings provided by the Agency (CIA) about al-Qaeda's presence and activities of al-Qaeda." The White House email: "The penultimate point could be abused by members to beat the State Department for not paying attention to Agency warnings."</Msg><Username>agent0977</Username><Timestamp>1368797810516</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 09:36:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368797849125-28</Id><Title>NICE POP !!!!

Lois Lerner, the head of tax-exempt section, made the disclosure in a pre-planned question-and-answer session at a banking conference last Friday. In a subsequent conference call, Lerner seemed totally unprepared to deal with the resulting uproar. 7:27 am by Patrick O'Connor Add a Comment Heads have actually rolled. Miller said he asked the agency to move someone who was involved in this scrutiny of conservative groups from their current position. He also makes it explicit that the managers of this section of the IRS were explicitly warned that these searches weren’t acceptable, confirming a pattern that seems clear in the Inspector General timeline that Washington repeatedly tried to intervene with the staff in Cincinnati and was frequently countermanded.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368814445024</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 14:14:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368814660040-78</Id><Topic><Title>Pole: Would you fly over the Pacific today in a 787 ?</Title><Username>lgbq_4_u</Username><Timestamp>1368812467246</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:41:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do they have inflatable life rafts on board, or are we just supposed to use our seat cushions?</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1368814660040</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 14:17:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368815312967-79</Id><Topic><Title>IRS planned leak last week re IRS targeting</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368814445024</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 14:14:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A Christian group that applied for tax-exempt status was asked to list some of the prayers they said during events, Illinois Republican Aaron Schock informed Miller during his questioning. Miller was careful not to address the specific request – since he’s barred by law from talking about specific cases that haven’t been cleared – but he said that kind of question was highly abnormal. 9:12 am by Patrick O'Connor Add a Comment A quick timeline on who knew what when: George said he alerted Miller’s predecessor, Shulman, in May 2012. He alerted the Treasury counsel on June 4, 2012, and subsequently told Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin. The IG told new Treasury Secretary Jack Lew after his appointment. 9:20 am by Patrick O'Connor Add a Comment One of the things that has outraged conservative activists is the request for donor information because some of these groups were filing for tax-exempt status in part to shield the identity of their benefactors. And Miller, who has been defensive on some counts, certainly doesn't condone these requests. ++ also Miller claims he did not lie earlier- he answered every question truthfully- IF they dont ask - he doesn't have to tell !!!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368815312967</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 14:28:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368816253961-80</Id><Title>If you drive a TSLA car,, you live with the same battery.

Why Obama is suddenly under siege. By Jacob Weisberg at Slate - Thursday, May 16, 2013 Washington’s need for periodic scandal is almost biological. For legislators, it’s an opportunity to strut on the national stage. For the party out of power, it is politics by other means. For the press, it’s an escape from the boredom and frustration of a second term. Scandal means a break in the routine, a thrilling emergency. At some level, the whole political class loves it. Which is not to say that scandal is never real. Watergate was real. The Whitewater affair was not real but managed to be quite damaging to the Clinton administration anyway. Iran-Contra was real, but not damaging enough to turn Republicans out of office in 1988. Plamegate, which began with the question of who leaked the name of a clandestine CIA agent to a reporter, wasn’t real or damaging, though it did result in #$%$ Cheney and George W. Bush not speaking anymore. What a scandal needs to count as real is an underlying crime. What it needs to be damaging is a strong story line. The Benghazi business falls short on both counts. This investigation posits that the top administration officials conspired to hide the truth about the September attack on an American consulate that resulted in the death of four diplomats, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya. Republican accusations about Benghazi derailed the nomination of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. The charge against Rice was essentially that she delivered distorted political spin by calling the attacks spontaneous riots rather than a planned act of terrorism—the theory being that before the 2012 election, the Obama administration didn’t want to tarnish its success against al-Qaida. It emerged yesterday that Rice’s much-parsed Sunday television talking points were prepared not by the State Department but by the more politically independent CIA. But in an inquisitorial frenzy, dead ends are synonymous with new avenues. Republican investigators can now return to Gregory Hicks, the diplomat serving in Tripoli, Libya, who claims he was punished for speaking frankly to Republican investigators. This claim, too, is extremely weak. In less tendentious perspective, Benghazi was a tragedy, a chain of errors that left a diplomatic outpost vulnerable. Even clearer is the political motivation behind that investigation, which is to embarrass Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic nomination. When Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina fulminates that Benghazi is “every bit as damaging as Watergate,” the most accurate translation is, “I am facing a Republican primary challenge.” Last week, Graham survived that challenge and may now begin to calm down. The fresher IRS scandal, in which agents are alleged to have targeted the Tea Party and other conservative organizations for examinations looks similarly unreal but has much more potential to be damaging. This is because it has a readily comprehensible narrative: that the Obama administration used the tax enforcement agency to harm its political enemies. This surely did not happen, but it is something, unlike Benghazi, that people can understand. Richard Nixon used tax audits as a tool of political persecution during Watergate. It’s the kind of abuse that Obama’s paranoiac enemies believe him to be capable of. What actually seems to have happened is this: In 2010, a spate of conservative groups was applying for tax-exempt status. This designation is available to organizations whose main activity is not political, so most of the groups were running a kind of scam by asking for it. Low-level employees in a Cincinnati field office thought they could create a shortcut by watching out for red-flag political terms like “patriots” and “9/12” on the applications. The IRS inspector general has persuasively concluded that this was an instance of bureaucratic overzealousness meeting a vague standard, not politically motivated, and not criminal. But this kind of scandal can succeed even where it fails the reality test, thanks to bipartisan cowardice. No politician wants to defend the IRS. So President Obama has done his best to appear furious about what happened, the Justice Department has announced a criminal investigation, and the Treasury has forced the IRS acting commissioner, who may or may not have done anything wrong, to resign. Feeding the wolves in this way is a bad idea; they know where their next meal is to be had. As the fever takes hold, any additional controversy—such as the Justice Department’s subpoena of Associated Press phone records in pursuit of a leak—is accorded scandal status. The administration is officially “beset” and “besieged.” The final requirement of a successful scandal is that it be less boring than what people would be talking about otherwise. Here, Benghazi and the IRS are up against implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Round 17 of the budget battles, and a stalemate over immigration reform. Washington is desperate for diversion. But it’s going to have to try harder—these scandals aren’t any fun. A slightly different version of this piece appears in the Financial Times.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1368829089680</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 18:18:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368830660519-118</Id><Topic><Title>A Letter From The Speaker</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368828859235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 18:14:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Republicans have been so responsible and so reluctant to use hyperbole with respect to the President, that the American people are following the recent unscandals very closely.

Let’s not tell the public that there were warnings,” Woodward said. He then compared the situation to Watergate 40 years ago. “I have to go back 40 years to Watergate when Nixon put out his edited transcripts to the conversations, and he personally went through them and said, ‘Oh, let’s not tell this, let’s not show this.’ I would not dismiss Benghazi.

A curious (though inexact) arcane quote from Gertrude Stein, a left-wing, progressive, World War 2 #$%$ sympathizer and collaborator and the "life long partner" of Alice B. Toklas. Here is a famous quote of BB: "A person who lies cannot help themselves but reveal some element of the truth while doing so." Our President, under pressure that he has till recently been able to avoid, that is a growing skepticism of the American press, cannot help himself but dig deep into his foundation of beliefs - Godless and reprehensible. Why in the world would President Obama leverage off Gertrude Stein's quotes to intone his sense of being offended?</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1368845932279</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 22:58:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368846157551-140</Id><Topic><Title>Pole: Would you fly over the Pacific today in a 787 ?</Title><Username>lgbq_4_u</Username><Timestamp>1368812467246</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:41:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love America.......I love aviation......and I really like Boeing.....and I love the 787.......but I would not fly on one.......YET !</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1368846157551</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 23:02:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368846624084-141</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Altered Benghazi Emails, CBS News Report Claims</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368830329235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 18:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well CBS would know about altering and even making documents, just ask that Dan Rather guy.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1368846624084</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 23:10:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
