Be specific. Imagine that you were standing before the court of Heaven and you were accusing me of judging in the sense that is admonished in God's Word not to do. Assign the passages of scripture that support your case. In other words, you will tell the Lord, "Bulky said this and your Word says that." It is very easy to latch onto the word "judge" as if it is an all encompassing definition of activity and then, by definnition, it is deemed wrong. But is it always wrong? I shared with you all on this very subject in the past. Even Jesus, after guilt tripping all of the hypocritical accusers, told the woman "caught in adultry", to "sin no more". First he tells the crowd that they are hypocrites (assumed by the unknown things He writes in the dirt, perhaps a listing of their own sins) and, after they are shamed by their inability to throw the first stone (because of their own sinfulness), He tells the woman that she is also a sinner and to stop doing what she is doing. So, how can Jesus on the one hand shame the folks that had rightfully claimed that she was an adulteress and on the other hand admonish her to stop doing what the crowd had accused her? It is a matter of heart. I tell Hooz that he needs Jesus. And I tell Spartacus and you the same thing as well. What I did not include is that it does not matter what you, we, or I do as far as works and politics are concerned, our eternal salvation is about our acceptance of Jesus. Now, you accuse me of judging. I am pretty sure that your Pastor will agree with me. Go ask him.

Remember when Democrats accused Rep. Paul Ryan of wanting to "throw granny off a cliff" because he dared to try and reform the Medicaid system in order to reduce costs and increase quality of care? Despite making promises to decrease the cost of healthcare, afterall, the official name for ObamaCare is the "Affordable Care Act," cancer patients are about to see their treatment costs skyrocket. Cancer patients could face high costs for medications under President Barack Obama's health care law, industry analysts and advocates warn. Where you live could make a huge difference in what you'll pay. To try to keep premiums low, some states are allowing insurers to charge patients a hefty share of the cost for expensive medications used to treat cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and other life-altering chronic diseases. Such "specialty drugs" can cost thousands of dollars a month, and in California, patients would pay up to 30 percent of the cost. For one widely used cancer drug, Gleevec, the patient could pay more than $2,000 for a month's supply, says the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. And if you think paying for treatment is the biggest issue, think again. Finding a doctor is going to be the toughest part. Most physicians have a pessimistic outlook on the future of medicine, citing eroding autonomy and falling income, a survey of more than 600 doctors found. Six in 10 physicians (62 percent) said it is likely many of their colleagues will retire earlier than planned in the next 1 to 3 years, a survey from Deloitte Center for Health Solutions found. That perception is uniform across age, gender, and specialty, it said.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368451049136</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:17:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368451227669-39</Id><Topic><Title>MSNBC: Yeah, Benghazi Could Lead to Impeachment for Obama</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368450675381</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:11:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh yes Zosima , never mind if Obama is guilty or not......heck, he's liberal, a Democrat and black.....an that's all that's necessary for you to come to support him.....no matter what else he does.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368451227669</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:20:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368451246790-40</Id><Topic><Title>MSNBC: Yeah, Benghazi Could Lead to Impeachment for Obama</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368450675381</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:11:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Senate won't?

Another frequent Carney assertion was that despite 12 separate revisions to the talking points, the final product still reflected the "best assessment" of the intelligence community. This is patently untrue, as re-confirmed by ABC News this morning. In fact, the White House's desired talking points were so "useless" that the CIA director personally rejected them the day before Susan Rice made her infamous talk show rounds: RADDATZ: About those. How about CIA Director David Petraeus? How did he respond to these talking points? And I know you have new information on that. KARL: Yeah, this is fascinating. Because Mike Morrell, who was the deputy director, was the one that ultimately signed off on this one. Petraeus finally saw the final version of the talking points. This is the Saturday afternoon before Susan Rice’s appearances on the Sunday shows. He looks at these and says they’re essentially useless. And direct quote from his e-mail. He says, I would just as soon not use them. But it’s their call, meaning the White House’s call.

The truth differs substantially from Carney's version of events, in which everyone but the White House had a hand in overhauling the "official story" from accurate to false. I'll leave you with a handful of additional Benghazi developments: (1) The Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee confirms that more whistle-blowers are stepping forward. The new White House spin may take even more hits sooner rather than later. (2) The Left is already trying to discredit existing whistle-blower Gregory Hicks, suggesting that he has an ulterior motive, such as a partisan axe to grind. His attorney has now revealed that Hicks is a Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2008 primaries, then backed Obama twice. (3) The MSM is finally treating Benghazi as a bona fide scandal. See, for example, The New Yorker: It’s a cliché, of course, but it really is true: in Washington, every scandal has a crime and a coverup. The ongoing debate about the attack on the United States facility in Benghazi where four Americans were killed, and the Obama Administration’s response to it, is no exception. For a long time, it seemed like the idea of a coverup was just a Republican obsession. But now there is something to it...the mere existence of the edits—whatever the motivation for them—seriously undermines the White House’s credibility on this issue. This past November (after Election Day), White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that “The White House and the State Department have made clear that the single adjustment that was made to those talking points by either of those two institutions were changing the word ‘consulate’ to ‘diplomatic facility’ because ‘consulate’ was inaccurate.” Remarkably, Carney is sticking with that line even now...This is an incredible thing for Carney to be saying. Parting quotation: "All of this is a distraction."</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368452849683</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:47:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368453213677-49</Id><Topic><Title>More whistle-blowers are stepping forward</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368452849683</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:47:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great way to clear y our name, and make a name for yourself testifying.

"He" told me via inspiration to tell you that he is not a a he, she, or it...and to warn you about ypur use of langue et language skills, or lack thereof..." As you can see, Bisbee's comment lacked grammatical competence as well as it was incoherent. I didn't understand what was attempting to be said. Given the hour of the evening, apparently I made an assumption of some level of inebriation. My mistake. The alternative was to assume a fundamental lack of writing skills. Thus, I was giving him/her the benefit of the doubt, that the dysfunction was only transient. By the way, are you sure that you understand what Matthew 6:1 actually means? Consider what you think it means versus the following: “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." (Matthew 5:14-16) The way I take that is that I am compelled to tell others what is the truth about God's Word. In your case, you think that doing such is a violation of Matthew 6:1. How could Jesus be confused? Truly, it is not Jesus that is confused, but perhaps the one that said, "I am not going to debate your INTERPRETATION of scripture. I have told you I don't give a rat's rear about that or about hearing you spew it." So, are you the "light of the world"? By the way, you and Cliberg can put me on ignore if that will help.

Bush and kept on during President Obama’s first term, continued that he wouldn’t have “approved sending an aircraft, a single aircraft, over Benghazi under those circumstances.” “It’s sort of a cartoonish impression of military capabilities and military forces,” Gates added. “The one thing that our forces are noted for is planning and preparation before we send people in harm’s way, and there just wasn’t time to do that.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368457388706</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:03:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368457517211-76</Id><Topic><Title>Obama gave US $5.00 gas by Memorial Day when he walked into the White House it was $1.83 what happened?</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1368396862544</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 18:14:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Source????

As we reported on “Good Morning America” this morning, the IRS began targeting “Tea Party or similar organizations” in March 2010. That was when the Cincinnati-based IRS unit responsible for overseeing the applications for tax exempt status starting using the phrases “Tea Party,” “patriots” and “9/12″ to search for applications warranting greater scrutiny. During this first phase, 10 Tea Party cases were identified. By April of 2010, 18 Tea Party organizations were targeted, including three that had already been approved for tax-exempt status. By June 2011, the unit had flagged over 100 Tea Party-related applications and the criteria used to scrutinize organizations had grown considerably, flagging not just “Tea Party” or “Patriot” in group names, but also groups that were working on issues like “government debt,” “taxes” and even organizations making statements that “criticize how the country is being run.” The report, done by the Inspector General for the IRS, also shows that senior IRS officials in Washington was aware of what was going on as early as August 4, 2011 when, according to the report, the IRS chief counsel held a meeting with the IRS’s Rulings and Agreements unit “so that everyone would have the latest information on the issue.”</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368460571892</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:56:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368460687903-89</Id><Topic><Title>Robert Gates: I would have handled Benghazi the same way</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368457388706</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:03:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There also seems to be sort of a naive of how diplomacy and embassies operate.

There is not a military force standing by to protect each embassy other than the normal small guard that is attached to each one, nor should there be. It is in the interest of host countries to maintain good diplomatic ties and keep vandalism and terrorism at a minimum unless they deliberately want to have diplomatic ties severed.

The investigation also revealed that a high-ranking IRS official knew as early as mid-2011 that conservative groups were being inappropriately targeted—nearly a year before then-IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman told a congressional committee the agency wasn't targeting conservative groups. Enlarge Image image image Associated Press Tax-exempt groups organized under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code are allowed to engage in some political activity, but the primary focus of their efforts must remain promoting social welfare. Previously IRS Apologizes for Scrutiny of Conservative Groups IRS Apologizes for Improper Scrutiny of GOP Groups The new disclosures are likely to inflame a widening controversy over IRS handling of dozens of applications by tea-party, patriot and other conservative groups for tax-exempt status. The details emerged from disclosures to congressional investigators by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The findings, which were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, don't make clear who came up with the idea to give extra scrutiny to the conservative groups. The Internal Revenue Service inappropriately flagged conservative political groups for additional reviews during the 2012 election to see if they were violating their tax exempt status. John McKinnon reports on the News Hub. The inspector general's office has been conducting an audit of the IRS's handling of the applications process and is expected to release a report this week. The audit follows complaints last year by numerous tea-party and other conservative groups that they had been singled out and subjected to excessive and inappropriate questioning. Many groups say they were asked for lists of their donors and other sensitive information.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368460780819</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:59:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368460867433-91</Id><Topic><Title>Inaccurate talking points</Title><Username>norivit</Username><Timestamp>1368455638247</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 10:33:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's all they have, and it amounts to nothing.</Msg><Username>freedumber</Username><Timestamp>1368460867433</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:01:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368461009013-92</Id><Topic><Title>Rand Paul suppots Constitution and opposes UN Small Arms Treaty</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368367038922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 09:57:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sadly, that is about the best you have.

The ongoing debate about the attack on the United States facility in Benghazi where four Americans were killed, and the Obama Administration’s response to it, is no exception. For a long time, it seemed like the idea of a coverup was just a Republican obsession. But now there is something to it. On Friday, ABC News’s Jonathan Karl revealed the details of the editing process for the C.I.A.’s talking points about the attack, including the edits themselves and some of the reasons a State Department spokeswoman gave for requesting those edits. It’s striking to see the twelve different iterations that the talking points went through before they were released to Congress and to United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice, who used them in Sunday show appearances that became a central focus of Republicans’ criticism of the Administration’s public response to the attacks. Over the course of about twenty-four hours, the remarks evolved from something specific and fairly detailed into a bland, vague mush. From the very beginning of the editing process, the talking points contained the erroneous assertion that the attack was “spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved.” That’s an important fact, because the right has always criticized the Administration based on the suggestion that the C.I.A. and the State Department, contrary to what they said, knew that the attack was not spontaneous and not an outgrowth of a demonstration. But everything else about the changes that were made is problematic. The initial draft revealed by Karl mentions “at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi” before the one in which four Americans were killed. That’s not in the final version. Nor is this: “[W]e do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa’ida participated in the attack.” That was replaced by the more tepid “There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.” (Even if we accept the argument that State wanted to be sure that extremists were involved, and that they could be linked to Al Qaeda, before saying so with any level of certainty—which is reasonable and supported by evidence from Karl’s reporting—that doesn’t fully explain these changes away.) Democrats will argue that the editing process wasn’t motivated by a desire to protect Obama’s record on fighting Al Qaeda in the run-up to the 2012 election. They have a point; based on what we’ve seen from Karl’s report, the process that went into creating and then changing the talking points seems to have been driven in large measure by two parts of the government—C.I.A. and State—trying to make sure the blame for the attacks and the failure to protect American personnel in Benghazi fell on the other guy. But the mere existence of the edits—whatever the motivation for them—seriously undermines the White House’s credibility on this issue. This past November (after Election Day), White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that “The White House and the State Department have made clear that the single adjustment that was made to those talking points by either of those two institutions were changing the word ‘consulate’ to ‘diplomatic facility’ because ‘consulate’ was inaccurate.”</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368461240387</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:07:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368461791694-94</Id><Topic><Title>Inaccurate talking points</Title><Username>norivit</Username><Timestamp>1368455638247</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 10:33:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not very up to date on the Benghazi crisis, but for some reason the CIA jumped out there pretty quickly with their story, like the kid caught with a cookie in his hand at the cookie jar-"I was just putting it back" "Dad asked me to get it for him".

Those who did this should be fired immediately. That’s obvious. It continues a slovenly week for Barack Obama. The President has been very proud of the absence of scandal in his Administration, and rightly so. The inability of his opponents to find any significant corruption in the historic $800 billion stimulus package was a real achievement, given the speed of the payout. None of his top aides have been caught up in taking bribes while in office — although their race through the revolving door into lucrative private-sector positions is well beyond nauseating. As in most presidencies, there have been an awful lot of political hacks populating the midreaches of this Administration. In the Obama instance, these have shown an anachronistic, pre-Clinton liberal bias when it comes to the rules and regulations governing many of our safety-net programs, like Social Security disability. And now they have violated one of the more sacred rules of our democracy: you do not use the tax code to punish your opponents. Lois G. Lerner, the IRS official who oversees tax-exempt groups, said the ‘absolutely inappropriate’ actions by ‘frontline people’ were not driven by partisan motives. Does anyone actually believe this? Yet again, we have an example of Democrats simply not managing the government properly and with discipline. This is just poisonous at a time of skepticism about the efficacy of government. And the President should know this: the absence of scandal is not the presence of competence. His unwillingness to concentrate — and I mean concentrate obsessively — on making sure that government is managed efficiently will be part of his legacy. Previous Presidents, including great ones like Roosevelt, have used the IRS against their enemies. But I don’t think Obama ever wanted to be on the same page as Richard Nixon. In this specific case, he now is.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368461892189</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:18:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368462180217-96</Id><Title>Why Does the Obama Regime Always Blame the "Little Guy" for their Scandals?</Title><Msg>Why doe this Bunch of Elites always throw some little guy (low level employee) under the bus and blame them for the screw ups of the leadership of this administration?</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368462180217</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:23:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368462300914-97</Id><Topic><Title>Robert Gates: I would have handled Benghazi the same way</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368457388706</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:03:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well said, albucucu.</Msg><Username>instant_karma48</Username><Timestamp>1368462300914</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:25:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368462391057-98</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Now on the Same Page as Richard Nixon</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1368461892189</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:18:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't know who wrote that, but thanks.

They are entitled to their policy views. It’s a different matter for Republican leaders to manifest their views by blocking confirmation to Cabinet positions of the officials in charge of those policies. By doing so, on absurdly flimsy pretexts, Republicans not only impede the president’s nominations for labor secretary and chief of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but also undermine the normal flow of government, upon which presidents of both parties have depended. They help to subvert whatever is left of Americans’ faith in government. And they may give frustrated Democrats an excuse to rewrite Senate rules in a way that both parties will have cause to regret. Last Thursday, Republicans boycotted the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, thereby preventing a vote on the nomination of Gina McCarthy to lead the EPA. Ms. McCarthy, who was easily confirmed by the Senate to her current position as chief of the EPA’s clean air division, previously served as a top state environmental official under Republican governors in both Connecticut and Massachusetts. Competent and well qualified, she’s an obvious choice to lead the agency. Still, Republicans unhappy about the administration’s policies to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and other pollutants — “job-killing regulations,” in GOP parlance — demanded she submit answers to more than 1,000 questions, then deemed her answers inadequate. The deluge may be a record for a Cabinet appointee; more than 650 were submitted just by Sen. David Vitter (R-La.). The Republican playbook is only slightly different in the case of Thomas Perez, chief of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, who is the nominee to become labor secretary. Democrats highly regard Mr. Perez, a former secretary of labor in Maryland, for his aggressive action on voting rights, police abuse and fair lending cases. Republicans dislike him for the same record. Again, there is no question that he is qualified for the job. But Mr. Perez, who if confirmed would be the only Hispanic in the Cabinet, has been the target of baseless personal attacks, with Sen. John Cornyn of Texas questioning Mr. Perez’s “temperament” and “competence.” It is Washington at its worst, and that’s saying something. At a Senate hearing last week, Republicans affected indignation — and strained credulity — by insisting that Mr. Perez had failed to stick up for a federal contracting program designed mainly to benefit minority and low-income workers. It was novel to hear GOP lawmakers posing as champions of the disadvantaged, but their protests were nothing but a pretext. Americans elected Barack Obama president, and reelected him. He’s entitled to his Cabinet. It’s possible that Republicans will muster the 41 votes needed in the Senate to block both nominations — despite their strong qualifications and high ethical standards. If they do, Americans will be under no illusions that the GOP has led Washington to new lows of dysfunction</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368462433966</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:27:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368462523031-100</Id><Topic><Title>if you have nothing to hide- you have nothing to fear-</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368457865213</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:11:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound like a crazy person!!!!</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1368462523031</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:28:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368462576051-101</Id><Title>Watch out for Petraeus.....More 'Whistleblowers Coming'...</Title><Msg>"I do think we're going to see more whistle blowers.

They think it’s their job, and lounging on the Oval Office couches, they nod along with the president’s every musing. But this presidency has taken OOCS to new heights. Mr. Obama has only a few trusted aides, and occasional leaks from the West Wing show a paranoid president suspicious of nearly everyone around him. Supremely confident, convinced by the fawning minions at his feet that he is untouchable, the president dismisses all controversy as partisan attacks by an overzealous opposition.

VanderSloot’s saga was told by columnist Kimberley Strassel in the Wall Street Journal last July. In April 2012, VanderSloot, who served as the national co-chair of Mitt Romney’s presidential finance committee, was one of eight Romney backers to be defamed as ”wealthy individuals with less-than-reputable records” in a post on the Obama campaign’s website. The post, entitled “Behind the curtain: a brief history of Romney’s donors,” singled out VanderSloot for being a ”litigious, combative and a bitter foe of the gay rights movement.” Two months later, the IRS informed VanderSloot he and his wife were going to be audited, Strassel reported. Two weeks after that, VanderSloot was notified by the Labor Department that it was going to “audit workers he employs on his Idaho-based cattle ranch under the federal visa program for temporary agriculture workers,” reported Strassel. “The H-2A program allows tens of thousands of temporary workers in the U.S.; Mr. VanderSloot employs precisely three,” Strassel wrote. “All are from Mexico and have worked on the VanderSloot ranch—which employs about 20 people—for five years. Two are brothers. Mr. VanderSloot has never been audited for this, though two years ago his workers’ ranch homes were inspected. (The ranch was fined $8,400, mainly for too many ‘flies’ and for ‘grease build-up’ on the stove. God forbid a cattle ranch home has flies.)” “This letter requests an array of documents to ascertain whether Mr. VanderSloot’s ‘foreign workers are provided the full scope of protections’ under the visa program: information on the hours they’ve worked each day and their rate of pay, an explanation of their deductions, copies of contracts,” she continued. In her column, Strassel raised the specter that the IRS targeted VanderSloot for his political activism.</Msg><Username>chinamanpro</Username><Timestamp>1368467894242</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:58:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368467967208-138</Id><Title>Republicans have nothing</Title><Msg>But obstruction and hate , what happen to working on Jobs and the economy? all they are are a bunch of mindless finger pointers.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368467967208</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:59:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368467994156-139</Id><Topic><Title>Is it too late to impeach Junior Bush</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368464600892</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:03:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You respond exactly like spaz responds to questions.

Once confined to the ranks of the birthers, the fantasy of removing President Obama from office is starting to fester in supposedly saner minds. Certainly impeachment is on the mind of Mike Huckabee, the Fox News commentator who—as a former governor of Arkansas and political antagonist of Bill Clinton—can be expected to know something about the subject. On Monday, he predicted that the president will be forced from office before the end of his term by the controversy over the Benghazi consulate attack last September. According to Huckabee, while the Watergate scandal was “bad,” Benghazi is worse because four Americans died there, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. The proximate cause for impeaching Obama, he suggested, is the “cover-up” of the facts concerning Benghazi. Moreover, he said, if the Democrats “try to protect the president and their party, and do so at the expense of the truth, they will go down.” When “the facts come out,” predicted Huckabee, “something will start” and ultimately the Democrats will lose “the right to govern.” Presumably Huckabee believes impeachment would be easier than winning a national election. He isn’t alone in ruminating on the removal of a president who just won re-election last November—not on Fox News, anyway. (The ever-crafty Huck hedged by noting, however, that none of this will come to pass if Democrats win the midterm elections next year.) Meanwhile, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, whose cranky pronouncements continue to embarrass responsible conservatives, upped the ante by confiding what Huckabee left out—namely, that like every desperate Republican, he yearns for a Benghazi scandal that will stick. If there was no cover-up, Bolton insisted with characteristically twisted logic that would prove Obama (the president who dispatched Osama bin Laden) simply doesn’t understand the ongoing threat from al-Qaida. “If it was merely a political cover-up,” he noted with satisfaction, “then there can be a political cost to pay.” Advertisement No doubt both Bolton and Huckabee—not to mention Rep. Darrell Issa, whose House Government Reform Committee maintains an ongoing Benghazi probe—plan to charge that cost not only to Obama but to a certain woman who now leads every 2016 presidential poll. The meager substance of the “cover-up” canard was debunked months ago—and to date nothing has emerged to change those facts. (Indeed, even some of the most gullible denizens of Fox Nation have rejected the attempted frame-up lately.) Were the Republicans interested in constructive change rather than invented conspiracies, they might consult the Benghazi testimony of former general David Petraeus and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as the unvarnished report by former ambassador Thomas Pickering and Admiral Mike Mullen. But defending American diplomats and promoting American prestige are both foreign to the Republican agenda, which is concerned with nothing more elevated than partisan power. With his far-fetched comparison to Richard Nixon’s disgrace, Huckabee helpfully unveiled a flashing neon clue to GOP psychopathology. The desire for revenge over Watergate, a Republican obsession for decades, was the underlying motivation for the outlandish Whitewater investigations that targeted the Clintons almost 20 years ago. Now, as the Obama presidency continues, America’s political predicament increasingly resembles the worst moments of that era, when the furious derangement that grips the opposition began to emerge in full. For years we have seen the same campaign to demonize the president, the same systematic obstruction, the same refusal to accept a democratic verdict—and now the same urge to invent high crimes and misdemeanors. The only difference is that the timetable for impeachment—which didn’t commence for Clinton until the end of 1997—appears to be accelerating.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368468988988</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:16:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368469160134-145</Id><Title>Looks Like a Witch Hunt</Title><Msg>By Eugene Robinson Those who are trying to make the Benghazi tragedy into a scandal for the Obama administration really ought to decide what story line they want to sell.

That’s not a particularly noble way to use the deaths of four American public servants, but at least it’s understandable. Attempts to concoct some kind of sinister Whitewater-style conspiracy, however, don’t even begin to make sense. The hearing convened Wednesday by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., produced a riveting narrative of the chaotic events in Libya last September. But what was the supposedly unforgiveable crime? Did Clinton’s State Department fail to provide adequate security for the U.S. consulate in Benghazi? In retrospect, obviously so. But the three diplomats who testified at the hearing gave no evidence that this failure sprang from anything other than the need to use limited resources as efficiently as possible. Advertisement House Republicans who voted to cut funding for State Department security should understand that their philosophy—small government is always better—has consequences. Bureaucrats have to make judgment calls. Sometimes they will be wrong. Is the scandal supposed to be that a four-man Special Forces team was not sent from Tripoli to help defend the Benghazi compound? This is a decision that clearly still haunts and enrages Gregory Hicks, the former deputy chief of mission in Libya, who sat helplessly in the capital while Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were being killed at the consulate 650 miles away. But the decision not to dispatch troops was made by the military chain of command, not by Clinton or anyone who reported to her. Superior officers decided this team was needed to help evacuate the embassy in Tripoli, which was seen as a potential target for a Benghazi-style attack. The Pentagon has concluded that the team, in any event, could not have arrived in Benghazi in time to make a difference. Hicks testified that he disagrees. It is difficult not to feel his pain. But it is also difficult, frankly, to believe he knows more about deploying troops than do the professionals. Well, then, maybe the transgression is that administration officials, for some unfathomable reason, willfully lied when they said the attack was in reaction to an anti-Islam video produced in the United States and disseminated on the Internet. The problem is that there were, in fact, tumultuous anti-American demonstrations taking place in cities throughout the Muslim world because of the video. President Obama labeled the Benghazi assault an act of terror almost immediately—as Mitt Romney learned in the second presidential debate—but it was hard to imagine that the attack was completely unrelated to what was happening in Cairo, Tunis, Khartoum and Jakarta. The Obama administration was eager to make clear, as George W. Bush tried to do many times, that the United States is not fighting a war against Islam. The administration was slow to recognize that the uproar over the video, at most, provided the opportune moment for a well-planned, highly organized terrorist attack involving heavy weapons. This was an error, but it makes no sense as a deliberate attempt to deceive. What would be the motive? To cover up the facts and maximize the administration’s embarrassment once the truth finally came out? Maybe that’s it: a cover-up. Perhaps the administration conspired to hide Clinton’s failure to protect our diplomats overseas. But she commissioned an independent report by former Ambassador Thomas Pickering that said—well, I’ll just quote Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House intelligence committee: “The Pickering Report appears to make clear what we already knew, that there was strategic warning from the intelligence community of a dangerous security environment in Benghazi and that our diplomats were failed by the bureaucracy at the State Department.” Some cover-up. Was Hicks “demoted” for blowing the whistle on Benghazi, as he testified? He asked to come home, understandably, and the department parked him in a desk job—with the same pay and rank—until something more to his liking comes open. Has he been muzzled? Hardly, as evidenced by his testimony Wednesday. I can only hope that Issa’s witch hunt leads to better security for our brave diplomats. Even the cheapest political stunt can have a silver lining.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368469160134</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:19:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368469232029-146</Id><Topic><Title>Robert Gates: I would have handled Benghazi the same way</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368457388706</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:03:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gates knows more than all of the right-wing radio nuts put together.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368469232029</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:20:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368469865878-147</Id><Topic><Title>Is it too late to impeach Junior Bush</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368464600892</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:03:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My understanding is that it is possible to impeach Bush after he has left office.

The so-called Alternate Plan of these three counties doesn't follow the traditional defined-benefit or defined-contribution model. Employee and employer contributions are actively managed by a financial planner—in this case, First Financial Benefits, Inc., of Houston, which originated the plan in 1980 and has managed it since its adoption. I call it a "banking model." As with Social Security, employees contribute 6.2% of their income, with the county matching the contribution (or, as in Galveston, providing a slightly larger share). Once the county makes its contribution, its financial obligation is done—that's why there are no long-term unfunded liabilities. Those who retire under the Texas counties' Alternate Plan do much better than those on Social Security. According to First Financial's calculations, based on 40 years of contributions: • A lower-middle income worker making about $26,000 at retirement would get about $1,007 a month under Social Security, but $1,826 under the Alternate Plan. • A middle-income worker making $51,200 would get about $1,540 monthly from Social Security, but $3,600 from the banking model. • And a high-income worker who maxed out on his Social Security contribution every year would receive about $2,500 a month from Social Security versus $5,000 to $6,000 a month from the Alternate Plan. No wonder Congress outlawed these plans.......they could steal from them.</Msg><Username>chinamanpro</Username><Timestamp>1368471322023</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:55:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368471356642-153</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans have nothing</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368467967208</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:59:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>could you name 3 of Obama failures ?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368471356642</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:55:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368471570618-154</Id><Title>DID PRESS MAKE HIM CRY?</Title><Msg>On drudge, while speaking to reporters about Benghazi.

This means he will face at least three life sentences and could face the death penalty. Gosnell was found guilty of murdering Baby A, Baby C and Baby D. He was found not guilty of murdering Baby E. LifeNews has more: Baby Boy A was the biggest baby that Kareema Cross had ever seen delivered at Gosnell’s abortion “House of Horrors” clinic in the four years she worked there. He was delivered to 17-year old Shaquana Abrams at 29.4 weeks gestation, according to an ultrasound record. Baby Boy A was so large, he did not fit into the plastic shoe box that Gosnell tossed him in. Cross said she saw the baby pull in his arms and legs while Gosnell explained the movements as “reflexes” telling her the baby really didn’t move prior to cutting the baby’s neck. Baby Boy A was so large, Gosnell joked that “this baby is big enough to walk around with me or walk me to the bus stop.” Cross and fellow employees Adrienne Moton and 15-year old Ashley Baldwin were all so “startled” by the size of the baby that they all took photos of the baby with their cell phones. Baby C was an intact baby of over 25-weeks gestation. Kareema Cross testified that she saw Baby C breathing and described the up and down chest movements she observed for 20 minutes. She told the court she saw Lynda Williams lift the baby’s arm and watched as the newborn drew it back on its own power. Afterwards, Williams inserted surgical scissors into the baby’s neck and “snipped” the spinal cord. Gosnell was said to be in the room at the time. This baby’s murder charges were unintentionally dismissed in the place of Baby F, but were reinstated after Judge Minehart discovered his error. Baby D was described by witnesses as 12-15 inches long with the head the size of a “big pancake” when he was delivered into a toilet. Kareema Cross testified that she saw the baby struggling, using swimming motions in an attempt to get out of the toilet bowl. Adrienne Moton pulled the baby out and “snipped” the neck, as Gosnell had taught her to do, while the mother watched. Gosnell has also been charged with Criminal Solicitation of Moton to commit murder of Baby D. Baby E was estimated to be at least 23 weeks gestation and maybe more. After Baby E was delivered, teen Ashley Baldwin heard the baby cry and called Kareema Cross for help. Cross described the baby’s cry as a “whine.” Baldwin said that Gosnell when into the room then came out with the baby — which now had an incision in its neck — and tossed it into the waste bin.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1368473525700</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 15:32:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368473989327-164</Id><Topic><Title>Robert Gates: I would have handled Benghazi the same way</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368457388706</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:03:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gates would have blamed the video too?

It is the former (individual) "control" that I was asking you about a preference - which would have included the Boston bombers. The aggregate control is easily demonstrated in Israel's ancient and contemporary history. For example, time and again they strayed under their own leadership with good and, very often, evil Kings. Finally, God said, "enough", and they were attacked by Babylon, reduced to a small "remnant", and taken into captivity for seventy years. Thus, punishment for bad behavior was applied in sufficient measure to get them "in line" and prepare for the coming of the Messiah. Everything, everything about God's dealings with Israel was about the Messiah (Jesus). Thus, while individuals, such as King Herod committed great sins against God - in the killing of male babies (when Jesus was born) to stop the advent of a new "King" - He allowed it, but did not allow the advent of Jesus coming to be undone. He sent Joseph and Mary away to Egypt with the baby Jesus to prevent Herod's evil scheme. In the same manner, God has blessed the United States in a way that is unprecedented. And it was the United States, single-handed, that stopped Hitler from carrying out its plan to exterminate the Jews. God still has a purpose for Israel. The re-gathering of Israel as a nation (1948) and its purpose during the Tribulation (soon to happen) are a part of Biblical prophecy. - BB</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1368478267420</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:51:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368478607287-187</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans have nothing</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368467967208</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:59:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republicans know they have nothing that`s why everyday since the election its been like this poop tossing contest , they have gotten lots all over themselves but have failed to get any of it to stick to the wall. get back to creating jobs and working on our Economy your just wasting time and money investigating everything . don`t cry and ask why when you keep losing elections its pretty obvious why.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368478607287</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:56:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368478681890-188</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans have nothing</Title><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368467967208</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:59:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You fruit cakes are all the same you make claims but never come though your guys stuff is getting so old.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368478681890</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:58:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368478724590-189</Id><Title>Will Obama Ask AG Holder to investigate the IRS Scandal????</Title><Msg>....or will he ask someone who is not a scandal himself?</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1368478724590</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:58:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368478792449-190</Id><Topic><Title>Robert Gates: I would have handled Benghazi the same way</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368457388706</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:03:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>EXCEPT - by congressional laws passed a decade ago - IF an embassy or consulate is considered to be in a high risk area, specific- enhanced security requirements are MANDATED.

They fought a long front for YEARS longer than we did and lost a lot more men and exacted a HUGE toll on the Germans. You also forget the valiant effort of the Brits, before we got directly involved they took a stand in the battle of Britain that was every bit as important as what came later. The Canadians and other allies also played a role. Hell, even the French underground (and I am by no means a fan of the WW2 french) was vital to the effort.

At every opportunity since they took over the House in 2011, Republicans have made it clear that they have no interest in reaching a compromise with the White House. For two years, they held sham negotiations with Democrats that only dragged down the economy with cuts; this year, they are refusing even to sit down at the table. Mr. Obama hasn’t given up inviting the Republicans to join him in making the hard choices of governing, but he has been rebuffed each time. This year, in hopes of getting some support for modest tax increases on the rich, he even proposed a reduction in the cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients. The events of the last few weeks should make it clear to him why that offer should be pulled from the table immediately. Consider: Shortly after Mr. Obama presented this idea to Republicans, more than a half-dozen of them began trashing it as too “draconian” and a “shocking attack on seniors.” For years, the party has demanded entitlement cuts, but the moment the president actually offered one, he was attacked. Then last Tuesday, Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, said that no grand bargain is possible because Democrats aren’t willing to make significant cuts to spending and entitlement programs. The Social Security cost-of-living change, he said, did not go far enough. Senate and House Republicans are refusing to meet with Democrats to negotiate over the budgets passed by each chamber. Four times in the last two weeks, Senate leaders have proposed beginning a conference committee to hash out a federal budget; four times they have been blocked by Republicans.

Knowing that their positions would be deeply unpopular among the public if their stubbornness were exposed in an open committee, Republicans would simply prefer not to talk at all. Instead of negotiation, Republicans cling to their strategy of extorting budget demands by threatening not to raise the debt ceiling. On Thursday, the House passed a stunningly dangerous bill that would allow foreign and domestic bondholders to be paid if Republicans forced a government default, while cutting off all other government payments except Social Security benefits. The bill has no possibility of becoming law, but its passage was a deliberate thumb in the eye to Mr. Obama, business leaders and those who say the debt ceiling should not be used for political leverage. Republican lawmakers have become reflexive in rejecting every extended hand from the administration, even if the ideas were ones that they themselves once welcomed. Under the circumstances, Mr. Obama would be best advised to stop making peace offerings.

What the hell is going on within the Obama administration? Another huge scandal rears its head, and I'd bet the press won't take this one lying down: The Justice Department secretly obtained two months of telephone records of reporters and editors for The Associated Press in what the news cooperative's top executive called a "massive and unprecedented intrusion" into how news organizations gather the news. The records obtained by the Justice Department listed incoming and outgoing calls, and the duration of each call, for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and the main number for AP reporters in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. In all, the government seized those records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. The exact number of journalists who used the phone lines during that period is unknown but more than 100 journalists work in the offices whose phone records were targeted on a wide array of stories about government and other matters. The Associated Press is understandably livid: In a letter of protest sent to Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation. He demanded the return of the phone records and destruction of all copies. "There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters. These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations, and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know," Pruitt said.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1368481433698</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 17:43:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368481715030-205</Id><Title>Listen up, grads.

If you're keeping score at home, here's what we've discovered since last Friday: (1) The Obama administration changed its Benghazi talking points 12 times, scrubbing politically unhelpful elements, and radically changing the best analysis of the intelligence community. The White House had previously denied presiding over anything but minor, cosmetic changes to the talking points. (2) The IRS targeted conservative groups for extra harassment from 2010 to 2012, and top officials knew about it since at least 2011. No disciplinary action has been taken so far. (3) The Obama Department of Health and Human Services is requesting "voluntary" donations from the healthcare companies over which it wields enormous power in order to help fund Obamacare's implementation, perhaps in violation of the law. (4) The Obama Justice Department secretly monitored dozens of Associated Press journalists' work and personal phone records for purposes that remain unclear. This lasted for at least two months. I'd toss in some "what if Bush had done it?" snark, but that hardly seems necessary. This is quite simply astonishing. And to think, Ron Fournier's piece about President Obama's credibility crisis was written before this latest bomb dropped. Last week, Obama told Ohio State graduates to "reject" those "cynical" voices who warn of government abuse and tyranny. Then the IRS and AP stories broke. Listen up, grads.

Sen. John McCain either misspoke or flat-out lied about that on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “Remember when she said, ‘well who cares how this happened,’ in a rather emotional way?” McCain asked guest host Martha Raddatz. “A lot of people care.” It’s too bad Raddatz didn’t tell the senator that no, she didn’t remember that – because Clinton never said it. Remarkably, I’ve seen no one follow up on McCain’s misstatement today either. (I’m sure someone will correct me if I’m wrong.) Instead, reporters are breathlessly parsing each new GOP charge on Benghazi (while also decrying the very real abuse of the IRS overscrutinizing the tax-exempt status of conservative groups.) The National Journal’s Ron Fournier tweeted “Welcome to the 90s,” with no apparent irony or self-awareness about the role of the media in ginning up that decade of phony scandals that paralyzed our last popular second-term Democratic president, Bill Clinton. In fact, Fournier contends Benghazi will hurt Clinton and President Obama, even though he acknowledges the GOP’s claims are overblown. “If nothing else, Benghazi is a blow to the credibility of the president and his potential successor, then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. This could be big … Credibility is Clinton’s vulnerability, dating to the unjustified financial accusations that triggered the Whitewater investigation. Doubts persisted about her veracity and authenticity throughout the 2008 presidential campaign.” Read that again: “Credibility is Clinton’s vulnerability, dating to the unjustified financial accusations that triggered the Whitewater investigation.” The accusations were unjustified, Fournier admits, but they hurt Clinton anyway. Why? Because reporters continued to act like they were justified, even in the face of contrary evidence. And so it goes with Benghazi. Welcome to the ’90s! Let’s remember what Clinton actually said in her Jan. 23 congressional testimony. She faced down Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who repeatedly insisted the administration immediately knew the attack on the Benghazi consulate was terrorism. After correcting Johnson several times, Clinton erupted: With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again. That’s very different from saying, “Who cares?” Still, the former secretary of state probably wishes she could take those eight words back. The motivation of the forces that attacked the Benghazi consulate is making a difference, politically at least, and it may also make a difference in terms of our understanding how bad the Libya situation was, and is. But we can’t get to that latter, serious question, because of all the ridiculous GOP posturing on Benghazi – posturing abetted by breathless Beltway reporting. Also on Sunday, McCain charged the administration with a “coverup,” to which Sen. Dianne Feinstein shot back: “I think that’s nonsense.” Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates accused the administration’s critics of having a “cartoonish” approach to how the military might have rescued the Benghazi victims. There are two sets of issues here: what actually happened, and what the administration said about what happened. Unbelievably, most attention continues to swirl around the infamous “talking points” prepared for Congress members as well as U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to talk about the attack on the Sunday shows Sept. 17. ABC News’ “scoop” showing that the talking points had been substantively edited 12 times reinvigorated the Benghazi story, because it provided evidence that State Department spokewoman Victoria Nuland succeeded in getting many details redacted from the document – using language that, to be honest, seems deliberately designed to inflame charges of a coverup. References to previous violence in Benghazi, for instance, “could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either?” Nuland wrote. “Concerned …” Still unhappy with a later draft, Nuland complained: “These changes don’t resolve all of my issues or those of my buildings leadership,” Nuland wrote. Her building’s leadership, of course, was Secretary of State Clinton. Conspiracy-minded liberals may be tempted to blame the whole mess on Nuland, since she worked for #$%$ Cheney and is married to neocon Iraq War booster Robert Kagan. Alex Seitz-Wald has a good piece about her here. In fact, the career Foreign Service officer has worked for both parties, and her talking points push-back was not about protecting her boss, but her agency. All Nuland’s email proves is that there was dysfunctional interagency warring going on between State and the CIA. Meanwhile, former CIA chief David Petraeus is being lionized by Fox News for ABC’s report that he wanted to scrap the talking points entirely. But as Media Matters reminds us, that was only because Petraeus thought they didn’t do enough to tie the attacks to Egyptian rioting over an anti-Islam video, which has been debunked as the primary cause of the Benghazi attack. Bill O’Reilly beclowned himself by praising Petraeus for protesting the talking points, while ignoring the fact that Petraeus was peddling the very excuse for the attacks – rioting over the anti-Islam video – that got Susan Rice excoriated. So far Jonathan Karl hasn’t explained the reasoning behind Petraeus’ objections, either, so the CIA director stands as the hero in the talking points debacle. Which is ridiculous, because if we ever learn the full truth about what happened in Benghazi, we will probably find most culpability belongs with the CIA. Nobody wants to talk about the size or scope of its operation there. Nobody wants to talk about the CIA’s role in working with local militias that were supposed to provide security for the consulate, and failed. The review by Ambassador Thomas Pickering and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen made 29 recommendations, most of which focused on inadequate protection of the consulate, many directed at State. There is certainly blame to be taken by the State Department, and Clinton has taken it repeatedly. Likewise, charges by State Department “whistle-blowers” that more could have been done to rescue those who died in Benghazi have been debunked by Mullen and Pickering’s review. “Mullen made it very clear that his view as a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that there were nothing within range that could have made a difference,” Pickering told the AP. Robert Gates agreed. The State Department employees who came forward may sincerely believe that more could and should have been done to save their colleagues, but no one has uncovered such evidence. Significantly, where President Obama reacted with appropriate outrage to the IRS scandal in Monday’s press conference, once again he dismissed the Benghazi story as politics. “The whole issue of talking points frankly throughout this process has been a sideshow. There’s no there there,” Obama said. And a poll by PPP found that roughly half of all voters – 49 percent – say they trust Clinton’s version of Benghazi events more than they trust congressional Republicans (39 percent trust the GOP). Just like in the ’90s, the American people may see through the GOP’s effort to undermine Clinton and Obama. But just like in the ’90s, they’re not getting enough help sorting fact from fiction from Beltway reporters who can’t resist a good scandal, even if it’s fake.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368487248868</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 19:20:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368487712117-226</Id><Title>This is the TSA</Title><Msg>drop the pressure cooker NOW ! DETROIT (AP) — A Saudi man was arrested at Detroit Metropolitan Airport after federal agents said he lied about why he was traveling with a pressure cooker, but his nephew said Monday that it was all a misunderstanding about a device he simply wanted for cooking. Two pressure cookers were used in last month's Boston Marathon bombings. Hussain Al Khawahir was being held in Detroit on allegations of lying to Customs and Border Protection agents and of using a passport with a missing page. He was arrested Saturday. His nephew, Nasser Almarzooq, told The Associated Press that he had asked his uncle to bring him the pressure cooker so he could make lamb. The college student said two pressure cookers he bought in the U.S. were "not good at all," and said the ones available in Saudi Arabia are higher quality. "I'm Arabic," said Almarzooq, who is studying mechanical engineering at the University of Toledo in Ohio, about 55 miles south of Detroit. "I always use pressure cookers to cook." Almarzooq said his uncle was coming to visit him for a couple weeks. A criminal complaint alleges that Al Khawahir arrived at the airport Saturday on a flight from Saudi Arabia via Amsterdam, and that he told agents he was visiting his nephew He originally said he brought the pressure cooker with him because pressure cookers aren't sold in America, then later said his nephew had bought one but it "was cheap" and broke after one use, according to the complaint. Agents said they also noticed a page was missing from Al Khawahir's passport from Saudi Arabia. He told them he didn't how it had been removed, and said the document had been locked in a box that only he, his wife and three children have access to in his home, according to the complaint. Al Khawahir was read his Miranda rights, which he said he understood, and he invoked his right to remain silent, according to the complaint.....</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1368487712117</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 19:28:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368487862512-227</Id><Title>Barry thinks it's all a conspiracy.</Title><Msg>He's the one bereft of facts and lying.

Instead, they were fired for organizing. The NLRB ruled Omar and his co-workers were illegally fired and must be given back pay and their jobs back, but that decision has been delayed because of corporate legal attacks against the Board. And now, corporate-funded politicians in the Senate are threatening to make it easier for CEOs to deny workers their rights by refusing to confirm President Barack Obama’s nominations to the Board. If the current nominations aren’t confirmed, CEOs will be able to violate workers’ rights and intimidate workers into keeping silent about dangerous working conditions, poverty wages or simply making the company better. And workers like Omar won’t have a say on the job or a way to fight back. STOP the NeoCon Thugs from setting labor back 100 years in safety, benefits and wages. STOP the United States of Corporatocracy from killing the United States of Americans NEVER shall it be "for the Corporations", "by the Corporations" and "of the Corporations." “If we don’t have a fully staffed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the company can do whatever they want to do.

Chinese-owned companies are investing in American businesses and new vehicle technology, selling everything from seat belts to shock absorbers in retail stores, and hiring experienced engineers and designers in an effort to soak up the talent and expertise of domestic automakers and their suppliers. While starting with batteries and auto parts, the spread of Chinese business is expected to result eventually in the sale of Chinese cars in the United States. Chinese auto companies are assiduously avoiding the spotlight. Last year, the biggest carmaker in China, Shanghai Automotive Industries, opened new offices in suburban Detroit without any publicity, which is almost unheard-of in an industry that thrives on media coverage. But China’s growth in the American auto industry is drawing notice in Washington. Last year, the Obama administration filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization that China’s government was unfairly subsidizing the production of some parts shipped to America. And the country’s inroads into American-made batteries and electric vehicles have drawn scrutiny because that sector of the industry has been heavily subsidized by the United States government. " the Obama administration filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization that China’s government was unfairly subsidizing the production ", China's reply #$%$ !!!! Say bye bye tio the big 3 and hello to the disposable throw away autos. If you don't know Mandarin you'll never know whats going on in the world , and thats the way it was on May 13, 2013.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1368497943691</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 22:19:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368498597246-240</Id><Topic><Title>B.O.
