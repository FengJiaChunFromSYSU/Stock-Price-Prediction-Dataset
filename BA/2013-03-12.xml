In America, many people saved their money, put it aside, and didn’t buy four or five houses with no job and no money down. They did what most people would consider the right thing, and what historically has been the right thing. But now, unfortunately, those people are being wiped out, because they are getting 0% return, or virtually no return, on their savings and their investments. We’re wiping them out at the expense of people who went deeply into debt, people who did what most people would consider the wrong thing at the expense of people who did the right thing. This, long-term, has terrible consequences for any nation, any society, any economy. If you go back in history, you'll see what happened to the Germans when they wiped out their savings class in the 1920s. It didn’t lead to good things down the road for Germany. It didn’t lead to good things for Italy, which did the same thing. There were plenty of countries where it wiped out the people who saved and invested for their future. It’s usually a serious, political reaction, desperation in some cases, and looking for a savior and easy answers is usually what happens when you destroy the people who save and invest for the future.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363086321359</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 07:05:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363088480528-14</Id><Topic><Title>Liberal Paul Krugman filing bankruptcy, liberals already shut down the website with the information.

Jim Moran held a public "conversation about gun violence." Moran respesents Virginia's 8th congressional district. Celia Bigelow, the former campus action director for American Majority Action, asked Moran why he felt it was appropriate to legislate women into being victims. Bigelow specifically referred to the story of Amanda Collins who said she was "legislated into being a victim" by university bureaucrats. Collins was raped on campus in a gun free zone at gun point. At the time of the attack, Collins was in possession of her concealed carry permit, but not her concealed weapon due to complying with university policy. "Why do you want to legislate women into being victims?" "Why can't you answer the question?" "He won't answer." Not surprisingly Moran, who has a history of violent language and dodging constituents, couldn't answer Bigelow's question. The only response was, "next question." Moran's son, Patrick Moran, recently plead guilty to beating his girlfriend in the street. Moran and his girlfriend were fighting outside 14th Street bar The Getaway around 1:23 a.m. on Dec. 1, according to a police report, over Moran talking to another woman at the bar. Suddenly, Moran allegedly slammed his girlfriend's head into the bar's metal trash can cage. After the attack, police described Moran's girlfriend as "bleeding heavily from her nose and also observed that her nose and right eye were extremely swollen." One of the ambulance technicians who transported her to Howard University Hospital told police that Moran appeared to have broken her nose and given her a skull fracture under her right eye. Moran was arrested for felony domestic violence assault, but pleaded the charge down to simple assault today. He was sentenced to probation.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1363098742610</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:32:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363098884769-36</Id><Topic><Title>Liberal Paul Krugman filing bankruptcy, liberals already shut down the website with the information.

The National Institutes of Health is getting getting federal grant money to study why lesbians are more overweight than gay men because it's really important. From CNSNews: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded $1.5 million to study biological and social factors for why “three-quarters” of lesbians are obese and why gay males are not, calling it an issue of “high public-health significance.” Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Mass., has received two grants administered by NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to study the relationship between sexual orientation and obesity. “Obesity is one of the most critical public health issues affecting the U.S. today,” the description of the grant reads. “Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the determinants, distribution, and consequences of obesity are receiving increasing attention.” “[H]owever, one area that is only beginning to be recognized is the striking interplay of gender and sexual orientation in obesity disparities,” it states. “It is now well-established that women of minority sexual orientation are disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, with it continues. “In stark contrast, among men, heterosexual males have nearly double the risk of obesity compared to gay males.” That's right people, we can't go on a White House tour but the federal government has plenty of money to toss around for stuff like this, apparently. The study started in 2011, when a portion of the funds were allocated, and could last as long as five years.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1363099033900</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:37:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363099168371-39</Id><Topic><Title>Past HOD, call Jim Cramer a loser.</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1363098255915</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:24:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1363099168371</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:39:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363099490941-40</Id><Title>when aapl is sick, market looks bad.</Title><Msg>but BA is just fine..</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1363099490941</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:44:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363099841449-41</Id><Topic><Title>when aapl is sick, market looks bad.</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1363099490941</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:44:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>iPlane is better than iPhones..</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1363099841449</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:50:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363100603235-42</Id><Topic><Title>Analyst Downgrades The Boeing Company.

He was the "Ghost Riders" first casualty.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1363108954688</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 13:22:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>22</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363109223618-74</Id><Topic><Title>The World's Savers Are Being Wiped Out, And History Says That Leads To Very Bad Things</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363086321359</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 07:05:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>censored err spaz err bernanke err maobowa err inflation OOPS deflation OOPS spazmo err censoredkookMO</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1363109223618</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 13:27:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363109291998-75</Id><Topic><Title>Progressives, Liberals and their History of Reacism</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1363097419034</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:10:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumbos err spaz err special ed for censored err spazmo err censoredkook err censoredfascist err bumper</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1363109291998</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 13:28:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363109579504-76</Id><Topic><Title>Progressives, Liberals and their History of Reacism</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1363097419034</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:10:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Genna is the typical liberal bigot.....hates anyone who doesn't see themselves as a victim.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1363109579504</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 13:32:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363109628478-77</Id><Topic><Title>It looks like BA is set to break 90 bucks..</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1363096256468</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 09:50:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>86-88 maybe...

(AP) — The prolonged grounding of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has forced some airlines to seek alternative arrangements, including renting other planes to fill gaps for the upcoming busy summer travel season. It's a sign that some Boeing customers don't expect a quick fix to the 787's problems. Jeff Knittel of airplane leasing company CIT said on Tuesday that unnamed airlines are talking to CIT about alternatives to the Dreamliner. He said leasing rates for planes like the Boeing 767 and the Airbus A330 "have remained strong and strengthened slightly." Interest has come from a handful of airlines that already have the plane or were supposed to get it before the summer travel season. "This is not some feeding frenzy out there," Knittel said at an aviation finance conference. Airline fleet managers are just being practical, he said. Boeing's newest jet has been grounded for almost two months because of two battery incidents, including a fire. Boeing has proposed a fix but it requires federal approval and further testing. Fifty planes have been delivered to eight airlines. Deliveries are currently halted, but Boeing is still building the planes and has said it still expects to deliver at least 60 this year. For now, airlines are making other plans. Last week, Norwegian Air Shuttle, which was due to receive its first 787s in April and June, said it will lease two Airbus A340s along with flight crews if it doesn't get its 787s on time. The replacements will be costly for airlines,( and to Boeing shareholders) because planes like the 767 generally have more seats and are not as fuel efficient as the 787. Many airlines planned to use the 787 specifically on routes where the larger 767 was unlikely to be profitable, such as United's planned Denver-to-Tokyo flight, which has been postponed. United Continental Holdings Inc. has six 787s. Boeing has 200 engineers working on a battery fix and has proposed a solution to U.S. and Japanese aviation regulators who are currently reviewing it. Boeing, regulators, and the airlines that fly the 787 haven't said when they expect the plane to return to the skies. But Knittel's comments show that airlines don't think it will be soon. "This isn't about whether this will be resolved but when it will be resolved," Knittel said.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363119519033</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 16:18:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363120120226-107</Id><Title>Michigan Senate votes 37-0 to overturn a Conspiracy Theory !!!

Fastest Joystick in the world? Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will reconsider new Distinguished Warfare Medal, for which drone operators are eligible. Critics complain it ranks higher than the Bronze Star or Purple Heart – awards for acts of valor in physical combat. Since its debut last month, the new Distinguished Warfare Medal – promptly dubbed the “Nintendo” medal by troops – has been a magnet for controversy. Now, new Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is apparently reconsidering whether such a medal – which could be awarded to cyber specialists, say, or remote operators of Predator or Reaper drones that kill enemy forces threatening the lives of troops on the ground – should retain its high ranking in the medal pecking order. The medal is meant to acknowledge contributions of troops “regardless of the member’s physical location or domain,” according to Pentagon background papers. Many pilots of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, operate their aircraft in Afghanistan from bases in Nevada. The award, these officials stress, is not to be awarded for acts of valor in combat. Few have a problem with recognizing the contributions of UAV pilots .The problem is that the DWM was placed in order of precedence ahead of the Bronze Star, and even above the Bronze Star with a “V” device for valorous conduct in combat. That prompted an outcry among veterans groups and, in a rare show of bipartisan unity, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1363122212679</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 17:03:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363122428221-111</Id><Title>FAA statement on accepting Boeing 787 battery proposal plan</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today approved the Boeing Commercial Airplane Company's certification plan for the redesigned 787 battery system, after thoroughly reviewing Boeing’s proposed modifications and the company’s plan to demonstrate that the system will meet FAA requirements.

The plan establishes specific pass-fail criteria, defines the parameters that should be measured, prescribes the test methodology and specifies the test set-up and design. F.A.A. engineers will be present for the testing and will be involved in all aspects of the process. Under the plan, Boeing proposed adding insulation among the eight cells in the battery to minimize the risk of a short-circuit cascading through most or all of them. It also would space the cells further apart and add systems to monitor the temperature and activity in each cell. It would enclose the batteries in high-temperature steel boxes, instead of the earlier aluminum ones to contain any fire. And it would create tubes to vent hazardous gases The F.A.A. has also approved limited test flights for two aircraft. These aircraft will have the prototype versions of a new containment system designed to seal off any smoke or fire. The purpose of the flight tests will be to check the battery instrumentation and the container.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1363124063121</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 17:34:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363124368240-114</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan Budget Plan Gets Endorsement from Ayn Rand</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1363118361629</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 15:59:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The majority of your libtrad base didn't even know who Paul Ryan was when they voted.

Additional testing may be scheduled as needed. The certification plan calls for a series of tests that show how the improved battery system will perform in normal and abnormal conditions.

The United States is the most hated country in the world, followed closely by Israel, and then by nobody. Why? Why not Ecuador? China? Russia? East Timor? The hostility puzzles many Americans, who genuinely believe their country to be a force for good, a pillar of democracy, a defender of human rights. To the rest of the world, none of this is even close. If you have lived abroad, as so very few Americans have, the explanation for the hatred is obvious: Meddling. Relentless, prideful, uncomprehending meddling, frequently military, often with horrendous death tolls. Americans, adroitly managed by a controlled press, historically illiterate, incurious, decreasingly educated, either have never heard of the American behavior that angers others, or believe it to have been inspired by virtuous motives. Nobody else thinks so. Add to unfamiliarity with the wider world the constantly inculcated assertion that America is the greatest, most wonderful nation ever to exist, a light to the world, a shining city on a hill, and you get a dangerously delusional state. Especially now. In the past, American economic and military supremacy were such that the US didn’t have to care what others thought. The times, they are a-changing. It might be wise to compare briefly the view through American and foreign eyes. Consider Iraq. To most of the world, the war on Iraq was brutal, unprovoked, and murderous. More than a few, looking at the ruins of Fallujah, thought of Guernica – of which few in the States have ever heard. Many Americans do not believe that we destroyed Iraq for oil, empire, and the Israel lobby, as was in fact the case. No. We wanted to topple an evil dictator and dispense the precious gift of democracy. It was a question of goodness. Many apparently still believe that Iraq had something to do with the attacks on New York. Again, controlled press, poor schooling, little curiosity. Similarly, Americans tend to see the war on Afghanistan as having to do with ending Terror or sprouting democracy – not as the Great Game (“Hanh?”) redux, or the quest for the TAPI pipeline (“Say whuh?”) or Caspian hydrocarbons. (“Caspian? You mean the Friendly Ghost?”) To most of the world, Afghanistan is just another sorry spectacle of American fighter-bombers killing peasants, of gutted children and drone attacks on half-identified targets. This, the merciless use of overwhelming firepower against lightly armed campesinos, is what the world sees, over and over. Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan. It isn’t pretty. I live in Mexico. In countless towns, probably in every city of any size, you see streets named Niños Heroes, Heroic Children. In Guadalajara there is a traffic circle with an imposing monument to them. These things commemorate the children who tried to fight the American soldiers invading Mexico City. In that (purely acquisitive) war Mexico lost half its territory. Yet how many gringos know that it ever happened, or when, or for that matter have ever heard of the bombardment of Veracruz or Pershing’s incursion? Americans who have some grasp of history sometimes say of the Mexican-American War that Mexicans should “get over it.” Some might tell the Jews to get over the Holocaust, or Americans to get over 9/11. It is much easier to tell people to get over what you have done to them than to get over things they have done to you. Then there is the War on Drugs. Americans believe this to be a campaign against Evil – best conducted, of course, in other people’s countries. There are other views. Thoughtful Mexicans (all I know, but I haven’t taken a poll) do not see why drugs are Mexico’s problem. If gringos don’t want drugs, why do they buy them? Why don’t they solve their own problems? It is no secret internationally that American students in high school and universities use drugs. Why don’t the Americans put their college kids in jail? And, they say, probably correctly, that Washington, by sponsoring the elimination of big drug lords, caused the current fighting among littler lords to control the trade, thus creating carnage. Predictably, the flow of drugs northward was not affected. Truculent patriots at Billy Bob’s Rib Pit know none of this. The combination of clueless ignorance and a sort of Walmart-parking-lot arrogance make mysterious to them much behavior of other countries. Consider their view of Iran, an evil Arab country, somewhere, that wants the Bomb so it can blow up Israel and New York. No explanation occurs to them for Iran’s hostility to the US, which wants regime change so Iranians can be democratic and have freedoms. Ask Billy Bobbers whether they have even heard of, much less been in, major Iranian cities like Tehran, Sulawesi, Sidon, or Tbilisi. No. Yet they are sure the inhabitants are dangerous and un-American. Iranians may perhaps see things differently. They know that in 1953 the democratically elected prime minister Mohammed Mossadeg (“Mossy what?” they ask in the Rib Pit.) was overthrown by the CIA leaving the Shah (“Is that, like, a person?”), a routinely ghastly dictator, in control. This had much to do with the occupation of the US embassy in 1979, which was sold in the US as evidence of the badness of Iranians. Later, in 1988, the US Navy, in the form of the USS Vincennes, shot down an Iranian airliner and killed everyone aboard. Americans shrugged it off: Such things were doubtless necessary to stop terrorism. But imagine the outrage if the Iranian navy shot down a US airliner. Nobody beyond the borders buys our song about spreading freedom and human rights. America has supported countless sordid dictators ruling by army and torture chamber (the Saudis being a current example). We have put many dictators on their thrones, such as Pinochet (“That little wooden guy, his nose got long when he told a lie, right?”) in Chile. (“Isn’t that Tex-Mex soup with beans in it?”) Others notice that the only country that openly and proudly tortures prisoners is…us. Always, the underlying problem is meddling. Bin Laden’s guys didn’t attack New York because it was a slow morning and they couldn’t think of anything else to do. They were furious at US meddling in Moslem lands. You may think, and I may think, that Islam is a primitive faith not well adapted to the modern world. Fine. I may think that hornets do not have an ideal social organization. But I know better than to poke their nest. This is why they hate us – meddling, bombing, invading, droning, telling them how to run their countries. No, George, it is not because of our freedoms.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363126900353</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 18:21:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363127332086-123</Id><Title>Michigan Senate votes to overturn "Conspiracy Theory" 37-0</Title><Msg>Michigan Senate Votes 37-0 to Defeat NDAA Yes I know...Folks on here have told me Obamas NDAA that he signed on New Years Eve when (to attract the least attention) and is the most OutRageous UnAmerican Executive Order even Joe Stalin would be embarressed about.... does not exist or ...thats RIGHT boys and Girls...how many of you pukes told ne this does not exist...it is a "conspracy theory"..will the State of Michigan just voted to nullify a "Conspiracy Theory" .... this one goes out to all you Kool Aide drinkin Anti American #$%$ who want to turn over 250 years of unprecdented Liberty...

On a serious note even longs have to admit the odds favor us shorts now.....all the technical indicaters, long and short term are pressed, some relief of pressure does need to occur. that's why i feel totally confident if we get some more upward movement, using the remaining balance of my cash to short another 50 shares most likely will payoff, so even in the most bizare circumstance and this powers to the mid 90's I will margin and double down and be 800 shares in total short instead of 400. For real most assuradely at that point this thing will be getting heavy additionaly the battery solving problem and the big order ajoint announcement after a big run up puts ba in a perfect sell-the-news position. They could announce some other huge order or something else good and positive but I seriously doubt it, its time for the stock to take a breather. this stock never moves up more than 1-2% a day and easily has a history of 4-5% loss days and people rush for the exits. the indexes and their new highs and positive days are in the MSM now daily so all kidding aside long or short you have to admit. 1.BA technicals pinned across all time frames 2. Good news is out and over none known on the horizon, and run up has already occured 3. Up days are weak in % terms compared to down days historicly 4. The MSM is toting the market once again and BA actually gets mentioned every time the DOW JONES does...and in the past this has been a recipe for disaster.
