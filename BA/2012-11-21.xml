Is that what we should be doing? So, in other words, Obama is doing a "back door" push for increased "self deportation". While Obama makes a pronouncement of an amnesty to the "children of undocumented people" (so-called Dream Act provisions), and gets votes as a result, he plans to drive all of the other undocumented folks out of jobs and out of hope, using "more audits". And, Obama gets more money from the fines, a form of "random taxation", as money is main goal. How about, instead, fixing the issue of the legal status of folks, let them work and be at peace, stop harassing businesses, and forget the stupid I-9 audit forms that creates non-value-added employment in the government?

Nothing like a receiving a 10 million dollar bonus and and 8 million dollar pay package + all the perks to set the example of hard times ahead and then ask everyone else to take a pay and benefits cut. McCerny and the BOD have drunk the walls street cool-aid. Ya, I know they are so much smarter than everyone else in the world and you have to pay millions and millions of dollars to these geniuses to run companies and sit on the board of directors. I read about their successes all the time in paper. The most recent being the geniuses at HP and the 30 billion dollar overrun on the 787. These are the tip of the iceberg. Anyone read about the growing pay disparity between those that run companies and those that make companies run? Working together is an empty slogan from the top down. It is not really meant and has no meaning to those at the top. They actually think that reviewing stop light charts gives them insight into how the company is doing. They never question the monumental mistakes they made in the past and they never hold themselves accountable. They want everyone else to "take one for the team" while they continue living high on the hog. SPEEA members need to stand up and be counted like in 2000. The young engineers need to realize that their future pay and benefits will be base lined by this offer if it becomes a reality.</Msg><Username>zevach</Username><Timestamp>1353504509165</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 08:28:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353510603653-11</Id><Title>R U DUMB OR JUST PLAIN STUPID!

Chrysler cost the taxpayers $1.3 billion and is no longer an American owned corporation. Currently the gov't/ U.S. taxpayer is on the hook to the tune of $22 billion to GM and the only way to break even is for GM stock to double in price. Please note that GM also got a $18 billion dollar tax forgiveness. As for saving banks, 440 banks failed since Obuma took office. 300 of them going out a year after Obama took office (since 2010) and billions of dollars in TARP money was thrown at them. Fannie Mae needed over $8 billion in taxpayer money last year and now the FHA will be needing around a billion dollars to cover their losses. While bin Laden didn't go down while Bush was in office the majority of the top leaders in al Qaeda did. Still, al Qaeda is alive and raising havoc all over the mid-east with the situation now getting worse under Obuma.

Now if boeing wants to hire and retain employees in Puget Sound the average family income here in 2007, the latest figure i just found was then $63895 with a yahoo search, it must be higher in 2012. So Boeing has to pay at least 65K now if Boeing wants the smartest and best employee's for their company. Seattle is not bad if you like the area for not being hot or humid like the east coast or the Texas heat and other problems. Washington has one of the highest average educations in the nation so a lot of reasons to live here. You for example could go to the sand fields in the USA or in other countries and make a lot of money working in oil companies but the quality of life is less. If Boeing wants to be compeititive they Boeing should have not taken 3 billion from the State of Washington taxpayers in return for the 100% 787 final production and then failed and moved to Carolina not due to wages if you read up on it but because they wanted to kill the union an illegal act. There must be some reason Boeing is still in Puget Sound, so fishface I bet you really know why, if not here it is . Boeing relies on the IAM ans SPEEA to bail the very poor company Executives out everytime they Stonecipher a 787 plan.

The shareholders and potential stock holders are voting with going to better companies. Of course companies like Apple that uses a large fraction of semi-slave labor does better too bad an airplane is not as easy to engineer and assemble as an apple. Negotiations continued between the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) and Boeing amid fallout from its white-collar workers’ overwhelming rejection of the company’s first contract offer. Now Boeing has made another offer that is a total failure, less worse is not an offer, it is a slap in the face of every present, past and future Boeing employee. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) Global profits: $4.1 billion Corporate income tax: -$605 million CEO: W. James McNerney CEO pay: $18.4 million. Stock price year to date down .20% Development costs for the 787 30 billion over budget, 4 years behind schedule 747 2 billion over budget and two years late The CEO of Boeing should walk the talk about controlling employee costs and take a pay cut to match his failure to bring the 787 and the 747 in on time and on budget he is responsible for his employee’s union, non union and contract. He is responsible to make a stock price gain but to get a pay raise all he did was to fail in both areas! Boeing’s opening proposal called for various cuts in benefits and the elimination of several contractual guarantees, making what SPEEA calls almost every key element subject to unilateral change by the company. So Boeing is playing the comparison game first offer a terrible take away contract, now Boeing negotiation plan is to sweeten the deal with a little less take away, does Boeing not get it , your negotiating with some of the smartest workers in the world. SPEEA workers understand that the CEO will only work with a labor contract, same with the SPEEA and IAM workers. Boeing Chicago, until you learn to build the planes, you will have to deal with the SPEEA workers in Puget Sound. BTW how is that outsourcing working for you now?

The No return fire shows great planning though). The Binlaudin assault was a coordinated attack involving air and backup assets and was obviously Commanded and planned well from the top. Rawmoney wanted the banks to allow mortgage debt to crash and create more housing troubles and then to allow "investors" to buy these assets very cheaply in the same vane as he wanted GM to crash so that Vulture capitalists could continue destroying American industries for personal profits at everyone's expenses. He also was against the response to storm Sandy. I dont understand youall's Value systems and youall certainly adjust the facts to fit your agenda's.

OK- so what is the big deal. ? 1) At 45 hours/week of credited service against 2000 hours year, no increase in pension $$ from November to December. 2) The yearly increase in Covered Compensation on Jan 1 results in a no increase in Pension $$ for an additional 2 to 5 months, depending on FAE and credited service. 3) This formula has not changed since around 1990. The above can easily be checked out by employees on then Boeing system I would suggest that for those planning to retire in the next few years do the following starting this month or starting the estimate in August or Sept of the year following turning age 60. Set your retirement date for each month from Sept to perhaps June. Note the change in retirement $$ Little change in Nov and december compared to August and Sept. NO change from Jan to feb, march, april depending on your numbers. The long term result is that many wind up getting hosed out of 3 to 5 YEARS of pension benefits. Cure ? Insist that the MINIMUM monthly rate of increase be based on the $$ change per month in the STANDARD OR BASIC formula.

Mitt Romney in the popular vote 51 percent to 48 percent. In the all-important Electoral College, the difference was larger, with Obama winning 303 electoral votes and Romney 206. Let's not think so much about the election's outcome but instead ask: What's so good about democracy and majority rule? How many decisions in our day-to-day lives would we like to be made through majority rule or the democratic process? How about the decision to watch a football game or "Law and Order"? What about whether to purchase a Chevrolet Volt or a Toyota Prius? Would you like the decision of whether to have turkey or ham for Thanksgiving dinner to be made through the democratic process? Were such decisions made in the political arena, most of us would deem it tyranny. Democracy and majority rule give an aura of legitimacy and decency to acts that would otherwise be deemed tyranny. Most people would agree that having our decisions on what television shows to watch, what kind of car we'll purchase and what we'll eat for Thanksgiving dinner made through the democratic process is tyranny. Why isn't it also tyranny for the political process to determine decisions such as how much should be put aside out of our paycheck for retirement; whether we purchase health insurance or not; what type of light bulbs we use; or whether we purchase 32- or 16-ounce soda containers? The founders of our nation held a deep abhorrence for democracy and majority rule. The word democracy appears in neither of our founding documents: our Declaration of Independence and Constitution. In Federalist Paper No. 10, James Madison wrote, "Measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority." John Adams predicted, "Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide." Edmund Randolph said, "... that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy." Chief Justice John Marshall observed, "Between a balanced republic and a democracy, the difference is like that between order and chaos." In a word or two, the founders knew that a democracy would lead to the same kind of tyranny the colonies suffered under King George III. Our founders intended for us to have a republican form of limited government where political decision-making is kept to the minimum. Alert to the dangers of majoritarian tyranny, our Constitution's framers inserted several anti-majority rules. One such rule is that election of the president is not decided by a majority vote but instead by the Electoral College. Nine states have more than 50 percent of the U.S. population. If a simple majority were the rule, conceivably these nine states could determine the presidency. Fortunately, they can't because they have only 225 Electoral College votes when 270 of the 538 total are needed. Were it not for the Electoral College, presidential candidates could safely ignore less populous states. Two houses of Congress pose another obstacle to majority rule. Fifty-one senators can block the designs of 435 representatives and 49 senators. The Constitution gives the president a veto that weakens the power of 535 members of both houses of Congress. It takes two-thirds of both houses of Congress to override a presidential veto. To change the Constitution requires not a majority but a two-thirds vote of both Houses to propose an amendment, and to be enacted requires ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures. Today's Americans think Congress has the constitutional authority to do anything upon which they can get a majority vote. We think whether a measure is a good idea or a bad idea should determine its passage as opposed to whether that measure lies within the enumerated powers granted Congress by the Constitution. Unfortunately, for the future of our nation, Congress has successfully exploited American constitutional ignorance or contempt.

While the executives reward themselves with excessive bonus ans pay increases they want to limit the workforce and take away some benefits. I bet the executives who have a worker contract like the CEO would like all workers to be at risk as a no contract employee. Seems odd the 787 program went to Carolina not because of wages, read up on it the guy in charge told the Washington governor it was all about worker rights, the wages were not the issue. Boeing wants complete control of their workers so they can terminate without cause. You know like Walmart or twinkee with a billion is assests the twingsteers are going to sell the company to cheap foreign companies. The answer is to make the contries like China stop working their people like slaves , rather than pay them 50 dollar per month and put up suicide prevention nets on the worker dormatories, perhaps actually pay them a living wage. The worker family median income in Seattle is over 65000 so if your not making at least $32.50 per hour then your as poor or worse than half of the workforce. Next look at the job your not making twinkies here your making a very complicated machine and if it quits running it will not coast over to the cloud and wait for Allen Mulally Ford truck to pull it home .

Your shocking lack of both makes you come across as a neanderthal. 2) Our contracts, like the IAM's, contain a no-strike clause. We cannot legally strike until they expire, which is at midnight on 11/25. Even so, striking in November or December is a ridiculous notion. Why would we want to strike when 99.75% of the company is closed over the holidays? 3) Of the 23,000 or so people represented by SPEEA, about 16,000 of us are degreed engineers. That means a minimum of a bachelors degree in engineering from an ABET accredited engineering program. They may not have a degree in engineering, but many techs are also very highly educated. 4) The average salary for a machinist at Boeing is about $58K a year, for an engineer at Boeing it's $110K a year. Don't like it? Nobody's stopping you. Go to college like we did and get an engineering degree, if you can a) get accepted, b) hack the academics and c) make the minimum grade-point-average requirements. Fair warning though, engineering is not an easy field to major in and has a very high washout rate. Good luck. You're going to need it.</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1353545020693</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 19:43:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>18</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353545648129-66</Id><Topic><Title>BOEING SPEEA AND PENSION GAMES</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1353529856687</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:30:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump it up !</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1353545648129</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 19:54:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353545831539-67</Id><Topic><Title>An Open Letter to President Obama</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_999</Username><Timestamp>1353540328043</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 18:25:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Barack Obama?

How much $$$$ did BHO raise over two election cycles? Asking BHO to take the $$$$$ out of politics is like asking Bernie Madoff to put an end to Ponzi schemes. # 10 is good too because most of those who voted for BHO can't even do for themselves let alone do for others.

By the middle of last year, it had dropped to under 2 percent. Job prospects for engineers "are really good, especially for young ones," says Lawrence Jacobson, executive director of the National Society of Professional Engineers in Alexandria, Va. He and other industry watchers see demand across the board, especially in electrical, biomedical, aerospace, computer, automotive, environmental, mechanical, and petroleum engineering. Having been on several hiring teams during the last month I can attest that the binders and binders don't turn out to have that many prospects because 1) the vast majority are not qualified for the engineering jobs and 2) the ones that are have already been hired. Boeing had to change their hiring process to give managers on the spot authority to hire because they were losing too many good prospects because it took so long for the bureaucracy to process the acceptances. Also, Boeing has stopped trying to hire at top tier universities because the offers were not competitive. The new list of "emphasis" schools is mostly second and sometimes third tier. Not to say there are not good people there but they are deliberately trying to get bargains instead of going after the best. That's going to catch up with Boeing eventually. It is highly unlikely that Ed Wells would be hired with the current system.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1353553666705</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 22:07:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353558721019-73</Id><Topic><Title>November deliveries</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1353534964229</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 16:56:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is it 42 or 44?</Msg><Username>ronanderson727</Username><Timestamp>1353558721019</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 23:32:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
