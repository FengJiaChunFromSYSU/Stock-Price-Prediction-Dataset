The latest Government figures show that the total number of firearm offences in England and Wales has increased from 5,209 in 1998/99 to 9,865 last year - a rise of 89 per cent. In some parts of the country, the number of offences has increased more than five-fold. In eighteen police areas, gun crime at least doubled. The statistic will fuel fears that the police are struggling to contain gang-related violence, in which the carrying of a firearm has become increasingly common place. Last week, police in London revealed they had begun carrying out armed patrols on some streets. The move means officers armed with sub-machine guns are engaged in routine policing for the first time. Shadow Home Secretary, Chris Grayling, said last night: 'In areas dominated by gang culture, we're now seeing guns used to settle scores between rivals as well as turf wars between rival drug dealers. The number of people injured or killed by guns, excluding air weapons, has increased from 864 in 1998/99 to a provisional figure of 1,760 in 2008/09, an increase of 104 per cent . The figures follow a warning by Mr Grayling that U.S.-style gang culture has reached some parts of the UK. In August, he made a controversial speech warning that a collapse of 'civilised life' had allowed a brutal drug and gun crime culture - like that of the U.S. TV show The Wire - to flourish in Britain. The hit TV series tracks the nightmare of gangs and organised crime in inner city West Baltimore and the futile efforts of police to deal with them. ________________________________________________________ It seems from the data that the UK's knee-jerk reaction of taking guns away from law abiding citizens after a mass murder event in 1996, has been totally ineffective and has only led to a situation where they can't protect their citizens and their citizens aren't allowed to protect themselves. We a situation in the UK where large GROUPS of armed gangs are running wild. What can the law abiding citizen do with his "regulated" 7 bullets if 10 armed gang members invade his home? Progressive ideology ignores facts, statistics and outcomes measurement, meaning they ignore reality. They have based their view on gun regulation on knee-jerk emotional reactions rather than calm data based analysis. I am left to conclude that progressives aren't interested in solving gun violence and that they are only interested in imposing their emotional/irrational based will on everyone else by taking guns away from law abiding citizens. They can't make any rational argument for how limiting magazine capacity will reduce gun violence and why any particular capacity (7 bullets? 6bullets? 5bullets?) is the magic number. Why not just 1 bullet? Well that will be next and then no bullets, won't it? It WILL BE NEXT because progressives aren't interested in any real solutions to gun violence or gun crime. They sat silent for 15 years while 300 to 500 gun homicides were taking place in Chicago every year right under Obama's nose, and he had no faux tears then. But now he cries and says law abiding citizens are to blame because they have too many bullets in their magazines. Again irrationalism reigns in the progressive mind.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358949867770</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:04:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358950063303-18</Id><Topic><Title>Gun crime goes up by 89% in a decade in England after gun ban</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358949867770</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:04:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Australia tells a completely different story.</Msg><Username>analgonquin11</Username><Timestamp>1358950063303</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:07:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358950176560-19</Id><Title>The USA is Now Officially a Ship Without a Rudder</Title><Msg>Marxist Ideologues continue to occupy the country with insane spending and reducing our freedom.

Have you looked at any stats in Australia as to risk of being a victim there? I would think it is less because it is geographically large and only has a population of 23 million of which 92% are White and &amp; 7% Asian. You might also want to look at the gun violence rate based on ethnicity for Whites and Asians and see how it compares to Whites Asians Blacks and Latinos in the USA. I think you will understand then why you can't make a direct comparison between the USA and Australia.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358951756862</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:35:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358951835780-25</Id><Topic><Title>Another College Shooting...

Here again the statistics are evidence against the irrational idea that restricting guns, magazine capacity and ammunition for law abiding citizens will lower gun violence. The more you know the more it becomes clear in the data that none of the proposals being touted to reduce gun violence has any rational basis and is nothing but knee-jerk emotionally based nonsense that can only lead to the same mistakes that Britain made. _____________________________________________ Gun laws in California regulate the sale, possession, and use of firearms and ammunition in the state of California in the United States.[1][2] The gun laws of California[3][4] are some of the strictest in the United States. A Handgun Safety Certificate, obtained by passing a written test, is required for handgun purchases, although there are exemptions to this requirement.[5] Handguns sold by dealers must be "California legal" by being listed on the state's roster of handguns certified for sale. Private sales of firearms must be done through a licensed dealer. All firearm sales are recorded by the state, and have a ten-day waiting period. Unlike most other states, California has no provision in its state constitution that explicitly guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms.[1] The California Supreme Court has maintained that most of California's restrictive gun laws are constitutional based on the fact that the state's constitution does not explicitly guarantee private citizens the right to purchase, possess, or carry firearms. However recent US Supreme Court decisions of Heller (2008) and McDonald (2010) established that the 2nd Amendment applied to all states within the Union, and many of California's gun laws are now being challenged in the federal courts. Semi-automatic firearms that the state has classified as assault weapons, .50 BMG caliber rifles, and magazines that can hold more than ten rounds of ammunition may not be sold in California. Possession of automatic firearms, and of short-barreled shotguns and rifles, is generally prohibited. California is a "may-issue" state for permits to carry concealed guns. The willingness of issuing authorities in California ranges from No-Issue in most urban areas to Shall-Issue in rural counties. However, concealed carry permits are valid statewide, regardless of where they were issued. California does not recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states, and non-residents are generally forbidden from obtaining a California concealed carry permit.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358955942914</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 10:45:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358956455999-50</Id><Topic><Title>The Repubs are Waving White Flags of Surrender</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1358954515729</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 10:21:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like what you are saying IMSHOCKEDSCHOCKED!

Experts in lithium-ion batteries — the type under investigation on the Dreamliner — have suggested that the batteries may have been charged too quickly, pointing to charging issues rather than problems with the batteries themselves. But data retrieved from the All Nippon jet suggested that the battery had not been charged beyond its maximum design voltage, 32 volts, Norihiro Goto, chairman of the Japanese Transport Safety Board, told reporters Wednesday. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration announced similar findings Sunday from its investigation into the lithium-ion battery that caught fire in Boston. Mr. Goto said that readings aboard the All Nippon flight showed the battery’s voltage stayed relatively stable at 31 volts, just under the maximum voltage, until pilots detected a strange smell in the cockpit about 15 minutes after takeoff. The data showed a sudden, unexplained drop in the battery’s voltage after that, Mr. Goto said. “There is no direct evidence of overcharging,” Mr. Goto said, though he stressed it was too early to reach a firm conclusion, given the complexity of the electrical systems aboard the 787. “There is a possibility that something went wrong within the battery itself.”</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1358957946284</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 11:19:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358957965851-57</Id><Topic><Title>A new gun threat gets 5 yr old child suspended</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1358908624998</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 21:37:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hi Don I urge you to do a search on the toy and look at it for yourself as I did.

One of the Japanese investigators looking into the ANA Dreamliner incident said last week that the burn marks on the charred battery suggested overcharging, as among the more likely causes initially leading to the impression that the U.S. and Japanese probes were headed in different directions. Data from the aircraft's digital flight data recorder wasn't available at the time. The twists and turns of the U.S. and Japan probes—run separately but with the cooperation of the other—underscore the difficulty of troubleshooting the advanced electrical system that powers Boeing's flagship jet, celebrated at its launch for its revolutionary features. Among them is the Dreamliner's heavy reliance on electrical systems to perform many functions that were previously handled mechanically. The plane, for instance, moves parts of wings electrically instead of with hydraulic devices. Two engineers from Thales SA HO.FR -1.68%of France joined the investigative team in Japan on Tuesday, transport ministry officials said Wednesday. Thales designs and makes electrical systems for the aerospace and transport industries—including the battery-operation system for the Boeing 787. Engineers with GS Yuasa Corp., 6674.TO 0.00%the maker of the 787's lithium-ion batteries, are also involved of the investigation. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other global aviation regulators last week grounded all Dreamliners until regulators are convinced the battery systems are safe. The data found on the digital flight data recorder of the ANA Dreamliner showed that the output voltage of the battery didn't exceed the maximum 32 volts, said Mr. Goto of the JTSB on Wednesday. It had stayed at 31 volts before suddenly dropping and then moving up and down, indicating that overcharging may not have been the cause of the incident. But JTSB officials cautioned that there is still insufficient data to rule out any potential causes of the incident entirely, since it is still unclear whether the voltage fluctuations were a cause or symptom of the problems. One unknown is whether there was excess voltage coming into the battery, said Mr. Goto. The data showed only the voltage of the battery output, not inflow of electricity into the battery, he said. The JTSB will also have to investigate the battery charger to figure out whether there may have been overcharging from the charger, Masahiro Kudo, a director general of the JTSB told reporters after the news conference. The flight data also suggested that the battery wasn't used during the flight. Instead, power was supplied by four generators connected to the engines.

A few years ago, Dell had a few laptops smoking in the laps of users. But eventually, the problem was solved. Most modern laptops use Li ion due to energy density and weight. The early data says the battery was not overcharged. This lets the charging system off the hook. But how come the battery smoked? These batteries have internal cooling . Something caused these batteries to self disintegrate. This is similar to D cells that leak their contents. The Li ion battery works for laptops and other mobile devices.

The Business Roundtable (BRT), a group of influential CEOs, on Wednesday unveiled its plan to partially privatize the health insurance program for older Americans and gradually reduce the benefits they currently receive by cutting entitlements. The plan calls for smaller annual Social Security increases, as well as reduced benefits for wealthy retirees. “America can preserve the health and retirement safety net and rein in long-term spending growth by modernizing Medicare and Social Security in a way that addresses America’s new fiscal and demographic realities,” Gary Loveman, chairman, president and chief executive of Caesars Entertainment, told CBS News. Loveman is head of the Business Roundtable, which came up with the plan. The millionaire businessman hopes to convince Congress to enact the new measures in an attempt to cut US spending. The BRT believes the eligibility age for both Medicare and Social Security should increase to 70. Some legislators have already proposed raising it to 67, but congressional Democrats have fought hard to prevent such an increase. Retirees can currently get reduced Social Security benefits starting at age 62, full Social Security benefits at age 66, and Medicare at age 65. While the proposed changes would impact the younger generations, anyone who is currently over 55 would not be affected by those measures and could continue to receive their government benefits, regardless of the outcome of the decision. The BRT believes that raising the age would help reduce the deficit. Its members also believe that the changes would cause traditional Medicare programs to compete with private insurance plans – something that Rep. Paul Ryan, chair of the House Budget Committee, has long advocated for. But while raising the eligibility age would save the federal government money, it would also cause Americans’ expenses to increase dramatically, which would particularly devastate low-income individuals dependent on government assistance. CNNMoney reports that medical expenses would increase by $11.4 billion, even though federal spending would only drop by $5.7 billion. “Raising the age doesn’t address the larger concern of reducing health care spending overall,” said Juliette Cubanski, associate director of Kaiser’s Program on Medicare Policy. “It just shifts costs from the federal government to other payers in the system.”</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358963612767</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 12:53:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358963706172-86</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary - An Example of Failed Leadership</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1358960986975</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 12:09:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rand Paul is a good man that went directly to the point with Bilary.

Fire risk on planes has always been a major concern, especially given the amount of fuel they carry and the heat generated by jet engines. U.S. aviation standards require planes to have numerous on-board fire suppression systems. But through a review of government documents with aviation and battery experts, found that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration granted the Dreamliner special conditions and said its contain-and-vent system was sufficient to control the build-up of explosive or toxic gases, except in situations considered "extremely remote." The FAA's 2007 decision is now coming under scrutiny after the lithium-ion batteries in two 787 planes failed within days of each other, sparking a fire in one case in Boston, and generating warnings and an acrid smell that prompted the pilots of the second plane to make an emergency landing .. A key U.S. Senate committee plans to hold a hearing in the coming weeks to examine aviation safety oversight and the FAA's certification of the 787, an aide to the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee told Reuters on Tuesday. FYI this user posted that eventually the Senate would look into the FAA and the fast tracking relationship between Boeing and the FAA and as I have shown more than once “Boeing had to prove to the FAA that these batteries would never ignite as part of the 787 certification and if they did ignite they would not explode. Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 25 [Docket No. NM375 Special Conditions No. 25-359-SC]. I guess fire is ok then!” Do not invest in BA stock get out now. This user posted that Boeing was being sold by major institutions on 1-9-2013 and was in the kill zone, and the company buyback of 2 billion dollars would support the stock for a while but as the failure of the outsourced 787 which will take a long time to fix and the fix will be just one of many more to come. Also the scapegoated SPEEA workers and the collective bargaining strike comes up next so the holders of Boeing Stock are taking excessive risk for , no return as the stock for a year is down 1.79% while the Dow Jones average is up 7.8% today. EADS is up over 27% for one year, Lockheed Martin is up 15.50% for one year. Boeing is not a stock to hold long or short a failure stock and a failure leadership with the outsource business plan, the same one that Bankrupted McDonnell Douglas- outsourcing does not work. See report by Hart-Smith Boeing. “source” Hart-Smith, , argues that even if outsourcing makes sense in some circumstances, Boeing's reliance on it is excessive. "Outsourcing all of the value-added work is tantamount to outsourcing all of the profits," his paper concludes. "It is time for Boeing to reverse this policy."</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358968438389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:13:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358968479345-110</Id><Topic><Title>Why is the NRA So much Much More Popular than Obama?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1358967587845</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 13:59:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as full of poo as you are you have no hope fool, there are like 250 million Americans who are not NRA supporters.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1358968479345</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:14:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358968538500-111</Id><Title>SHAME ON BOEING FOR PAYING ALL THE PEOPLE ON THIS BOARD FOR TALKS OF TOPIC</Title><Msg>All that just to divert attention from the disasterliner</Msg><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1358968538500</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:15:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358968613139-112</Id><Title>SHAME ON BOEING FOR PAYING ALL THE PEOPLE ON THIS BOARD FOR TALKS OFF TOPIC</Title><Msg>Shame on boeing for paying all the people on this board for talks off topic</Msg><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1358968613139</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:16:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358968775592-113</Id><Topic><Title>Mass shooters are white men !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358967891985</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:04:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>makes sense... according to gun advocates ' guns don't kill people ' ... so ban the right !!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358968775592</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:19:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358968873172-114</Id><Title>FIRST IN HISTORY: BOEING WILL CERTIFY THE 787 TO BE SOLD AND FLOWN ONLY IN AFRICA</Title><Msg>First in history: boeing will certify the 787 to be sold and flown only in africa</Msg><Username>communicator_777</Username><Timestamp>1358968873172</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:21:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358969231961-115</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary - An Example of Failed Leadership</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1358960986975</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 12:09:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Come on Hillary stop protecting Obama.

And they are the backdrop to a manufactured budget crisis that will likely result in already scant resources being sacrificed to America’s corporate class.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358971243099</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:00:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358971497794-129</Id><Topic><Title>Mass shooters are white men !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358967891985</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:04:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How come Japanese, Chinese or Bolivian kids who play the same video games do not carry out mass Killing of civilians in their countries seems to be a made in America thing.

Easy to figure out, one wek ago the Boeing Yahoo financial site said the average BA daily volume was 5 million shares traded per day( the average llooks back) today the average is 5 million 900 thousand shares traded per day. The stock price is stepping down lower highs and lower lows. Next go to the historical price for Boeing notice while the average volume is up from 5 million traded shares to about 5.9 million each day the stock is being traded out by the big investment houses ( I posted that on 1-9-2013 and said to get out of the kill zone then0 notice the recent actual volume which will make up the new average is still much higher 21 million shares and 18 million shares those share volumens are investment houses selling their postion ans Boeing shareholder buyback filling the gap until the 2 billion is spent. the FAA has already said the 787 problem has not been found and it will take a long time, the scapegoated speea workers will stike unless their and the future and retired pensions are not taken away, the cost of the airline loss of reenue is 50 million per day to boeing shareholders the strike will cost the Boeing shareholders 400 million per day, there is no reason to buy and hold or to short just get out of Boeing . The Dow Jones average for one year is up 8.5% Ba for a year is down 1.4% figure it out no gain and with a loss your behind the average by 8.8% and then the minus of Ba so your down 10% that you could have made on a etf for the dow jones</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358972942808</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:29:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358973051879-135</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing taking off!</Title><Username>georgecox125</Username><Timestamp>1358971003260</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:56:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't bother asking.

Including any message board user, who demonstrates that Boeing stock price is not good over time, in fact is a dog, and is also not a recommending that any investor buy or short Boeing stock is attacked, usually on a personal basis. The Boeing mismanagement police that monitor this message board, ignore the facts or demand proof, but never do any research on their own, so their rants are never backed up with any actual verifiable professional documented publication. This Boeing management enabler group or rapid response team has tactics , these Boeing mismanagement enablers deploy spam posts and make direct personal attack assaults on users , who dare to tell the truth about Boeing Executives behavior and the results of Boeing business plans. The rapid response Boeing police also deploy misleading stories and put out misinformation, lately it is the scapegoat the SPEEA represented in an attempt to fool the stock buying public. These Boeing management enablers are used as attack weapons; their user comments directed toward other users and not about Boeing are intended to sink the truth about Boeing Mismanagement as soon as they are published. Yahoo message board Attack reviews are hard to police. To the average Yahoo message board user, it is difficult, to detect the difference between an authentic critical review and a yahoo message board user who is malevolently trying to bring down a fact about Boeings failed outsourcing and the zero return on shareholder Boeing stock price investment for a year. Any fact about the compensation of Boeing Executives compared to the rank and file workers, shows that the excessively paid and failed Boeing Executives who has been given their jobs is not and has not been cut back for failure. , As history shows, the best way to encourage contempt and arrogance and failure, is to promote a friend into a power job. How many people have noticed that when they give something to a friend over time that friend ends up not having any gratitude and the free gift? Same deal for promotions at Boeing it ends up only making the person who was selected, by being connected with friends of Boeing for his job, to being a worthless employee Executive. The example from history or Boeing is clear, Phil Condit, Harry Stonecipher and James McNerney all got their jobs by knowing someone and while as very young men they learned how to kiss up to get ahead. So once all of them made it to the top, since they had not earned the right to lead over their entire work history, or had not done anything good for their companies for decades because they were retired on the job, they became very greedy, arrogant and incompetent. So when they were appointed the Boeing CEO potion, all these leaders ended up wasting the hard earned money of the investors and losing market share to Airbus a socialistic make work company. Washington State gave 3 billion dollars in tax breaks to Boeing to do all the 787 assembly work and in return Boeing moved to Carolina. The government gave Boeing billions in government contracts only to have to go to court and Boeings fines total a huge amount POGO , Federal Contract $: $19366.6m Total Number of Instances: 46 Total Misconduct dollar amount: $1054.5mThis is what happens when you give people or companies free breaks, Boeing pays less tax in a year than the CEO makes in a year. Boeing Co. CEO James McNerney Jr. received $18.4 million in pay last year, which was more than Boeing paid in federal taxes, according to a new report by the Institute for Policy Studies. Investors notice when Steve Jobs was the CEO of Apple he tool an annual pay of one dollar and only made money if the company made good products on time that worked, he made all his money on stock price appreciation. Now he is dead the new CEO has the same massive pay and benefit package that McNerney does and notice how poor the shareholders of Apple are doing now compared to when Steve Jobs ran the company for a dollar and the increase in stock price. Boeing investors learn the lesson of history, stay away from Boeing stock, until the management has to earn their money.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358974397085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:53:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358974635456-145</Id><Topic><Title>SHAME ON BOEING FOR PAYING ALL THE PEOPLE ON THIS BOARD FOR TALKS OFF TOPIC</Title><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1358968613139</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:16:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>chris_genna2 BURN IN HELL YOURSELF MISERABLE IDIOT, you want us to praise Boeing for putting people at risk and thinking only about money and not safety</Msg><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1358974635456</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:57:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358974668924-146</Id><Topic><Title>BA Billions for Stock buyback</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1358965127346</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 13:18:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good user comment Don , way to go !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358974668924</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:57:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358974836069-147</Id><Topic><Title>DAN RATHER MADE A FILM WITH THE ENGINER FIRED BY BOEING FOR SAYING 787 NOT SAFE</Title><Username>communicator_777</Username><Timestamp>1358973729697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:42:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very good post I went there to find a lot of information discrediting fully the 787 GO ON GOOGLE AND TYPE: dan rather reports - boeing 787 composite concerns</Msg><Username>pierre_from_geneva</Username><Timestamp>1358974836069</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 16:00:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358975038522-148</Id><Topic><Title>The Boeing Debacle: Seven Lessons Every CEO Must Learn</Title><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1358461826122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 17:30:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for the 4 thumbs up, even laidlow had to give credit on this one, and he is promoting the 787 like it came in on schedule and on cost forgetting it is not aBoeing engineered plane and making excuses for managment. just look at the boeing Board of Directors financial experts, Bankers, public policy professors , these are unqualified to be on a manufacturing board and that is the key issue Boeing under James Mcnerney is attempting to run a manufacturing company like a bank with outsourced plans that drove MD into bankruptcy The BOD and the CEO are living in denial !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358975038522</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 16:03:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358975134667-149</Id><Topic><Title>Mass shooters are white men !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358967891985</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:04:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No direct link at all - either way. Only implication and guilt by association. The point is that not every gun owner is going to commit mass shootings, just as every person who plays (to excess) violent video games is going to be influenced to do such. It only takes a fraction of the people to have too many nut cases out there. By the way, the Oregon and Connecticut attacks were committed by persons stealing or using the weapons without permission. Not that that matters to someone who is deranged. A resourceful person who is intent on killing a lot of people will do so. It is more important to eliminate the things which influence folks to do acts of evil than to try to control the implements involved in the acts. Problem: New York restricts magazines to 7 bullets. Solution: carry more magazines. Is the violence in movies and video games contributing to the "real" acts of violence? We celebrate the notion of "ideas" as being powerful and the importance of capturing the "imagination" of the individual. But when we discuss how nut cases are influenced by powerful visual images presented in videos and movies, my original post was poking at the politics of bias, the influence of money, to not consider, honestly, what are the issues involved in this problem.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1358975134667</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 16:05:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358975360607-150</Id><Topic><Title>IN THE NAME OF PROFIT BOEING PERSISTS TO PUT PEOPLE ON RISKY PLASTIC AIRPLANES</Title><Username>copyright_member</Username><Timestamp>1358974299031</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:51:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>right on</Msg><Username>speaker_737</Username><Timestamp>1358975360607</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 16:09:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358975532100-151</Id><Topic><Title>SHAME ON BOEING FOR PAYING ALL THE PEOPLE ON THIS BOARD FOR TALKS OFF TOPIC</Title><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1358968613139</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:16:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As if you're thinking of anything but money.

Rand Paul said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been negligent in conducting her job, and said that if he were president, he would have relieved her of her post. Paul said that the fact that she was not aware of the requests of more security for the U.S. Embassy in Libya constituted “a failure of leadership” and said it was “inexcusable.” “I think ultimately…you accept the culpability for the worst tragedy since 9/11,” Paul said. “Had I been president at the time and I had found that you had not read the cables from Benghazi, you had not read the cables from Ambassador Stevens,” he went on, “I would have relieved you of your post.” Paul accused Clinton of being directly responsible for the loss of lives in the September 11, 2012 attacks. “Not to know of the requests for security really, I think, cost these people their lives,” he said. “I don’t suspect you of bad motives,” he said, but added that “it’s a failure of leadership not to be involved.

Steve Watson Jan 23, 2013 A pro-gun control meeting held by New Trier Democrats in Glenview, Chicago, turned into a raucous exchange Sunday when most of the audience members took offense to comparisons of gun enthusiasts to Nazis. The event was labeled as a forum on “Guns and Public Safety” and a “space for real conversation,” however, it quickly became clear that the organisers were vehemently in favour of strict gun control measures, and very much against the protection of Second Amendment rights. Audience members felt they were being subjected to one sided presentations and slideshows, and attempted to question the speakers at the event, only to be repeatedly told they could not speak and should reserve their questions and comments for the Q&amp;A at the end. Speakers included Mark Walsh, campaign director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence; Lee Goodman, of the Stop Concealed Carry Coalition; and Northfield residents Jennifer Bishop-Jenkins of the Million Moms March and her husband, author and gun control advocate Bill Jenkins. It was emphatically obvious that the event represented an all out assault on Second Amendment advocates, and over two thirds of the 160 strong crowd began to shout down the speakers in protest. At one point, as reported by the Wilmette Sun Times, speaker Bill Jenkins referred to manufacturers of guns and ammunition as “A desperate group of people that are really in financial trouble.” Things got really heated, however, when Jenkins displayed a photograph of a Nazi rally on a screen with the caption, “this is what a gun show looks like”. Following that he displayed a picture of a chihuahua with the words “this is what I think the NRA really is”. The verbal exchanges between organisers, speakers and audience members went back and forth, and became even more heated when Lee Goodman of the Stop Concealed Carry Coalition responded to a question about the intentions of the Founders when they included the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights. Goodman stated that “it didn’t matter,” and said “all that matters is whether or not it’s relevant today.” That comment was enough for one member of the audience, also a combat veteran, who stood up and passionately defended the Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment: “I’ve sat here [inaudible] and I’d like to agree with the professor. Everyone standing in this room right now, especially the veterans in the room right now, know, that we are all Americans. The problem with this country right now is it’s us and it’s #$%$ them. We need to stop this #$%$.” “I went to war for your ability to have the First Amendment, to say what you stood up there and said today, to write what you want to write in your newspaper, and have whatever opinion you want to have.” the man stated. “You can practice whatever religious freedoms you want. I would like you to answer the question, since you just said that one of the rights that I went to war over to defend, that is inalienable, to every American citizen. If this discussion was going on, about your First Amendment rights, would you still have the same opinion that we don’t need that any more either?” he asked Goodman. Goodman argued that his comments had been misunderstood and stated “When they consider any part of the Constitution, any law, they’re going to say, ‘what does it mean today?’” To which the veteran shot back “The threat of tyranny, today, is no less than at the turn of the century in 1900, in 1800, or in 1700!” The crowd then erupted into applause</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358978079059</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 16:54:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358978214065-173</Id><Topic><Title>DAN RATHER MADE A FILM WITH THE ENGINER FIRED BY BOEING FOR SAYING 787 NOT SAFE</Title><Username>communicator_777</Username><Timestamp>1358973729697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:42:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is actual news valid from 2007 but Boeing was then and now in denial and now as you say old news are again fresh news and catching Boeing up GO ON GOOGLE AND TYPE: dan rather reports - boeing 787 composite concerns</Msg><Username>communicator_777</Username><Timestamp>1358978214065</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 16:56:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358978660363-174</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing stock value compared to Boeing Executive excessive incentive pay</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358631485511</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:38:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Analysts of Boeing. Jefferies analyst Howard A. Rubel estimated that re-working the jet to fix electrical problems could cost anywhere from $250 million to $625 million. Fitch Ratings, said the grounding will hurt Boeing’s profits and cash flow. “Barclays analyst Carter Copeland predicted he grounding will have impact on Boeing’s finances or production. Boeing will have to pay airlines cash because of the problems, it may also have to offer services to mollify airlines, such as discounted or free pilot training or discounted spare parts, said Carter Leake, an analyst at BB&amp;T who downgraded Boeing quickly after the plane began having trouble. Those services are worth something to the airline but don’t show up as a cash expense for Boeing, so Boeing will try to use this tactic to hide the true expense to Boeing shareholders. The latest problems come just as Boeing is in contract talks with its unionized engineers.. The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace indicated it would reject Boeing’s offer because the union believes it would put retirement benefits at risk. “Boeing’s actions reiterate the company’s growing disrespect for the engineers and technical workers who are essential to working issues and restoring confidence in the 787,” the union said. Because the 787 problems have arisen this late in the process, they could lead authorities to conclude that even tougher testing is needed. “If the authorities get more stringent and take more time to certify planes, this will affect Boeing bottom line,” said Sandy Morris, an aerospace analyst with Jefferies in London.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358978660363</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 17:04:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358979009619-175</Id><Topic><Title>Man shot 34 times in head with nail gun</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1358967174850</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 13:52:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Should they limit the magazine to 10 nails and make it a bolt or lever action?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1358979009619</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 17:10:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358979370989-176</Id><Title>Boeing stock price and the trend</Title><Msg>Although investors at first discounted the incidents and Boeing shares held up, they've drifted down this month despite a market uptrend, and it's trading about 5% below its recent high 78.02 on Jan. 4. The company has been rocked by the glitches aboard several Dreamliners, including planes flown by Japan's All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Japanese carriers own about half of the 50 Dreamliners that were in operation. Japanese investigators this week said that overheating in the batteries wasn't the cause of the fires and the focus has shifted to the battery's recharging unit. On Wednesday, Boeing said it remains confident the planes are basically safe. Mike Sinnett, chief project engineer for the Boeing 787 program, said at an aviation conference in Dublin that it's not clear how long it will take to discover the cause of the problems. "I can't really say anything about the time frame of the investigation. The NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) is really the only authorized authority in the U.S. to talk about this investigation," Sinnett said. Meanwhile, there is still an issue about Dreamliner fuel leaks. Industrial giant Eaton (ETN) is cooperating with investigators. Eaton shares fell 0.8% intraday. Bottom line: Boeing's 787 Dreamliner remains sidelined, with no timetable for returning to flight. Boeing will no doubt now make some noise about a huge plane order, make sure it is a confirmed order and not a future order. This is standard Boeing tactic for fooling investors into staying in or not going with better stocks , for example how bad is Boeing stock ? the Dow Jones average for a year is the lowest gaining average of the big three and it is up 8.43% for one year while BA is down for one year at minus 1.62%, the NASDAQ is up 13.27% for a year and the S and P 500 is up 13.59% for one year.

These 297 people, in their winter camp, were murdered by federal agents and members of the 7th Cavalry who had come to confiscate their firearms “for their own safety and protection”. The slaughter began after the majority of the Sioux had peacefully turned in their firearms. The Calvary began shooting, and managed to wipe out the entire camp. 200 of the 297 victims were women and children. About 40 members of the 7th Cavalry were killed, but over half of them were victims of fratricide from the Hotchkiss guns of their overzealous comrades-in-arms. Twenty members of the 7th Cavalry's death squad, were deemed “National Heroes” and were awarded the Medal of Honor for their acts of [cowardice] heroism. We hear very little of Wounded Knee today. It is usually not mentioned in our history classes or books. What little that does exist about Wounded Knee is normally a sanitized “Official Government Explanation”. And there are several historically inaccurate depictions of the events leading up to the massacre, which appear in movie scripts and are not the least bit representative of the actual events that took place that day. Wounded Knee was among the first federally backed gun confiscation attempts in United States history. It ended in the senseless murder of 297 people. Before you jump on the emotionally charged bandwagon for gun-control, take a moment to reflect on the real purpose of the Second Amendment, the right of the people to take up arms in defense of themselves, their families, and property in the face of invading armies or an oppressive government. The argument that the Second Amendment only applies to hunting and target shooting is asinine. When the United States Constitution was drafted, “hunting” was an everyday chore carried out by men and women to put meat on the table each night, and “target shooting” was an unheard of concept. Musket balls were a precious commodity and were certainly not wasted on “target shooting”. The Second Amendment was written by people who fled oppressive and tyrannical regimes in Europe, and it refers to the right of American citizens to be armed for defensive purposes, should such tyranny arise in the United States. As time goes forward, the average citizen in the United States continually loses little chunks of personal freedom or “liberty”. Far too many times, unjust gun control bills were passed and signed into law under the guise of “for your safety” or “for protection”. The Patriot Act signed into law by G.W. Bush, was expanded and continues under Barack Obama. It is just one of many examples of American citizens being stripped of their rights and privacy for “safety”. Now, the Right to Keep and Bear Arms is on the table, and will, most likely be attacked to facilitate the path for the removal of our firearms, all in the name of “our safety”. Before any American citizen blindly accepts whatever new firearms legislation that is about to be doled out, they should stop and think about something for just one minute- Evil does exist in our world. It always has and always will. Throughout history evil people have committed evil acts. In the Bible one of the first stories is that of Cain killing Abel. We can not legislate “evil” into extinction. Good people will abide by the law, and the criminal element will always find a way around it. Evil exists all around us, but looking back at the historical record of the past 200 years, across the globe, where is “evil” and “malevolence” most often found? In the hands of those with the power, the governments. That greatest human tragedies on record and the largest loss of innocent human life can be attributed to governments. Who do the governments always target? “Scapegoats” and “enemies” within their own borders…but only after they have been disarmed to the point where they are no longer a threat. Ask any Native American, and they will tell you it was inferior technology and lack of arms that contributed to their demise. Ask any Armenian why it was so easy for the Turks to exterminate millions of them, and they will answer “We were disarmed before it happened”. Ask any Jew what Hitler’s first step prior to the mass murders of the Holocaust was - confiscation of firearms from the people. Wounded Knee is the prime example of why the Second Amendment exists, and why we should vehemently resist any attempts to infringe on our Rights to Bear Arms. Without the Second Amendment we will be totally stripped of any ability to defend ourselves and our families.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358989369862</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 20:02:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358989432644-204</Id><Topic><Title>"SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED"</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358988344860</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 19:45:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More applicable: Definition of KOOK: noun Sparty; Spartacus 1089256839562; Spartaloon; Spartadoofus; Spartalunatic, etc ad nauseam.</Msg><Username>letsmakecharts</Username><Timestamp>1358989432644</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 20:03:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358989480348-205</Id><Topic><Title>when will Boeing turn a profit on the 787?

Well, bucko, those photos are real. If you want to talk about the lies begin with the biggest hoaxster of all. Elie Wiesel. No tattoo. No name on any camp entry log. When he took Oprah on a walk though the camp in 2010 and pretended it was a place he lived for 18 months, she asked him if the large trees on the main walkway were there in 1945. He only further outed himself as a liar. He said YES. Elie..... you arrogant liar, there were no large trees there because the CAMP was new in 1942.</Msg><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1358999532244</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 22:52:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358999604559-247</Id><Topic><Title>Racism and the DISARMED Indians slaughtered at WOUNDED KNEE !!!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358989369862</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 20:02:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump</Msg><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1358999604559</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 22:53:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358999743098-248</Id><Topic><Title>Racism and the DISARMED Indians slaughtered at WOUNDED KNEE !!!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358989369862</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 20:02:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There was a second amendment when the Indians at Wounded Knee were masacred wasnt there #$%$ When the MayFlower came ...there was no NEED of a second amendment.
