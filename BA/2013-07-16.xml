Add to that the significant persistance of of hot epoxy in an enclosed area **may** also be a contributing factor. RE persistance read about the persistant fire issues on the B2 crash on takeoff on Guam a few years ago after the visible flames were long out.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1373948029654</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 00:13:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373949053999-2</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Started the KKK</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1373945462166</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 23:31:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are you a Democrat then PDB?</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1373949053999</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 00:30:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373949232122-3</Id><Title>Food for Thought</Title><Msg>From another board: I liken what's happening with the 787 to the teething problems of the 1st-gen jets, in that a whole new level of complexity has been added, and also the nature of the most likely failure modes has changed. Now that the physical basics of building a flying jetliner have been pretty well mastered over the last 60 years, we are at a new break point: The predominant failure mode will likely be changing from mechanical to electronic. And so I really don't expect the 787 EIS to be smooth, due to the paradigm shift, and I don't think I'm selling Boeing's people short when I think this. Engineers of the 1950s were no more human or failure-prone than engineers of the 2010s, and in many ways had a deeper, more solid education and a sturdy diligence to them. The struggles of those men 60 years ago to figure out the Comet and Electra were not the struggles of stupid, primitive men. We would do well to remember that the modern generation of engineers now has the task of successfully implementing the EIS of the winged computer, and figuring out the failure modes with pure sweat and sleepless nights. Of course it's anyone's guess, but were I forced to choose a root cause for all this, without having any facts before me but seeing the unprecedented complexity of the 787, and the weird manner that fires are breaking out in different places on the plane, I would not be shocked to learn that the repeated - unexplained - fires have been originating in the software. If so, the modern computer guys now have their challenge set before them.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1373949232122</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 00:33:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373949326622-4</Id><Title>We so love this great American company, we are aiming BA to shoot to 200.</Title><Msg>Not that it is more expensive than AMZN..</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1373949326622</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 00:35:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373949477157-5</Id><Title>The bad news is the fire fire fire.</Title><Msg>the good news that WayneDickenson981 pant is on fire.</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1373949477157</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 00:37:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373949876522-6</Id><Title>Which part of monoply with huge backlog, you don't understand?</Title><Msg>You either go with airbus (engine was on fire) or BA...

The batteries in these ELT's are replaced every 7 years anyway, so most aircraft will just get a new battery installed.</Msg><Username>logictheorist</Username><Timestamp>1373983707067</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 10:08:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373984579310-38</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Maintain the KKK</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1373974921196</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 07:42:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sparty how come dumbos continue to fight against school choice, preferring instead to force our kids to attend their common communist core of race division and identity politics?</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373984579310</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 10:22:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373984843271-39</Id><Title>Honeywell Beacon only Power on in Parked Plane</Title><Msg>A source familiar with the probe told Reuters on Monday that investigators were now looking into whether the fire, which occurred at London's Heathrow airport, was caused by the battery of an ELT built by Honeywell.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1373984843271</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 10:27:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373984925935-40</Id><Title>Hey Shuper</Title><Msg>Watching this 787 fire problem unfold I have been thinking about the transponder and the battery problems.

It’s not like they have the votes to repeal the law—a math problem they still haven’t solved after 37 different tries. Their appeal to the Supreme Court ended in defeat at the hands of a conservative chief justice. And now the bulk of the plan will begin to take effect in just a few months. At this point, why not sit back and wait for this crazy experiment to self-destruct? Why not let President Obama and the Democrats reckon with the millions of angry Americans who will undoubtedly hate their new insurance or their new insurance protections? Because Republicans are terrified that Obamacare could actually work. Already, the law has provided 54 million Americans free access to preventive services like check-ups and mammograms. More than six million seniors have saved more than six billion dollars on their prescriptions. Nearly 13 million consumers have received more than one billion dollars in rebates from insurance companies that had overcharged them. There are more than three million happy young adults who have been allowed to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they turn 26. And in California, a state that represents one-fifth of the U.S. economy, we’ve learned that premiums for the law’s new insurance options have come in lower­ than expected. As these successes build, Republicans are naturally coping with their fear the only way they know how: by scaring the hell out of everyone else. The Koch brothers, not content with the millions they flushed down the toilet on Karl Rove’s 2012 electoral strategy, are spending millions more on ads that tell the same previously debunked lies about the health-care law. Mitch McConnell, still pursuing his top legislative priority of defeating a president who can no longer be defeated, actually threatened the NFL for even considering the administration’s request to help educate uninsured Americans about the fact that they can....</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1373989174210</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 11:39:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373989337614-57</Id><Title>Boeing will be the spark that takes this whole market down</Title><Msg>I would get out of everything.

Year to date both BA and Airbus are at 38% gain so nothing for Boeing holders to brag about but over 5 years Airbus is better than Boeing today the numbers using CNN stock chart are Boeing in 5 years has gained 59% most of it this year(40%)a stock manipulated company buy back , while Airbus is up 200% in stock price smooth over time and when the A350 starts deliver it will not be 8 years late with fires, electrical problems oil leaks in the jet engines and constant emergency landings and diversions Boeing fools so that is 13.8% gain in two days for me on TSLA I hope it continues to make great moves up or down read my call yesterday all out of tesla and scty &amp; today I am right!</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373995361476</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 13:22:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373995537264-73</Id><Title>Honeywell may need to make 225 mil check out to Ethiopian Airlines</Title><Msg>Talk is burned out jet may be too dammaged to repair, or more likely due to being so new have a parts value so high that a major repair would be more expensive that parting out the plane and taking the loss on part value verses plane repair costs.

Spartacus99991 looked up IGZ after the fact and made a liar statement that she made 144% on IGZ and my ACAD was not so good ACAD topped out at over 1200% in one year, plenty of time for spartacus99991 to get some . She is not a trader, she is not a retired MD engineer. the IGZ stock symbol, is only a stock symbol that is only used to trouble shoot the index, spartacus99991 also has used by looking back after the fact , at one day pops in very risky medical cancer stocks , that made all the gain pre market then go flat for one day to claim that those are better trades than mine. Spartacus99991 is a flat out fool and a liar, and a very bad hack /troll. I am a real deal stock trader and called my sell off yesterday on TSLA ! I have already attempted to teach this move to spartacus99991 on apple years ago, I explained to spartacus99991 then with apple and told her then the stock price going down was related to apple being too much a percentage of the stock market place it was traded on . Now you have a similar situation with TSLA is will sell off for a while, good , I make more money going down .

It was a clever way to play the race card, as he had done before, when Professor Henry Louis Gates of Harvard was arrested. But it did not stop there.

Siewert is a Crime Laboratory Analyst employed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Crime Laboratory. She examined TM’s Fruit of the Loom dark gray hooded sweatshirt (Exhibit ME 12) and the light gray Nike sweatshirt (Exhibit ME 8) that he was wearing underneath the hoodie when GZ shot and killed him In her report dated March 22, 2012, she concluded: These are the classic signs of a contact shot. That is, the muzzle of the gun was in contact with the outer hooded sweatshirt with the light gray sweatshirt immediately behind, or in contact with it. She also test fired GZ’s gun into squares of cloth cut from both sweatshirts and verified that the muzzle of the gun was in contact with the sweatshirts. She also noted that the holes in the sweatshirts align with each other. She also measured the vertical distance from the hole up to to the neck seam at approximately 7 inches. The horizontal distance to the shoulder seam was approximately 7 1/2 inches. Although these holes align with each other, they do not align with the entry wound in TM’s chest. According to the autopsy report, the entry wound is 1 inch left of the midline and 1/2 inch below the left nipple. Therefore, the entry wound is approximately 3 1/2 inches below and 2 1/2 inches closer to the midline than the holes in the sweatshirts. Also significant is that the entry wound was caused by a gunshot in which the muzzle of the gun was at an intermediate range of 2-4 inches. What does this mean? It means the sweatshirts were being pulled down or being held by GZ as TM was pulling back or attempting to stand up (and probably screaming for help as he did so) when GZ pressed the muzzle of his gun against the hooded sweatshirt and pulled the trigger. The two sweatshirts were in contact with each other (i.e., gripped together) and approximately 2-4 inches from his chest. Just as the z-man stated...that 'he had to avoid shooting his own left hand'!</Msg><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1373998963386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 14:22:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373999054239-89</Id><Topic><Title>15 yo white gal shot and killed by a black drive by shooter</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1373997197611</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 13:53:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A man has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old girl who he targeted at random, authorities said today.

While some airlines complained about the delays, most were just glad to get their hands on this revolutionary plane. After a long period of underperformance, Boeing stock has beaten the market handily since the Dreamliner was introduced in September 2011. However, quality issues are starting to seriously threaten Boeing's reputation. There have been multiple unexplained fires on board Dreamliners this year, including one just last week. While regulators have had a measured reaction to the most recent Dreamliner fire, the model's poor track record is becoming a cause for concern. With top rival Airbus soon releasing its own new fuel-efficient widebody -- the A350 -- Boeing needs to repair its reputation for reliability right away. Fire on board In January, two different Dreamliner aircraft experienced fire-related incidents. On Jan. 7, a Japan Airlines airplane caught fire while sitting empty on the tarmac at Logan Airport in Boston. Then, on Jan. 16, people on board an ANA flight in Japan caught the smell of smoke, forcing an emergency landing. In both cases, the problems were traced to the Dreamliner's advanced lithium-ion batteries, but the exact cause of the malfunctions could not be determined. As a result of these safety issues, regulators grounded the 787 worldwide for four months in order to investigate the incidents and ensure that they would not recur. Boeing ultimately had to redesign the battery compartment in a number of ways. However, while having the plane out of commission for months was a big inconvenience, most of Boeing's 787 customers were not too concerned. For example, United Continental (NYSE: UAL ) CEO Jeff Smisek extolled the 787's virtues on the day the plane reentered service in May. Deja vu On Friday, Boeing and its customers experienced a deja vu moment. An Ethiopian Airlines plane mysteriously caught fire while parked in a remote area "</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1374002118250</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 15:15:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374002515315-105</Id><Topic><Title>"Boeing's Dreamliner Looks More and More Like a Nightmare"</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1374002118250</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 15:15:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good article from The Motley Fool and it looks like you didn't even alter it.

When fiber glass boats first came out some thought they might not be repairable, now we have found out they can fix almost any amount of damage, only factor is value of the boat compared to the repair, or scraping and replacing. I am sure an air worthy repair of the damaged tail section of this plane can be made, the only question is will it be less expensive to repair than scrap and replace, and being a very new plane it might bring in a lot of money on a salvage sale. Also by the way if this had been a conventional aluminum alloy plane, it still would be just as majore of a repair since the fire would have destroyed the heat treatment of the aluminum alloys used in their construction, so all part subjected to the heat of the fire would still need to be replaced. So regardless of construction a fire like this is going to be a major repair issue.</Msg><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1374003888949</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 15:44:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374004156405-110</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmermann only called 911 to report blk people as supicious</Title><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1373950325160</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 00:52:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"a kid with dreams of working in the aviation industry" Never was going to happen with his habit of smoking dope - not for flying, stewarding, baggage handling, maintenance, designing or manufacturing.

A civil suit may force Zimmerman to take the stand, and subject him to cross-examination concerning his deeds that fateful day. Although his lawyers, publicists and apologists will undoubtedly and shamelessly continue to try to turn Trayvon Martin into something he was not — and although there will be risk and continued pain for the family — there may be some consolation in holding Zimmerman accountable in a civil trial. Meanwhile, Trayvon Martin has joined Emmitt Till, Rodney King and others whose unsought and unwanted fame has shone a momentary spotlight on America’s continued struggle with its greatest demon – not just race, but the subordination and demonization of African-Americans. In the aftermath of a Florida jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman on charges of murder and manslaughter, civil rights organizations and ordinary citizens asked the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue charges under federal civil rights laws. In response, a spokesperson for the department said it would “determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction.” This, of course, raises key questions, like: What kind of jurisdiction does DOJ have, and what is the likelihood it will pursue such charges? The request for federal prosecution follows a familiar pattern following killings of black men, and sometimes women, by law enforcement officials: The police are either cleared of wrongdoing by local or state authorities without facing trial, or if tried in state court, they are acquitted (unarmed white men and women are rarely killed in interactions with police). Many black people have a deep-seated skepticism, extending as far back as the Jim Crow era, about the ability or willingness of state courts to justly adjudicate these cases. The Justice Department has available to it several statutes designed to protect those deprived of civil and constitutional protection after state courts failed. If Attorney General Eric Holder wants to pursue charges, here’s what his statutory authority looks like: Following the Civil War, the federal government enacted a number of laws aimed at providing a backstop for the failure of states to protect the civil rights of African-Americans. These Reconstruction Era statutes, some directed at the Ku Klux Klan, tended to focus on conspiracies between two or more persons (for those looking for the specific statutes, they’re known as 18 U.S.C. sections 241 and 242; and 42 U.S.C. sections 1983, 1985 and 1986). Section 241 applies when “two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person … in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374010444398</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 17:34:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374010474453-126</Id><Topic><Title>The Next Step</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374010444398</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 17:34:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reconstruction Era laws included prohibitions against persons in disguise going on the highways with the purpose of threatening and intimidating individuals on the basis of race or color, and otherwise interfering with the exercise of constitutional and civil rights. Another statute (18 U.S.C. section 242) addresses deprivations of rights “under color of law”: “whenever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any person … to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States”. While not limited to conspiracies, section 242’s “color of law” language (like the often used 42 U.S.C. section 1983), applies to persons who act under governmental authority. Of course, one has to anticipate the irony of Zimmerman, the “wannabe cop,” arguing that since he was a private citizen and not really a law enforcement officer, the statute does not apply to him. Justice Department prosecutors would have the added burden of showing that Zimmerman “willfully” acted to deprive Trayvon Martin of his constitutional or civil rights. Another statute in the arsenal of the Justice Department does not require proof of action under color of law, or of conspiracy; 18 U.S.C. section 245(b) (1) prohibits “whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, by force or threat of force, willfully injures, intimidates or interferes with or attempts to injure intimidate to interfere with any person because he is or has been [engaging in enumerated rights such as voting, participating in federally administered programs, serving as a juror, etc.]”. Section 245’s enumeration of protected activities narrows its application to require a showing that Martin was engaged in the exercise of a federally protected right. Section 245 (b)(2) includes a similarly enumerated list of protected activities, although they involve state, as opposed to federal government. The latter includes enrolling in state-run public schools or colleges; participating in state-administered programs, state employment; serving on state court juries; traveling in interstate commerce; and enjoying public accommodations. The Justice Department’s authority under 42 U.S.C. section 1985 covers conspiracies to interfere with civil rights, including holding office or carrying out the duties of office, obstructing justice, intimidating witnesses, or otherwise interfering with the judicial system with intent to deny equal protection of the laws; or conspiring to go on the highways or on the premises of another to deprive any person of equal protection of the laws or privileges and immunities; or interfering with the right to vote by threat, intimidation or force. Section 1986 provides for actions against persons who knowingly fail to prevent conspiracies that would violate Section 1985 from being carried out. In sum, the Justice Department has at its disposal several statutes enacted by Congress with the intent of providing federal protections to those deprived of civil and constitutional protection where state courts failed. These statutes were fashioned to deal with systemic defaults in an era of widespread violence and intimidation, and even KKK infiltration and control of the mechanisms of local and state law enforcement and the judiciary. The focus on conspiracy and action under color of law mirrored the manner in which racial oppression and subordination were carried out. The phenomenon of late 20th and early 21st century law enforcement killings of unarmed African-Americans — occurring in the context of a criminal justice system that arrests, prosecutes and incarcerates black people at massive rates dwarfing those of European Americans — is inadequately addressed by post-Civil War, Reconstruction Era laws. These laws, at first blush, appear to be exactly what the doctor ordered when, as in the late 19th and early 20th century Jim Crow era, state court remedies for civil rights violations, including racially motivated killings, were largely unavailable in the South. But 21st century killings of unarmed African-Americans present a problem that does not quite fit the solution created by Congress in the Reconstruction Era. It is not that the laws can’t apply; it is that they do not apply well. Or perhaps, that they are not applied well. Either way, those who believe that the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager with no criminal intent on the day he was killed or record of violent or otherwise significant criminal activity, was a miscarriage of justice, should be cautious about their expectations for a federal criminal conviction. Ironically, the Obama Justice Department, even with the first African-American attorney general, has legal and political constraints that put it in an impossible position. Once again, as was true in the heady and euphoric days following Barack Obama’s election as president in 2008, expectations are high. No matter which way his administration steps on the Zimmerman case, it is invariably going to disappoint and anger important constituencies. Many European Americans (but certainly not all) blindly insist that race was not part of Trayvon Martin’s death, or George Zimmerman’s trial. Some of these same individuals, who insist that race played no part in Trayvon Martin’s death are paradoxically quick to see race when it comes to what they call “black on black” crime. Most African-Americans, whose unarmed sons, fathers, brothers and sometimes even their mothers (remember Eleanor Bumpurs) have been doing the dying, see it differently. They understand that the senseless violence and dysfunction that characterize poverty-impacted communities of all races, as hugely important as it is, is a different phenomenon with different implications than those that attend the dangerously corrosive destruction of faith in our core institutions, including those entrusted with our protection. Many Americans, regardless of race, see the place of race in Trayvon Martin’s death and in our grotesquely distorted criminal justice system. Most understand that the president and the attorney general are, in all likelihood, no less outraged by the death of an innocent youth, than they are. Even still, there may be little justice in the criminal courts. Without a reboot of federal laws that provide a backstop to 21st century state court inadequacies when it comes to civil rights protections, the Justice Department option will remain a last choice, uphill avenue in which the odds of relief are long.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374010474453</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 17:34:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374011835447-127</Id><Topic><Title>15 yo white gal shot and killed by a black drive by shooter</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1373997197611</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 13:53:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You need to get informed dude , the shooter is a white guy freaking Boeing worker even."

While we all know that the government can sometimes speak with "forked tongue", the Justice Department can only appear to be harassing Zimmerman because of the not guilty outcome, not because of any facts. And, really, it is absurd on its face the notion that Zimmerman's asking Trayvon what he was doing around the neighborhood, since he did not know him, was an attempt to deny Trayvon his constitutional rights. This has nothing to do with race or what Obama's fictitious son would look like. This is about the Second Amendment. This has to do with the government using its power to harass law-abiding citizens and their ability to carry a weapon that is intended to protect their lives. The Second Amendment provides the right to bear arms. It does not require carrying a weapon. Thus, if a nefarious government can make exercising that right so onerous, costly, and perilous to one's livelihood, then to the average citizen, it is a de facto revocation of a sacred right in effect since 1791.

Tryvon's call to Jeantel started at 6:54 PM, which is 30 minutes after leaving the 7-11. He could have stopped somewhere to consume the sugar - but it was raining. Or, as Zimmerman noted, Trayvon was "lurking" around, not walking with purpose. The trip from the 7-11 to his dad's girlfriend's house (0.6 traveled miles) should only have taken 12 minutes (based upon a leisurely 20 minute mile). Even if you add in the 18 minute phone call to Jeantel, there are 15 minutes of doing what? In the rain? No crime, but a reasonable person might be able to argue that Trayvon's behavior, though even innocent, appeared to be suspicious.

In fact, not until earlier this year was there an actual confirmation by the government that such a program even existed. So much for the “most transparent administration in history.” Scahill elaborated, “We are doing pre-crime, like Minority Report, where we say if you’re a military-age male in a certain region of these countries we’re gonna kill you and then later say that you were a terrorist without ever providing any information that you actually were involved in a terror plot.” Scahill is alluding to the Obama administration’s redefinition of the word “militant,” whose definition has been transformed to mean “all military-age males in a strike zone.” Former Salon and current Guardian writer Glenn Greenwald had this to say about the brazenly propagandized term: “By ‘militant,’ the Obama administration literally means nothing more than: any military-age male whom we kill, even when we know nothing else about them. They have no idea whether the person killed is really a militant: if they’re male and of a certain age they just call them one in order to whitewash their behavior and propagandize the citizenry (unless conclusive evidence somehow later emerges proving their innocence).” The faux-conservative liberal next assumed a trademark liberal stance, claiming that if Scahill didn’t support unmanned drones, he didn’t support the troops. “In fact,” Scahill fired back, “you know they tried to make a medal for drone pilots and then it was rescinded by the Defense Secretary because of outrage from the actual troops. So, the troops actually disagree with your position that a drone is a troop.” “So what’s your answer?” Colbert asked, seemingly interested. “Well, I think first of all we can indict them and demand their extradition,” Scahill stated, referring to the rule of law due process requirement that typically governs war scena</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374021605264</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 20:40:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374021721431-164</Id><Title>Did Ya Hear South Carolina Is Giving More Tax Breaks to Build More PlaneMELTS???</Title><Msg>PlaneMELTS melt in your mouth, and not in your hand.</Msg><Username>gop_clown_circus</Username><Timestamp>1374021721431</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 20:42:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374021879374-165</Id><Title>PlaneMELTS Ground Themselves</Title><Msg>BA needs to step up planeMELT production in South Carolina to replace all the grounded planeMELTS.</Msg><Username>gop_clown_circus</Username><Timestamp>1374021879374</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 20:44:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374021901037-166</Id><Topic><Title>Justice For Trayvon</Title><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1374006477166</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 16:27:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is always just the beginning when radical leftists don't get their way.

As stated, in the year prior to killing Trayvon, Zimmerman called 9/11 eleven times. Six times to report suspcious activity by black males. No other race was reported. One time children running One time neighbor garae door open One time about dogs One time Zimmerman's own false alarm and the last time for a disturbance at the club house concerning a food srver which Zimmerman didn't want to pay. You might want to get your facts straight about Trayvon Martins lab work concerning the use of marijuana. Martin's autopsy indicated that medical examiners found THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, when they tested Martin's blood and urine. The amount described in the autopsy report is such a low level that it would have played no role in Martin's behavior, said Larry Kobilinsky, a professor of forensic science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. The toxicology exam, which was conducted the morning after Mr. Martin was killed, found 1.5 nanograms per milliliter of blood of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, in his body. This strongly suggests he had not ingested marijuana for at least 24 hours Research tells that aggression and violence are highly unlikely outcomes of marijuana use. Zimmerman was on the often abused prescription drug Adderall, which is known to cause “worsening mental or mood problems (eg, aggression, anxiety, delusions, depression, hallucination, hostility),”Adderall contains a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Both these medicines are central nervous system stimulants that affect chemicals in the brain and nerves that contribute to hyperactivity and impulse control. Adderall is used to ADHD. Urban Dictionary: Adderall damn adderall hooks yer #$%$ up nice son! poppin the blue pills unleashes the thrills, energy up Zimmerman was also on the prescription drug Temazepam, which is known to cause insomnia and anxiety; the drug is also known to cause “aggressiveness” and “hallucinations.</Msg><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1374028678470</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 22:37:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374029282553-188</Id><Topic><Title>Asiana grounds Boeing 777 in U.S. due to engine oil leak ReutersReuters – 18 minutes ago</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1374023035028</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 21:03:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How'd you get Courtney Love to go to prom with you ??</Msg><Username>husseindamuud</Username><Timestamp>1374029282553</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 22:48:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374029312372-189</Id><Title>Blacks fill our prison, cause they don't understand Justice but neither does Obama.

And that is not true, as I indicated his calls were for various reasons involving various people of color, but you have now corroborated my response with your last post. 2) From the toxology exam, "This strongly suggests he had not ingested marijuana for at least 24 hours. Research tells that aggression and violence are highly unlikely outcomes of marijuana use." OK, so he last "used" more than 24 hours before he died. His friend Rachel said (on Piers Morgan's program) he "used" at least twice a week. Summary: he was a "doper", plain and simple. We can speculate what that means in terms of aggression. But what we do know is that a drug user needs to pay for his bad habits - given no regular source of income. On the "priceofweed" website, the street price for weed is $120./ounce (about $4/joint). Perhaps, given he was not employed, he thought that he could stiff Zimmerman for money to pay for his habit. But that did not go well for him. There are other indicators (like being kicked out of school) that he was a thief. I am in agreement that prescription drugs can be a problem as well. Try taking prednisone. You will never be the same.

Some kids get an allowance, others get luch monies, on top of b-day and x-mas monies. etc. The Z-man was also chronically un/underemployed and exhibited financial difficulties by two of his 911 calls - one concerning his landlord for the z-man not paying the rent, and another for the z-man hiring a food server then canceling the deal.
