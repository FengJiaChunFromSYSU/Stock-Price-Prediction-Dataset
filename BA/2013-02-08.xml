I guess this certification upon which the 787 special conditions was granted is no good. Time for FAA and NTSB to take charge and do their job, not allow Boeing to self certify Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- What’s known so far suggests Boeing will have to come up with a new design, John Hansman, an aeronautics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an interview. “They weren’t supposed to have a fire, and they had a fire, so something went wrong,” Hansman said. “By doing it this way, the NTSB has forced Boeing to do something significant, to prove that they’re doing something different with the battery.” Cascading Failure The safety board is “basically calling out the very premise upon which the system was certified,” said Carter Leake, a BB&amp;T Capital Markets analyst in Richmond, Virginia, who is also a former pilot and previously worked for Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc. “Getting to a root cause to me seems to be a non-event until we find out what the FAA plans to do with regards to its original certification,” he said. “So I think it’s a very difficult situation that’s opening up here. I think the share gain is a misread of the dynamics here.” Boeing rose $1.14 yesterday to $77.43, the highest closing price since Jan. 4, the last day of trading before the Boston fire. That Jan. 7 incident started when a short-circuit in one of the battery’s eight cells set off uncontrolled overheating that spread to the rest of the battery, Hersman said. Boeing had said its pre-certification tests showed no sign such a cascading failure was possible, she said. Boeing had told the FAA the lithium-ion batteries would produce smoke less than once in 10 million flight hours, Hersman said. Fire or smoke in two planes after fewer than 100,000 flight hours by the 787 raise questions about assumptions used to certify the battery’s safety, she said. ‘Difficult Situation’ NTSB investigators are looking at possible causes of the initial short-circuit, including the recharging process, contamination in folds within the cell, the battery design and the manufacturing process, Hersman said. Investigators ruled out mechanical damage and external short-circuiting as a cause of the Boston fire, Hersman said. All battery damage occurred after the short-circuiting began, she said. The lithium battery packs are an essential component in the design of the Dreamliner, which entered service in 2011. The 787, developed to conserve fuel, uses five times more electricity than similar jets and its fuselage and wings are made from composite materials that are lighter than aluminum. Because FAA regulations didn’t cover aspects of the new design, the plane was certified with “special conditions” that allowed use of the lithium-ion batteries, Hersman said. Special Conditions Boeing received regulators’ permission to use the batteries in 2007, three years after the FAA barred passenger planes from carrying non-rechargeable versions of that type of battery as cargo because of fire concerns. Boeing’s chief engineer, Mike Sinnett, said Jan. 9 that the batteries were designed so that failure of one cell wouldn’t cascade to the others, and that the plane would be safe even if it did. “Sometimes it takes years before they find the answer, but that doesn’t mean the fleet has to remain grounded,” Weber said. Or that is does not mean the plane will not be grounded for years in a worst case situation ed!

Obama supporters in particular were baffled, wondering why they were seeing less pay when they had just voted for a President who promised they would never see a tax increase, that after all was reserved for "rich" people. The first Friday in January, Google was flooded with the question, "Why is my paycheck smaller?" Workers took to Twitter and asked the same question. Now, even the New York Times is realizing who the the newest payroll taxes hurt the most: poor people. Jack Andrews and his wife no longer enjoy what they call date night, their once-a-month outing to the movies and a steak dinner at Logan’s Roadhouse in Augusta, Ga. In Harlem, Eddie Phillips’s life insurance payment will have to wait a few more weeks. And Jessica Price is buying cheaper food near her home in Orlando, Fla., even though she worries it may not be as healthy. Like millions of other Americans, they are feeling the bite from the sharp increase in payroll taxes that took effect at the beginning of January. There are growing signs that the broader economy is suffering, too. Chain-store sales have weakened over the course of the month. And two surveys released last week suggested that consumer confidence was eroding, especially among lower-income Americans. While these data points are preliminary — more detailed statistics on retail sales and other trends will not be available until later this month — at street level, the pain from the expiration of a two-percentage-point break in Social Security taxes in 2011 and 2012 is plain to see. “You got to stretch what you got,” said Mr. Phillips, 51, a front-desk clerk and maintenance man for a nonprofit housing group who earned $22,000 last year. “That little $20 or $30 affects you, especially if you’re just making enough money to stay above water.” So he has taken to juggling bills, skipping a payment on one this month and another next month. “I’m playing catch-up each month,” he said. “You go to the supermarket and you can’t spend what you used to.” Now, liberals would argue that those payroll taxes will be put to good use for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid services these people will be able to use down the road but the truth is, that money will be gone and bankrupt so long as Washington refuses to even discuss a serious plan about how to reform our entitlement programs.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1360333469005</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 09:24:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360333765711-34</Id><Topic><Title>Outgoing CIA Chief: Obama Nowhere to Be Found Night of Benghazi Attack</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1360272396916</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 16:26:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>details? that`s why they have like 10 people in the chain of command.

Taxes on businesses are a business expense, and the cost of goods and services just raises, and the taxes get passed on to the consumer. Just like raising minimum wages hurts the poor. The additional cost of labor becomes a business expense, and employers layoff, cutback, and poor folks that need a job do not get one. And it becomes inflationary as well. Everyone elses wages get raised because the entre' level job will always be the low wage job on the totem pole.

(AP) — With family members waving from a pier, sailors aboard a Navy destroyer left for an overseas mission with more uncertainty than ever about their homecoming as potentially massive budget cuts reshape military plans. The guided-missile destroyer USS Barry headed for what was supposed to be a six-month deployment in Europe on Thursday as part of a NATO plan to provide a ballistic-missile shield for the continent. The Navy has warned that tours like this one could be extended for unspecified periods after billions of dollars in automatic spending cuts known as sequestration take place March 1, unless Congress acts to avert them. Among the military impacts, the Navy has said the cuts will mean less money for training and maintenance and that it could take longer to prepare crews to deploy as a result. The Navy has said that it would also deploy fewer ships to fewer places and that those that are sent out could spend longer stints at sea with fewer port calls to boost morale. The possibility of extended deployments adds to the uncertainty that already accompanies military families. "Even before the budget cuts and everything, you never have a set time that they're going to be home. I mean, they have a date, but that can always change so you always have that little bit of a worry that it's going to be longer than you think," said Robin Lunsford, whose husband Robert is an electronics technician aboard the Barry. It's not just a concern for sailors, but for Marines, soldiers and airmen who continually deploy around the globe. "If the military because of budget issues downsizes too much, does that mean that the fewer people who are left are going to have to deploy more?" asked Joyce Raezer, executive director at the National Military Family Association. "That's a real concern in the military community." The toll that extended and repeated deployments can take on sailors and their families isn't lost on Navy leaders. They created an expansive wellness campaign last year that targets alcohol abuse, among other problems, that they were concerned after a decade of war.

The proposed regulation would require store owners to label prepared, unpackaged foods found in salad bars and food bars, soups and bakery items. Erik Lieberman, regulatory counsel at the Food Marketing Institute, said testing foods for nutritional data will require either expensive software or even more costly off-site laboratory assessments. Lieberman said failure to get it right comes with stiff penalties: "If you get it wrong, it's a federal crime, and you could face jail time and thousands of dollars worth of fines." The proposed labeling requirement is meant to “aid consumers in selecting more healthful diets,” but according to Lieberman, “the evidence that menu labeling has any significant impact on public health is scant” and “no study shows any link to reduction of obesity rates.” Considering it will cost the grocery industry more than $1 billion to implement the regulation —it’s clear that by expanding menu labeling to include grocery stores, the FDA has gone too far. Townhall had the opportunity to sit down with representatives from the Food Marketing Institute and the American Pizza Community in November to discuss the impact the menu labeling regulation will have on their respective industries. FMI’s Director of Government Relations Robert Rosado explained that given the already high commodity and energy prices facing the grocery industry, the internalization of all the costs has gone as far as it can. In other words, this will mean higher prices for consumers, layoffs, stores scaling back their offerings or having to close altogether. Moreover, in the FDA’s cost-benefit analysis of the proposed rule, the "benefit" is left blank, he explained. “They can’t make any kind of quantitative or qualitative link to menu labeling and dietary habits [that lead] to decreased obesity or lower health costs.” He continued, “Unfortunately, by taking a very broad and prescriptive approach they’re [FDA] unnecessarily harming businesses and it’s a tough environment right now.” The FDA said Wednesday it has received hundreds of public comments on the proposal and will take them into consideration when finalizing the regulation. It is likely to be released later this spring, and the agency says it will "include a final economic analysis." FMI is strongly urging the FDA to "exclude grocery stores unless the majority of their business is derived from restaurant-type foods." Without making these common-sense changes, however, the proposed regulation will hurt small business owners and consumers and do little, if anything, to improve public health."

Critics of photo ID and other laws cracking down on voter fraud claim they’re unnecessary because fraud is nonexistent. Brennan Center attorneys Michael Waldman and Justin Levitt claimed last year: “A person casting two votes risks jail time and a fine for minimal gain. Proven voter fraud, statistically, happens about as often as death by lightning strike.” Well, lightning is suddenly all over Cincinnati, Ohio. The Hamilton County Board of Elections is investigating 19 possible cases of alleged voter fraud that occurred when Ohio was a focal point of the 2012 presidential election. A total of 19 voters and nine witnesses are part of the probe. Democrat Melowese Richardson has been an official poll worker for the last quarter century and registered thousands of people to vote last year. She candidly admitted to Cincinnati’s Channel 9 this week that she voted twice in the last election. This is how Channel 9′s web site summarized the case: According to county documents, Richardson’s absentee ballot was accepted on Nov. 1, 2012 along with her signature. On Nov. 11, she told an official she also voted at a precinct because she was afraid her absentee ballot would not be counted in time. “There’s absolutely no intent on my part to commit voter fraud,” said Richardson. . . . The board’s documents also state that Richardson was allegedly disruptive and hid things from other poll workers on Election Day after another female worker reported she was intimated by Richardson. . . . During the investigation it was also discovered that her granddaughter, India Richardson, who was a first time voter in the 2012 election, cast two ballots in November. Richardson insists she has done nothing wrong and promises to contest the charges: “I’ll fight it for Mr. Obama and for Mr. Obama’s right to sit as president of the United States.” But, of course, as you know there is no voter fraud. Pay no attention to that lightning coming out of Ohio.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1360337568485</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 10:32:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360337839583-54</Id><Title>Currency Wars Return, 1930s Style: Who Will Lose Out?</Title><Msg>As countries try to weaken their currencies to boost exports, the risk of a currency war similar to events seen in the 1930s has heightened, and policymakers are making sure they are on the winning side, according to Morgan Stanley. The balance of power now rests with Japan, according to the bank, as Japan's policy-makers' more dovish approach looks set to bring the world a step closer to a currency war. The Bank of Japan doubled its inflation target to 2 percent in January and made an open-ended commitment to continue buying assets from next year. This follows a leadership change, with new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe openly calling for aggressive monetary stimulus from the country's central bank.

"If a weaker yen is an important pillar of the strategy to make this export-oriented economy more competitive again, it brings into the picture something that was missing from earlier interactions among central banks of the advanced economies – competitive depreciation," it said in a research note.

Ironically, she said this as New Jersey, along with much of the northeast, is prepping for a major winter storm that includes blizzard warnings. Citing the worst of the past year’s weather (although apparently not this week’s weather) as evidence for global warming, Whitney claimed that the rate of climate change is happening too fast to prevent disaster. Then she suggested that the best way to lessen the damage was to “collect a fee from all fossil fuels at their points of entry into our economy from wells, mines, ports and pipelines.” To “make foreign trade fair,” she also recommended that foreign countries pay a fine for any carbon emitted during the transportation of goods into the U.S. Whitney’s analysis of global weather was dire. “Climate scientists predicted the oceans would warm and turn acidic, polar ice and permafrost would melt, sea levels would rise and extreme weather events would become ever more violent and frequent. But no one foresaw how rapidly these changes would take place.” According to Whitney, carbon dioxide levels are at “a concentration higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years.” Which was a bit before the time we started monitoring such things.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1360343534449</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:12:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360343824634-100</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Delays Dreamliner Deliveries As Battery Problems Get Worse</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360341403491</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:36:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>please read my other user comments and stay oout of Boeing stock or you will not make anything and have a greater chance of not staying up with the 3 major averages , and John Hart-Smith red up on his expert opinion of the failure of the 787 this was known in 2003 all the Boeing workers and retired workers know about this bad management 787 outsource failure 33 billion down the shareholder drain and still not flying passengers and the next problem will just keep presenting itslf the plane is radio shack parts , nothing is right with the plane and nothing was engineered by Boeing almost none of the parts were made by americans the FBI spin team is making foolish claims and wrongful statements the 787 is a terrible idea of how to make a plane. read John Hart-Smith</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360343824634</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:17:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360344110033-101</Id><Topic><Title>Is this the BA board or the</Title><Username>justshutupnfish</Username><Timestamp>1360341664944</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 11:41:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good to see you back ol pal justshutupnfish.

Indeed, McNerny never suffered a financial penalty as the Dreamliner endured repeated, costly delays and became a case study in how not to outsource a revolutionary new airplane. Minow told me that if board members wanted to signal they are on top of the crisis, “they will have to take immediate steps: Adding a new director with expertise in engineering and operations, setting up an independent board committee to evaluate the aircraft thoroughly and determine that all problems have been identified...” In addition, the board should independently investigate the failures in communication and testing, “improving the alignment of pay and performance throughout the company. They should also designate one or more directors to meet with shareholders to answer their questions,” she said. None of this has happened. Instead, last week Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith stated that the earnings forecast, “assumes no significant financial impact resulting from the FAA directive on the 787 program.” He left the door open to the possibility. “If this assumption changes after we have gained greater fidelity, we will let you know,” Smith told analysts and reporters. The board is filled with heavy-hitters. Among its members: Reagan chief of staff and uber-schmoozer Ken Duberstein; retired Admiral Edmund Giambastiani (a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff); and former U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab; Nor is the board lacking in business expertise. David Calhoun is chief executive of Nielsen Holdings. It has four former CEOs: Lawrence Kellner (Continental Airlines), Arthur Collins (Medtronic), Ron Williams (Aetna) and Mike Zafirovski (Nortel). Linda Cook was a senior executive at Royal Dutch Shell. Boeing’s board even has a man experienced in crisis management and its perils: Ed Liddy. He was picked by then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to run AIG as the financial crisis was turning into panic. Although Liddy took a token $1 salary (plus expenses), the insurer was bailed out with $84 billion in taxpayer money. He defended a lavish company retreat at the St. Regis Resort in California. He presided over $165 million in bonuses handed out to employees at a company that nearly pushed the world economy into a depression. McNerney, Calhoun and Zafirovski all come out of high positions at General Electric, where McNerney was the runner-up to succeed Jack Welch as chief executive. Taken together, it’s a cozy board largely of elite professional managers and political movers. The risk of living in a bubble is significant. There’s no shareholder activist. No union member. No cantankerous John Smale to ask tough questions and demand change. Not one aircraft engineer. The latter is no cure-all: Phil Condit, who moved the headquarters from Seattle to Chicago and underestimated the Airbus threat among other blunders, was an engineer. He served as Boeing’s chairman and chief executive from 1996 until he was forced out in a scandal involving bidding for the Air Force tanker in 2003. It was also the last time this weak board showed any spine. CEO McNerNey stands behind the 787, because he sure is not going to fly on one for the new potential test fail. Besides with his 22 million fully funded retirement plan, he needs to steal the workers pension, after all they took less pay up front for a better pension at retirement, he needs that money for his next Bonus. The government wants him to pay 1.5 in pension underfunding and it just is not what the man on top would like to do RONA.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360344795365</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:33:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360345045586-108</Id><Topic><Title>A change at the Top is needed 787 33 billion over cost, 3.8 years late failed , grounded</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360344795365</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:33:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody wants facts.

Thomson Airways, owned by Britain's TUI Travel told Reuters delivery of its first Dreamliner, originally scheduled for the end of February, had been "moved out of the month" and it had not been given a new delivery date. Norwegian so for the user who comments on Boeing delivery , how is that working for you now the 787 was going to up from 5 per month to 10 per month now it is zero per month and it could be a zero per month for years to come.

Mike Sears, 57, could face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines, but his attorney said his sentence probably would be less severe. James Streicker said in federal court that sentencing guidelines put his client's sentence at a maximum of six months. Boeing fired Sears, one of the Chicago-based company's top four executives, in November 2003 for discussing potential employment with Darleen Druyun, 56, a top Air Force procurement official, while she was negotiating a proposed tanker contract between Boeing and the Air Force. Druyun, 56, then left the Air Force to work for Boeing, which fired her along with Sears after an internal investigation. In October, she received nine months in prison for the illegal job talks. Darleen Druyun admitted she helped Boeing. Boeing Co. has reached a tentative agreement to pay $615 million to end a three-year federal probe into two high-profile Pentagon contracting scandals, the Justice Department said Monday. It would be the largest financial penalty ever levied on a military contractor. The settlement would end one of the more tumultuous periods for the aerospace company, whose reputation was tarnished by the cases. The scandals involved allegations that Boeing improperly acquired thousands of pages of proprietary documents from rival Lockheed Martin Corp. to help it win rocket contracts, and that Boeing illegally recruited a senior Air Force procurement official while she was awarding contracts worth billions of dollars to the company. Under terms of the agreement Boeing will not face criminal charges, but it will accept responsibility for the conduct of its employees that led to the ethical lapses, according to a senior Justice Department official. The deal is expected to be signed in a few weeks. The scandals led to prison time for two Boeing executives and the resignation in late 2003 of Chief Executive Phillip Condit, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360349172930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 13:46:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360349449943-131</Id><Topic><Title>The US should grow the deficit, not shrink it</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1360346259152</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:57:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Health care in the USA is not twice what it is in other developed countries.

Boeing failed to properly verify them before embracing them. Composites sounded brilliant and still offer benefits for aircraft in this class, but they bring new complications to manufacturing and aircraft certification and will take much longer to mature than assumed. The same goes for the 787’s brilliant-sounding more electric aircraft design approach. A fleet that still hasn’t resumed certification flights two months after the electrical panel fire shows that this concept was embraced without analyzing the possible complications. The global design partnership concept, which sounded brilliant, is a complete fiasco (see my July 2009 letter for more on this). As a result, the nonrecurring cost assumptions have proven completely wrong. All recurring cost assumptions look set to be proven wrong too.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360350739061</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:12:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360350861680-143</Id><Topic><Title>BA perhaps end up being the stock to monitor this week.</Title><Username>smithfranklin78</Username><Timestamp>1360326398542</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 07:26:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>im making money because the report</Msg><Username>vancemccoy247</Username><Timestamp>1360350861680</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:14:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360350927147-144</Id><Topic><Title>Peopel Should Charge as much as They can on their Credit Cards</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1360349729666</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 13:55:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>RONFLMAO.....good one!

Many years ago- in the mid-late 1980′s, Boeing earnings etc were on the downslope- as was typical of the whole aerospace industry at the time. Frank Shrontz was CEO, and he had a significant raise scheduled. At a shareholder meeting in seattle, a young person had tried to submit a proposal regarding pay issues. But it was one of those which wouldn’t fly due to SEC rules regarding ‘ ordinary business ‘ . However, rather than go thru the formalities of turning down via SEC, Frank agreed to specifically address the issue and call upon the proponent during the meeting so he could at least be heard rather than by random choice. AT that same meeting, Frank announced that he was declining the raise normally due him under contract since the company was not doing well at that time. In the overall scheme of things at that time, it was for Frank a minimum sacrifice- but had great PR value. Frank also had a VERY high ethical standards regarding trying to get realistic information from grunts via random selections from the troops for a one on one chat. Now fast forward to the current management. Grunts are P88888 when they read about the major bone-us for a job well done by McNearney and friends. While at the same time – telling the grunts we need to cut costs, go out to the subs and twist arms to lower costs, etc, and by the way- we can’t really afford you guys/gals anyhow so suck it up, boola boola, and lets see nothing but A8888 and elbows as you clean up the mess we made !

If Boeing is forced to switch to a different type of battery, it would add weight to the plane _ and fuel efficiency is one of the 787's main selling points. . The NTSB investigation shows the fire started with multiple short-circuits in one of the battery's eight cells.. That created an uncontrolled chemical reaction known as "thermal runaway," which is characterized by progressively hotter temperatures. That spread the short-circuiting to the rest of the cells and caused the fire.. The findings are at odds with what Boeing told the FAA when that agency was working to certify the company's newest and most technologically advanced plane for flight. Boeing said its testing showed that even when trying to induce short-circuiting, the condition and any fire were contained within a single cell, preventing thermal runaway and fire from spreading a complete failure of Boeing self certification. Boeing's testing also showed the batteries were likely to cause smoke in only 1 in 10 million flight hours, she said. But the Boston fire was followed nine days later by a smoking battery in an All Nippon Airways plane that made an emergency landing in Japan. The 787 fleet has recorded less than 100,000 flight hours. The plane that caught fire in Boston was delivered to Japan Airlines less than three weeks before the fire and had recorded only 169 flight hours over 22 flights. "There have now been two battery events resulting in smoke less than two weeks apart on two different aircraft.. "This investigation has demonstrated that a short circuit in a single cell can propagate to adjacent cells and result in smoke and fire. The assumptions used to certify the battery must be reconsidered."</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360355466812</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 15:31:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360355667422-168</Id><Title>Norwegian Air Shuttle said it will lease aircraft to replace Boeing's 787 Dreamliners</Title><Msg>Norwegian Air Shuttle said it will lease aircraft to replace Boeing's 787 Dreamliners if they are not delivered in time to launch its long-haul service.

As a person that designs and works with lithium batteries and that designs charging and protection systems for them. I have the opinion, that with the current state of the art , lithium batteries have no place in manned aircraft For safety of flight , only. when a lithium battery is designed that can build a cell that fails to a safe condition, like other technologies-but not before., then it is safe, to use on any airplane and not before that design , is the lithium battery a safe application for electrical power.". The engineering is not the most flawed aspect concerning the Boeing 787, this battery problem is is a symptom of the cause for the 787 delay and excessive build cost. . It is the management of Boeing, the FAA and now the NTSB that apparently cannot be counted on to make wise risk/benefit decisions. Boeing management first make up their minds , then seek underlings to support that decision. Anyone that objects or raises issues is pushed to the side while the sycophants grab the spotlight, at least until a patsy is needed to take the fall for unaware management decisions The new rules allow the shipment of lithium ion batteries weighing as much as 77 pounds, but only if they are aircraft batteries. Shipments of other lithium ion batteries greater than 11 pounds are still prohibited. The exemption makes no sense; it is a follow the money rule. The 787's two batteries weigh 63 pounds each. So if the standards need to be modified to allow the 787 to fly then instead of passenger safety, the money principal is used. Lithium-ion batteries can short circuit and ignite if they are improperly packaged damaged or has manufacturing defects. Fires involving rechargeable lithium-ion batteries can reach 1,100 degrees, close to the melting point of aluminum, or any other component that makes up a airplane, including aluminum. a key material in the construction of most airplanes the idea that smoke can be vented outside a burning battery box on a flying 787 ignores the actual cause of the ensuing crash . While the smoke can be vented a lithium fire of 1000 degrees in the vented battery section of the 787 is a crash condition at a rate of 100% . Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger, a former US Airways pilot famed for his precision flying that enabled passengers and crew to survive an emergency landing on the Hudson River in New York said in an interview that he wouldn't be comfortable flying an airliner that carried lithium ion aircraft batteries The potential for self-ignition, for uncontained fires, is huge," he said. The new regulations "need to be looked at very hard in the cold light of day, particularly with what has happened with the 787 batteries." Previously, U.S. regulations prohibited the shipment of lithium ion batteries on passenger planes in packages weighing more than 11 pounds, although heavier batteries could be shipped on cargo planes. The batteries are suspected of causing or contributing to the severity of an onboard fire that led to the September 2010 crash of a United Parcel Service plane near Dubai, killing both pilots. The two pilots of another UPS plane barely managed to escape the aircraft before it was consumed by fire moments after landing in Philadelphia in 2006. The combination of Boeing management ears wide closed , enabling FAA and NTSB self audit for Boeing and follow the money plan results in failure.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360356850775</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 15:54:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360356930370-174</Id><Topic><Title>Nanny Logic: Let's Throw People in Jail For Labeling Food Incorrectly</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1360350067714</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:01:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Would you rather buy a jar of peanut butter and find out it's rat paste?</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1360356930370</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 15:55:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360356997202-175</Id><Topic><Title>teeny-eeniac</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1360351220678</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:20:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, I see.

All commercial engines have built in "mechanical breakers" (i.e. like an electrical circuit breaker). If the engine turbines reach a critical overspeed, the mechanical breaker is designed to "break" and release the blade into the engine nacelle. The nacelle is designed to withstand the force of a broken turbine blade "at the expected speed " of the mechanical break. For an engine turbine blade to hit the fuselage, you would have to experience at least 2 independent failures. 1. The engine would have to experience an overspeed, and there are typically 3 separate controls to prevent an overspeed. 2. The mechanical break would not release at the expected speed, but would break at a much higher speed. 3. The engine nacelle would fail to contain the turbine blade as designed. Good luck to you all. I am going to go back to my normal life and try to ignore the nutcases on this board.</Msg><Username>madrusky</Username><Timestamp>1360357907114</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 16:11:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360358092548-181</Id><Topic><Title>HOW FAST THE PLASTIC BOEING 787 WILL BE CONSUMED IN CASE OF REAL FIRE IN FLIGHT</Title><Username>communicator_777</Username><Timestamp>1360354431947</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 15:13:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not as fast as I can put you on ignore.....</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1360358092548</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 16:14:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360358248946-182</Id><Title>Boeing smoking to much green stuff.... cant find out why the 787 is smoking to</Title><Msg>Its legal... to smoke some greens in washingston...Just cant find the smoking batteries...workers are higher than a 787 on a test flight</Msg><Username>forland1966</Username><Timestamp>1360358248946</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 16:17:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360358500199-183</Id><Title>After reading this only a "Fool" would go long Boeing</Title><Msg>After reading this only a "Fool" would go long Boeing by justkeepushin.Feb 8, 2013 11:06 AM.Permalink . buy as we know a new fool is born everyday.

But in the face of growing evidence that the jet’s lithium-ion batteries will need a major overhaul, the company now says those bets are off.

False. 2007 IPCC AR4, the scientific consensus, specifically stated that snow would diminish with global temperature increases. I was involved with a twitter exchange this morning correcting Dr. Marshall Shepherd, President, American Meteorological Society on this matter as he also wasn't aware of the consensus IPCC science. "In fact, Global warming has a real possibility of starting an ice age. (If the glaciers from Greenland melt and screw up the Gulf Stream)." While this is possible there has yet been no evidence for it. A couple of new scientific wrinkles have popped up. First a hugely important new paper just published by more than 100 ice experts,has determined from new ice core data that Greenland temperatures were an average of 14.4 degreesF warmer for thousands of years during the Eemian period and that to the shock of the scientists Greenland remained stable. 2nd wrinkle the GRACE satellite data used to claim Greenland and Antarctic ice melt rate had increase, was found to be tainted by bad sensors. When the scientists used IceSAT data they found that the rate of melt was not increasing and that net mass balance ice loss was less than the models predicted. Based on the current melt rate I calculated sea level rise from Polar ice melt to be less than 2 inches by the year 2100. As there is no guarantee that melt rate will be linear uncertainty boundaries are large for ice melt but with the new evidence from the Greenland study it seems likely that current modeled projections are incorrect. The atmospheric sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 will also be revised downward soon as climate scientists were wrong with the 3.2 degreesC for a doubling of CO2 as many new studies are suggesting 1.5-1.9 degreesC is the realistic number. Finally the scenario of a possible ice age from warming would require a slowing down of Atlantic "conveyor belt" current which is being monitored and again the modeled slow down is not materializing based on the reality of sensors monitoring the AMOC.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1360359609350</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 16:40:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360359667150-193</Id><Title>Boeing solves battery problem!

We will know soon enough but if a Maunder or Dalton type minimum cold event does occur the food supply system would be in huge trouble. Why should we be concerned about the next cold climate era? Space and Science Research Corporation Mon, 21 Jan 2013 23:27 CST This new era called a 'solar hibernation' or 'grand minimum' is caused by a repeating 206 year cycle of the Sun. These hibernations are accompanied by historic reductions in the energy output of the Sun. SSRC research shows ﻿the next solar hibernation will bring a long period of cold just as it has done before every time this cycle 'turns over' from its global warming phase to its global cooling phase. In addition, SSRC research backed by that of other researchers has shown a high degree of correlation between solar hibernations and the world's largest earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.Mr. Casey, President of the SSRC was the first authority to notify the White House and other government agencies of this coming solar hibernation in early 2007. Numerous other scientists discovered the same cycles of the Sun. Their findings have been ignored or buried in science journals and thus essentially unknown to the public.During the first six months of 2011, NASA, The US Air Force, and the National Solar Observatory all confirmed the coming solar grand minimum. The next solar hibernation and according to the SSRC and many other scientists, the next climate change to decades of record cold has begun. This cold era is expected to last for approximately 22 to 33 years with the coldest temperatures to be seen during the 2020's and 2030's either side of the bottom year of the cycle in 2031, and have temperatures on the order of that observed during the Dalton Minimum (1793-1830). We have already seen the early signs of the new climate with record cold winters globally for some of the past four years. During the winter of 2011-2012, while the central and eastern USA experienced a relatively warm winter, Europe and Asia had a difficult winter. We have entered a period of record temperature setting both hot and cold. This trend of highly variable extremes of both hot and cold within a general trend of globally declining temperatures is fully characteristic of the transition between climate changes. That does not mean we can wait to prepare. Now that the hibernation has begun, it is possible for these unusual variations in temperatures to strike with little warning. We should not be surprised to see occasional severe crop damage and recurring food shortages in many nations at any time. Comparisons to the Dalton Minimum show that there is a high probability of social, economic and political turmoil worldwide as a result of massive crop losses from the coming cold weather. The SSRC believes this damage to the world's agricultural systems will be sufficient to create conditions that could lead to the world's worst subsistence crisis in recorded history. This same food crisis occurred during the last hibernation, though with significantly fewer people to feed. Historian John D. Post called that time"...the last great subsistence crisis."</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1360360044217</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 16:47:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360360425066-198</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing certification standards were wrong on the 787 more weight for the 787 less fuel effecient next!</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1360355466812</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 15:31:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FSN, the scary part is with 43 billioninvested in the 787 and hundreds of bad foreign contractors if you follow the money passengers beware,the person who decides to fly on a 787 is taking a huge risk, the plane will fly but not with safety. Plenty of history to show that , the 737 rudder was a kill crash design, but every one I installed or later inspected was defective by design. The valve would stick, if Boeing grounded the 737 then Boeing would owe every airline customer for lost revenue as the FAA and Boeing had certified the plane as airworthy. So for a few 737 crashes the liar statement was pilot error. then the pilots were told when the rudder goes lock out in any direction , to free the sticking valve ,steer in the direction of the locked rudder and that would free the sticking valve. Next the engineers redesigned the actuator and fixed the defective design. Follow the money, boeing and the government would not ground the 737 because they would have to admit that they failed . The difference with the 787 is they can gound it now as the failures have occured very soon after the plane was certified for passenger flights and the failures are two in less than 200 hours of flight time. Like any product it is buyer beware.If you fly a 787 you are taking a huge risk even if and when the airplane is once more certified to fly. the basic problem will exsist too many outsourced engineers each doing thier owe design without Boeing having a view of the overall product. , there is no control this plane was not Boeing engineered so no control and no view of how the plane should work. Boeing is a customer not a designer of the plan and knows as much as a passenger. Inother words nothing. Flying on a 787 will be like putting a gun to yoru head with a slug in one chamber, you know the gun is loaded and you do not know if it is your turn to die.

TWO is that the nature of layered composites - think of carbon fiber cloth layers or tape impregnated with epoxy like material ( sort of like rip stop nylon or kevlar cloth ( as in bullet resistant vests ) is such that the load paths thru/around the damaged area spread out, leaving no single path of follow on failure.

By Dave Gilson -- Mother Jones -- on Thu. January 31, 2013 3:00 AM PDT By cutting off federal funding for research and stymieing data collection and sharing, the National Rifle Association has tried to do to the study of gun violence what climate deniers have done to the science of global warming. No wonder: When it comes to hard numbers, some of the gun lobby's favorite arguments are full of holes. Myth #1: They're coming for your guns. Fact-check: No one knows the exact number of guns in America, but it's clear there's no practical way to round them all up (never mind that no one in Washington is proposing this). Yet if you fantasize about rifle-toting citizens facing down the government, you'll rest easy knowing that America's roughly 80 million gun owners already have the feds and cops outgunned by a factor of around 79 to 1. Myth #2: Guns don't kill people—people kill people. Fact-check: People with more guns tend to kill more people—with guns. The states with the highest gun ownership rates have a gun murder rate 114% higher than those with the lowest gun ownership rates. Also, gun death rates tend to be higher in states with higher rates of gun ownership. Gun death rates are generally lower in states with restrictions such as assault-weapons bans or safe-storage requirements. Myth #3: An armed society is a polite society. Fact-check: Drivers who carry guns are 44% more likely than unarmed drivers to make obscene gestures at other motorists, and 77% more likely to follow them aggressively. • Among Texans convicted of serious crimes, those with concealed-handgun licenses were sentenced for threatening someone with a firearm 4.8 times more than those without. • In states with Stand Your Ground and other laws making it easier to shoot in self-defense, those policies have been linked to a 7 to 10% increase in homicides. Myth #4: More good guys with guns can stop rampaging bad guys. Fact-check: Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 30 years: 0 • Chances that a shooting at an ER involves guns taken from guards: 1 in 5 Myth #5: Keeping a gun at home makes you safer. Fact-check: Owning a gun has been linked to higher risks of homicide, suicide, and accidental death by gun. • For every time a gun is used in self-defense in the home, there are 7 assaults or murders, 11 suicide attempts, and 4 accidents involving guns in or around a home. • 43% of homes with guns and kids have at least one unlocked firearm. • In one experiment, one third of 8-to-12-year-old boys who found a handgun pulled the trigger. Myth #6: Carrying a gun for self-defense makes you safer. Fact-check: In 2011, nearly 10 times more people were shot and killed in arguments than by civilians trying to stop a crime. • In one survey, nearly 1% of Americans reported using guns to defend themselves or their property. However, a closer look at their claims found that more than 50% involved using guns in an aggressive manner, such as escalating an argument. • A Philadelphia study found that the odds of an assault victim being shot were 4.5 times greater if he carried a gun. His odds of being killed were 4.2 times greater. Myth #7: Guns make women safer. Fact-check: In 2010, nearly 6 times more women were shot by husbands, boyfriends, and ex-partners than murdered by male strangers. • A woman's chances of being killed by her abuser increase more than 7 times if he has access to a gun. • One study found that women in states with higher gun ownership rates were 4.9 times more likely to be murdered by a gun than women in states with lower gun ownership rates. Myth #8: "Vicious, violent video games" deserve more blame than guns. Fact-check: So said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre after Newtown. So what's up with Japan? ...........................................United States ............. Japan Per capita spending on video games....$44...........................$55 Civilian firearms per 100 people .............88 ......................... 0.6 Gun homicides in 2008 ....................... 11,030...................... 11 Sources: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Small Arms Survey (PDF), UN Office on Drugs and Crime Myth #9: More and more Americans are becoming gun owners. Fact-check: More guns are being sold, but they're owned by a shrinking portion of the population. • About 50% of Americans said they had a gun in their homes in 1973. Today, about 45% say they do. Overall, 35% of Americans personally own a gun. • Around 80% of gun owners are men. On average they own 7.9 guns each. Myth #10: We don't need more gun laws—we just need to enforce the ones we have. Fact-check: Weak laws and loopholes backed by the gun lobby make it easier to get guns illegally. • Around 40% of all legal gun sales involve private sellers and don't require background checks. 40% of prison inmates who used guns in their crimes got them this way. • An investigation found 62% of online gun sellers were willing to sell to buyers who said they couldn't pass a background check. • 20% of licensed California gun dealers agreed to sell handguns to researchers posing as illegal "straw" buyers. • The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives has not had a permanent director for 6 years, due to an NRA-backed requirement that the Senate approve nominees.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1360371070774</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 19:51:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360371098133-209</Id><Topic><Title>Governor, Perry has been an outspoken opponent of federal health-care reform</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1360369858122</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 19:30:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another fine post from hoozdik_patriotzzzzzzzzzzz. lol</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1360371098133</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 19:51:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360372358337-210</Id><Topic><Title>Global Warming Wacko - Ignores Snow - Wants Fee on Fossil Fuels</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1360343534449</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:12:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a doofus.
