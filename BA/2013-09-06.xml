We interviewed Zanders by phone. Q: You were quoted in the Huffington Post on August 30th as saying that the Youtube videos cited by the American government were not conclusive, as you couldnโt tell where or when the videos were taken โฆ or even whether they were from the same incident or different incidents. Do you still hold that view, or have you seen other videos that change your mind? Zanders: No, I have not changed my mind. The general observation still stands, and it will stand until we have the actual report from the U.N. investigation. I do not deny that a chemical with toxic chemicals has taken place. But I am just as concerned about how people are interpreting things in terms of a particular goal โฆ which in this case is military intervention. Living in a democracy we have the rule of of law, and we collect and analyze a variety of evidence collected at certain scenes before passing any kind of final judgment. One of the concerns I have is if we look over the periods starting in March 19th with the major allegation of chemcial weapons use near Aleppo, Syria, everything is being reinterpreted as sarin. When I look at video images that have been going around, what I see is a large number of people suffering from aspyhixia, but only a minority (if the photos are representative of the total picture) display symptoms that would correspond to exposures to neurotoxicants.

BTW your looonacy about communisim is about as appropriate as the concern that the moon is made of green cheese-- Its doubtfull if the so called communists of the last century were actually communists but merely zealous revolutionaries who were united under a modern day "Ivan the Terrible" namely Stalin in an authoritarian dictatorship practicing the old imperialism of the Czars who preceded them. When the old Bolsheviks died off and the rest of the world enjoyed booming economies the Soviet "communists" dissapeared and became capitalists over night back in 1990. A socialist economy might have been practiced in the Soviet Union but it sure is gone now- the only socialists are places like Cuba and Belyorussia. Try and do some reading- learn what "communism" really was and wasnt and try to do something about your stooopid ideas which you post on this board.

In 2008, two non partisan groups released a study that determined that President Bush and his top aides made 935 false statements about the security risk posed by Iraq in the two years following September 11, 2001. These statements were part of a deliberate campaign, according to the study conducted by the Center for Public Integrity and the Fund for Independence in Journalism. They concluded, โThe false statements dramatically increased in August 2002, with congressional consideration of a war resolution, then escalated through the mid-term elections and spiked even higher from January 2003 to the eve of the invasionโฆ In short, the Bush administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information that it methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against Iraq on March 19, 2003.โ The studyโs conclusions were further reinforced when former Bush White House press secretary Scott McClellan wrote, โtop Bush aides had outlined a strategy for carefully orchestrating the coming campaign to aggressively sell the warโฆ In the permanent campaign era, it was all about manipulating sources of public opinion to the presidentโs advantage.โ According to the study, then President George W Bush made 232 false statements about Iraq and former leader Saddam Husseinโs possessing weapons of mass destruction, and 28 false statements about Iraqโs links to al Qaeda. โPresident George W. Bush and seven of his administrationโs top officials, including Vice President #$%$ Cheney, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, made at least 935 false statements in the two years following September 11, 2001, about the national security threat posed by Saddam Husseinโs Iraqโฆ On at least 532 separate occasions, Bush and these three key officials, along with Secretary of State Colin Powell, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, and White House press secretaries Ari Fleischer and Scott McClellan, stated unequivocally that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (or was trying to produce or obtain them), links to Al Qaeda, or both.โ On July 2004, the Republican majority led Senate Select Committee released the Intelligence Senate Report on Iraqi WMD Intelligence, which identified numerous failures in intelligence gathering and โanalysisโ (i.e., interpretation). However, Republicans defended the Bush administrationโs statements on Iraq. An investigation into the administrationโs use of the intelligence was delayed for three years due to Republicans claiming it wasnโt as important (Senator Roberts, R-KS) as other pending items. Phase two of the investigation was released in 2007, but not all of the report was released. It determined, โour Committee has concluded that the Administration made significant claims that were not supported by the intelligence.โ</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1378492632851</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-06 14:37:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378493002875-94</Id><Topic><Title>Anybody Know Why Obama and Hillary Lied about Benghazi?</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1378413726605</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-05 16:42:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can not want to forward failed liberalism without lying.

The numbers: 4,484 Americans killed, 32,200 wounded, $806 billion spent (with an estimated $1 trillion needed for future medical care for war veterans through 2050, says a Brown University study) โ all for a war that began under a pretext (finding weapons of mass destruction) that never panned out. Instead, it evolved into a costly, 105-month grind that damaged America's image in the world and, it could be argued, strengthened Iran's standing in the region. On top of all this, the war wasn't paid for. Yes, it toppled Saddam Hussein. But other Mideast dictators have been overthrown pretty much on their own during the Arab Spring; historians can only ponder how Saddam might have fared. Obama opposed the war all the way back in 2002 โ and promised repeatedly on the campaign trail in 2008 that he'd end the conflict.

Itโs the growing portion of the working-age population that has dropped out of the labor force and isnโt even looking for a job. The jobs report for August seemed upbeat on the surface, since the unemployment rate dropped by one-tenth of a point to 7.3%. But analysts have been quick to point out that the unemployment rate fell because the number of people looking for work -- part of the numerator in the equation used to determine the unemployment rate -- declined. Thatโs usually a sign of an ailing economy, not a recovering one!
