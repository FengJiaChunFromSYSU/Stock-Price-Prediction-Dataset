This is not a new world: It is simply an extension of what began in the old one. It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time. It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom. But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule: Logic is an enemy, and truth is a menace.” Rod Sterling, The Obsolete Man. Rod Sterling’s quote from the Obsolete Man, a much loved 1961 episode of The Twilight Zone, has never been so relevant for today’s society, a world in which common sense has been subverted and reality is frowned upon by an establishment that sustains its own power on a steady diet of universal deceit. Since its introduction in a 1938 play and subsequent film adaptations, the term ‘gaslighting’ has entered into psychological textbooks as a form of psychological abuse whereby the protagonist seeks to make the victim doubt their own sanity by disorienting them and manipulating their sense of reality. Psychologist Martha Stout documents how sociopaths will successfully put on an act of being charming and convincing while simultaneously waging war against the common sense of their victims through a constant barrage of lies and abuse, all the time claiming their innocence. This is a perfect description of how the mainstream media and the government operates in the United States today – habitually lying without recourse while denouncing anyone who challenges the lie as a “conspiracy theorist”. A revolution has been launched against rationality and truth. Those who question authority are instantly derided as “conspiracy theorists” simply for coming to logical conclusions based on the evidence in front of them. The term “conspiracy theory” has been harnessed into a pejorative weapon with which to bludgeon free speech, healthy skepticism and independent thinking. In reality, today’s “conspiracy theorist” is someone who has managed to retain some remnant of control over their own thought process and one who has successfully resisted becoming another victim of ‘gaslighting’ – an individual who knows when they are being lied to. We live in an era where the ‘big lie’ has come to dominate virtually every sector of modern society – from news to entertainment, to foreign policy and politics, to the economy and healthcare. Only by refusing to accept that logic is an enemy and truth a menace, only by refusing to become victims of ‘gaslighting’ can we truly remain sane, rational, and not allow our understanding of the world to be shaped by those who see us as obsolete. Here are the top ten media and government hoaxes in recent history – lies and distortions that underscore how we truly are living in an age of universal deceit. - Iraq had weapons of mass destruction The lie that launched a war, following in the footsteps of numerous others throughout history including the Gulf of Tonkin hoax and the USS Maine. Not long after September 11 and for over a year until the invasion, the mainstream media dutifully repeated the hoax that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. One of the main sources used by the British and US governments to make the claim, Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, codenamed Curveball, later admitted that he lied about the existence of a WMD program in Iraq and then “watched in shock as it was used to justify the war”. - Osama Bin Laden was killed in May 2011 With most top analysts firmly of the opinion that Bin Laden died many years ago, a deluge of evidence suggests the May 2011 raid was a manufactured hoax. From the phony situation room photos, to the ludicrous “burial at sea” narrative, to the eyewitness testimony of those who lived in the same village where the raid supposedly took place, the assassination of Osama had all the hallmarks of a Jessica Lynch-style Hollywood hoax. - The drone program doesn’t exist Even after drone strikes were already being conducted and reported on around the world, former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was told by the Obama administration to act as if there was no such thing as an active US drone program – regurgitating the hoax that the entire project was completely non-existent. “When I went through the process of becoming press secretary, one of the first things they told me was, you’re not even to acknowledge the drone program,” Gibbs said on MSNBC’s “Up With Chris Hayes” last month. - The Federal Reserve is federal The Federal Reserve is no more federal than Federal Express. It is a private bank that poses as a government entity. In 2011, when the New York Times attempted to obtain documents about the Fed’s loans to foreign banks under the Freedom of Information Act, the Fed responded by admitting that it was in fact a privately owned bank and not federal at all, therefore not subject to FOIA requests. As the long-time Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee Charles McFadden said on June 10, 1932: “Some people think that the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions. They are private monopolies.” In 1982, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled that, “Examining the organization and function of the Federal Reserve Banks, and applying the relevant factors, we conclude that the Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA, but are independent, privately-owned and locally controlled corporations.” - The unemployment rate is 7.7% The unemployment rate reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and regurgitated by the media is a hoax. As economist John Williams of the Shadow Government Statistics website exhaustively documents, the real unemployment figure is closer to 23 per cent because the government figure does not include citizens who have stopped looking for work over the course of the previous month. “Since 1994, the long-term discouraged workers, those who have been discouraged for more than one year, have been excluded from all government data,” writes Jerome Corsi. - Flu vaccines protect you against flu Despite all its associated health risks, the flu vaccines does not protect you against the flu. The shots have to be renewed every year and even then recent statistics show that the flu vaccine is, “effective in only 56 percent of people who got the shot, and it largely failed to protect the elderly against an especially deadly strain circulating during flu season.” - Fluoride is good for you In addition to the plethora of existing studies which prove sodium fluoride, which is present in around 66 per cent of US water supplies, is a toxic waste that causes debilitating health problems, a recent Harvard University study found that “The children in high fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ than those who lived in low fluoride areas.” Even the CDC, which advocates the fluoridation of water supplies, admits that 2 in 5 American children show signs of fluoride poisoning. - The government is not preparing for civil unrest The establishment media, aided by a raft of leftist websites, is portraying concern over the Department of Homeland Security’s purchase of some 2 billion rounds of ammunition as a conspiracy theory by regurgitating the glib statement of a single DHS official. Erroneously claiming that the mass bullet buys are merely for training purposes or the government saving money by buying in bulk, the hoax conveniently ignores the fact that most of the bullets purchased are hollow point rounds which are both more and expensive and unsuitable for training purposes. The DHS admits that it is preparing for civil unrest by purchasing riot gear and yet the media still portrays the notion that the DHS is preparing for civil unrest as a “conspiracy theory”. - Democrats and Republicans represent two opposing parties The biggest political hoax ever invented – that the Republicans and the Democrats represent opposing forces – still continues to dominate despite the two parties habitually agreeing on every major issue. As Georgetown University Professor Carroll Quigley (Bill Clinton’s mentor), wrote in his book Tragedy and Hope, “The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can “throw the rascals out” at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy. … Either party in office becomes in time corrupt, tired, unenterprising, and vigorless. Then it should be possible to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party, which will be none of these things but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies.” - There is a war on drugs The notion of a war on drugs, one that continues to ensnare thousands of Americans in the prison-industrial system, is a complete hoax. As Pulitzer Prize winning author Gary Webb exposed before his “suicide,” the Central Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Agency control and operate the global drugs trade. US soldiers are now guarding the opium fields in Afghanistan as record amounts of heroin leave the country destined for US and European markets. The man who played a crucial role in reinstating Afghanistan’s opium market, Ahmed Wali Karzai, was on the payroll of the CIA for at least eight years. Mexican drug traffickers routinely admit that they work for the CIA and that the agency controls the drugs trade while simultaneously hoaxing the public with claims about a “war on drugs”.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363320052209</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 00:00:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363320087485-2</Id><Topic><Title>In memory ...</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1363108954688</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 13:22:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, who started the war(s)... it used to seem to be more clear or was it really GWB said on more than one occassion that he saw the first plane hit the WTC early on the morning of 9/11 when no live footage had been available to be broadcast...so exactly which 'channel' was the shrub watching... the trifecta channel - for chickenhawk oily money mongering monsters and criminals???!?</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1363320087485</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 00:01:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363320280720-3</Id><Topic><Title>Cruz to Feinstein: "What if we banned only SOME books from the first amendment"</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363306158904</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 20:09:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>many a book or other more vibrant media outlet are banned next is the spoken word before it is thought too bad this vet won't be around to see it all</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1363320280720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 00:04:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363320481868-4</Id><Topic><Title>Cruz to Feinstein: "What if we banned only SOME books from the first amendment"</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363306158904</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 20:09:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"too bad this vet won't be around to see the end of the first amendment" You sound like Mao Tse Tung</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363320481868</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 00:08:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363320506920-5</Id><Topic><Title>**** TEN MEDIA HOAX'S ****</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363320052209</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 00:00:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ros Serling was a corporate adventurist.

The company also faces U.S. public hearings in April on the safety of its lithium-ion batteries. Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau said on Friday that it was too early to estimate when the 787 could resume operations. "At this time we are not yet in a position to say when flights will restart," said Shigeru Takano, air transport safety director at the bureau, following Boeing's comments. Takano said it was "inappropriate" for Boeing to say that the investigation might not find the root cause of the battery incidents. Japan is Boeing's biggest customer for the fuel-efficient aircraft, which has a list price of $207 million, with Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways accounting for almost half of the Dreamliners delivered to date.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363341765306</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 06:02:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363343344136-40</Id><Topic><Title>Cruz to Feinstein: "What if we banned only SOME books from the first amendment"</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363306158904</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 20:09:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's amazing how many Communists and Communist sympathizers we have around.............</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1363343344136</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 06:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363343375777-41</Id><Topic><Title>battery replacewmets - who'd a thgunked iof thos</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1363343288462</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 06:28:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I used to think it was a fairly fair game on Crete</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1363343375777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 06:29:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363345657474-42</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes 500 Rich List Acquiring BA Shares!</Title><Username>james.tingle</Username><Timestamp>1362414215788</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:23:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very helpful report , thanks !</Msg><Username>ballerano</Username><Timestamp>1363345657474</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 07:07:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363345892910-43</Id><Topic><Title>BA Insider Trading Reported !!!</Title><Username>doris.shealey</Username><Timestamp>1361811207875</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 11:53:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very helpful report , thanks !</Msg><Username>ballerano</Username><Timestamp>1363345892910</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 07:11:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363347781497-44</Id><Topic><Title>**** TEN MEDIA HOAX'S ****</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363320052209</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 00:00:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see you have one iron rule: Logic is an enemy, and truth is a menace.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363347781497</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 07:43:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363348807704-45</Id><Topic><Title>**** TEN MEDIA HOAX'S ****</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363320052209</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 00:00:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BY YOUR OWN HAND SPAR-T-CUS</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1363348807704</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 08:00:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363350248589-46</Id><Topic><Title>BA LOSES ORDERS</Title><Username>nicehereinca</Username><Timestamp>1363294082574</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:48:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Say whatever you want, BA is going above $90 after the first 787 starts flying again...and past 100 if no battery problems ensue.</Msg><Username>eyt39bnp</Username><Timestamp>1363350248589</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 08:24:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363353218206-47</Id><Topic><Title>Analyst Downgrades The Boeing Company.

It’s not true.” As the Wall Street Journal reports, the Congressional Research Service now confirms that Obama cleverly lied both times. But the real question is, do any of those Obama voters care? And if not, why not? They can’t say Obama didn’t lie. The facts on oil production show that Obama shamelessly tried to take credit for the 1.1 million barrels per day increase since 2007 that happened in spite of, not because of, his policies. According to the CRS, “All of the increased [oil] production from 2007 to 2012 took place on non-federal lands.” On federal land, production fell more than 23% between 2010 and 2012. The federal share of oil production fell from 31% in fiscal 2008 to 26% in fiscal 2012. Similarly, the feds’ share of natural gas production went from 27.8% in 2007 to 15.5% today. Nor is it any mystery why federal oil production has fallen. Obama’s drilling moratorium after the BP Deepwater Horizon spill, and his snail’s-pace process for awarding permits on federal land––process time increased 41% from 2006 to 2011––has held back oil production to gratify the sensibilities of deep-pocketed environmental romantics like the Sierra Club. As Bob Dole wondered during the 1996 presidential race, “Where’s the outrage?” Where are all those fearless investigative reporters, the self-styled watchdogs of the public weal, who claim to hold politicians accountable when they lie and mislead on the scale this president has? But taking credit for increased oil production is small beer compared to the still festering scandal surrounding the administration’s response to the murder of 4 Americans, including an ambassador, in Benghazi last summer. The legacy media have shown little interest in ferreting out why the President, his ambassador to the U.N., his Secretary of State, and various flunkeys and flacks made multiple public claims that the murders resulted from a spontaneous demonstration sparked by an obscure Internet video. Indeed, this patent attempt to spin bad news should have been chum to those reporters constantly circling politicians and sniffing out scandal. Nor did you need Sherlock Holmes to figure out the motive. Obama has staked his foreign policy bona fides on the claim that “al Qaeda’s on its heels” and “al Qaeda is on the run,” that the death of Bin Laden and continuing droning of al Qaeda operatives had contained that terrorist threat, and that the foreign policy of “leading from behind” in Libya and promoting Islamists like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt would serve America’s interests and security without the interventionist excesses of the Bush administration and its wrong-headed wars. Confronting the truth about Benghazi would have exposed Obama’s foreign policy blunders and the truth he wanted to hide: al Qaeda is active and growing, and overthrowing Gaddafi released tons of advanced weapons into the hands of terrorists while leaving behind a failed state. The same media that turned a shabby campaign scandal like Watergate, a type of hardball politics unexceptional in American history, into an existential threat to our freedom and democracy, has been AWOL on Benghazi. Where’s Bob Woodward now? He’s too busy recycling anonymous gossip and squabbling with White House factotums who find his tone objectionable. Meanwhile the death of our ambassador, the dangerous failures of the president’s foreign policy, and the patent lies told to cover-up these failures are all ignored. So much for the media, whose partisanship is so persistent and obvious that it has become a dog-bites-man story. So we know why they are ignoring the scandals and lies and other sins of the Obama administration that, under a Republican, they would have burned through the whole Brazilian rainforest to report. As Jennifer Rubin wrote in January, “The media, in failing to doggedly seek answers, share in this shameful episode and have contributed to the complete absence of transparency and accountability. Nothing but blatant bias can explain that.” But where is the outrage of the American voter?

Check out Proverbs 12:22. What the Democrats have brought to the nation's table is "fecklessness, insolvency, and decadence". One does not have to be either "right" or "left" to see the truth in that. But, I will help you with the definitions of these words: "feckless": powerless - ineffective - helpless - Obama just yesterday announced that Iran is only one year away from building a nuke. “Make no mistake: A nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained,” Obama told world leaders. “That’s why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.” (Spet 2012) "Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before. And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons." (2011 SOTU speech). Three nuclear tests so far; Obama's speeches are of no effect. Of ten aircraft carriers, only three are deployed. "insolvency": Federal deficit of $16.5 trillion, nearly doubled since Obama has been in office for four years.

But Popes were unknown in the Bible, Peter was not a Pope, modern Popes have none of the essential qualifications of the apostles they are supposed to succeed, and it is admitted that there are times at which no one knows who was Pope. Furthermore, the men who select the Pope were unknown in the Bible and in history for centuries after the church began. And the modern means of selecting Popes was not determined until a millennium after the church began! The whole "chain" is missing!

(Some of these priests may have been married but left their families to become priests.) * At least 6 Popes were excommunicated or condemned as heretics, including one Pope who was excommunicated twice and two Popes who excommunicated one another! "In the first twelve centuries of her existence the Church was disturbed some twenty-five times by rival claimants of the Papacy. The strife thus originated was always an occasion of scandal, sometimes of violence and bloodshed ... For forty years (in the 14th century) two and even three pretenders to the Papacy claimed the allegiance of Catholics: whole countries, learned men and canonised saints, ranged themselves on different sides, and even now it is not perhaps absolutely certain who was Pope..." (Catholic Dictionary, Addis &amp; Arnold, p. 869). Who can believe that Christ's church is founded on an office occupied by such men as these? Imagine Jesus' church supposedly going through long periods of time in which nobody really knows who was the real head of the church! It makes more sense to accept the plain Bible teaching that Jesus is head of His church.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1363365879490</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 12:44:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363365918859-110</Id><Title>Get out of the WAY shorties new high a comming$$</Title><Msg>Mission controll we go a GO$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1363365918859</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 12:45:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363366093523-111</Id><Topic><Title>85.89</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1363360778334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 11:19:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let em FRY$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1363366093523</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 12:48:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363366170857-112</Id><Topic><Title>85.89</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1363360778334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 11:19:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wait till they start flying the 787$$$$$$$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1363366170857</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 12:49:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363366241161-113</Id><Topic><Title>By the time battery issue is resolved., BA is at 100</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1363361940809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 11:39:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The paln huh????

Boeing Co. BA +1.82% and a union health plan covering retirees of General Motors, GM -0.20% Ford Motor Co. F -0.60% and Chrysler, among other groups, have asked federal regulators to exclude or shield their insurance recipients from the fee. Insurance companies, which helped put the fee in the law, say the fee is essential to prevent rates from skyrocketing when insurers get an influx of unhealthy customers next year. The fee is part of a new insurance landscape created by the health law that will forbid insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The $63 fee will apply to plans covering millions of Americans in 2014. It applies to employers that assume the risk for workers' medical bills, and many private plans sold by insurers. The fee will be smaller for 2015 and 2016, though regulators haven't set those amounts. Few noticed the fee when the 2010 Affordable Care Act passed. Employers have spent recent months trying to peel it back, but final regulations published Monday in the Federal Register left it largely intact. "It's caught most employers, if not all employers, by surprise," said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health in Washington, which represents large employers. "They're very upset about it."</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1363370597334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:03:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363370650539-132</Id><Title>GUYS LONG VOLUME HAS JUST ABOUT STOP !!!!!!!!IT WILL FALL TO $79</Title><Msg>OOPPLKK</Msg><Username>nynynynybroker</Username><Timestamp>1363370650539</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:04:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363370795914-133</Id><Topic><Title>GUYS LONG VOLUME HAS JUST ABOUT STOP !!!!!!!!IT WILL FALL TO $79</Title><Username>nynynynybroker</Username><Timestamp>1363370650539</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:04:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What ever your Please pass it!!

The truth, of course, is that 19th century America was generally a time of minimal government and almost unimaginable (to us) economic freedom. In the course of editing my response, the Post made some unfortunate omissions and changes. Here is the original response in correct wording To rescue a drowning man, you don’t lecture him on why we need water. His immediate problem is too much water. You have to get him out of it. Today our country is drowning in government spending and debt. Yet some insist on lecturing us about the virtues of government rather than trying to cure the problems created by too much government. One of the lecturers is Jack R. Van Ens, who argues that government aided 19th century American economic growth, and that therefore President Obama’s government-centered approach is a good recipe for prosperity today. A more objective look at the 19th century shows just the opposite. It is true that the 19th century was an extraordinary time of economic progress—perhaps the greatest in recorded history. When the century opened in 1801, electronic appliances were unknown. So were motorized transportation, instant communication, modern medicine, and much more that had become commonplace by century’s end. These innovations created enormous economic benefits. They also facilitated enormous social progress, such as the freeing of slaves and the emancipation of women. But not all 19th century nations enjoyed this progress. Two far outstripped the rest. They were America and Great Britain. What made them different was economic liberty. For the white majority at least, 19th century America was a place of almost unimaginable economic liberty.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1363385063760</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 18:04:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363385568779-174</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Democrats Want to Kill Innocent Babies and Deny Medical Care to the Elderly?</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1363364454426</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 12:20:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And keep deathrow inmates alive.

Raised fed. taxes on workin stiffs to as much as 80%. Produced massive corruption, and poor medical care. Ryan wanted to save SS, and the libs said BS, and Obama said "no problem with the debt anymore, no need to produce a balanced budget."
