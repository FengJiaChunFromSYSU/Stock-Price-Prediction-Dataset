"There's a big market emerging for the next-generation of the 777-300ER, and so far, Airbus is the only manufacturer with a firmly launched new product." Airbus is promising the A350-1000's first delivery by 2017 and promotes it as 25 percent more efficient than a 777-300ER, partly because it uses more lightweight composite materials. That timeline may give Airbus a head start of three years over a 777 replacement, because Boeing hasn't committed to a schedule beyond saying the new plane would be in service by decade's end. The world's biggest airline is considering the 350-seat plane to replace older Boeing 747s, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. United already has agreed to buy 25 of the mid-sized A350-900 While we haven't set a firm timeline or launched the program, we at Boeing have the 777X on hold, we plan to continue the MD-Chicago fail plan , the customer will wait like with the 737. First we at Boeing Chicago will test the market and let Airbus take about 1000 plane orders for their plane and then run in at the last moment and say we, at Boeing have finally decided that we really failed with the 747 a plane with only 5 orders this year, and we at Boeing will actually get off our behinds to build a 777X, it will be late by 3 or 4 years and over budget like the 747 and the 787 and we will discount the price to gain some orders on our way to getting rid of the unions, we will win at Boeing when we go into bankruptcy then the unions will be done too.

Burger, Isn't this what Obama has done for the last four years and how he got re-elected? Still blaming Bush, four years later, for the economic problems of the Democrat's creation? What is boring is having to repeat this for you. Obama has been borrowing two to three times more than Bush. The economic problems are NOT the result of the Iraq war which spent about 13% of the total Obama deficit spending. The economic crisis arose from the housing industry problems that stemed from the Democrat's (Barney Frank &amp; Co) home loan extravaganza, giving loans anyone who happens to be breathing. Here is a question: if it turns out that Obama was lying, with purpose, to the American public regarding Benghazi, will you call for his resignation?

State the facts as to what actually happened - without the Axelrod spin factor, but instead with testimony, swearing under oath, from those who were on the ground in Benghazi (of course that survived) and those that were in the State Department and White House that were following the events as they unfolded. 2. Explain why the President, Rice, and Clinton claimed that it was due to passions over a video even though they knew while they were saying that that is was a terrorist attack. 3. Explain why six of our eleven aircraft carriers were taken out of service at the time, one of which stationed in the Mediterranean could have helped. Why were two of the active aircraft carriers patrolling less than 1% of the ocean's surface in the Persian Gulf. Why was our readiness lowered? Explain also why nothing was done to help over a seven hour period - during the attack.

Something similar to what was done during the Viet Nam war wherein the feds applied a surtax on everyone. To actually get enough revenue for Obama's taste for spending, an additional flat 10% tax should be applied to everyone - from the person that makes $1000 a year to the person that makes $1000000000 a year. Keep the progressive rates but ADD the new flat tax. Then, EVERYONE will pay their FAIR SHARE of taxes. Some people will have to forgo a few iTunes downloads and maybe pack a bag lunch, maybe go to the Good Will for clothing. A 10% tax - across the board - will completely wipe out the deficit spending. Small businesses will have to be treated with different tax rules than is currently done, but individuals who vote secretly in the polling booth to tax others will have to poney up and put their money where their vote is.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1352389614965</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 10:46:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352389876891-28</Id><Title>"Demoralized" - Ann Coulter</Title><Msg>Coulter said to Laura Ingraham "I'm demoralized"..My schadenfreude is strong with this one.

But let's expand that for a moment: neither the Democrats, nor the Republicans represent Christianity. There are both "Democrat" as well as "Republican" Christians. And there are Democrats and Republicans that will, unfortunately, spend eternity separated from God. At some risk, I will add, just for emphasis of point, that one could be a "communist" and also be a Christian (a thought that raises my eyebrows, nevertheless). Jesus, as you recall, made it clear to render to the government (Caesar) that which applies to the government and to God that which is due Him (Mark 12:17). But to define a Christian: he or she is a "disciple" (follower, believer) of Jesus and the term, "Christian", was first used in Antioch (Acts 11:26) - as flegling churches were first being established. It has nothing to do with political or social or economic philosophy. It has to do with being a believer, thus being saved and “born again” (John, chapter 3). So, any individual can have both a faith in Jesus and independently an opinion about something having to do with the social and political realm. There is no definitive statement in the Bible that would lead someone to know or judge whether or not a liberal or a conservative is a Christian, more specifically, is “saved”. Now, a Christian can be obedient to God’s Word or disobedient (John 14:15). And that may very well have to do with the support that that Christian gives to moral or immoral societal issues. And disobedience does not cause someone to "lose" his or her salvation but raises the question of whether that person was a believer from the beginning. I will leave it at that.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1352396372885</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:39:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352396844739-53</Id><Topic><Title>Right wing does not represent Christianity</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1352393044471</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 11:44:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can't articulate what Christianity is, but I can tell things it's not: - Demonizing the poor - Equating wealth with "good" - Claiming Jesus is a Capitalist - Giving your enemies as good as you got Christianity (through the Bible) condones things we no longer condone: - slavery - Death for working on the Sabbath Just a short list, there are a lot more</Msg><Username>norivit</Username><Timestamp>1352396844739</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:47:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352396934033-54</Id><Topic><Title>"Demoralized" - Ann Coulter</Title><Username>agent0977</Username><Timestamp>1352389876891</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 10:51:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Serves her right for calling Prez Obama a "retard".........who that bad taste stays in her mouth for a long long time</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1352396934033</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:48:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352396967287-55</Id><Title>October deliveries announced</Title><Msg>50 commmercial deliveries in October. 32 737's 2 747's 2 767's 7 777's 7 787's</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1352396967287</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:49:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352397054159-56</Id><Topic><Title>Stock Market votes against Obamma</Title><Username>locost7777</Username><Timestamp>1352322281259</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 16:04:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Send an email to Romney asking him how to play the market now that he's lost</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1352397054159</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:50:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352397125155-57</Id><Title>october defense deliveries</Title><Msg>1 AEW&amp;C 1 P-8 1 Apache (new) 3 Apache (remanufactured) 1 C17 4 Chinook 1 chinook (remanufactured) 4 F18 2 Harpoon 2 Osprey</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1352397125155</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:52:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352397235845-58</Id><Topic><Title>Stock Market votes against Obamma</Title><Username>locost7777</Username><Timestamp>1352322281259</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 16:04:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Compared to spring of 2009 market is up a lot and guess what.....if your Repub friends don't scuttle the deficit talks, in another year everybody might be singing praises of the economy recovery....maybe even YOU!

In a memo to defense-side employees Wednesday, Dennis Muilenburg, chief executive of the St. Louis-based Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS) division, said the program has saved $2.2 billion over the past two years. For the next $1.6 billion reduction phase, the company is “putting everything in our business under a microscope,” Muilenburg wrote. He announced the amalgamation of various business units within BDS that will cut the number of executives by 10 percent ( when Boeing cuts executives that means no more pork)— with a “sharp reduction in vice president and director-level positions.” The remaining executives will have expanded roles. Local BDS executive Tim Peters, who has headed the Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft and P-8 programs, will now be in charge of an enlarged division that includes the Air Force KC-46 tanker and C-17 transport aircraft programs.( No more work for Peters just less business to manage- less deliveries, less pork lower net for boeing shareholders over time, increased corporate taxes too) Overall, Muilenburg said in the memo, by the end of this year the number of executives will be 30 percent lower than it was in 2010. He said BDS wants to reduce its management costs by a further 10 percent by the end of next year, reducing the ratio of managers to non-managers to 12.5 to 1, from 9.7 to 1 today.

Democrats have been capitalizing on this shift while Republicans take on the impossible task of attempting to explain to the dependents that all of the hand outs are unsustainable and harmful. Unfortunately, like trying to take away candy from a spoiled child through reason, our efforts have been unsuccessful. To see where the dependence culture leads, Republicans only have to point to the tiny peninsula in the Mediterranean causing the entire world daily headaches, Greece. This has often been pointed at as the consequence of our current lack of financial responsibility and growth of entitlements, but the primary lesson to take away from Greece today is not economic; it’s cultural. Last night, the Greek parliament passed through necessary austerity measures amid a new wave of violent protests. The latest austerity package does not appear controversial. As the Financial Times summarized, it consisted of cuts in pensions and government salaries, higher taxes on gas and cigarettes, increased health care costs, and an increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67. Outrage and riots from these modest reductions have been completely out of proportion and can only be explained by the deep-seated entitlement mentality: This is where we are heading in the long term and what Americans voted for Tuesday night: a people so inclined to being handed everything there’s no rationality or measured response when something gets taken away. Luckily, we are not yet Greece and still have time to reverse the course, avert the fiscal cliff, and buck the entitlement culture. It’s not an easy task, but not impossible if sane people (conservatives) stay encouraged and keep fighting.</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1352407231560</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:40:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352407275948-77</Id><Title>You sorry dumbed down leftist democrap pukes......massive layoffs ahead.....</Title><Msg>Amazing, you democrap parasites are dumber than a fencepost..........</Msg><Username>drwstring</Username><Timestamp>1352407275948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:41:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352407366875-78</Id><Topic><Title>You sorry dumbed down leftist democrap pukes......massive layoffs ahead.....</Title><Username>drwstring</Username><Timestamp>1352407275948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:41:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes just the way to get people to vote Republican, call them childish names and have no facts to back up your statements . you wanna see dumb go look in a mirror</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1352407366875</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:42:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352407647007-79</Id><Title>Thou Shalt Not Steal - Unless by Majority Vote</Title><Msg>We have reached the point were Democracy loses its value - where 51% of the meople thin Democracy is the right to steel from the other 49%.

Thank you, America, for making sure our media will be taking a coffee break for the next four years instead of holding our elected officials accountable (unless they’re Republicans, of course). Thank you for making sure we’ll never find out about how we lost a brave border agent who was shot by a gun from a government gun-running operation. Thank you for making sure we won’t find out about why our president lied about the circumstances surrounding the death of an ambassador. Thank you for seeing to it that we won’t find out that the government’s response to Sandy was worse than its response to Katrina. Thank you, America. Thank you, America, for making sure we’ll continue to have an education system that teaches children that you are bad while ignoring the genius of your Declaration of Independence and your Constitution; that teaches children about birth control and gender equality but steers clear of God; that teaches children to rely on the government for the things they need instead of on themselves. Thank you, America. Thank you, America, for ensuring that we will continue to run up huge deficits. Thank you for ensuring the continued abuse of the Fed, which will be free to print more money, eventually making it worth less than the paper it’s printed on. Thank you for piling that debt on my children, so they’ll have to work for your government and China’s, rather than for themselves and their families. Thank you, America. Thank you, America, for making sure our military strength will be greatly reduced, in men and in supplies and equipment. Thank you for cementing poor relationships with our allies while coddling our enemies. Thank you for ensuring Iran gets a nuclear weapon, which it will not be afraid to use, probably resulting in another deadly global conflict down the road. Thank you, America. Thank you, America, for ensuring that proposed regulations on oil drilling and coal mining will be implemented, which will cause gas and electricity prices to spike. Thank you for ensuring that we won’t be able to build new power plants and refineries. And thank you especially because these things will cause our everyday necessities, like food and transportation, to cost us more than ever before. Thank you, America. Thank you, America, for ensuring that our religious institutions will be dictated to by your government, that they will have to provide services such as contraception and abortion even though doing so defies their most basic beliefs. Thank you, America. Thank you, America, for making sure we will continue to further divide ourselves into groups and see ourselves only by our race, gender, age, sexual orientation and income, instead of seeing each other as Americans. Thank you, America. Thank you, America, for the judges who will soon be sitting behind the benches in our courts, who will render decisions based on ideological social beliefs while ignoring the Constitution they’ve sworn to uphold. Thank you, America. Yes, thank you, America, for all of these wonderful gifts you’ve given us by re-electing Barack Obama.

Boeing announced a major restructuring of its defense division on Wednesday that will cut 30 percent of management jobs from 2010 levels, close facilities in California and consolidate several business units to cut costs. Boeing Headquarters The company [BA 70.98 0.87 (+1.24%) ] told employees about the changes on Wednesday, in a memo obtained by Reuters and confirmed by Boeing. Boeing, the Pentagon's second-largest supplier, said the changes were the latest step in an affordability drive that has already reduced the company's costs by $2.2 billion since 2010, according to the memo. The measures come as U.S. weapons makers are under pressure to cut costs and preserve profit margins amid dwindling defense spending in the U.S. In a message to employees, Dennis Muilenburg, chief executive of Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security, said the company aimed to cut costs by an additional $1.6 billion from 2013 through 2015. "We are raising the bar higher because our market challenges and opportunities require it, and our customers' needs demand it," Muilenburg said.</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1352409422203</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 16:17:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352409463136-88</Id><Title>Hey Repterds; ya need New Material !</Title><Msg>You #$%$ doosh eatin toads need better material !</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1352409463136</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 16:17:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352409508503-89</Id><Topic><Title>BOEING Announces Big Layoffs In Cutback to Below 2010 Levels...</Title><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1352409422203</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 16:17:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought you WANTED cuts in Gov't spending.</Msg><Username>norivit</Username><Timestamp>1352409508503</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 16:18:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352409853529-90</Id><Title>New Movie; Glenn Beck ' Regurgitation '</Title><Msg>staring yours truly, Fox news republicon jobs, from Mt Vernon... ms Glen 'the low life' Beck !</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1352409853529</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 16:24:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352410326165-91</Id><Title>Are the Majority of Americans Just Too Stupid to Live in Freedom?</Title><Msg>Are Government Safety Nets Replacing Personal Responsibility?</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1352410326165</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 16:32:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352410552231-92</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Repterds; ya need New Material !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1352409463136</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 16:17:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hi Stick, Here is some new material for you: On 1 November, the Iranians fired on an unarmed U.S. Predator drone in international airspace. The Obama administration decided to not make it public before the election "because it was on a classified mission". In the mean time, the U.S., protested to the Iranians. Apparently, the Iranians are cleared to know, but not the American public - especially if it may have influenced the elections. Let's see, there was another post about whether or not the Obama administration was likely to tell the truth. Perhaps maybe, perhaps not, but definitely after the election.

We are not talking about a landslide. The Senate and the House maintains its Dem-Rep complexion. The House will proceed with its investigation of the events in Benghazi. The White House will declare "executive priviledge" on some testimony, but there will be "leaks". There is no honeymoon with Obama, so the likelihood of pulling the impeachment trigger is not remote. It is a slow process, so Obama will be able to have another big party for his inaguration and a couple vacations, and several rounds of golf.

I actually woke up Wednesday “post election” morning in a very good mood. In fact, it surprised me. A conservative. Go figure! I was certainly aware that Obama won. Not that his winning was a good thing, but because it is as I predicted and it is necessary and the Lord is still in control. I have told you guys before that I have spent the past year and a half studying biblical prophecy in earnest. It is clear that for the proverbial "end" to come, that the United States must either be non-existent, irrelevant, or complicit in the work of the anti-Christ. What Obama has done in the past four years is to place Israel in the position of being compelled to make a "peace treaty" with the anti-Christ (who has not yet been revealed) (Daniel, chapter 9). It cannot be denied by anyone who treasures truth that Obama has participated in surrounding Israel with more hostile neighbors - Egypt and Libya who have been taken over by radical Islamists. In the case of Egypt, it was by U.S. coercion; in the case of Libya, it was by destruction through U.S. military force. He has also protected Iran and Syria with his tepid and ineffectual responses to their human and political rights abuses. To Israel, Obama has told them that they need to go back to the indefensible '67 borders and he has shunned and denigrated the Israeli Prime Minister. At some point, with the United States no longer supporting Israel, and her being surrounded by open and notorious hostility, and with Iran’s soon to be nuclear bomb capability, the anti-Christ will force Israel into a compact. And then the end will come. Obama will have played his part and for the United States, Obama will have, in a negative way, reaffirmed the promises made in Genesis 12:3.

I recommend that you consider reading just one chapter a day, maybe two or three. Start with the Gospels in the New Testament. Read Revelation but don't go bananas trying to understand it fully. Then to the Old Testament. Skim over the "begats", though make a note of the extensive detail. No one else has to know. Either it is God's Word or it is not. Not reading it is likened unto the old saying, "ignorance of the law is no excuse." Based upon what is there, I know that it is important that you read it. Perhaps, we'll meet in heaven and have a good laugh over the BA message board. Maybe not; it is up to you.

Here is one: A Florida A&amp;M University professor wrote a book entitled, "The Gospel According to Apostle Barack” in which she compares Jesus with Obama. She claims that “God” came to her in her dreams and told her to write this book. You can only imagine “who” I believe came to her in her dreams. Nevertheless, that such a book should even be published today is what is symptomatic of our times. In the United States, there is a rich history of the Bible and worship of God woven into the fabric of our lives, society, and government. Today, however, America's majority has "had its fill" of hearing God's Word and has instead gone on a path of idol and god worship of its President - longing, often stated, just to "touch" him.This country has become massively, fiscally irresponsible, while the policies of this Administration provide for the support of the enemies of God (Islam), endorses same-sex marriage, and pronounced that there should be nothing to stand in the way of unfettered abortions. The people openly hate and curse Israel, hate and curse Christians, while shaking their fists against God (Democrat convention). And the President loathes Israel. Many, too many, enough to win an election, are willing to believe lies. This is not America. This is something else.
