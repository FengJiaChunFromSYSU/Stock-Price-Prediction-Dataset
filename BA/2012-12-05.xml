First of all, despite all the melodrama about raising taxes on “the rich,” even if that is done, it will scarcely make a dent in the government’s financial problems. Raising the tax rates on everybody in the top 2 percent will not generate enough additional tax revenue to run the government for ten days. And what will the government do to pay for the other 355 days in the year? All the political angst and moral melodrama about getting “the rich” to pay “their fair share” is part of a big charade. This is not about economics, it is about politics. Taxing “the rich” will produce a drop in the bucket when compared with the staggering and unprecedented deficits of the Obama administration. No previous administration in the entire history of the nation ever finished the year with a trillion-dollar deficit. The Obama administration has done so every single year. Yet political and media discussions of the financial crisis have been focused overwhelmingly on how to get more tax revenue to pay for past and future spending. The very catchwords and phrases used by the Obama administration betray how phony this all is. For example, “We are just asking the rich to pay a little more.” This is an insult to our intelligence. The government doesn’t “ask” anybody to pay anything. It orders you to pay the taxes it imposes, and you can go to prison if you don’t. Then there are all the fancy substitute words for plain old spending — words like “stimulus” or “investing in the industries of the future.” The theory about “stimulus” is that government spending will stimulate private businesses and financial institutions to put more of their money into the economy, speeding up the recovery. But the fact that you call something a “stimulus” does not make it a stimulus. Stimulus spending began during the Bush administration and has continued full blast during the Obama administration. But the end result is that both businesses and financial institutions have had record amounts of their own money sitting idle. The rate of circulation of money slowed down. All this is the opposite of stimulus. What about “investing in the industries of the future”? Does the White House come equipped with a crystal ball? Calling government spending “investment” does not make it investment any more than calling spending “stimulus” makes it stimulate anything. What in the world would lead anyone to think that politicians have some magic way of knowing what the industries of the future are? Thus far the Obama administration has repeatedly “invested” in the bankruptcies of the present, such as Solyndra. Using lofty words to obscure tawdry realities extends beyond the White House. Referring to the Federal Reserve’s creation of hundreds of billions of new dollars out of thin air as “quantitative easing” makes it seem as if this is some soothing and esoteric process, rather than amounting essentially to nothing more than printing more money. Debasing the value of money by creating more of it is nothing new or esoteric. Irresponsible governments have done this, not just for centuries, but for thousands of years. It is a way to take people’s wealth from them without having to openly raise taxes. Inflation is the most universal tax of all. All the pretty talk about how tax rates will be raised only on “the rich” hides the ugly fact that the poorest people in the country will see the value of their money decline, just like everybody else, and at the same rate as everybody else, when the government creates more money and spends it. If you have $100 and, after the inflation that follows from “quantitative easing,” that $100 dollars will buy only what $80 bought before, then that is the same economically as if the government had taxed away one-fifth of your money and spent it. But it is not the same politically, so long as gullible people don’t look beyond words to the reality that inflation taxes everybody, the poorest as well as the richest.</Msg><Username>spartacus8463</Username><Timestamp>1354686850241</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 00:54:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354687360076-5</Id><Topic><Title>Republican fascist leaders have got themselves into a "No-Win" situation</Title><Username>republicanfascists</Username><Timestamp>1354672743138</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 20:59:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>my guitar gently weeps like a p. mccartney piano intro and playin' 'cert for george and the two beatle reunion 777 3 zeps 2 who a pair of rolling stones5 the beach #$%$ excuse me meeting for those with $2-3M if shoe fit wear it run for congress with a sub 3 minute egg like lyin' ryan 777</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1354687360076</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 01:02:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354687991119-6</Id><Topic><Title>FISCAL CLIFF NOTES !!</Title><Username>spartacus8463</Username><Timestamp>1354686850241</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 00:54:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are so old you thought the the propeller(s) a top your beanie were for LIFT not DRAG THE OLD THIRD iPIANO PEDALLING 777 pEOPLE SAY THAT hOLLYWOOD IS JUST LIKE hIGH SvcHOOL AND THAT wASHINGON d.C.

Obama and Robert Mugabe have much more in common than skin color. Obama is a lot smarter than most other Democrats which ain't saying much but......but most Democrats don't have a clue what his real agenda is. Looking at Mugabe and what he did to a once great and prosperous country would give them a clue. Many of the wealthy folks in Zimbabwe waited far to long to protect their wealth and move it out of the country before it was seized by the Marxist thieves. They couldn't believe what was happening to a country their ancestors had settled, built and lived in for over 300 years. It was home and they didn't want to leave or believe it was necessary to move their businesses. The smart guys saw the writing on the wall.and began moving moving assets to Australia, New Zealand and other for British colonies. The super rich moved assets to Hong Kong and Singapore. Of course the most valuable asset that many had was the land they famed and that couldn't be moved. Nothing they could do about that better to loose the land than their lives and other assets. Zimbabwe is a sad story of how jealousy and envy turned a country that was the bread basket for an entire continent into a laughing stock that's greatest export is selling their 50 trillion dollar bills to novelty shops. Step one - Get your assets out of reach of the Democrat's hands. Step two - Consider countries with no income tax - there are also other countries who will welcome you and your wealth. Countries that not only admire but encourage high achievement. Step three - stay as liquid and mobile as possible.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1354717644411</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 09:27:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354718523592-14</Id><Topic><Title>Protect your wealth from government thieves and those who elect them.</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1354717644411</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 09:27:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Asia Hits 16-Month High, China Leads Gains http://www.cnbc.com/id/100277092</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1354718523592</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 09:42:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354718545158-15</Id><Topic><Title>Protect your wealth from government thieves and those who elect them.</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1354717644411</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 09:27:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Make sure your passport is current.

Here is yet another example of this … Gallup’s latest tracking poll shows that Americans feel more confident about the economy. But when you break it down, which Americans feel more confident about our economy? Democrats, blacks, Hispanics, postgraduates and millennials. Notice anything about that list? They are all Obama supporters! The Obama supporters feel great about our economic future under Dear Ruler. Republicans, whites, 65 years and older, and married people were at the other end of the spectrum. These Obama supporters feel good about our economic future because it is exactly the type of economy they want – More government, more social programs, more redistribution, more taxes on the rich, more income redistribution to them. These people will get exactly the economy they deserve. Too bad they have to drag the rest of us down with them into their statist redistributionist hell. Just look around you --- everywhere you look there are moochers, leaches and parasites; and every single day that p#$%$ there are more and more of these takers. We have people lining up with their iPads, portable DVD players and other expensive toys … lining up to get their home heating checks. Food stamp use is exploding … you know the numbers. During Dear Ruler’s first four years 75 people were added to the food stamp roles for every person who got a private sector job. Employers are having a problem finding low-skilled workers to take jobs at $8 to $12 an hour. Why? Because these people do the math and figure out that they can sit on their #$%$ pulling down their endless supply of unemployment checks and not have to work a lick for their money. Social Security disability requirements have been liberalized to the point that when unemployment benefits run out millions of Americans have managed to scam their way into undeserved disability benefits … a check each month for life. No work needed. If you sign up for Social Security and you have children under the age of 18 … guess what? They get social security too! Over $600 a month until they’re 18! Welfare work rules have been relaxed, the Welfare Reform Law eviscerated, and welfare roles are exploding. Now getting a massage qualifies as work for welfare eligibility. Keep a diary? You’re working. Get a manicure? You’re working! That’s just scratching the surface, folks. The Democrats are working overtime to put as many Americans on the government dole as possible … and they do this because they KNOW that once these people start getting their government checks they will vote Democrat. Guaranteed. They’ll vote for the man or woman whom they believe will keep their checks coming. So where are we in five years? Well .. maybe not five, maybe sooner! Maybe later! But the time will come when the work requirement for welfare actually includes work; when 16-year-olds who have never paid a Social Security tax in their lives are no longer eligible for benefits; when you’ll actually have to be really disabled to qualify for disability benefits; when you’ll get your unemployment check for about three months --- time enough to find some work, even if you’re not making what you would want to make; when you’ll find the types of food you can buy with your food stamps severly limited, and when income requirements are tightened up, and when you can’t demand someone else pay for your heating in the winter while you’re playing your X-Box on your 50” big-screen TV. And when that time comes the moochers – these takers – are going to hit the streets in a destructive rampage. How DARE they be asked to carry their own load. They’ll riot, they’ll occupy, they’ll learn the art of the Molotov cocktail, and American will become ---- Greece. How many Greek wealth creators do you think still have their liquid assets in Greece?

This report offers a plan to achieve meaningful deficit reduction over the next 10 years that rests on two pillars: Progressive, revenue-enhancing, efficient, simplifying, and pragmatic tax reform Pragmatic spending cuts that do not undermine the middle class, the poor, or seniors First, we should recognize our revenue problem. Repeated tax cuts played an outsized role in creating the budget deficits of the last decade and they have hurt our country. As Oliver Wendell Holmes said, “Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.” They pay for the foundational public investments that are critical to a modern prosperous society, such as infrastructure, education, and basic scientific research. They pay for services that only the government can effectively perform, such as national defense and ensuring clean food, safe consumer products, and clean water. Taxes make it possible for us to meet our societal obligation to care for our veterans, our aged, and our impoverished. And taxation allows us to overcome national challenges and achieve extraordinary feats. Apollo 11, the Hoover Dam, and the Internet were all financed with tax revenues. Current federal revenue levels are at their lowest levels since the 1950s. And the assumption that all of the tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of this year will continue is the single-largest reason why budget experts expect federal deficits to remain far too high over the next 10 years. Clearly we have a big revenue problem. When thinking about where the revenue we need should come from, the starting point should be that our tax system must be progressive. From Adam Smith down to today, it has been a long-recognized principle that those with higher incomes should pay a higher share of their income in taxes because they have the ability to pay and have benefited the most. After all, no one disagrees that, to take a hypothetical example, a 10 percent tax on a family making $50,000 has a far greater impact on the life of that family than a 10 percent tax on a family making $5 million. And those at the top of the income ladder benefit significantly from our civil society, public investments, the protections taxes pay for, and all our nation provides. It’s only fair that the better off be asked to pay a larger share of the bill. And, in fact, our tax system is progressive. But over the last several decades, the trend has been to ask less and less of those at the top. The very highest-income households have enjoyed substantial tax cuts, even as their incomes have risen: From 1979 to 2007, for example, the pretax incomes of the top 1 percent more than tripled, while their tax rates declined by about one-fifth. And while, on average, higher-income Americans do pay higher federal tax rates than middle-income Americans, there are too many high-income households for whom that general rule does not apply. Finally, it is important to remember that the federal income tax is only one piece of a larger national tax system. Most of the other pieces—excise taxes, payroll taxes, state and local taxes—ask much less of high-income households than they do of low- and moderate-income households. Taken together, our national tax system is already less progressive than it might appear, which is one reason why it’s so important for the federal income tax to be substantially progressive. In addition to concerning ourselves with progressivity as we address the need to raise more revenue, we should also address the fact that the current tax code is too complex. It contains too many narrowly targeted special interest breaks. In some cases these special preferences create economic inefficiencies that can no longer be justified. They also erode Americans’ faith that the tax code is treating everyone fairly. Our tax reform plan addresses these failings. First and foremost, it would redesign the income tax code so that it will generate adequate levels of revenue to meet our crucial fiscal goals. Over the next 10 years, our tax reform would put us on a stronger fiscal footing by raising $1.8 trillion and, by the end of the decade, matching the overall levels of revenue proposed by fiscal commission co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles as part of their bipartisan deficit reduction plan. Though these proposed revenue levels will likely be insufficient for the country’s long-term needs, they are enough to do the job in the medium term. And given their bipartisan pedigree, they provide a realistic target. Our tax plan would raise this revenue in a progressive way, asking those in the top income brackets to pay more. On average, households making less than $100,000 would pay a little less than they do now, those making between $100,000 and $250,000 would see only tiny increases, and the tax hikes up to $500,000 would be small. Our reform would also simplify the filing process and streamline the code so that everyone could trust that each taxpayer is being treated fairly. It does this by turning certain deductions that currently favor those in the highest tax brackets into credits that will bestow equal benefits. Our plan would tax different sources of income much more equally than the current code does. It would remove the alternative minimum tax, repeal other provisions that add complexity, eliminate unjustified tax loopholes, and reduce the number of taxpayers who would have to itemize. Of course deficit reduction will not be limited to tax reform. Spending reform will also be necessary. It is important to note that the federal government has already cut spending substantially. In the last two years, President Barack Obama has signed into law $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. We propose hundreds of billions of dollars in additional spending savings that can be achieved without reducing retirement or health benefits, without shredding the social safety net, and without further disinvesting in America’s future. The result is a comprehensive deficit reduction plan that will substantially reduce our future deficits, set the budget on a sound course for the coming decade, and bring our debt-to-GDP ratio below 72 percent by 2022.</Msg><Username>torqputty</Username><Timestamp>1354729387455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:43:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354729590295-33</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals are getting scared</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1354671157434</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 20:32:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"liberal media David Brooks" You just can't help typing incredibly stupid things, can you?</Msg><Username>freedumber</Username><Timestamp>1354729590295</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:46:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354729824350-34</Id><Topic><Title>Destroying Republican Unity...</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354724684846</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 11:24:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And Krautbrains thinks this is BAD?

The GOP “counter-offer” to the President’s fiscal-cliff proposal isn’t really an offer at all: It’s a rehash of the tired and extremist right-wing economic warfare which the American people soundly rejected last month. But a political tin ear is the least of the shortcomings Republicans bring to this debate. This rehash of their old, rejected budget ideas is a formula for reducing the United States of America to a crumbling and poverty-haunted land where the young have no opportunities, the middle class is struggling to survive, and the aged live in misery and fear. Think we’re exaggerating? Take a look at the details, such as they are, and decide for yourself. The GOP’s proposal attacks our health security on two separate fronts. First, their unspecified proposal for $600 billion in “tax reform” almost certainly includes cutting or eliminating the tax provisions which encourage employer health coverage, which currently covers most non-Medicare-eligible Americans. That would throw working Americans into the individual health care market by the tens of millions, as their “tax reform” makes it financially unfeasible for their employers to keep provide health benefits. The Republicans also propose to raise the Medicare eligibility age to 67, which would force 65 and 66 year olds to seek private, individual health care coverage on the open insurance market. And since they’d also repeal the new health care law, these older Americans would get no help in that process. I’ve analyzed health data from a number of US employers, and health care costs begin to skyrocket for workers as they move from age 55 to 65. They rise even more steeply after that. The cost of covering these workers will make employers far more reluctant to hire older workers. And they’re going to be desperate to find jobs, since the Social Security age is already scheduled to rise to age 67 under current law – a blow the GOP would worsen by cutting Social Security benefits for current as well as future retirees. They’d do that by using a lower formula to calculate cost-of-living adjustments – a calculation that’s already inadequate. This change would also affect disabled Americans and children on Social Security. The $800 billion they’re offering in “tax reform” is also likely to include cuts to tax deductions that are helping millions of middle-class Americans as they struggle to stay afloat. Likely targets include reducing or eliminating the home mortgage interest deduction, which could lead to millions of additional foreclosures, as well as an end to deductions for children. The Republicans are also promising $300 billion in “other discretionary cuts.” They don’t say what they’d cut, but previous GOP Congressional budgets offer clues. Some of the cuts are absurd, like the massive reductions in funds for hurricane warnings. Are they serious? Law enforcement programs that pay for themselves, like US Customs impoundment of drug vehicles? Honestly? The GOP’s massive cuts to antipoverty programs would lead to increase in the number of poor Americans, including poor children, and a marked decrease in their health and quality of life. Other cuts would lead to a significant jump in unemployment. Still others would make it impossible for any but the most well-to-do young people to finance a college education. If Republicans were really concerned about Federal deficits they’d be allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with big pharmaceutical companies, which would save billions. Instead they’re blocking it. And they’d be targeting the greed factor in for-profit health care companies, which is one of the leading reasons our country’s health care costs are so much higher than those of other countries. Instead, their last Presidential standard-bearer led the way in investing in those kinds of companies, then pushing them so hard that several of them wound up committing Medicare fraud. And if Republicans were really concerned about the deficit, they’d be raising rates on millionaires, billionaires, and corporations, instead of proposing to gain new revenue by “tax-reforming” the middle class into penury. Why propose such a socially destructive set of ideas? As the prosecutors ask, Cui bono? Who benefits? Under the GOP’s proposal, Wall Street would get millions of new customers as Americans scramble to make up for the loss in future Social Security and Medicare benefits. Health insurers would also gain millions of new customers. And lower government expenditures means an even lower tax burden for millionaires, billionaires, and giant corporations – and they’re the Republican Party’s real constituencies.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_444</Username><Timestamp>1354731973986</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 13:26:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354732343310-44</Id><Topic><Title>Hi.

Ignoring a veto threat, the Senate voted 98-0 for the legislation that authorizes money for weapons, aircraft and ships and provides a 1.7 percent pay raise for military personnel. After a decade of increasing Pentagon budgets, the vote came against the backdrop of significant reductions in projected military spending and the threat of deeper cuts from the looming “fiscal cliff” of automatic spending cuts and tax increases. The bill reflects the nation’s war-weariness after more than a decade of fighting in Afghanistan, the messy uncertainty about new threats to U.S. security and Washington belt-tightening in times of trillion-dollar-plus deficits. Spending solely on the base defense budget has nearly doubled in the past 10 years, but the latest blueprint reins in the projected growth in military dollars. The bill would provide some $526 billion for the base defense budget, $17 billion for defense programs in the Energy Department and about $88 billion for the war in Afghanistan. House and Senate negotiators must reconcile their competing versions of the bill in the next few weeks............</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354743484376</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:38:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354745082338-74</Id><Topic><Title>"Take Five"</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1354743394575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:36:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And what does the number 5 refer to in that tune? :)</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1354745082338</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 17:04:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354745229985-75</Id><Title>Best quote of 2012:</Title><Msg>There are two types of republicans, the rich and the stupid.

Maddison had been told that he was participating in a test to "cure the common cold." Ten days after his death an inquest was held in secret which returned a verdict of "misadventure". In 2004, the inquest was reopened and, after a 64-day inquest hearing, the jury ruled that Maddison had been unlawfully killed by the "application of a nerve agent in a non-therapeutic experiment."[19] 1956: Regular production of sarin ceased in the United States, though existing stocks of bulk sarin were re-distilled until 1970. 1960s (developing): The US unsuccessfully sought Australian permission to test Sarin and VX gas on 200 "mainly Australian" troops, probably in the Iron Range rainforest near Lockhart River, Queensland. While this never actually took place, the planning was in advanced stages.[20] 1978: Michael Townley in a sworn declaration indicated that sarin was produced by biochemist Eugenio Berríos for DINA, the secret police of Chile's Pinochet regime. He indicated that it was used to assassinate the state archives custodian Renato León Zenteno and the Army Corporal Manuel Leyton.[21] 1980–1988: Iraq used sarin against Iran during the 1980–88 war. During the 1990–91 Gulf War, Iraq still had large stockpiles available which were found as coalition forces advanced north.[citation needed] 1988: Over the span of two days in March, the ethnic Kurd city of Halabja in northern Iraq (population 70,000) was bombarded with chemical and cluster bombs, which included sarin, in the Halabja poison gas attack. An estimated 5,000 people died almost instantly.[22] 1991: UN Resolution 687 established the term "weapon of mass destruction" and called for the immediate destruction of chemical weapons in Iraq, and eventual destruction of all chemical weapons globally.[23] 1993: The United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention was signed by 162 member countries, banning the production and stockpiling of many chemical weapons, including sarin. It went into effect on 29 April 1997, and called for the complete destruction of all specified stockpiles of chemical weapons by April 2007.[24] 1994: The Japanese religious sect Aum Shinrikyo released an impure form of sarin in Matsumoto, Nagano. (see Matsumoto incident) 1995: Aum Shinrikyo sect released an impure form of sarin in the Tokyo Metro. Thirteen people died. (see Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway) 1998: In the US, Time Magazine and CNN ran news stories alleging that in 1970 U.S. Air Force A-1E Skyraiders engaged in a covert operation called Operation Tailwind, in which they deliberately dropped sarin-containing weapons on U.S. troops who had defected in Laos. CNN and Time Magazine later retracted the stories and fired the producers responsible.[25] 2004: On May 14, fighters in Iraq detonated a 155 mm shell containing binary precursors for sarin. The shell was designed to mix the chemicals as it spins during flight. The detonated shell released only a small amount of sarin gas, either because the explosion failed to mix the binary agents properly or because the chemicals inside the shell had degraded significantly with age. Two United States soldiers were treated after displaying the early symptoms of exposure to sarin.[26]</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1354760933498</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 21:28:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354761307754-96</Id><Topic><Title>Why Does McNerney Still have a Job ??????</Title><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1354759132676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 20:58:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Outsourcing has made the CEOs'millions.

Note: Detroit's official unemployment is 18% and 75 plus % voted for obama. From Adriennes Corner website which also shows a photo of the very nice home: According to the AP: A Detroit City Council member who paid $68 in property taxes this year because city records indicate her home doesn't exist, said she thought damage caused by a tornado was the reason her bill was so low. But JoAnn Watson couldn't recall exactly when the tornado struck her well-kept brick, Tudor-style home on the city's west side, saying it might have been 1993 or 2002. She said she was unaware of a city records discrepancy that has for the past decade listed the parcel as an empty lot, despite the home occupying the plot since 1926. Owners of comparable homes pay $2,000 to $6,500 in property taxes. The really hilarious part of the above story is: (emphasis mine) "I've been a target of a smear campaign," Watson told reporters gathered outside her home on Sunday. "... I pay my bills and whatever I was billed, I paid." When asked why anyone would want to "smear" her, Watson replied: "I don't smoke, I don't drink and I don't sleep around. It's an election year. I'll let you figure it out." source</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1354765650260</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 22:47:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354765892904-102</Id><Topic><Title>Wu are you in those NY Post pictures</Title><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1354764584126</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 22:29:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IF you outlaw trains- only criminals will have trains . . .
