"It's not easy to get up in the morning, training them to do your job so that you can be made unemployed," Bonnie Borman told the paper. Borman, 52, has worked at the Sensata auto sensors plant for 23 years. She has three children and predicts that soon, "I am going to be competing for minimum wage jobs with my own daughter." Although Romney left Bain around the turn of the century -- pinpointing the exact year is difficult, which has itself become a source of controversy -- he maintains financial ties to the company, receiving millions of dollars annually in profits from buyout and investment funds. Which means that Romney stands to gain if Bain's plan to cut costs at Sensata by eliminating U.S. jobs succeeds in increasing profitability. Needless to say, such an arrangement strikes the company's current employees as deeply unjust. "I understand business needs to make a profit," Tom Gualrapp told The Guardian. "But this product has always made a ton of money. it's just that they think it is not enough money. They are greedy." Gaulrapp, 54, is a 33 year veteran of the plant, and says that homelessness "is a real possibility" in his near future. Bain has already quadrupled its initial 2006 investment in Sensata, The Guardian says. The closing of the Freeport plant will cost the city 170 well-paying jobs, further damaging an already enfeebled economy. The process of transferring the machinery to China will be complete by the end of the year.</Msg><Username>republicanfascists</Username><Timestamp>1345301076000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 10:44:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345301411000-38</Id><Topic><Title>Rmoney the destroyer (of jobs) - Bain legacy continues</Title><Username>republicanfascists</Username><Timestamp>1345301076000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 10:44:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does this post have to do with the Boeing Co?

The remainder, 21, are from the red or conservative states. Also, the predominance (or rate) of unionization in the pertinent offender's states is 66% on average across this group of 50.

The President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness (Jobs Council) was created to provide non-partisan advice to the President on continuing to strengthen the Nation's economy and ensure the competitiveness of the United States and on ways to create jobs, opportunity, and prosperity for the American people. The Jobs Council is made up of members appointed by the President from among distinguished citizens outside the Federal Government, including citizens chosen to serve as representatives of the various sectors of the economy to offer the diverse perspectives of the private sector, employers, and workers on how the Federal Government can best foster growth, competitiveness, innovation, and job creation. The Jobs Council will: 1.Solicit ideas from across the country about how to bolster the economy and the prosperity of the American people that can inform the decision making of the President; 2.Report directly to the President on the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies to promote the growth of the American economy, enhance the skills and education of Americans, maintain a stable and sound financial and banking system, create stable jobs for American workers, and improve the long term prosperity and competitiveness of the American people; and 3.Provide analysis and information with respect to the operation, regulation, and healthy functioning of the economy and other factors that may contribute to the sustainable growth and competitiveness of American industry and the American labor force. The Jobs Council will work collaboratively with all agencies and all offices within the Executive Office of the President toward the fulfillment of these goals. GE and Bain are two different beasts.

The fact is, the parking lot is a good 100+ yards from the restaurant/pro shop and the only way to get to it is to walk through some tree and over a foot bridge. Do try and keep up.

The private sector throughout American History has operated under a policy of capitalism with little interference from government. No system is perfect but America's version of capitalism has managed to make America the wealthiest nation in human history. Even America's poor are better off then the poor in every other third world country. I should know something about this because for years I and my wife have been supporting a family living in poverty in Ecuador. These people live in a small one room brick shanty without a window. No television. No radio. No car. No bicycle. No healthcare. No medicine. No shoes. No education. a mattress no bed. America's poor are considered wealthy to these people. You should help others like them by donating to Children International.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1345343504000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 22:31:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>42</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345343660000-106</Id><Topic><Title>''Greater I srael'' Defined</Title><Username>skeptically98</Username><Timestamp>1345310714000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 13:25:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Paul, I do not propose to know everything. It is not possible, nor is it appropriate for me to know. There may be evil and warmongering folks running Is.rael today. All I know is what the Bible says - specifically that Israel would be re-gathered, which happened in 1948, after the dispersion that occurred in 70 AD (by the Romans, who destroyed Jer.usalem and the temple) just prior to the "end times" or the "great tribulation". Yes, I know that that sounds apocalyptic, but much of what is in the Bible is so. Is.rael is supposed to then have a "revival" and repent but much of the rest of the world that opposes God and Is.rael will suffer destruction. Is this a hundred years from now; is this tomorrow? Who knows. Only God the Father knows. Best to get right and be ready.
