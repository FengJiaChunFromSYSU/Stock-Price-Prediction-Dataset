Clinton's reform was far from harsh - from Aug 22, 1996 CNN artical: WASHINGTON (AllPolitics, Aug. 22) -- President Bill Clinton today signed a sweeping welfare reform bill that ends the open-ended guarantee of federal aid and shifts much of the responsibility for public assistance to the states. The measure, hammered out in Congress over the past several months, imposes a five-year limit on benefits, requires able-bodied recipients to go to work after two years, and gives states incentives to create jobs for people on welfare.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1346301558696</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 00:39:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346306362117-3</Id><Topic><Title>Condo was great tonight</Title><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1346296172422</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 23:09:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The 9/11 widows called her "KindaLiesaLot Rice"</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1346306362117</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 01:59:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346327857000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan's Speech In 3 Words</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_007</Username><Timestamp>1346327408000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 07:50:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lyin' Ryan is both a loose cannon AND a loose stool.</Msg><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1346327857000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 07:57:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346327994000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan's Speech In 3 Words</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_007</Username><Timestamp>1346327408000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 07:50:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>iiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1346327994000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 07:59:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346328509420-6</Id><Title>Lyin Ryan Continues the Tradition</Title><Msg>I recall Repubs telling us there were WMD's.

NOT. Addiction is becoming generational and then you list the requirement that says a person must go work after two years. How stupid are you? Obama never undid anything. Read this if you CAN! The administration did not waive the work requirement. Instead, it invited governors to apply on behalf of their states for waivers of administrative requirements in the 1996 law. Some states have complained those rules tie up caseworkers who could be helping clients directly. In a July 18 letter to congressional leaders, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that to be eligible for a waiver, governors must commit that their plans will move at least 20 percent more people from welfare to work. Moreover, states must show clear progress toward the goal within a year, or lose the waiver. "We will not accept any changes that undercut employment-focused welfare reforms that were signed into law fifteen years ago," Sebelius wrote.</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1346336922875</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 10:28:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346336987215-15</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Unanswered Questions</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1346299351645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 00:02:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are not only a liar but you are an ignorant liar and you prove it every time you post</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1346336987215</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 10:29:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346337059487-16</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Unanswered Questions</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1346299351645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 00:02:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gravy train???? what gravy train??? you think people want to be on welfare, use food stamps, be on unemployment.

Not so.

As a result, the whoppers that dominated Republican VP candidate Paul Ryan's convention speech last night will likely not hurt the candidate's standing with Republican voters, says Greenfield.

By Gregory Korte, USA TODAY Updated 1h 44m ago CAPTIONBy Edward Linsmier, Getty Images TAMPA -- Tampa police say patience paid off as a cat-and-mouse game with protesters failed to result in a single arrest outside the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night. The band of fewer than 100 "Occupy"-style protesters tried to taunt police officers by dangling bagels and donuts at the end of fishing poles. "I guess they thought that was funny," said Tampa Police Chief Jane Castor outside a downtown hotel, where she dealt with the protesters personally. The protesters took over intersections and refused to move for more than 15 minutes -- until getting up and asking police for directions to their next protest site. So far, only three people have been arrested in RNC-related protests, including one suspected of a protester-on-protester attack at a "Romneyville" encampment, WTSP reports. It's been so uneventful that the police chief has canceled several news conferences on protests because of a lack of news. Protest signs contained the message "Mr. 1%" beside a picture of "Rich Uncle" Pennybags, the Monopoly board game mascot, and protesters chanted anti-corporate slogans.

Because we’re wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking? Well, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally "cut" a dollar from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion. The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. So it’s timing that’s making the "cuts" bigger, not changes to Medicare.</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1346353648826</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 15:07:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346353930109-55</Id><Title>immacon is a #$%$</Title><Msg>I have to put 5 digits here so you can read the subject line</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1346353930109</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 15:12:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346354212869-56</Id><Title>Obama’s Sneaky, Deadly, Costly Car Tax.</Title><Msg>My column today looks at the latest radical maneuver by the Obama administration — slipped through yesterday while much of the media’s attention was on Hurricane Isaac and the RNC convention.

The Administration drafted these standards in secret, strong-arming automakers and short-circuiting the deliberative regulatory process to achieve a purely political result, abandoning sound science and objectivity to appease its political allies in the extreme environmentalist lobby,” Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif, said in a statement on the oversight panel’s website. “I support the goal of higher fuel efficiency, but this rule will only add to the burdens American small businesses and middle class families face under the heavy hand of the Obama Administration.” Remember in November.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1346354212869</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 15:16:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346354486361-57</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's Tax Plan Can Raise Revenue</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1346350989021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:23:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Notice that the subject line says "can" not "will".

The decision is a major victory for the Obama administration and its Democratic allies, which had challenged the law. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott promptly announced the state will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. Republican Gov. Rick Perry signed the voter ID measure into law last year, but it had yet not gone into effect because the federal Voting Rights Act requires changes in Texas voting laws to be pre-cleared by the U.S. Justice Department. Voter ID law goes to court DOJ 'cherrypicking' voter ID stats? Attorney General Eric Holder denied the pre-clearance of the measure in March, concluding that Texas failed to show the law will not have "the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race."

Liberals are panicking over Mitt's apparent win and eating themselves. Obama wants a Country of Loafers... living off the Producers. Romney’s welfare ad is accurate Published: 5:29 PM 08/29/2012 Poor Mickey Kaus. He’s the liberal intellectual (not an oxymoron — he’s the last known living “liberal intellectual”) lefties on TV are usually stealing from, but now that this welfare reform maven has concluded that Romney’s welfare ad is basically correct, liberals refuse to acknowledge his existence. The non-Fox media have formed a solid front in denouncing Romney’s welfare ad for daring to point out that Obama has gutted the work requirements of the 1996 welfare reform bill. The New York Times claims that Romney’s ad “falsely” charges Obama with eliminating work requirements. CNN rates the ad “false.” Underemployed hack Howard Fineman says Romney’s ad “is just flat out wrong on the facts” and “that every fair analyst, every fact checker” has said it’s “just factually wrong.” When a campaign ad induces this much hysteria, you know Romney has struck gold. On closer examination, it turns out that by “every fair analyst,” Fineman means a bunch of liberals quoting one another. This is how the media’s “fact checkers” operate when it comes to a Republican campaign ad. One not very well-informed person (or a heavily biased person) announces that Romney’s welfare ad is false, and the rest of the herd quote him, without anyone ever bothering to examine the facts, much less citing anyone who knows what he’s talking about. It is striking that everyone who actually knows something about the 1996 welfare reform law says that Romney’s ad is accurate. One of the principal authors of the 1996 welfare reform, Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, and Douglas Besharov, who advised Hillary Clinton on the 1996 welfare reform law, say Romney’s ad is accurate. Andrew Grossman, also of Heritage, produced something the MSM “fact checkers” avoid: a specific and detailed explanation of how the new waivers will allow states to evade the work requirements. Even Ron Haskins, one of the reform bill’s authors now at the liberal Brookings Institution — cited far and wide for “blasting” Romney’s ad — doesn’t deny the Obama administration plans to waive the work requirements. He just says he supports waivers for “job training.” That’s not disputing the accuracy of Romney’s ads. A lot of Americans don’t support waiving the work requirements, even for “job training.” Mitt Romney thinks they should know that that’s what Obama is doing. And liberal Kaus — whom liberal hacks are usually plagiarizing from — has written a series of blog posts explaining in detail why the Times is wrong and Romney’s ad is not incorrect. True, he says the ad is “oversimplified,” but I think most people grasp that a 30-second ad will not provide the lush analytical detail of a Kausfiles blog posting. We know liberals are reading Kausfiles; why aren’t they stealing from him this time?</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346358372251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:26:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346358388628-75</Id><Title>SAD Joe Bidum is the Smart one of the bunch!!</Title><Msg>Dumb BA Hillbillies!!!</Msg><Username>sizzlin2day</Username><Timestamp>1346358388628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:26:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346358461767-76</Id><Topic><Title>Are BA employees over paid hillbillies?</Title><Username>sizzlin2day</Username><Timestamp>1346355964521</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 15:46:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK , yes</Msg><Username>sizzlin2day</Username><Timestamp>1346358461767</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:27:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346358654838-77</Id><Title>God Bless President Obama..!!!</Title><Msg>and God Bless the USA!!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1346358654838</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:30:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346358917701-78</Id><Title>787 production increase</Title><Msg>BA execs told reporters today that the production rate of 787's will go to 5 per month starting in September per the NYC787 blog.

(credit: Facebook) Filed Under Regional News, Religion, Syndicated Local Related Tags NAPCON 2012, National Atheist Party, Troy Boyle BOSTON (CBS Connecticut) — The National Atheist Party is canceling its secular convention due to a lack of funding. Troy Boyle, the party’s president, announced on its website won’t be holding NAPCON 2012 in Boston in October because it would bankrupt the group. “After this year’s amazing Reason Rally, and flush with our successful recruiting and a spike in donations, we decided to hold our OWN secular event. NAPCON 2012 was supposed to be our biggest and best public event; our chance to show the U.S. that we could fund and organize a large, noteworthy and impressive ‘Secular Summit’ that would attract media buzz and even more interested members and donations. The reality is that we can’t,” Boyle said in the press release. “The donations simply aren’t there and if we went ahead with the event as planned, it would bankrupt us.” The second annual convention was supposed to consist of several speakers and musical acts over two days, as well as giving away free prizes to fellow atheists. Boyle blames a lack of donations and sponsors, along with several prominent people backing out of the convention. “The plain fact of the matter is that we have to cancel the event and spend more time and careful planning to make our 2013 convention a solid and better organized success,” Boyle said. “I am disappointed and disheartened, certainly, as I’m sure you all are, but I’m also committed to learning the lessons of this ‘failure to launch.’” The party – which was founded in March 2011 – states on its website that it “is a Constitutional movement dedicated to the preservation of the Founding Fathers’ vision of a secular nation.” Officials hope to develop it into a full-fledged political party.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346359376075</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:42:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346359416224-81</Id><Title>Embracing Mormonism..!!!</Title><Msg>And when he accepts the Republican presidential nomination tonight, Romney will discuss his years as a Mormon bishop ministering to troubled families, following testimonials about his compassion by congregants and an invocation from a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. “This is an opportunity to say how his faith informs his thinking and his actions,” former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said at a Bloomberg/Washington Post breakfast today.

Obama is worse than the Goober, Jimmy Carter The GM Bailout has cost 25 Billion plus.... Obama: I Didn’t Do Good Enough Job Selling Americans On Stimulus Plan August 30, 2012 2:23 PM TAMPA, Fla. (CBS Tampa/AP) — President Barack Obama says his re-election might help end the political stalemate in Washington, much like “popping a blister.” In an interview with Time magazine, Obama says he expects Republicans in Congress to work more cooperatively in a second term, since his re-election would no longer be a factor. “My expectation is that there will be some popping of the blister after this election, because it will have been such a stark choice,” Obama said. The president says he also wants to do a better job of explaining to the public how his policies will help the economy grow. Obama claims he didn’t do a good enough job selling Americans on the stimulus plan and the auto company bailout because he was so focused on acting to fix the economy. “[W]e were in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime crisis, so we had to just do stuff fast. And sometimes it wasn’t popular,” Obama told Time. “And we didn’t have the luxury of six months to explain exactly what we were doing with the Recovery Act, which was basically a jobs act and making-sure-middle-class-families-didn’t-fall-into-poverty act.” Obama says he wants to focus on overhauling immigration laws and reducing the nation’s dependence on foreign energy during a second term. The interview was conducted last week.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1346360891102</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 17:08:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346361819487-85</Id><Topic><Title>The Vulture/Voucher Ticket</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1346169827875</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 12:03:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have been watching Foxvda and listening to El Flushbo way too long.
