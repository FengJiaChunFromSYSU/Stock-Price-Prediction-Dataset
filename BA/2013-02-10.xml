That is the stark assessment of Nasa scientist and leading climate expert Jim Hansen who last week warned only urgent action by the new president could halt the devastating climate change that now threatens Earth. Crucially, that action will have to be taken within Obama's first administration, he added. _____________________________________________ Obama doesn't have a clue about climate change as his understanding of math and physics is at a 7th grade level which he announced on national TV. If Obama was intelligent enough to calculate the Earth's radiation budget and then calculate the amount of heat content reduction in the oceans that that USA CO2 cuts would make, he would know that he can do nothing that would have any significant impact on a global scale. There are two major areas where man is increasing CO2, energy production and land use change. Land use change is contributing as much or more CO2 as is energy production but is ignored because it is the poor and developing countries that are destroying forests and altering land to produce these emissions rather than the rich developed countries like the USA. So it is too late as the contribution of global CO2 emissions for the USA is only about 7% when energy production and land use change are considered included in the calculation. Worse yet s the fact that the 165 coal plants aleady scheduled to be shut down in the USA by 2017 will do nothing to offset the 1200 new larger coal plants that are being built by 2017 by the China and India. The measly 1 Gt per year of CO2 that the USA cuts by 2020 will be replaced and added to by Asian Pacific countries to the tune of 15Gt per year by 2020. Even a president as dumb at math as Obama is can figure out that he's deluding himself and the public in suggesting that the USA can make any meaningful reduction in CO2 in order to prevent catastrophic warming.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1360515260141</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 11:54:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360515285776-22</Id><Topic><Title>Since Global Warming has been mentioned earlier, there are those who blieve</Title><Username>laylow1991</Username><Timestamp>1360436212502</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:56:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can yu explain the correlation between the rise in greenhouse gases/atmospheric CO2 and the advent of the industrial revolution along with deforestation/desertification/overpopulation by normal cycles of the sun ?

Come enjoy the comfort of the 787 interior cabin, though from time to time smoke might get into your eyes. Lastly, (from Boeing Management) please keep buying our stock since we as a company promise to continue to "rush to judgement, find ways to skirt FAA safety regulations, continue to hide safety data from inspectors and promise delayed 787 orders [to all airlines], year after year". Its called the Boeing way and remember its not built in the good old USA.

Boeing can monitor things that go bad and then report back to management but not the general public. Its called no you see the major problem - no you don't. Boeing tells FAA and general public test flight was uneventful, but Boeing pilots and electrical engineers (on test flight) know different and have sworn their alliance to BA management and their weekly paychecks. Always best to go to 20,000 ft up in the air to do your bogus tests, thus making sure the the FAA is far, far away when the real problems surface. Problems like the whole electrical system within the Dreamliner might be defective.</Msg><Username>youbgone</Username><Timestamp>1360518980198</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 12:56:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360519245482-40</Id><Topic><Title>why are they checking in the air</Title><Username>tgif_8564</Username><Timestamp>1360517883554</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 12:38:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Temperature changes, pressure changes etc. Lots of changing conditions while in the air.

As usual, Sparty, you jump to rehtorical conclusions, overlooking facts. One internet source says the were 35,486 U.S. military deaths in VN from 1961-68 and 20,501 from 1969 through 1972. The total doesn't add up to 58,272, in part because names were added after the page I cite was created; or because 1961-65 deaths are lumped together; certainly there were deaths before 1961 -- the earliest casualty on the wall is June 8, 1956; perhaps there were deaths after 1972. But we don't need to argue about a 2,200-death discrepancy. My POINT is that you launch off without considering Nixon's "Bag." And that proves you're in no mental condition to evaluate anyone else's mental condition. (Not that I give a doughnut hole what Dubya's mental condition is. :-)</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1360533634092</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 17:00:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360534205368-86</Id><Topic><Title>Is George W.

I recenly saw a story about a night watchman/patrolman/something who had stopped dozens of jumpers off the Golden Gate. The veterans administration runs a hot line for service members or veterans to talk (about anything) 24/7. I haven't found any details on their "success" rate, but they keep at it. The high success rate has led to the philosophy (probably patronizing) that most suicide attemps are just a "cry for help." Of course you'll never stop someone who's convinced they have to do it, but pills or exhaust or jumping takes way more committment than simply holding the gun in your mouth and pulling the trigger. I don't know why we're arguing this point, since most of this is done with handguns or shotguns, and I've not heard of anyone planning to restrict ownership of those -- unless you have been to a doc (who flagged you in the system) and THEN try to purchase a gun to accomplish it.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1360544784677</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 20:06:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360545193090-106</Id><Topic><Title>Sally Jewel, Obama's total hypocracy</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1360544823565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 20:07:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Corruption from the getgo.

We are Greece.</Title><Msg>The free food handout in Athens began peacefully as hundreds of Greeks lined up in advance outside the agriculture ministry, where protesting farmers laid out tables piled high with produce, giving away 50 metric tonnes (55.11 tons) of produce in under two hours. Tensions flared when the stalls ran out of produce and dozens of people – some carrying small children – rushed to a truck and shoved each other out of the way in the competition for what was left. One man was treated for injuries after being trampled when he fell to the ground in the commotion. “I never imagined that I would end up here,” said Panagiota Petropoulos, 65, who struggles to get by on her 530-euro monthly pension while paying 300 euros in rent. “I can’t afford anything, not even at the fruit market. Everything is expensive, prices of everything are going up while our income is going down and there are no jobs.” Desperation, sadness, poverty, disbelief – these are the horrors that await the unprepared. While European (and U.S.) officials would have us believe they’ve mitigated the crisis in Greece, the fact is that this experiment in centralized governance is, in its entirety,on the brink of collapse. We’ve chronicled the desperate situation in Greece for the last few years. Personal accounts from some of our readers express their fear and uncertainty as political and socioeconomic conditions have deteriorated. Shortages of life savings medicines and food have led to widespread riots and looting. Food has become so expensive in Greece that it has become unattainable for many, prompting the Greek government to authorize grocery retailers to sell expired food at discounted prices. On a national level, Greece’s manipulation of economic health numbers and their ability to repay loans has left them unable to meet their financial obligations and has led to talks of their exit from the Euro, a move that has the potential to destroy the European currency system altogether. The debts have gotten so high that the country faced the possibility of a complete collapse of their power and gas infrastructure when local utility companies were unable to settle their agreements with regional suppliers – an effect caused by their customers’ inability to pay their monthly bills. This is what it looks like when a system collapses. Sometimes it happens overnight in a waterfall event. In the case of Greece, a country that has the backing of the world’s two largest central banks, it’s been a slow but steady process of grinding down all aspects of life. A similar grinding down should be apparent in other Western nations, namely the United States, where we’ve seen employment decline unabated over the last decade and tens of millions of people added to government funded social safety nets like food assistance and disability. Make no mistake. We are Greece.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1360551143640</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 21:52:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360551379820-118</Id><Topic><Title>Soischi 2014</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360547918882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 20:58:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>definitley...</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360551379820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 21:56:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360551806316-119</Id><Topic><Title>Soischi 2014</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360547918882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 20:58:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>zero time one mile 59 seconds bored on day re-set me and my friends two minutes</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360551806316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 22:03:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360551962693-120</Id><Topic><Title>Soischi 2014</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360547918882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 20:58:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>time-clock beep the lunar rover say by more than one second alas... ?</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360551962693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 22:06:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360552222459-121</Id><Topic><Title>Soischi 2014</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360547918882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 20:58:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>two mjles the first mioleess than 58 seconds the second mile inivloves the time and space machine and 12 inches per foot or about... mp-h/gal 56 seconds OR Else!</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360552222459</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 22:10:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360552618521-122</Id><Topic><Title>LAPD* BLACK vs. WHITE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>frankmalone90</Username><Timestamp>1360526046276</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 14:54:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're just shotgunning numbers in the air......you sound like helter skelter trying to stir up some race stuff.......</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1360552618521</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 22:16:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360552899867-123</Id><Topic><Title>Soischi 2014</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360547918882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 20:58:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1O2 SECONDS MY MOMMA BETTER THAN A CADILLAC</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360552899867</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 22:21:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360554011621-124</Id><Topic><Title>Soischi 2014</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360547918882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 20:58:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BETTER LADS THAN i PULL KNEES TO CHEST AND FLY 60-80 MPH CALL ME</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1360554011621</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 22:40:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360554770315-125</Id><Topic><Title>Make no mistake.
