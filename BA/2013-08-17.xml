Of course we are still far higher than the the Bush years for which the press and libs (really the same thing) pummeled him daily. Here is a quote from Senator Obama in 06 where he sounds almost Tea party-ish "It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our government’s reckless fiscal policies. Over the past five years, our federal debt has increased by $3.5 trillion to $8.6 trillion.

And anyone, retired, shareholder, joe public, etc can contact them. However, what an employee does on his own equipment and on his own time is NOT subject to BA approval, unless its something criminal involving BA. Within the last year - a BA HR type told newbies that ( pawraphrased ) thou shalt not diss BA or else- this resulted in a filing of a NLRB complaint- ( which is public record ). Why dont you dig up the details- and report back but not in your usual outdated- out of context editing of the resulsts. ?? Hint- the filing was made by SPEEA- When you find the results- copy and paste it here- then print it out on heavy paper, fold it with max number of sharp points, and insert it appropriately !" Thanks Don. Correct you are. Appreciate your efforts to educate Wayne, but as I think we're both aware he's unlikely to listen to anything other than the strange, rambling voices in his head.

"waynedickenson961 • Aug 16, 2013 12:52 AM Don, You can copy and paste from any link. 2. the ethics policy is legal or the policy would be removed by law. Don, your talking about represented collective bargaining rights to be free from intimidation, nothing more. The employee conduct is a employment at will doctrine. If a company no longer wants a man(VN) to be employed even with a labor contract they can be terminated without any reason Harry Stonecipher, a CEO of Boeing was terminated he had a employment contract better than you or I did . Don, he was representing Boeing and had a inside Boeing affair, no party was harmed . Yet Boeing decided to terminate his job. This guy your representing (VN) has violated company conduct policy while an active Boeing employee and can be terminated for any reason or no reason. As a retired, but experienced Labor Relations Manger for a very large top 10 prime contractor, I know the difference between a negotiated collective bargaining right and a company policy that can be enforced Don , you lose on this one.

Me? Are you kidding me? Go back and read a bunch of your own posts. Your intense and (probably) unjustified disdain for Boeing, its products, senior executives and management is off the friggin' charts. While I'd never claim to be an expert on Boeing's policies, procedures and rules, nor an expert on federal, state or local law, I'm very well acquainted with all of them. You clearly are not and made the mistake of engaging somebody who really does work for Boeing, designing commercial A/Ps and has done so not for years, but decades. I know what the hell I'm talking about as does Don Shuper, who's a retired Boeing engineer. Hopefully, you have learned something from this experience but I doubt it. When does it end? It ends when you stop lying to the people on this board and the public at large about the company for which I work and its products. There are plenty of factually accurate things about Boeing, its products, its executives and their decisions to be critical of and like many employees who have literally decades invested in this company I have been as critical as anybody but there's no need to make stuff up. Stop lying and I'll stop attacking you. Keep on lying however and I'm going to continue trying to set the record straight. It is a responsibility I have as a degreed engineer and like most engineers I take it pretty damn seriously.</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1376736740529</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-17 06:52:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376739089448-8</Id><Topic><Title>Attn Don Shuper</Title><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1376733634991</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-17 06:00:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, I'm quite certain Boeing will be very concerned that I (and others) have revealed you to be a chronic liar. Record away you idiot. As Don Shuper (retired Boeing engineer who's very well versed in all things Boeing) told you, what I do on my own time, using my own equipment is none of Boeing's business. The only possible exception to that is if I were to violate a company policy or rule that extends beyond company property and I have committed no such offense. I'm an employee of the company. I'm not their slave and their reach does not extend into my personal life. Ever hear of something called defamation? How 'bout libel, which is defamation by written word or image? "Defamation—also called calumny, vilification, or traducement—is the communication of a false statement that harms the reputation of an individual, business, product, group, government, religion, or nation. Most jurisdictions allow legal action to deter various kinds of defamation and retaliate against groundless criticism." You'd better be careful.

AS usual SPEEA is remiss in not explaining the outcome other than ' dismissed ' . While I was looking that up - it seems that someone has filed with NLRB against SPEEA on a dues issue. Considering the decades long foo bar financial foulups and the exec director(S) bullying of the Board to cover up- deflect- one might hope it would rattle a few cages. But early this year- OBOZO controlled board made it virtually impossible for any non member- agency fee payer to get the needed financial records to prove anything. Of course any MEMBER can by simple request get ALL financial records of SPEEA. IF SPEEA claims confidential- that becomes per se just cause to reveal such to any member. Someone needs to severely clip the Exec Director down to size.

In fact, the Everett plant will have to make up the difference in order for the company to reach its overall goal of 10 jetliners a month by year's end. As recently as July 24, when Boeing announced second-quarter earnings, Boeing CEO Jim McNerney insisted the company is on track to hit 10 Dreamliners monthly by the end of this year. But how Boeing accomplishes that has become more problematic. Company executives have started saying that Boeing’s North Charleston, S.C., plant is somewhat behind its goal of contributing three 787s monthly by the end of 2013. This was first reported in the Charleston Post and Courier, after a conversation between reporter Brendan Kearney and Boeing South Carolina executive Willy Geary.
