Piers Morgan or Anderson Cooper or Bill Maher, or anybody else that tries to take me on, they always have and they always will lose. They can’t win against truth. During the CNN interview, Nugent told Morgan that it’s important to note how many law enforcement officials are killed when their own weapons are used against them. “Let’s not dismiss that reality that is documented over and over,” he said. When asked whether a neighborhood watchman in Zimmerman’s capacity should be armed, Nugent definitely replied, “Yes.” Morgan “attempted to get me on the gun issue, but I let him have it,” Nugent said in the radio interview. “I kept it civil, and I let him know that the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman situation is anything but what most of the media was attempting to depict it as. We should be ashamed ourselves that our media in the United States of America is convicting this man, convicting him of quote, cold-blooded murder” without all the facts. “I’m not taking sides in this,” Nugent added, “but I’ve got some perspective working in law enforcement for most of my life.” Nugent further said, Morgan “tried to related the English law, which would have not stood for George Zimmerman defending himself, and I had to clarify to the CNN-viewing public that in England, by law, if someone breaks into your house, you have to retreat, like a cowardly sheep, out the back door. [...] That’s anti-human, it’s absolutely repulsive, and it encourages crime.” After remarking that Morgan’s producers told him the show has some of its highest ratings when he’s on, Nugent mocked Morgan’s way of saying “vast majority” — as well as the point Morgan made when he said it. Nugent said he cleared up to Morgan that the vast majority of Americans do not want to see Zimmerman convicted — and they are still praying for the families of the 10 black children who were killed in Chicago that same weekend. Jesse Jackson and “Al not-so-Sharpton” seem to conclude those deaths don’t matter because they were killed by other black people, Nugent said. “Nobody cares about race! [...] The rest of us value human life, regardless of color.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356269938125</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 08:38:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356270730320-9</Id><Topic><Title>Eric Holder’s Sympathy For the Devil</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356135076975</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 19:11:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Google: "WACO FBI used flamethrowers" ...Most Americans saw tanks using Flamethrowers on TV that day (until the videos were scrubbed). .......Most Liberal interpretation was that Gas was used.....which led to the inceneration of little children.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356270730320</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 08:52:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356270788336-10</Id><Topic><Title>WHY is President Barry giving Assault Weapons to Al-Qaeda (Confirmed)?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356049251554</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 19:20:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump again</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356270788336</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 08:53:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356273039938-11</Id><Topic><Title>Progressives Moving us Progressively Toward Communism.</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1356217340003</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 18:02:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its not the progressives that want more and more government, its the corporations that want more government to subsidize their low wages for the working poor. Without medicaid, how would the working poor who work for companies that pay low wages and offer little or no health benefits get well enough to work. Without food stamps, how would the working poor that work for companies that pay low wages be able to feed their families. Without housing assistance, how would the working poor that work for companies that pay low wages be able to pay their rent. If the government stopped the assistance, corporations would have to raise their wages. As wages go down or not keep up with inflation, the federal government has to pick up the slack. Isn't it amazing that republicans have a history of fighting minimum wage increases, but have been willing to let the federal government expand its spending on healthcare, food stamps and housing assistance. Isn't it amazing that republican voters now claim $250,000 is not alot of money to live on, but republican politicians fight minimum wage increases to $8.00 or $9.00 per hour. Its not progressives that have moved us to communism, its corporations that have.</Msg><Username>flyininmytaxi</Username><Timestamp>1356273039938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:30:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356273493875-12</Id><Topic><Title>Progressives Moving us Progressively Toward Communism.</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1356217340003</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 18:02:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've never been convinced those folks that become successful, that start a co., and create jobs, or even a co. whose offstpring was GIVEN the co., and became wealthy had a better life style than I had.

This is not true and simply speculation in your mind. In my community we made the decision that our children need to be safe and protected at school after a shooting incident on campus. It is the experience in my community that having armed police officers in school has been very effective as a deterent as they have confiscated several weapons including loaded guns and no further incidences of shootings or stabbings have occurred. My community continues to fund the program as it has been effective so people recognized the VALUE of having armed police in our schools. You choose to dismiss my remarks and pretend that proven programs aren't effective and that you and seventh graders know so. I can see why you are impressed by a letter from a 2nd grader who doesn't have any world experience or understanding. It's sad that people fall prey to emotional appeal that ends up clouding their ability to think and make good decisions. The fact that you launch into an argument about me wanting nuclear weapons illustrates your inability to #$%$ things in an adult manner. You should stick to reading 2nd grade thoughts on important matters. That's about as far as your thinking skills have evolved.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1356285315569</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 12:55:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356287159240-28</Id><Topic><Title>Clinton Pledges Funds to Add Police to Schools</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1356191962517</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 10:59:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I can see why you are impressed by a letter from a 2nd grader who doesn't have any world experience or understanding."

Death and war are not a casual event. Real shootings of humans include horrid sqealing and screaming, blood, guts and the associated memories for survivors. Duck or deer hunting are on an entirely different level. Artillary, bombing and drone strikes are even crueler and at even more horrid results level. Holding all of us private gun owners in America responsible for the safety of others and the proper storage of weapons should a minimum.

Description: Forwarded email / Viral text Circulating since: June 1999 Status: Transcription is authentic : Guess our national leaders didn't expect this, hmm? Darrell Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, a victim of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colorado, was invited to address the House Judiciary Committee's sub-committee. What he said to our national leaders during this special session of Congress was painfully truthful. They were not prepared for what he was to say, nor was it received well. It needs to be heard by every parent, every teacher, every politician, every sociologist, every psychologist, and every so-called expert! These courageous words spoken by Darrell Scott are powerful, penetrating, and deeply personal. There is no doubt that God sent this man as a voice crying in the wilderness. The following is a portion of the transcript: "Since the dawn of creation there has been both good &amp; evil in the hearts of men and women. We all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence. The death of my wonderful daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, and the deaths of that heroic teacher, and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain. Their blood cries out for answers." "The first recorded act of violence was when Cain slew his brother Abel out in the field. The villain was not the club he used. Neither was it the NCA, the National Club Association. The true killer was Cain, and the reason for the murder could only be found in Cain's heart. "In the days that followed the Columbine tragedy, I was amazed at how quickly fingers began to be pointed at groups such as the NRA. I am not a member of the NRA. I am not a hunter. I do not even own a gun. I am not here to represent or defend the NRA - because I don't believe that they are responsible for my daughter's death. Therefore I do not believe that they need to be defended. If I believed they had anything to do with Rachel's murder I would be their strongest opponent." "I am here today to declare that Columbine was not just a tragedy-it was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies! Much of the blame lies here in this room. Much of the blame lies behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselves. "I wrote a poem that expresses my feelings best. This was written way before I knew I would be speaking here today:" Your laws ignore our deepest needs, Your words are empty air. You've stripped away our heritage, You've outlawed simple prayer. Now gunshots fill our classrooms, And precious children die. You seek for answers everywhere, And ask the question "Why?" You regulate restrictive laws, Through legislative creed. And yet you fail to understand, That God is what we need! "Men and women are three-part beings. We all consist of body, soul, and spirit. When we refuse to acknowledge a third part of our make-up, we create a void that allows evil, prejudice, and hatred to rush in and reek havoc. Spiritual influences were present within our educational systems for most of our nation's history. Many of our major colleges began as theological seminaries. This is a historical fact. What has happened to us as a nation? We have refused to honor God, and in so doing, we open the doors to hatred and violence. And when something as terrible as Columbine's tragedy occurs politicians immediately look for a scapegoat such as the NRA. They immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws that contribute to erode away our personal and private liberties. We do not need more restrictive laws." Eric and Dylan would not have been stopped by metal detectors. No amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months planning this type of massacre. The real villain lies within our own hearts. Political posturing and restrictive legislation are not the answers. The young people of our nation hold the key. There is a spiritual awakening taking place that will not be squelched! We do not need more religion. We do not need more gaudy television evangelists spewing out verbal religious garbage. We do not need more million dollar church buildings built while people with basic needs are being ignored. We do need a change of heart and a humble acknowledgment that this nation was founded on the principle of simple trust in God!" "As my son Craig lay under that table in the school library and saw his two friends murdered before his very eyes, He did not hesitate to pray in school. I defy any law or politician to deny him that right! I challenge every young person in America, and around the world, to realize that on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School prayer was brought back to our schools. Do not let the many prayers offered by those students be in vain. Dare to move into the new millennium with a sacred disregard for legislation that violates your God-given right to communicate with Him. To those of you who would point your finger at the NRA- I give to you a sincere challenge. Dare to examine your own heart before casting the first stone! My daughter's death will not be in vain! The young people of this country will not allow that to happen!" Do what the media did not... let the nation hear this man's speech.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1356293703121</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 15:15:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356295043164-37</Id><Topic><Title>Progressives Moving us Progressively Toward Communism.</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1356217340003</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 18:02:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You frequently make make a distinction between government "benevolence" and "grand theft." when there is none.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1356295043164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 15:37:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356295818977-38</Id><Topic><Title>V-22 dumps crew member</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1356207937882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 15:25:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's without parachutes, add the parachutes and it a solid mass.

They hired almost everyone who came from North Dakota. we went from making a buck an hour back there to around 3.50 an hr. plus another 95 bucks to work the weekend at Boeing. More money than we could ever imagine. You could rent a nice one-bedroom apartment for a hundred bucks a month back then. A few years ago, when Boeing was still doing their own hiring, if you knew someone inside, there was a good chance you had a job. A good friend who taught me the garage door business, and the brother of the owner, finally saw the company close down. He applied at Boeing and the woman told him that he didn't have enough mechanical experience. Here's a guy that worked 10+ years installing garage doors, built his own house doing his own wiring and plumbing, who didn't have enough experience to get on at Boeing?? i did a spring change a few days earlier for a Boeing fork-lift supervisor, who lived in Kirkland. i called him and he told me to bring Rod over the next night. A week later, he was hired and worked driving fork-lifts until he could get into maintenance. A customer told me the other day that he paid out the 4500 bucks and is now working at Boeing. How many people are out there who don't have 450 bucks that would love to work at Boeing and work their butts off?? Why not give them jobs?? Another customer told me that he filled out 30 applications, before getting on. The current hiring system they have is nuts. You never want a computer to pick out and hire your people.

Karl Marx describes in his communist manifesto, the ten steps necessary to destroy a free enterprise system and replace it with a system of omnipotent government power, so as to effect a communist socialist state. Those ten steps are known as the Ten Planks of The Communist Manifesto… The following brief presents the original ten planks within the Communist Manifesto written by Karl Marx in 1848, along with the American adopted counterpart for each of the planks. From comparison it's clear MOST Americans have by myths, fraud and deception under the color of law by their own politicians in both the Republican and Democratic and parties, been transformed into Communists. Another thing to remember, Karl Marx in creating the Communist Manifesto designed these planks AS A TEST to determine whether a society has become communist or not. If they are all in effect and in force, then the people ARE practicing communists. Communism, by any other name is still communism, and is VERY VERY destructive to the individual and to the society!! The 10 PLANKS stated in the Communist Manifesto and some of their American counterparts are... 1. Abolition of private property and the application of all rents of land to public purposes. Americans do these with actions such as the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (1868), and various zoning, school &amp; property taxes. Also the Bureau of Land Management (Zoning laws are the first step to government property ownership) 2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. Americans know this as misapplication of the 16th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, 1913, The Social Security Act of 1936.; Joint House Resolution 192 of 1933; and various State "income" taxes. We call it "paying your fair share". 3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance. Americans call it Federal &amp; State estate Tax (1916); or reformed Probate Laws, and limited inheritance via arbitrary inheritance tax statutes. 4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels. Americans call it government seizures, tax liens, Public "law" 99-570 (1986); Executive order 11490, sections 1205, 2002 which gives private land to the Department of Urban Development; the imprisonment of "terrorists" and those who speak out or write against the "government" (1997 Crime/Terrorist Bill); or the IRS confiscation of property without due process. Asset forfeiture laws are used by DEA, IRS, ATF etc...). 5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. Americans call it the Federal Reserve which is a privately-owned credit/debt system allowed by the Federal Reserve act of 1913. All local banks are members of the Fed system, and are regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) another privately-owned corporation. The Federal Reserve Banks issue Fiat Paper Money and practice economically destructive fractional reserve banking. 6. Centralization of the means of communications and transportation in the hands of the State. Americans call it the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Department of Transportation (DOT) mandated through the ICC act of 1887, the Commissions Act of 1934, The Interstate Commerce Commission established in 1938, The Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Communications Commission, and Executive orders 11490, 10999, as well as State mandated driver's licenses and Department of Transportation regulations. 7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state, the bringing into cultivation of waste lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan. Americans call it corporate capacity, The Desert Entry Act and The Department of Agriculture… Thus read "controlled or subsidized" rather than "owned"… This is easily seen in these as well as the Department of Commerce and Labor, Department of Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Mines, National Park Service, and the IRS control of business through corporate regulations. 8. Equal liability of all to labor. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture. Americans call it Minimum Wage and slave labor like dealing with our Most Favored Nation trade partner; i.e. Communist China. We see it in practice via the Social Security Administration and The Department of Labor. The National debt and inflation caused by the communal bank has caused the need for a two "income" family. Woman in the workplace since the 1920's, the 19th amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, assorted Socialist Unions, affirmative action, the Federal Public Works Program and of course Executive order 11000. 9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries, gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country, by a more equitable distribution of population over the country. Americans call it the Planning Reorganization act of 1949 , zoning (Title 17 1910-1990) and Super Corporate Farms, as well as Executive orders 11647, 11731 (ten regions) and Public "law" 89-136. These provide for forced relocations and forced sterilization programs, like in China. 10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production. Americans are being taxed to support what we call 'public' schools, but are actually "government force-tax-funded schools " Even private schools are government regulated. The purpose is to train the young to work for the communal debt system. We also call it the Department of Education, the NEA and Outcome Based "Education" . These are used so that all children can be indoctrinated and inculcated with the government propaganda, like "majority rules", and "pay your fair share". WHERE are the words "fair share" in the Constitution, Bill of Rights or the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26)?? NO WHERE is "fair share" even suggested !! The philosophical concept of "fair share" comes from the Communist maxim, "From each according to their ability, to each according to their need! This concept is pure socialism. ... America was made the greatest society by its private initiative WORK ETHIC ... Teaching ourselves and others how to "fish" to be self sufficient and produce plenty of EXTRA commodities to if so desired could be shared with others who might be "needy"... Americans have always voluntarily been the MOST generous and charitable society on the planet. Do changing words, change the end result? ... By using different words, is it all of a sudden OK to ignore or violate the provisions or intent of the Constitution of the united States of America????? The people (politicians) who believe in the SOCIALISTIC and COMMUNISTIC concepts, especially those who pass more and more laws implementing these slavery ideas, are traitors to their oath of office and to the Constitution of the united States of America... KNOW YOUR ENEMY ...Remove the enemy from within and from among us. VOTE LIBERTARIAN, the only political party in America that still firmly supports and diligently abides by the Constitution of the united States of America.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1356304284904</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 18:11:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356306009645-46</Id><Topic><Title>Gena Wants No Nativity Displays in public</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1356299735505</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 16:55:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are living proof that "religion" and "hypocrisy" are synonomous.

Assault Rifle is a technical term to refer to a rifle that among other characteristics must support burst or full automatic fire. The AR-15 is a generic term for a sporting rifle that is designed to look and function like an M16 or M4, except that is semi-automatic only. The are several makers of the AR-15 style rifles and you can actually purchase the parts yourself and build one yourself. Most people hunt with bolt action rifles, but some people do hunt with an AR 15 or other semiautomatic rifles, where legal. The AR-15 shoots the .223 Remington (a sporting round) or slightly more powerful 5.56x45mm NATO round. The .223 Rem is often used for target shooting, varmint hunting, and occasionally deer hunting. The .223 Remington is actually LESS powerful than must deer hunting cartridges. You can buy an AR15 in any gun store and in many sporting good stores. Walmart's the sell guns often have a Bushmaster version in stock:</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356309845256</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 19:44:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356310079273-61</Id><Topic><Title>Do States Have the Right to Secede?</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1356108413857</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 11:46:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Federal Government gets it mone from the "Mandrake Mechanism" whereby Money is LOANED INTO EXISTENTCE magically by the Federal Resere....they are PRIVATE bankers that operate globally with absolutely NO LOYALTY to the United States.....SO....If any state secedes from the Union they need to coin their own money....or they will be, in short oreder, in debt to private bankers.....The Constituion, had it been follwed, and CONGRESS actually controlled teh issuance of the currency, we would not be in this problem.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356310079273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 19:47:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356310496609-62</Id><Topic><Title>The True Definition of the Word "Hopelessness"</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1356275938070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:18:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won.
