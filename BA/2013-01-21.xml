Where then was the C-suite while these risks were being incurred? An interview in 2011 with Philip Condit, who was CEO of Boeing when the initial 787 decisions were being made, is revealing. In 2001, under Condit’s leadership, Boeing moved its headquarters from Seattle to Chicago, a decision continued by Condit’s successor, James McNerney. The ostensible reason for the move was to be neutral among the various divisions of Boeing, which were scattered around the US. In the interview, Condit makes no secret of another factor: as CEO, he didn’t want to be bothered with tiresome “how-do-you-design-an-airplane stuff,” or boring meetings with Boeing’s key customers (airlines) who came to Seattle. After the move, Condit says that he spent much of his time in the Chicago business community, where he “encountered CEOs frequently gathering to nail down civic goals ranging from landing new companies to building world-class parks. ‘I was surprised by how much that happened,’ Condit said. ‘A meeting in which Starbucks, Microsoft, Costco, Boeing and Weyerhaeuser and a bunch of small businesses are all in the same place — rarely happens in Seattle,” he added. ‘It happened all the time in Chicago.’” So while Boeing’s CEO was in Chicago, strategizing about the future of Boeing and discussing civic goals with CEOs from other companies, the managers back in Seattle were making business decisions about tiresome “how-do-you-design-an-airplane stuff” that would determine whether there would be a firm to strategize about.</Msg><Username>dellhead.geo</Username><Timestamp>1358757940075</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 03:45:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358757992057-14</Id><Title>Boeing Management is in denial about the 787 grounding very scary , safety is unimportant</Title><Msg>You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone at Boeing who believes the FAA should have grounded it,” said a former top executive, who asked for anonymity in speaking about his former colleagues. “They all believe the airplane is safe.” But an executive in charge of fleet planning for a major airline that has 787s on order expressed astonishment that Boeing has seemed to minimize what he sees as potentially critical incidents. “At no stage have they appeared to be open to admitting the seriousness of what’s happened,” the executive said. “They are basically still in denial.” This is another Ford pinto gas tank denial issue, money over safety of the flying public, if it is a Boeing 787 firestarter then I am not going.

Then just days after unveiling the review, an All Nippon Airways (ANA) 787 was forced to make an emergency landing in western Japan when a battery overheated and spewed hot chemicals and soot into the electronics bay.

It means that you aren't a servant of the tribe, or the king, or the church, or society, but that morally and politically you have a right to pursue your own happiness. But how do you achieve happiness? Part of Rand's argument is that other people are a tremendous value to an individualist: as teachers, friends, trading partners, lovers. But the key to successful human relationships, she argues, is that there should be no sacrifice of anyone to anyone. Whereas Obama advocates that we subordinate our 'self-development' in order to 'make sure everybody else has opportunity,' Rand says that we should all aim at our own rational self-interest, and deal with others as traders, offering value-for-value. Unlike the President, Rand doesn’t confuse ‘caring for others’ with having the government forcibly redistribute your wealth to others. She recognizes that our main obligation to other people is to respect their freedom. The President is pulling the same old trick that collectivists have been pulling for the last hundred fifty years. Rather than openly defend the proposition that you have a duty to serve society, he misrepresents and smears individualism. Contra Obama, what Ayn Rand appeals to is youthful idealism. We grow up being told that our duty in life is to surrender our happiness for the sake of others. Rand’s message is not ‘Forget other people and do whatever your feel like.’ No. Her message is that morality matters, truth matters, your life matters—and nothing is more noble than making the most of that life. That is why so many young people respond to her works.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358770857132</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 07:20:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358772633032-26</Id><Topic><Title>NBC Special Report: No assault rifle was used at Sandy Hook</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358714045776</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 15:34:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you a fan of Judy Garland?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1358772633032</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 07:50:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358774706542-27</Id><Topic><Title>Dreamliner probe widens after excess battery voltage ruled out</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358737388990</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 22:03:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey- thet there gummint - beaurocrats, black heliocopters, soshulism, tryin to git our guns etc etc are you a paragon to be admired and looked up to or what there bulky</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1358774706542</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 08:25:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358774823218-28</Id><Topic><Title>Dreamliner probe widens after excess battery voltage ruled out</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358737388990</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 22:03:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey Dell George Boeing is going to find the problem today or tomorrow and fix it on the spot. little bit of luck and you will lose your shirt once again on your BA shorts tough titty as they say eh HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR H</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1358774823218</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 08:27:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358775438292-29</Id><Topic><Title>NBC Special Report: No assault rifle was used at Sandy Hook</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358714045776</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 15:34:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Am I a fan of Judy Garland ? not really...more a fan of the fictional charachter Dorothy and her silver slippers in the novel.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358775438292</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 08:37:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358775778070-30</Id><Topic><Title>‘Why me ?’ : Dealing with self-pity from a Buddhist perspective</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358734593920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 21:16:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very wise words......very wise</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358775778070</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 08:42:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358776382672-31</Id><Topic><Title>NBC Special Report: No assault rifle was used at Sandy Hook</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358714045776</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 15:34:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's all that inbreeding they do out in the welfare states.

Corruption at the highest level.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1358778462578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 09:27:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358779028399-33</Id><Topic><Title>Solution to the Gun Debate</Title><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1358714016675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 15:33:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... they keep shooting themselves in the foot !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358779028399</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 09:37:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358779084333-34</Id><Topic><Title>Ayn Rand is for children</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1358634137344</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:22:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are all the "hers" and "shes" in quote marks?</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1358779084333</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 09:38:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358779338680-35</Id><Topic><Title>What has the NRA done for America !!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358548136299</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:28:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On January 11, Pratt said on a radio show that Obama should be impeached if he uses an executive order to restrict gun rights. Pratt has also said that legislation denying firearms to the dangerously mentally ill was "a dictatorial power" that "they use[d] ... in Nazi Germany." Pratt was removed as national co-chair of Pat Buchanan's 1996 presidential campaign after his associations with white supremacists were revealed. Pratt also served as a contributing editor of a publication described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as anti-Semitic. On Fox &amp; Friends, John Velleco, GOA's director of federal affairs, falsely claimed: "Every time a state tries to relax concealed carry laws, we hear the Chicken Littles of the world saying that blood is going to flow in the streets, and it just doesn't happen. In fact, crime doesn't go up, crime goes down, because criminals don't know who is carrying a firearm to defend themselves. Velleco also suggested that gun owners should be allowed to carry their weapons at events where the president of the United States is speaking. Michael Hammond, GOA's legislative counsel, warned that a "government psychiatrist" could determine who is allowed to possess a gun, citing the example of returning Iraq War veterans who are not allowed to have guns due to post-traumatic stress disorder.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358779338680</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 09:42:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358779467079-36</Id><Topic><Title>Solution to the Gun Debate</Title><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1358714016675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 15:33:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Had to be a braindead liberal post.

Read up on it a little and then think about this passage: "The notion of Karma and re-birth was used by C. S. Jung to draw parallel to his theory of ‘archetypes’, a dynamic substrata of human experience in which humans are born into, thus giving rise to individual characteristics and psychological traits. (2) The source of these inherited archetypes arises in Jung’s view not from one’s personal Karma, but that from one’s ancestors." It's scary that Jung a man born in 1875 could envision a concept/construct of ‘archetypes’/Karma that parallels the epigenome. This is a great example of how an awakened mind sees what is unseen by others (Plato's Allegory of the cave). Is the ripple effect from earlier ancestors the cause of Jung's awareness? Is it the reason modern science was led to the epigenome? Bakes your noodle, doesn't it? ;-)</Msg><Username>hooschtick_hertz</Username><Timestamp>1358782361197</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 10:32:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358782448950-53</Id><Title>The Last time Boeing hit 150</Title><Msg>Was moons ago.

State Sen. Kelvin Atkinson said Sunday he informed Kirkpatrick of Brooks' threat against her. Atkinson said Brooks had been telling people Kirkpatrick's "first day as speaker would be her last." North Las Vegas police said Brooks, 40, was booked about 6 p.m. at the Las Vegas City Jail on a felony charge of intimidating a public officer by threat of physical violence. Jail records show Brooks was in custody Sunday evening. Brooks is a Democrat serving Nevada Assembly District 17 in northern Clark County. Police said they responded to a home in North Las Vegas at about 3:45 p.m. Saturday in response to reported threats to an elected official, though authorities would not say who Brooks reportedly threatened. A Nevada legislator who requested anonymity said Kirkpatrick was shaken but doing fine. Kirkpatrick is a North Las Vegas Democrat who was recently elected speaker. Brooks was arrested without incident during a traffic stop near Carey Avenue and Mount Hood Street. A law enforcement source said a gun was found in Brooks' car.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358785135630</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:18:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358785267450-63</Id><Topic><Title>‘Why me ?’ : Dealing with self-pity from a Buddhist perspective</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358734593920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 21:16:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's another grand, world-wide conspiracy that you have uncovered.

But I disagree that we are raised to feel we must give up everything to help others. We've been known for decades as the 'me first' society. But even a person who dedicates a lot to the betterment of society can still be quite an individual, with all the freedoms that entails. Being less selfish does not have to mean being less of an individual. It does not mean one has to be a communist or a socialist. The noticeable thing about a lot of people who admire Rand's thoughts is they tend to forget the part about respecting others. A lot of the most individual people are the homeless, living life their way, but some of the most prominent admirers of Rand's thoughts despise the homeless.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1358786469042</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:41:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358786932028-69</Id><Topic><Title>"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358783197758</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 10:46:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a crock, Biden promising to defend the Constitution against all enemies when Obama is its enemy.</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1358786932028</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:48:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358787110660-70</Id><Topic><Title>"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358783197758</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 10:46:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You should be extra scared right now.

It’s only actions that matter when it comes to being judged, right? Merely thinking something doesn’t mean you’re going to act on it, right? Enter Barack Obama and his 23 executive orders issued last week. (And don’t forget New York mafia Governor Cuomo and his new “psychiatric police” law.) Suddenly merely thinking about doing something violent or dangerous can cause all your constitutional rights to be stripped away by the state. Here’s how it works: If you’re seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist and you say something that might be considered violent — “I can’t stand my boss and I wish he would just die!” — under Obama’s executive orders the psychiatrist must now report you to the government as a possible danger to society. This is done in complete violation of doctor-patient confidentiality, of course. Once the government receives this information, it then conducts a raid on the home of the person in question, seizes his or her firearms, and places that person on a “no gun buy” list maintained by the FBI, completely outside of law and due process.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358787868589</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 12:04:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358788087334-77</Id><Topic><Title>Would Adam Lanza have made it into the Obama girls' school?</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358722171794</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 17:49:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is a Breitbart lie that there are armed guards at that school.

As far as the pps is concerned there are more issues to factor in than this monster. The engineers contract and the debt ceiling are all going to weigh on the pps this quarter. Usually I play earnings and do well, but this is the first time I am out 100% and will remain out for the next several months. I do this rarely, but the performance under McNernney has been dismal. Go back to see that we were in the mid 50's the last time the debt ceiling was a problem and Moody's downgraded the US. Another action by Moody's and I could see it happen again and couple that to the labor issue alone make me gun shy here. The fix may be very costly for the company and I don't have the confidence in Chicago to manage it any better than they have managed the pps and the execution so far. They are buying back shares as quickly as they can so I don't think the got a pass as you think., last week. Just how many shares they will continue to buy to support the pps is anyone's guess, but I will wait until spring and have a much better understanding of these issues. Hoping it's over soon and the company sustains minimal damage for all, but Chicago's execution is still an issue, and by that I mean "dog of the DOW".

These are mentaly and emotionally damaged people. They do not work towards mindful self-development as individualists but instead persue a self-destructive path of mindless existence. These are flawed humans who have no interest in fixing themselves nor any interest in contributing to the "betterment of society" to use your words for whatever they mean to you. In another post I mentioned Russian Philosopher G. I. Gurdjieff who sees selfishness far different from the negative version that modern Western society has put forward. Modern Americans have never known the tyranny and fear that that people like Gurdjieff or Rand as a young girl in Russia faced. Selfishness has a completely different meaning to them and was a very positive tool for developing a strong mind to overcome the intolerance of a corrupt statist government system that destroyed individual thought, creativity, religious freedom, etc. That is why the 37 year old silver spoon in the mouth Norhteastern yuppy author that Hooz admires, has no chance of understanding Ayn Rand. No matter how educated Sirota is he can't comprehend what a simple immigrant who lived under communism or totalitarianism gets immediately in hearing Ayn Rands words.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358793279964</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 13:34:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358793360160-105</Id><Title>Collectivism Versus Individualism</Title><Msg>"Collectivism is a form of anthropomorphism.

It’s the human equivalent of a puppy dog’s face: an evolutionary tool designed to enhance survival, reproductive value and status. In short, liberalism is based on one central desire: to look cool in front of others in order to get love. Preaching tolerance makes you look cooler, than saying something like, “please lower my taxes” — Greg Gutfeld 1) Most liberals are hateful people. Who are the most hateful people you can think of off the top of your head? If you're not a liberal, the first people that probably come to mind are the God hates #$%$ lunatics from Fred Phelps' Westboro Baptist Church. What type of human beings would do sick protests at funerals? Well, liberals have their own version of this. Whenever a prominent conservative gets sick or dies, there's an orgy of celebratory hatred on the Left. It happened with Reagan, Breitbart and every other big name conservative in between. Bill Maher, Barney Frank, Michael Moore, Keith Olbermann, Amanda Marcotte, Ed Schultz, Dan Savage, Ted Rall, Al Sharpton, etc., etc. are some of the most hate-filled people you'll ever run into outside of a maximum security prison, but liberals consider it to be okay because their hate is aimed at conservatives, who are acceptable targets. This is why liberals felt perfectly comfortable attacking Sarah Palin's children, harassing Michelle Malkin's family until they had to move, and publicly posting the addresses of ordinary citizens who opposed Prop 8. They're hate-filled people who are constantly accusing EVERYONE ELSE of behaving the way they do on a daily basis. So, if you want to find the most hate-filled people in America, look for a liberal lecturing other people about how important it is not to hate people and you're practically guaranteed to be looking at a hate-filled person. 2) Liberals do more than any other group to encourage race-based hatred. It's amazing how much we still hear about Nazis and the KKK, even though they're both marginalized, nearly powerless groups of misfits and losers. On the other hand, how marginalized are the hatemongers on the Left? MEChA is allowed in public schools, Al Sharpton is on TV every night, and Democratic congressmen are still willing to appear on stage with Louis Farrakhan. But that's no surprise because promoting racial strife at every opportunity is an actual Democratic campaign strategy. Almost the entire message of the Democratic Party to large swathes of the electorate is, "Everybody who doesn't look like you hates you except us." There are plenty of liberals who have jobs almost solely because they're willing to incessantly shout "racism" to help the Democratic Party. We even have groups of professional grievance mongers like CAIR, La Raza, and the New Black Panther Party that work incessantly to stir up race hatred because it's good for fund raising and gives them a reason to justify their existence. If the Nazi Party or the KKK had tried to come up with a system to keep people hating each other based on skin color, they couldn't have ever created anything as effective as the one liberals have now implemented. 3) Most liberals are less moral than other people. You won't see liberals being accused of being hypocritical if it turns out that they don't have "good family values," commit adultery, or don't live up to their Christian beliefs because they don't really buy into any of those things. Liberals incessantly attack the church and they seldom talk about morals because if they have no morals, then no one can ever accuse them of being hypocrites. This is also why liberals feel so comfortable lying about conservatives. The standard with liberal blogs, papers, and cable news outlets isn't accuracy; it is doing damage to conservatives. It's considered perfectly acceptable amongst liberals to lie about conservatives, Christians, and anybody else who gets in the way of liberalism. The problem for liberals is that you can't smear and mock people for believing in morals, traditions, and family values while simultaneously credibly claiming to have them yourself. 4) Most liberals don't care if the policies they advocate work or not. This may seem like an alien concept to a lot of people, but liberals don't push policies based on whether they improve people's lives or not. To the contrary, liberals support policies that make them feel good about themselves or alternately, help cement liberals in power. This is why liberals don't care whether tax revenues go up after a tax cut, whether high taxes on the rich kill jobs, or how high your gas prices go because they don't want to drill. To liberals, a policy that kills millions but makes them feel good about themselves is a win, not a loss. See the Left's cut- off of military aid to South Vietnam for one example of that and their opposition to the use of DDT, which is needlessly killing 1.5 million people a year in Africa. Conservatives would be happy to reverse that ban, but it makes liberals falsely feel like they're good environmentalists to keep it in place; so all those poor people in Africa have to die for no reason other than to prop up the fragile self esteem of pampered left-wingers here in the United States. 5) Most liberals are extremely intolerant. Liberals talk incessantly about tolerance and yet they lash out whenever anyone dares to present a view that doesn't toe the liberal line. Conservative college speakers usually need extra security because budding liberal fascists often try to shout them down or assault them. Liberals desperately try to censor talk radio, which they don't even listen to, because they can't stand the idea that someone else is allowed to have a contrary opinion. Why do you think liberals get so upset about a conservative-leaning news station like Fox News, when ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, and CNN all lean to the left? It's because liberals don't think people should be allowed to have an opinion that differs from their own. Amazingly, if you listen to liberals, you'll find that they don't even understand what tolerance is in the first place. Actual tolerance means that you realize people have different practices and views and even if you don't agree, you understand that they should have the ability to live as they choose, just as you should have the leeway to live as you choose. On the other hand, liberals have a fascistic view of tolerance, which really isn't surprising since liberalism and fascism are merely different branches of the same tree. To liberals, tolerance is, by definition, whatever their opinion happens to be. So, to be tolerant, you have to agree with them. People who don't even know what tolerance is shouldn't be lecturing everyone else on the subject.

Is that wrong?" Yes. To take money out of your own pocket to help the needy is noble, to take money out of another man's pocket to help the needy is theft. "Once one accepts the principle of self-ownership, what's moral and immoral becomes self-evident. Murder is immoral because it violates private property. Rape and theft are also immoral -- they also violate private property. Here's an important question: Would rape become morally acceptable if Congress passed a law legalizing it? You say: "What's wrong with you, Williams? Rape is immoral plain and simple, no matter what Congress says or does!" If you take that position, isn't it just as immoral when Congress legalizes the taking of one person's earnings to give to another? Surely if a private person took money from one person and gave it to another, we'd deem it theft and, as such, immoral. Does the same act become moral when Congress takes people's money to give to farmers, airline companies or an impoverished family? No, it's still theft, but with an important difference: It's legal, and participants aren't jailed." -- Walter Williams</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358796323902</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 14:25:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358796473837-130</Id><Topic><Title>5 Uncomfortable Truths About Liberals</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358795855564</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 14:17:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>father_zosima ....Thanks for proving the point of the post.

Boeing shareholders, there is a host of other troubling problems that spring from the original conception of the 787. In the past, Boeing has outsourced manufacturing but maintained tight control over design. In that way, Boeing was able to make sure that the pieces that other companies made would fit together well because Boeing engineers understood what each part would do and how they would interact when the plane was flying. But with the 787, Boeing departed from this approach. Instead — to save money and supposedly to boost quality and speed time to market — Boeing outsourced 60% of the design and manufacture to suppliers. This shifted the investment on to the suppliers who would only get paid once airlines started paying for the 787s. But it also meant that each supplier of, say, the wings or the batteries that supplied power to the engines or auxiliary systems, would use their own approach to both the design and the manufacture. For its part, Boeing assumed that its suppliers would share its commitment to quality and meeting ambitious delivery deadlines. But this did not happen and the 787 missed at least seven deadlines or 3.5 years late and went way over budget, about 30 billion dollars. Furthermore, the 787 is made of carbon fiber material, rather than aluminum. This means that it should be lighter and able to maintain higher cabin humidity which improves air quality for passengers. Using carbon fiber also means that Boeing has no previous experience with how the material behaves in flight. So it is hard to build software that will predict how, for example, the wing will maintain its hold on the fuselage during flight. Moreover, reports from a Boeing worker back in 2009 described, the problems with the 787′s electrical and environmental control systems. The electrical system — that includes GS Yuasa’s lithium-ion battery – is manufactured by French company Thales SA, according to Reuters. These problems are continuing to cost Boeing plenty. For example, Bloomberg estimates the price tag at $550 million for Boeing shareholders to compensate airlines that have lost business thanks to pulling the 787 out of service. But it does not require a huge amount of imagination to suggest that the cost of the 787 to Boeing could rise much higher. After all, public statements by airlines suggest that they have confidence in the 787′s long-term future. But what if the airlines and Boeing are now scrambling underneath the surface to investigate and fix a whole host of problems with the 787 whose purported 20% fuel savings offered a big profitability boost to the long-suffering airline industry? Meanwhile, the time it is likely to take to thoroughly investigate and fix the battery problem alone ought to ground the 787 for months. This could extend the time period over which Boeing must pay compensation to the airlines. But those costs are nothing compared to the cost to Boeing’s reputation if the 787′s problems end up causing passenger injury or death. Hopefully, Boeing will bear in mind one of the lessons of the Titanic — don’t push a new technology beyond its limits.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358798223906</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 14:57:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358798450260-144</Id><Topic><Title>97% of illigal gun violence in the US is in African American neighborhoods</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358787530979</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:58:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why try Stalin's approach?</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358798450260</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 15:00:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358798604154-145</Id><Topic><Title>Dreamliner probe widens after excess battery voltage ruled out</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358737388990</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 22:03:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One expert told KING 5 News that it would essentially take a double charge in order to get the batteries to the point where cells inside burst, venting electrolytic fluid, resulting in smoke and flame. But a quick solution is not in the offing. A source close to the investigation says Boeing had no real proposal in front of the FAA right now, and that there is no time frame for a fix. It does not appear the batteries themselves are defective. Another source confirmed again Friday that the FAA won’t be satisfied with an interim solution. “Those planes aren’t going to fly until we are 1,000 percent sure that they’re safe to fly.” Said U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood this morning. KIng5: Is Japan moving too slowly in 787 probe? HAR HAR HAR BOEING has no clue. They are putting pressure on the Japan investigation team to solve THEIR problem.

"You and I are literally surrounded. The gun-grabbers in the Senate are about to launch an all-out-assault on the Second Amendment. On your rights. On your freedom," reads the opening of the email, according to The Hill. "[T]hey're coming for your guns," the email exhorts. Last week, President Barack Obama unveiled a comprehensive set of initiatives meant to combat gun violence. Alongside 23 executive actions, Obama also announced his intention to press congressional lawmakers to introduce a set of measures, including a renewed assault weapons ban and restriction on large-capacity ammunition magazines. Following Obama's announcement, McConnell said he'd take a tempered approach to judging the effort against gun violence, declaring that the “first test of any new legislation” would be “whether or not it infringes on the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms.” The Kentucky Republican has apparently decided that the president's proposals would violate the Second Amendment. Over the weekend, he sent out a telephone recording to supporters in his home state, promising to fight Obama's new campaign "tooth and nail." "President Obama and his team are doing everything in their power to restrict your Constitutional right to keep and bear arms," McConnell said in the recording. "Their efforts to restrict your rights, invading your personal privacy and overstepping their bounds with executive orders, is just plain wrong."</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358798653098</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 15:04:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358798724505-148</Id><Topic><Title>Seven Reporters Who Falsely Claimed that "Obama Signed 23 Executive Orders"</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1358789720002</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 12:35:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>After 8 wasted years of Bushleague, during which the US was essentially leaderless, our GOP friends seem to have forgotten what it means to have a LEADER.

Appearing before Obama's National Finance Committee and various business leaders, Clinton stressed that guns present different cultural complexities than other political issues. "Do not patronize the passionate supporters of your opponents by looking down your nose at them," he said, according to Politico. Clinton's words are wise, but it may be too late. The Obama campaign team has already been converted and activated to attack the National Rifle Association and its 4.4 million members. The Obama administration has essentially told the country that anyone who doesn't support Obama's gun control agenda isn't practicing "common sense." The nearly 90 million gun owners in the country have also been classified as "fringe" by liberal politicians and the media. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has also cautioned Obama on the issue because like Clinton, was around in 1994 to see Democrats get walloped in the House as a result of the assault weapons ban legislation.

A question: are the RPDUs (remote power distribution units) and the passenger convenience outlets de-energized when the engines are off? Perhaps the ground crew are plugging their vacuum cleaners (commercial/heavy duty) into the passenger convenience outlets (rated at less than ten amps). While rated at up to 10 amps, the system design "usage" assumption was for a few tens of watts (phone and computer battery charging). Some heavy-duty vacuum cleaners are rated at up to 12 amps. One of the fires occurred while the ground crew were servicing the airplane (Boston's Logan Airport). Even if you tell the people NOT to do something, there is always those that will figure, "what difference does it make?" The APU was energized at the time of the fire (according to investigators). The APU feeds into the 230 VAC distribution which then feeds into the 115 VAC distribution and the passenger convenience outlets (via the RPDUs). So, unless there is a specific capability to de-energize the passenger convenience outlets on the ground, the ground crew could initiate (inadvertently) a rapid discharge of the APU's battery. It is easy to focus on over-charging and ignore excessive discharging.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1358805095083</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:51:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358805263103-190</Id><Topic><Title>President with the lowest approval rating in our nations history is re-elected?</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1358805112526</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:51:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does that say about Romney?</Msg><Username>dellhead.geo</Username><Timestamp>1358805263103</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:54:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358805282167-191</Id><Topic><Title>President with the lowest approval rating in our nations history is re-elected?</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1358805112526</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:51:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its a good day to be an American</Msg><Username>dellhead.geo</Username><Timestamp>1358805282167</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:54:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358805750765-192</Id><Topic><Title>Allop</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1358727643078</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 19:20:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'd love to have a drink with you , Goth-chick ; but meanwhile , is there no vampyric board where you can hang out amongst your peers ??</Msg><Username>fmrdownestr</Username><Timestamp>1358805750765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 17:02:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358805846547-193</Id><Topic><Title>President with the lowest approval rating in our nations history is re-elected?</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1358805112526</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:51:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love breathing the air in the free WEST.</Msg><Username>dellhead.geo</Username><Timestamp>1358805846547</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 17:04:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358805958784-194</Id><Topic><Title>Solution to the Gun Debate</Title><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1358714016675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 15:33:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmm, seem to have touched a nerve.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1358805958784</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 17:05:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358806074904-195</Id><Title>Assault Weapons Ban is Not the Answer</Title><Msg>I'll make a prediction regarding "assault weapon" bans and 10-round limits in magazines. If they're passed, neither will make a bit of difference. As regards "assault weapons," realistically, that horse has long since left the barn. There are millions of these rifles already out there, and more being sold each day. Thus, unless you want to debate confiscation or a mandatory turn-in (good luck with either one), the point is already settled. We couldn't control alcohol during Prohibition, and let's see a show of hands from those who believe we've got illegal drugs under control. The same would be true for these rifles. Further, what's being pointed at is purely cosmetic and cosmetics, in a rifle, don't kill. A pistol grip won't kill you. Nor will barrel shrouds, bayonet lugs, collapsible stocks, accessory rails, laser pointers, flashlights, or what have you. At the end of the day, these are still simply semi-automatic rifles. Nothing more. Nothing less. What does kill, as noted in another column, is "what," "how quickly," and "how many" are coming out of the muzzle and headed your way. And, there, we meet with the 10-round magazine capacity which is, basically, pointless as currently proposed. Pointless, unless you re-design the rifle so as to make reloading (and detachable magazines don't help with this) a much slower process. Talk with any experienced firearms owner and they'll explain how anyone with access to electrical tape can marry two or three detachable magazines together and, voilà!, we're back to 30 rounds which can be brought into action in the space of seconds. Further, with high-capacity magazines (for which I don't see a need), you have the same problem as with the military-look-alike rifles. The horse and barn scenario. There are millions already out there and they're not going to disappear either. Like it or not, that's the reality of the situation. As for the executive orders -- universal background checks, better/quicker exchange of information between law enforcement agencies, attempting to get our mental health programs into better shape, research into the causes of gun violence, etc., -- many of the steps may help, sorely need to be tried, and some are, in fact, long overdue. herald news</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358806074904</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 17:07:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358806127878-196</Id><Topic><Title>President with the lowest approval rating in our nations history is re-elected?</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1358805112526</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:51:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>His low approval rating just shows racism is alive in America.</Msg><Username>zachattack1041</Username><Timestamp>1358806127878</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 17:08:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358806263135-197</Id><Topic><Title>The greatest day in American history</Title><Username>zachattack1041</Username><Timestamp>1358804665181</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:44:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Congratulations Mr. President and to our lovely first lady the beautiful Michelle.</Msg><Username>zachattack1041</Username><Timestamp>1358806263135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 17:11:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358806532683-198</Id><Title>On Martin Luther King Day...Barry Soetoro retakes the oath of Office</Title><Msg>Martin Luther King who knew the measure of freedom for an oppressed race...did not live to see a Black man in he Whitehouse...but its just as well.

But President Obama's target is not simply the Republican Party: it is the Constitution itself, and the values of liberty that it enshrines. In the address itself, President Obama made the case that liberty is not timeless; that it must adjust to the times, and that "preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action"--not to defend those freedoms from infringement, but to give them "meaning" through government regulation and redistribution. White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer put the point more bluntly in remarks published earlier today: “There’s a moment of opportunity now that’s important,” Pfeiffer said. “What’s frustrating is that we don’t have a political system or an opposition party worthy of the opportunity.” Note the contempt in Pfeiffer's words--not just for the political opposition, but for the political system itself--a system designed by the Framers to include checks and balances to hold government power firmly in check. Pfeiffer's contempt is widely shared by the clique of media barons and political entrepreneurs that put him in office. As Joel Kotkin writes today, Barack Obama is both the creation and culmination of a new "power class" that shares the impatience of early twentieth century progressives with the democratic process, and prefers a technocratic model that Obama has emulated through his extra-political, executive-order-style management. A year ago, President Obama observed: "[I]t turns out our Founders designed a system that makes it more difficult to bring about change that I would like sometimes." Back then, facing re-election, he promised to be patient. Today, he is impatient--with the opposition, and the system itself. He will destroy both, if necessary, to achieve his vision of America--one where "government alone" does not do everything, but rather dictates to individuals what they should do, and choose, and want, to serve its sweeping designs.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358811471767</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 18:37:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358811509045-230</Id><Topic><Title>On Martin Luther King Day...Barry Soetoro retakes the oath of Office</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358806532683</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 17:15:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump!</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358811509045</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 18:38:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358811670407-231</Id><Topic><Title>Obamas target is NOT Republicans but the CONSTITUTION ITSELF !!!!!!!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358811471767</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 18:37:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Note the contempt in Pfeiffer's words" I didn't see any contempt in his words.</Msg><Username>instant_karma48</Username><Timestamp>1358811670407</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 18:41:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358811683544-232</Id><Title>Is this the Day Democrats Hoped for - Or is there another day?</Title><Msg>It is Well Established that Obama's Father Was a Communist It's well established that Obama admired His Father's Political leanings.

What is it you are upset about ? healthcare because that's what seem to get the T-party's knickers in a bunch. OK the major countries of the world have government led healthcare systems from Switzerland to Israel to Rwanda The list is to long to post here but it will take you 5 minutes to look up. They spend 1/2 of what we spend and are healthier and live longer(well maybe not in Rwanda but tons of the other countries). Obamacare was a GOP idea until Obama liked it then they hated it ---which is one reason (among many) I think you rednecks are acting like a bunch of 9 year olds. Obama care was designed to allow the working poor to contribute an affordable amount to the system in return for healthcare. At the moment you (assuming you have a job and aren't some OXY addict on disability)and I pay all the bills for the people with no insurance who have baby's or heart attacks or the flu. We subsidize companies like Wal-mart and Papa Johns who don't bother buying insurance for their employees ( I know you going to say illegals ---and yes we pay for them to but I never hear you guys talking about paying for the legal low wage employees) We pay for all of them. Personally I spend 25% of my after tax income on healthcare. In Israel I would pay 8% and get better care so what I see is a bunch of ignorant rednecks who seem unable to put together a coherent thought stealing thousands of dollar from me every year. We have great public healthcare business models in the US with our VA. It's incredibly stupid not to use what we've learned there for all of our citizens and it's your fault we don't so I pretty much hate you for being as dumb as you are.</Msg><Username>auntie_theresa</Username><Timestamp>1358813124946</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 19:05:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358813211902-243</Id><Topic><Title>Martin Luther King:................

I will give you this one free , the six mismanagment enablers don't care they think by identification with boeing mangment they have power and are important. . For those that think the 787 is going to take Boeing down! by defense_junky.Jan 21, 2013 3:16 PM.Permalink . The last aircraft built by Boeing has never had a major crash. Yes, I'm talking about the 777. The 787 is a nightmare because Boing is trying to work with new materials. Boeing is an innovator of new technology and when all is said and done, the aerospace industry will hail Boeing as a great company that brought VERY new technology to the plate!.Bank on it!! " Notice how this guy forgets to state the reason the 777 was a success was it was 100% designed by Boeing engineers and the company control was 100%. No outsourced designs. Now to compare the 777 and to contrast. The 777 cost less than the 767 to engineer in house by SPEEA than the actual cost to outsource on the 787. The 777 was delivered on time and within budget , 100% of the parts were made per Boeing specifications. The 777 was not grounded in fact the last plane to be grounded by the FAA was over 30 years ago and it too was another MD plane only this MD plane is a MD-GT- managment plane with a boeing logo on the side. The 787 is not a Boeing plane other than the name.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358821227244</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 21:20:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358821380850-285</Id><Topic><Title>Official Texas Sheriff's Exam</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358820744418</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 21:12:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL...thats great...I have one 3 people are taking a dump in a Kent Bathouse George Bush, Barrack Obama and an out of work reporter sponging off the Government from all three stalls one can hear the sounds of high speed power grunting followed by silence....

How much money does it take to really make a full clip? 9/11, Building 7, did they really pull it?” “…Rush Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist, Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say s**t. That’s why I ain’t vote for him, next one either, I’m a part of the problem, my problem is I’m peaceful and I believe in the people.” When the rapper extended and continued to play the anti-war themed song, the microphones were cut and the lights shut off. Then security personnel jumped on the stage and asked Fiasco to leave. The event organisers denied that the political nature of the performance was the reason for the intervention, stating “We are staunch supporters of free speech, and free political speech. This was not about his opinions. Instead, after a bizarrely repetitive, jarring performance that left the crowd vocally dissatisfied, organizers decided to move on to the next act.” However, those in attendance at the StartUp RockOn concert were in no doubt as to why Fiasco had been shown the exit. “Lupe Fiasco just got thrown off stage here at the Hamilton Live after he went on an anti-Obama diatribe mid set.” tweeted Josh Rogin, a reporter with Foreign Policy magazine. “So Lupe played one anti-war song for 30 min and said he didn’t vote for Obama,” Rogin added, ”and eventually was told to move on to the next song…Lupe refused to move to the next song so a team of security guards came on stage and told him to go.” Other attendees concurred: “Things going terribly wrong at @lupefiasco performance during#SURO. Kicked off stage, bashing obama…” tweeted Matt Dornic, a CNN Worldwide PR director. “#SURO slammed by @lupefiasco’s nonstop, anti-obama rap. Corporate sponsors scurrying.” Dornic added. Fiasco, whose father was a prominent member of the Black Panther Party, was a known risky booking for the event organisers, given his past criticisms directed toward Obama. Last year the rapper hit headlines with an anti-drone tirade, openly calling the president a child murderer: “You have someone who is a great speaker, but kills little children – our President,” he said during an interview with Philadelphia radio station Power 99FM. “I’m talking about ordering a drone attack. Ordering drone attacks that go and kill mothers, innocent bystanders, children. Militants too, but the collateral damage. You’re responsible for that, too.” In a CBS interview in 2011, Fiasco also called the president a terrorist. “My fight against terrorism, to me, the biggest terrorist is Obama and the United States of America. I’m trying to fight the terrorism that’s actually causing the other forms of terrorism.” he told reporters. “You know, the root cause of terrorism is the stuff the U.S. government allows to happen. The foreign policies that we have in place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists.” he added at the time.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358826459656</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 22:47:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358827114834-303</Id><Topic><Title>The Boeing Debacle: Seven Lessons Every CEO Must Learn</Title><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1358461826122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 17:30:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What Went Wrong At Boeing? Forbes - Steve Denning 1/21/2013 My article, The Boeing Debacle: Seven Lessons That Every CEO Must Learn, elicited spirited conversation. Several commentators noted that, in addition to the general lessons, Boeing made specific errors in the way it handled outsourcing and offshoring. Let’s take a closer look at those specifics. Boeing enthusiastically embraced outsourcing, both locally and internationally, as a way of lowering costs and accelerating development. The approach was intended to“reduce the 787′s development time from six to four years and development cost from $10 to $6 billion.” The end result was the opposite. The project is billions of dollars over budget and three years behind schedule. “We spent a lot more money,” Jim Albaugh, Chief of Commercial Airplanes at Boeing, explained in January 2011, “in trying to recover than we ever would have spent if we’d tried to keep the key technologies closer to home.” The right goal: add value for customers Let’s start with what Boeing did right. After losing market share to Airbus (owned by EADS) in the late 1990s, Boeing could have decided to focus on reducing the costs (and the selling prices) of its existing aircraft. That would have led inexorably to corporate death. Instead Boeing decided—commendably—to innovate with a new aircraft that would generate revenues by creating value for customers. First, Boeing aimed to improve their travel experience for the ultimate customers, the passengers. As compared to the traditional material (aluminum) used in airplane manufacturing, the composite material to be used in the 787 (carbon fiber, aluminum and titanium) would allow for increased humidity and pressure to be maintained in the passenger cabin, offering substantial improvement to the flying experience. The lightweight composite materials would enable the 787 to fly nonstop between any pair of cities without layovers. Second, Boeing aimed to improve value for its immediate customers (the airlines) by improved efficiency by using composite materials and an electrical system using lithium-ion batteries. This would result 20 percent less fuel for comparable flights and cost-per-seat mile 10 percent lower than for any other aircraft. Moreover, unlike the traditional aluminum fuselages that tend to fatigue, the 787′s fuselages based on composite materials would reduce airlines’ maintenance and replacement costs. All good stuff, if Boeing could deliver. Boeing’s customers apparently thought they could. And the 787 became the fastest selling plane in aviation history. The stock price popped and the C-suite received their bonuses. But reality has since set in. Overheating batteries We have no way of knowing whether the cause of the current grounding of all 787s—lithium-ion batteries that overheat alarmingly—is a narrow, fixable manufacturing glitch or a serious design flaw that will put the whole enterprise in peril. It’s true, as CEO James McNerny pointed out in a letter to Boeing staff on Friday, that “Since entering service 15 months ago, the 787 fleet has completed 18,000 flights and 50,000 flight hours with eight airlines, carrying more than 1,000,000 passengers safely to destinations around the world.” But all that will mean nothing unless and until Boeing can get to the root cause of those overheating Lithium-ion batteries. What we do know is that the cost-cutting way that Boeing went about outsourcing both in the US and beyond did not include steps to mitigate or eliminate the predicted costs and risks that have already materialized. The coordination risk Even with proven technology, there are major risks in outsourcing that components won’t fit together when the plane is being assembled. “In order to minimize these potential problems,” wrote Dr. L. J. Hart-Smith, a Boeing aerospace engineer, in a brilliant paper presented at a 2001 conference, “it is necessary for the prime contractor to provide on-site quality, supplier-management, and sometimes technical support. If this is not done, the performance of the prime manufacturer can never exceed the capabilities of the least proficient of the suppliers. These costs do not vanish merely because the work itself is out-of-sight.” Boeing did not plan to provide for such on-site support for its suppliers. In fact, it explicitly delegated this responsibility to sub-contractors. When the subcontractors didn’t perform the necessary coordination, Boeing had to provide the support anyway. “Boeing sent hundreds of its engineers to the sites of various Tier-1, Tier-2, or Tier-3 suppliers worldwide to solve various technical problems that appeared to be the root cause of the delay in the 787′s development. Ultimately, Boeing had to redesign the entire aircraft sub-assembly process.” The result? Huge additional expense, that should have been planned for and included in the project’s costs from the outset. The innovation risk The 787 involved not merely the outsourcing of a known technology. It involved major technological innovations unproven in any airplane. Would the carbon fiber composite survive the rigors of international flying? Could lithium-ion batteries, which are notorious for overheating and causing fires that are difficult to put out, be safely used? No one knew for sure. The 787 also contains multiple new electrical systems, power and distribution panels. The interactions among these novel technologies, introduced simultaneously, also exponentially increased the risk of innovation. The innovation risk implied a greater involvement by Boeing in the development and manufacture of the aircraft. Astonishingly, Boeing opted for lesser involvement, delegating much of the detailed engineering and procurement to sub-contractors. The result? Unexpected problems have kept occurring that have delayed the project and increased its cost. The outsourcing risk Complicated products like aircraft involve a necessary degree of outsourcing, simply because the firm lacks the necessary expertise in some areas, e.g. engines and avionics. However Boeing significantly increased the amount of outsourcing for the 787 over earlier planes. For the 737 and 747 it had been at around 35-50 percent. For the 787, Boeing planned to increase outsourcing to 70 percent. Boeing didn’t approach outsourcing as a troublesome necessity. Instead, like many US firms, it enthusiastically embraced outsourcing in the 787 as a means of reducing costs and the time of development. “The 787′s supply chain was envisioned to keep manufacturing and assembly costs low, while spreading the financial risks of development to Boeing’s suppliers.” In his 2001 paper, Hart-Smith had warned of the additional costs and risks of large-scale outsourcing. Outsourcing didn’t cut costs and increase profits, he wrote; instead, it drove profits and knowledge to suppliers while increasing costs for the mother company. “Not only is the work out-sourced; all of the profits associated with the work are out-sourced, too.” Hart-Smith argued that make-buy decisions should be based on complete assessments of all of the costs: “make-buy decisions should not be made until after the product has been defined and the relative costs established.” Outsourcing requires considerable additional up-front effort in planning to avoid the situation whereby major sub-assemblies do not fit together at final assembly, increasing the cost by orders of magnitude more than was saved by designing in isolation from the work-allocation activities. Boeing didn’t follow Hart-Smith’s advice and outsourced the engineering and construction of the plane long before the product was defined and the relative costs established. The results have been disastrous. Boeing’s 787 project is many billions of dollars over budget. The delivery schedule has been pushed back at least 7 times. The first planes were delivered over three years late. The risk of tiered outsourcing Boeing further aggravated these risks by adopting a new outsourcing model, along with the new technology. Unlike Boeing’s earlier aircraft, in which Boeing played the traditional role of integrating and assembling different parts and subsystems produced by its suppliers, the 787′s supply chain is based on a tiered structure that would allow Boeing to foster partnerships with around fifty Tier-1 strategic partners. These strategic partners were to serve as “integrators” who assemble different parts and subsystems produced by Tier-2 and Tier-3 suppliers. In due course, Boeing discovered, as Hart-Smith had predicted, that some Tier-1 strategic partners did not have the know-how to develop different sections of the aircraft or the experience to manage their Tier-2 suppliers. To regain control of the development process, Boeing was forced to buy one of the key Tier-1 suppliers (Vought Aircraft Industries) and supply expertise to other suppliers. Boeing also had to pay strategic partners compensation for potential profit losses stemming from the delays in production. The risk of partially implementing the Toyota model Boeing’s outsourcing was modeled in part on Toyota’s supply chain, which has enabled Toyota to develop new cars with shorter development cycle times. Toyota successfully outsources around 70 percent of its vehicles to a trusted group of partner firms. However key elements of the Toyota outsourcing model were not implemented at Boeing. Toyota maintains tight control over the overall design and engineering of its vehicles and only outsources to suppliers who have proven their ability to deliver with the required timeliness, quality, cost reduction and continuous innovation. As Toyota works closely with its suppliers and responds to supplier concerns with integrity and mutual respect, it has established an impressive level of professional trust and an overriding preoccupation with product quality. By contrast, Boeing adopted the superficial structure of Toyota’s tiered outsourcing model without the values and practices on which it rests. Instead, Boeing relied on poorly designed contractual arrangements, which created perverse incentives to work at the speed of the slowest supplier, by providing penalties for delay but no rewards for timely delivery. The offshoring risk Some degree of outsourcing in other countries—i.e. offshoring—is an inevitable aspect of manufacturing a complex product like an airplane, because some expertise exists only in foreign countries. For example, the capacity to manufacture Lithium-ion batteries lies outside the US. Boeing had no choice but to have the batteries made in another country. More than 30 percent of the 787’s components came from overseas. By contrast, just 5 percent of the parts of the 747, were foreign-made. While there is nothing in principle wrong with necessary offshoring, the cultural and language differences and the physical distances involved in a lengthy supply chain create additional risks. Mitigating them requires substantial and continuing communications with the suppliers and on-site involvement, thereby generating additional cost. Boeing didn’t plan for such communications or involvement, and so incurred additional risk that materialized. The risk of communications by computer Rather than plan for face-to-face communications and on-site communcations, Boeing introduced a web-based communications tool called Exostar in which suppliers were supposed to input up-to-date information about the progress of their work. The tool was meant to provide supply chain visibility, improve control and integration of critical business processes, and reduce development time and cost. Instead of people communicating with people face-to-face, the computer itself was supposed to flag problems in real time. Not surprisingly, the tool failed. Suppliers did not input accurate and timely information, in part due to cultural differences and lack of trust. As a result, neither Tier-1 suppliers nor Boeing became aware of problems in a timely fashion. Boeing’s reliance on computer communications contrasts sharply with Agile practices of continuous face-to-face communications to ensure that everyone is on the same page. The labor relations risk We do not know to what extent Boeing’s enthusiasm for outsourcing and offshoring stemmed from a desire to circumvent difficult labor relations in Seattle. We do know that instead of involving the employees in the decision-making about outsourcing and offshoring, Boeing’s management approached decision-making pre-emptively. The approach backfired, as labor relations worsened as a result of the outsourcing decisions and a costly strike ensued. The project management skills risk Given the extraordinary risks of the 787 project, one would have expected Boeing to assemble a leadership team with a proven record in supply chain management and diverse expertise to anticipate and mitigate wide array of risks. Amazingly, this was not the case. “Boeing’s original leadership team for the 787 program,” write Tang and Zimmerman in an important case study, “did not include members with expertise on supply chain risk management. Without the requisite skills to manage an unconventional supply chain, Boeing was undertaking a huge managerial risk in uncharted waters.” The risk of a disengaged C-suite The combination of the above risks constituted an existential threat to Boeing as a going concern. Where then was the C-suite while these risks were being incurred? An interview in 2011 with Philip Condit, who was the richly compensated CEO of Boeing when the initial 787 decisions were being made, is revealing. In 2001, under Condit’s leadership, Boeing moved its headquarters from Seattle to Chicago, a decision continued by Condit’s successor, James McNerney. The ostensible reason for the move was to be neutral among the various divisions of Boeing, which were scattered around the US. In the interview, Condit makes no secret of another factor: as CEO, he didn’t want to be bothered with tiresome “how-do-you-design-an-airplane stuff,” or boring meetings with Boeing’s key customers (airlines) who came to Seattle. After the move, Condit says that he spent much of his time in the Chicago business community, where he “encountered CEOs frequently gathering to nail down civic goals ranging from landing new companies to building world-class parks. ‘I was surprised by how much that happened,’ Condit said. ‘A meeting in which Starbucks, Microsoft, Costco, Boeing and Weyerhaeuser and a bunch of small businesses are all in the same place — rarely happens in Seattle,” he added. ‘It happened all the time in Chicago.’” So while Boeing’s CEO was in Chicago, strategizing about the future of Boeing and discussing civic goals with CEOs from other companies, the managers back in Seattle were making business decisions about tiresome “how-do-you-design-an-airplane stuff” that would determine whether there would be a firm to strategize about.

Boeing decided at the outset to rely on outsourcing for 70 percent of the plane’s manufactured content. As Steve shows at length, this greatly increased the managerial complexity of the project and almost certainly helps explain why the project ended up three years late (with consequent damage not only to Boeing’s reputation but, thanks to contractual penalties, to its immediate bottom line). Even more troubling, however, has been the long-term cost in weakening Boeing’s competitiveness. This is something I identified in “Boeing, Boeing….Gone,” a cover story for The American Conservative, as far back as 2005. The point is that among the things Boeing has outsourced have been the wings and the wing-box. These are by far the most technologically advanced elements of an airframe and they were outsourced to a Japanese consortium led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Part of the deal was that much of Boeing’s secret wing-building know-how had to be transferred to Japan. The decision was highly controversial with Boeing workers who saw it as a direct threat to their jobs. Outraged at the prone position they were asked to adopt towards their information-gathering Japanese counterparts, they were quoted by author Karl Sabbagh as vulgarly referring to Boeing’s technology-transfer deal as the “open kimono” policy. Of course, you might think that what was outsourced yesterday can be insourced today. Actually this rarely happens in the real world, at least not where seriously advanced manufacturing is concerned. In this case a key problem is that the 787′s are made of carbon fiber. The learning curve in putting this tricky new material to work has been climbed by Tokyo-based Toray and Mitsubishi, not by Boeing. Unfortunately Boeing seems to have negotiated no effective access to the industrial secrets the Japanese have acquired. In effect Boeing has been left behind by its suppliers and cannot catch up without major costs that, given the relentless pressure for short-term profits in corporate America, will never seem to be worth incurring. As a practical matter, the Airbus subsidiary of Netherlands-based EADS, will use Japanese-made carbon-fiber for the wings of its next major plane. The net effect is that the Japanese have suddenly bootstrapped themselves to leadership in the jetliner industry. (It should be noted that Japan’s aggregate contribution to the 787 comes to 30 percent, the same as that of the United States.) All this is the more piquant because Mitsubishi seems to be planning in the long run to enter the fray as a direct competitor to Boeing and Airbus in building full-size commercial jetliners. Already Mitsubishi is working with Toyota Motor to launch a 90-seat regional jetliner in 2017. As for the immediate problem of getting the 787 back into the air, the news this morning is that overcharging seems to have been ruled out as the cause of the battery problems at the center of the crisis. Meanwhile Securaplane, a subsidiary of Britain’s Meggitt, which makes chargers for the 787, has announced it is cooperating in the effort to find the source of the problem.</Msg><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1358827582620</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:06:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358827768193-306</Id><Topic><Title>SOON AIRLINES WILL START CANCELLING THEIR ORDERS FOR THE 787 AND GO WITH AIRBUS</Title><Username>pierre_from_geneva</Username><Timestamp>1358827578536</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:06:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AIRBUS makes better planes than Boeing like their 787 disaster.</Msg><Username>copyright_member</Username><Timestamp>1358827768193</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:09:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358828115582-307</Id><Title>BOEING IS A DISASTER = TO FORD OR CHEVROLET WHILE AIRBUS = TO MERCEDES</Title><Msg>EOM..</Msg><Username>xawa</Username><Timestamp>1358828115582</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:15:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358828156229-308</Id><Topic><Title>The Boeing Debacle: Seven Lessons Every CEO Must Learn</Title><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1358461826122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 17:30:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lots of good food for thought.

Add to that record cold temperatures last felt 30 to 50 years ago in many countries. Progressive idealism in the EU has created an energy debacle that has left hundreds of thousands of people unable to afford heating oil this winter as cold deaths climb and people are now forced to cut down trees in public parks and forests for firewood in an effort to stay alive in the frigid cold. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Greeks, desperate to find fuel to stay warm because they can’t afford heating oil that has been ghit with big tax increases, have been taking to the woods and even city parks to cut down trees and now authorities said someone has felled the olive tree under which Plato sat in ancient times. Police said they believe at least two people cut down the famous tree because it was massive and heavy. Some residents of the area reportedly said that homeless people cut the tree, while others allege that a group of gypsies did it. Plato’s Olive Tree, was said to be a remnant of the grove within which Plato’s Academy was situated, which would make it approximately 2,400 years old. The tree comprised a cavernous trunk from which a few branches were still sprouting in 1975, when a traffic accident caused a bus to fall on and uproot it in 1975. Since then, the trunk has been preserved and displayed in the nearby Agricultural University of Athens. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358828457047</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:20:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358828690713-310</Id><Topic><Title>Plato’s Tree Cut Down For Firewood</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358828457047</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:20:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simple stories for very simple or nearly feeble minds.</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1358828690713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:24:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358829271604-311</Id><Topic><Title>The Boeing Debacle: Seven Lessons Every CEO Must Learn</Title><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1358461826122</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 17:30:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks techpath, I really appreciate your posts as well.

The piece also predicts the short-term benefits of the subsidies and includes the effects of rising federal requirements for fuel economy (known as CAFE) standards. The outlook is that federal subsidies will cost taxpayers $7.5 billion over the next few years for little or no benefit (even when including the impact of CAFE) to total gas consumption or emissions. The CBO is a non-partisan federal agency that is relied upon by Congress to provide unbiased economic data. Unfortunately, Congress does not seem to listen to what the statistics are telling them. In the case of green subsidies, it seems that no logical data on how little the country benefits from the politically-popular handouts and how many billions of dollars are spent, few members of Congress are willing to appear to be anti-green by suggesting limiting the subsidies. Congressman Mike Kelly once introduced a bill to cut back on the wasteful EV subsidies, but seemed to receive little support; even from fellow Republicans.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1358830724944</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:58:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
