If, as you say, there is only negligible fraud, then the outcome of any election will not change - either way. To say that someone will not vote because they have to obtain and show an ID simply insults anyone's intelligence. Now, if there is fraud, even if negligible, it taints the voting process and raises questions of legitimacy. That affects everyone's perception of the process - not just a few. Imagine that there are some pathetic individuals that refuse to get off their rear ends in order to get a free ID to support voting. The reluctance to do one's civic duty, of course, raises many other concerns or issues. Say that you and others insist that they vote, whether they want to or not: then, volunteer to help them get an ID and then drive them to the polling place. People that desire to participate in the voting process are not swayed by a minor inconvenience - if it truly is an inconvenience.

"The economy ministry remains willing to talk. We expect that a constructive solution is possible," the ministry said in a statement. "Airbus has committed to strengthening the research and development capacities in Germany. The economy ministry is awaiting concrete proposals and their implementation." Earlier, German daily Die Welt quoted from a paper, which Airbus had sent to those German federal states that are home to the planemaker's bases, that the drawn-out talks had "realistically speaking finally failed". Germany and Airbus have been at loggerheads over the remaining 623 million euro part of a 1.1 billion euro loan. They have fought over the allocation of jobs for Airbus A350 jets and sources have said Airbus is unwilling to give guarantees over the share of work on the latest jet as long as Germany holds back the loan. Berlin, for its part, wants guarantees about work on future Airbus projects and says Airbus has not stuck to its commitment. Despite having a working share of 34 percent in Airbus' long-distance plane A350, Germany has only paid 15 percent of the European development loan, "practically forcing Airbus to correct its German working share downwards", the newspaper said. Airbus (EAD.PA) declined comment.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1377866005438</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 08:33:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377866258704-13</Id><Topic><Title>Harvard Study: No Correlation Between Gun Control and Less Violent Crime</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1377787051779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-29 10:37:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So you are saying you support AlQaeda?</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377866258704</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 08:37:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377866892950-14</Id><Topic><Title>Harvard Study: No Correlation Between Gun Control and Less Violent Crime</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1377787051779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-29 10:37:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hinkley was MKULTRA..gun laws irrelevent in that case..yes Harvard study accurate</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377866892950</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 08:48:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377867191018-15</Id><Title>Notice how NO ONE is buying the chemical attack narrative</Title><Msg>Another false flag....carried out by NWO operative (AlQaeda).....no one biting any more</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377867191018</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 08:53:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377867814456-16</Id><Topic><Title>Notice how NO ONE is buying the chemical attack narrative</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377867191018</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 08:53:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How will the Kent Raven explain his way out of such hypocrisy?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1377867814456</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 09:03:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377867904454-17</Id><Topic><Title>Harvard Study: No Correlation Between Gun Control and Less Violent Crime</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1377787051779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-29 10:37:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wouldn't it be interesting to hear the Kent Raven explain why we should be their air force?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1377867904454</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 09:05:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377871157618-18</Id><Topic><Title>The Truth About Voter Fraud</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1377820086031</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-29 19:48:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Demonstrably proven to be absolutely false.

I've taken the company to task IN the Tiimes using my names while I was an employee. And the worst that happened was an executives aide tried to tell me that I must bring my supervisor to a meeting with the director of commercial operations.. I explained a few things to him and he politely backed down. Some of that can be verified in the times as follows Go to Seattle times Search on the secret word Shuper . . . . And yes I had the meeting- and it lasted for an hour- resulting in 3 other execs cooling their heels in the foyer for about 20 minutes. The results - Engineers in manufacturing- operations eventually ( took a few years ) got boosted up with a bit of equal pay and opportunity in grade and as technical fellows. And on another issue- I'm probably one of maybe 500 employees /retirees who has been hugged by alan mulally.

Thus a court ruled the petition to put issue on ballot was not valid. In the court papers, the problem of how to count or not count duplicate signatures came up. state law says if a duplicate signature is found, BOTH signatures are dumped. But it turns out, King county in past elections/initiatives never followed that rule, instead allowing one of the duplicates to remain. And in our gubernators election a few years ago, it took three counts to change the outcome by 125 votes to give Chris gregoire ( D) the election. Later, a few boxes of votes were found not counted, and later, a significant number of felon and cadaver votes were also found. And many voter registration addresses were found to be the local city hall ( used by those who had no homes or ID ). So in this state- we have a large dem contingent in the cons,crooks, and cadaver voting block.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1377874855405</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 11:00:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377875135061-21</Id><Topic><Title>The Truth About Voter Fraud</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1377820086031</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-29 19:48:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>August 26, 2013 at 9:53 PM Judge: SeaTac petition for $15/hour minimum wage invalid Posted by Colin Campbell The petition to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour in SeaTac was halted Monday when a King County Superior Court judge ruled that it did not have the adequate number of signatures to be on the general election ballot in November, according to a report in the SeaTac Blog. The petition had been signed more than once by 61 of its supporters, Judge Andrea Darvas said, and once the repeat names were stricken, the petition did not have enough signatures, according to the report. Darvas’ ruling on Monday reversed an earlier statement from the SeaTac city clerk that the petition was sufficient to put the minimum-wage measure before voters. Where the ordinance goes from here isn’t clear — nor is whether sponsors will be allowed to go back out to get more signatures, the blog report says. Darvas said SeaTac and the SeaTac city clerk “are prohibited, and must desist and refrain, from sending the initiative measure to King County,” the SeaTac Blog reported.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1377875135061</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 11:05:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377875426206-22</Id><Topic><Title>Don't Let The Right Wing Co-opt King</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1377557161612</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 18:46:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even though Tricky Rick has used the same term for years in his own speeches and writings.</Msg><Username>notarethug</Username><Timestamp>1377875426206</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 11:10:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377875562622-23</Id><Topic><Title>Notice how NO ONE is buying the chemical attack narrative</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377867191018</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 08:53:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Josef Goebbels ALSO believed that if any lies are repeated constantly, people will begin to believe those lies are true.

Go to compare P/E to EPS yahoo or google ,and then Zacks research to compare Pe and EPs for BA and Airbus. a good article by Warren buffett streesed EPS is better and why,using Zacks financial. i found the 83 and 30 percent, that is under for the year increase in EPSand yep it is greater for Airbus. next year's EPS projection has Airbus up another 40% compared to BA at 12.!%. The issue as it seems here is investing compared to trading. So that can be reviewed with the yahoo comparison chart for BA and Airbus. as pointed out for american charting the symbol for airbus is eadsy. Looking at the max chart at least for the last 3 years , ) Airbus is leading over Boeing and pulling awya from boeing at about or getting toward 200% while boeings comparison is hovering at the 60%level. Airbus and Boeing are more an a investmenrt than a trade stock. Not much movement . The other stock mentioned tesla that is up about 700%and for an investor over three years was a winner . There is a lot of built in price on tesla due to Elon Musk meeting all of his projections and the stock price is anticipating in my opinion, an increase in car deliveries. Something faulmouthharbor must appreciate as he is mr boeing is getting more orders and delivering more planes. what is good for falmouthharbor is good for Wayne,Fred and Dell. As to if he is a and you fill in the blank on his fictional name, that is off topic we could talk abot mike Sears or john hart-Smith too, . today boeing is the biggest loser on of the Dow jones and that is not a good thing for a trader and not much to brag about for a boeing investor. Zacks shows both BA and Eadsy as 16.1 PE and if sparti looks, noot tht he needs to if he want to argue 180% compared to 300% , that is the same PE for Boeing and Airbus EPS is better per Buffett</Msg><Username>searcfojailtime1year</Username><Timestamp>1377889808301</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 15:10:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377890650067-47</Id><Topic><Title>Rand Paul Warns Obama Against Starting “Major War” With Russia</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377810009555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-29 17:00:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Assad never gave the order to use chemical weapons...all a lie</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377890650067</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 15:24:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377891328761-48</Id><Topic><Title>Rand Paul Warns Obama Against Starting “Major War” With Russia</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377810009555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-29 17:00:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>right - it was his brother- or like the IRS some renagade person in the military- therefore like obama- NO one is responsible</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1377891328761</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 15:35:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377892307156-49</Id><Topic><Title>Rand Paul Warns Obama Against Starting “Major War” With Russia</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377810009555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-29 17:00:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AlQaeda took credit.....you,ve heard of those guys...they are the folks that are the reason we have a global war on terror...and are the folks the Obama supports with weapons</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377892307156</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-30 15:51:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377894182567-50</Id><Topic><Title>Rand Paul Warns Obama Against Starting “Major War” With Russia</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377810009555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-29 17:00:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeh, Assad, supporter of Iran would never give an order like that would he.
