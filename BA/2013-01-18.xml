Boeing corporate created the 787 problems by ignoring the warnings of the Boeing technical community,” said Joel Funfar, Technical Negotiation Team member. “Now, they propose to double down on their failed outsourcing strategy by outsourcing the engineering work required to solve the problems caused by previous rounds of outsourcing.” Boeing stated publicly that the company does not need SPEEA members for the FAA investigation or working the 787 issues.

Mann. He said that the FAA was under pressure to fast-track approval of different design parts of the 787 Dreamliner because of the excitement surrounding the aircraft. "When you start to stack up very innovative solutions, either as designs or as processes, any one of these is OK," Mann said. "But when you start to build an aircraft entirely out of very innovative approaches to problems, you start to think, do you really want to allow the oversight agency to hurry along the certification process?" In fact, 65% of the $15.3 billion worth of loan guarantees that the Ex-Im bank issued in 2007 and 2008 went to help foreign countries buy Boeing aircraft, according to a 2009 report issued by the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts. Last year, Congress reauthorized the Export-Import Bank by four years, and raised its loan limits to $140 billion. Experts say Boeing's influence in Washington helped settle a high-profile labor fight with the NLRB. After Boeing's union reached an agreement, the federal agency dropped a complaint against Boeing for building a new non-union plant in South Carolina that helped make Dreamliner jets. Boeing's influence also extends to the FAA, which last week announced a probe into the design, manufacture and assembly of the Dreamliner after problems first began to surface. On Wednesday, the FAA grounded the Dreamliner in the United States, a move that resulted in taking all 50 planes worldwide out of service. Boeing needs to get back to building Boeing planes not outsourcing the work. The competitive duopoly is Airbus who pays their workers more than Boeing pays their work force and makes airbus shareholders a gain of 27% return on their stock while Boeing has made zero return for their Boeing investors for the last 12 months .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358495482297</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 02:51:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358495605930-9</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing to ignore the safety of the flying public and the stockholders share value.</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358493990331</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 02:26:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wayne, you had made some good points.</Msg><Username>ngengee</Username><Timestamp>1358495605930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 02:53:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358496376372-10</Id><Title>EVERETT HERALD 1-17-2013 7:59 pm 'SPEEA to recommend rejection of 'final' Boeing offer'</Title><Msg>SPEEA to recommend rejection of 'final' Boeing offer As 787 crisis unfolds, engineers union also will seek strike authorization from members</Msg><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1358496376372</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 03:06:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358498432547-11</Id><Title>Pilot,engineer and mechanic state the public safety issue with the 787</Title><Msg>Any time you've got smoke or fire or odor of smoke and fire on an aircraft, that's a very serious situation," said Kevin Hiatt, a veteran airline pilot and head of the Flight Safety Foundation. "You've got very little time to get an aircraft on the ground safely if something like that occurs in flight." The batteries are critical to the plane because the 787 is thirsty for electrical power. The Dreamliner uses electricity to run more systems than any other Boeing airliner, said University of Dayton professor Raul Ordonez, an aircraft electrical and computer engineer who spent time observing Dreamliner development at Boeing's Seattle headquarters. It takes lots of battery power to run electricity through those systems. The 787 is unique because its batteries are lithium ion batteries. The batteries hold more energy for longer periods than the standard nickel cadmium airliner batteries. "These kinds of batteries," Ordonez says, "are slightly more likely to cause problems." It's unclear whether the Dreamliner battery trouble in Japan was a charging problem or a battery overheating problem, says John Goglia, a former airline mechanic and former member of the National Transportation Safety Board. A charging problem wouldn't require an immediate landing, "but if I had a battery overheating -- given the history -- I'd be looking for the nearest place to put my butt on the ground."</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358498432547</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 03:40:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358499751866-12</Id><Topic><Title>PREDICTIONS for BOEING !!</Title><Username>johnsonandrew384</Username><Timestamp>1358447476581</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:31:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you gotta check out this</Msg><Username>marieparker549</Username><Timestamp>1358499751866</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 04:02:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358502628075-13</Id><Topic><Title>Why this stock is up?</Title><Username>holakonichiwa</Username><Timestamp>1358472106819</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:21:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks.</Msg><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1358502628075</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 04:50:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358502943934-14</Id><Topic><Title>The idea that the Sandy Hook massacre was faked is not only absurd, but also an insult to the victims</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1358381502396</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 19:11:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Someone once called CNN a pipeline for CIA propaganda.

Fast and Furious, Holder was held in contempt of Congress, and still nothing ever came of it. Humma Abedjin, holding a major position of power in the DOS. She has a mother and brother who are high ranking members of the Muslim Brotherhood. And what was that about Hillarys concussion and blood clot.

Fast and Furious, Holder was held in contempt of Congress, and still nothing ever came of it. Humma Abedjin, holding a major position of power in the DOS. She has a mother and brother who are high ranking members of the Muslim Brotherhood. And what was that about Hillarys concussion and blood clot. She still has yet to testify about her version of Benghazi, what does that matter now? The bogus COLB that Obama has presented as his credential for being a natural born US citizen and the findings of Joe Arpaio that seem to prove it to be a fraudulent document. I could go on but I think you get my drift. With all of this unfolding before our very eyes, who are you going to be inclined to believe? Remember, we still don't really know who killed the Kennedy's, probably because they still control things. In closing, try to remember that the collective American memory is so short that I think it is in need of treatment for dementia.

"Texas is better than New York, and New York just gave us another excuse to say that," Abbott, a Republican, said on Thursday, after ads extolling Texas appeared on several media websites. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed sweeping gun-control legislation earlier this week expanding the state's ban on assault weapons and putting limits on ammunition capacity in the wake of last month's school shootings in Connecticut. Abbott, a possible candidate for governor of Texas in next year's election, used campaign money to buy ads on websites of news organizations in New York City and Albany. One ad says in classic Western script: "WANTED: Law abiding New York gun owners seeking lower taxes and greater opportunities." Clicking on the ad leads to a Facebook page touting the virtues of Texas, including the fact that the state has no income tax so "you'll be able to keep more of what you earn and use that extra money to buy more ammo." Abbott told Reuters the ads are a "way to tweak our liberal friends up in the Northeast." "It is tongue in cheek, but there is a deeper message here," he said. "Texas really does stand as the last bastion of ultimate freedom in this country. Over the last decade, more than 4 million people moved to this state, and one reason is freedom and one reason is economic opportunity." Abbott has said he will file a federal lawsuit to throw out any nationwide gun restrictions implemented by Congress. A Cuomo spokesman did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1358517444062</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 08:57:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358517448474-36</Id><Topic><Title>EVERETT HERALD 1-17-2013 7:59 pm 'SPEEA to recommend rejection of 'final' Boeing offer'</Title><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1358496376372</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 03:06:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing seeks to switch to a 401 K plan for future employees.

The key is the charging and protection system, Gulfstream 680 has some LiFePo4 on it. One solution is to have a low power charger for each cell and diode isolate the pack from the power buss. It is a brute force way to prevent thermal runaway of a whole pack. I think this is the Gulfstream implementation. A drawback is don’t get the real fast recharge rate the Li-Ion can provide. Chemistry, performance, cost, and safety characteristics vary across LIB types. Handheld electronics mostly use LIBs based on lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), which offers high energy density, but have well-known safety concerns, especially when damaged. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) offer lower energy density, but longer lives and inherent safety. These chemistries are being widely used for electric tools, medical equipment and other roles. NMC in particular is a leading contender for automotive applications</Msg><Username>doogie91112</Username><Timestamp>1358517863484</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 09:04:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358517931462-38</Id><Title>Many Democrats Know Socialism Is Just another Form of Thievery</Title><Msg>.....but they don't like people calling them thieves.....go figure.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1358517931462</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 09:05:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358517968271-39</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing bows to SPEEA</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358474179603</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 20:56:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing has a long memory.

Naturally, the NRA, which lobbies on behalf of gun manufacturers, is not happy about any of this and released a video Tuesday criticizing Obama for being a "hypocrite" and an "elitist." And why is that? Well, here's how the video puts it: "Are the president's kids more important than yours?" the ad asks. "Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school?" The ad continues: "Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he is just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security."</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358523061623</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:31:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358523562523-61</Id><Topic><Title>The administration may label the NRA as a terror supporting organization.</Title><Username>frankmalone90</Username><Timestamp>1358523355487</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:35:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why not call them a union and go about busting them up. they are a dues paying union of gun owners are they not?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1358523562523</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:39:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358523669010-62</Id><Topic><Title>BA - Important Update!</Title><Username>miquel.manza</Username><Timestamp>1358510311119</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 06:58:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they are fantastic</Msg><Username>kopchickleslie</Username><Timestamp>1358523669010</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:41:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358524346928-63</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing exec's are oinkers and several other things.</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1358469181976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 19:33:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are now saying voltage into the battery was too high.

SPEEA has two separate bargaining units, the Techs and the Profs. There really isn't a system in place in case one group votes to accept the contract offer and the other group votes to reject, it would pretty much be accepted at that point. But there is a SPEEA Tech negotiating team, a SPEEA Prof negotiating team, a SPEEA Tech Bargaining Unit Council (BUC), a SPEEA Prof BUC, SPEEA Tech "rank and file", and SPEEA Prof "rank and file". 2. The SPEEA Tech and SPEEA Prof negotiating teams both unanimously recommended rejection. 3. Now it goes to the BUCs, who are expected to recommend rejection (notionally, Jan 23). 4. Then, it will go to the rank and file, who will vote between (about) Jan 25 to Feb 4. Rank and file will also be asked to authorize a strike if the offer gets rejected. 5. If the offer gets accepted, it's all over. If the offer gets rejected AND the rank and file DON'T authorize a strike, SPEEA will ask Boeing to continue negotiations, but Boeing doesn't have much of a reason to. If the offer gets rejected AND the rank and file authorize a strike, SPEEA and Boeing will restart negotiations. P.S. This offer is apparently much better than previous offers, but includes no pension for new-hires. SPEEA has offered to give up the pension for new hires, as long as the new system is roughly equivalent to the pension, which Boeing rejected. So, is this the hill SPEEA wants to die on? Conversely, the savings to Boeing on Day 1 of the this contract are ZERO, as there aren't any new-hires at that point, but a strike by SPEEA would cost Boeing tens to hundreds of millions of dollars PER DAY, so is this the hill Boeing wants to die on? Boeing could guarantee acceptance of this offer if they'd amend it to continue pensions for new-hires for two years, and in the meantime they would commit to working with SPEEA to create a pension replacement that is roughly equivalent to the current system (i.e. not intended to screw a bunch of people).</Msg><Username>masterkc99</Username><Timestamp>1358531101216</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:45:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358531179222-90</Id><Topic><Title>NRA cowards take aim at Presidents kids</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358523061623</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:31:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>' Bad times are on the way for the USA ' what are you talking about?... the GOP and NRA are already here... if anything, America is trying to rid herself of these bad elements !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358531179222</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:46:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358531272059-91</Id><Topic><Title>787's biggest problems won't show up for a couple of years</Title><Username>leftwinggunowner</Username><Timestamp>1358522123565</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:15:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>never seen composite heads,,,,,,don't think you hit a gold ball with the shaft! but nice try anyway</Msg><Username>duffymagoo</Username><Timestamp>1358531272059</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:47:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358531272086-92</Id><Topic><Title>The idea that the Sandy Hook massacre was faked is not only absurd, but also an insult to the victims</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1358381502396</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 19:11:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>look at the types we're dealing with</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358531272086</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:47:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358531317358-93</Id><Topic><Title>Many Democrats Know Socialism Is Just another Form of Thievery</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1358517931462</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 09:05:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It all depends on what you call socialism or hybrid.

Boeing implemented the Pension Value Plan (PVP) in 1999 for over 100,000 non-represented employees. Although the PVP is primarily one of benefit formula change, Boeing has previously claimed it could not comply with eligibility, vesting, benefit and funding requirements by giving employees a choice at retirement or termination. We believe, however, that the Company can allow such a choice, as other companies like Kodak, 3M, Motorola, Delta Airlines, and AT&amp;T have done. In their February 23, 1998 message to shareholders, Boeing said “A company, any company, is nothing more or less than the people who make it up.” We believe Boeing should “walk their talk” in pension issues. The Company’s pension plan documents state that “[g]ains arising from experience under the Plan will not serve to increase the benefits otherwise due any participant but will be used to reduce future Company contributions.” Boeing, like many corporations, legally improves earnings with non-spendable pension gains based on anticipated pension fund returns.

Š Employees began earning new benefits under the PVP formula immediately upon the PVP’s implementation rather than having a “wear-away” transition period before they could accrue any new benefits under the cashbalance plan. Š The PVP increases the percentage of pay that is credited to the employee’s cash-balance “account” as the employee’s age increases. Thus, the PVP gives the Company’s oldest employees nearly four times more benefit credits each year than their youngest counterparts receive. +++ from the 2003 proxy Boeing implemented the Pension Value Plan (PVP) in 1999 for over 100,000 non-represented employees.

It does have an advantage for younger employees- but contrary to BA PR ( from the BOD), it hammers the older employes in a very subtle fashion BCERP allows 100 percent of vested- computed benefits at age 60. PVP requires getting to 65 to get the same 100 percent of vested A reasonable solution would be as I proposed. Simply give newer employees the choice when they leave or retire - after a typical 5 year vesting period the choice of plans. AS the older employees retire under the BCERP- the younger employees will be a bigger percentage under the PVP.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1358535518263</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:58:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358535565463-111</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing exec's are oinkers and several other things.</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1358469181976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 19:33:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing can't be bothered with fixing something, they want a quick visual and watch for messages.</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1358535565463</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:59:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358535594527-112</Id><Topic><Title>Repubs love to quote dead people !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358532126746</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:02:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Galileo, Einstein were liberal kinda guys - eh ?</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358535594527</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:59:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358535663022-113</Id><Topic><Title>Repubs love to quote dead people !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358532126746</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:02:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>' When the ideas of people that have been dead for generations are embraced by numerous generations ' like slavery</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358535663022</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:01:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358535895001-114</Id><Title>Institutions slowly exiting prior to BA's crash</Title><Msg>I expect the stock to be back in the 60s should BA delay having a long term solution for the battery and what knows what the next problem is.

Sept. 11 2001 was a hard hit for the entire aerospace industry, which saw both a decrease in air travel and big questions about the design of security. Before that, Boeing was still sorting through the details of its acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. in 1997. Experts are in agreement that this is more than a simple fix for Boeing, because of the trend of problems, and because regarding the Dreamliner, it has been one problem after another. Boyd, chairman of The Boyd Group, made a comparison to past new plane rollouts. "Is it going to be like a Lockheed (LMT) Electra that basically put the company out of the passenger airplane business?" Former American Airlines CEO Robert Crandall says the 787 problem can be "very expernsive". Past problems CFO Michael Sears left in 2003 in a procurement scandal -- he later went to jail -- and Boeing CEO Phil Condit quit. Stonecipher resigned in 2005 over an affair with a subordinate. Problems of a HR nature continued, settling cases involving sexual discrimination. On October 10, 2001, Boeing lost to its rival Lockheed Martin in the fierce competition for the multi-billion dollar Joint Strike Fighter contract. Boeing's entry, the X-32, was rejected in favor of Lockheed's X-35 entrant. Boeing continues to serve as the prime contractor on the International Space Station and has built several of the major components. , Boeing lost ground to Airbus and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in 2003. Multiple Boeing projects were pursued and then canceled, notably the Sonic Cruiser, a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the speed of sound, cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as 20 percent. It was launched in 2001 along with a new advertising campaign to promote the company's new motto, "Forever New Frontiers", and to rehabilitate its image. However, the plane's fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent weak economy and increase in fuel prices. The continued problems, with the focus being in the Dreamliner, indicate a deeper problem than a battery. This should be the concern of investors, not so much how they will get around the recent battery issue, but that this is a structural design flaw both in the product, and in the company. Sell Boeing The obvious trade to capitalize on the trend of the Dreamliner's problems is to sell.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358538346878</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:45:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358538371180-127</Id><Topic><Title>Obama’s other aholesex partners</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1358536264658</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:11:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Liars like you are generally #$%$ themselves and are somehow trying to smear somebody they hate like most straights</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1358538371180</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:46:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358538561664-128</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Reaches Endgame</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358538346878</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:45:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dell when are you going to come clean about your termination from Boeing??

He said authorities must first fully investigate the batteries linked to recent incidents, and he could not predict when flights would resume. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday temporarily grounded the 787 after a second incident involving battery failures caused one of the Dreamliner passenger jets to make an emergency landing in Japan. The grounding came less than a week after Boeing and U.S. federal authorities reassured the public of the safety of the new-generation plane. During a press conference last week LaHood went as far as to say he would have "absolutely no reservations about boarding one of these planes and taking a flight." When pressed by reporters on Friday about whether he regretted his prior statements, LaHood said, "Last week it was safe." What has changed since then, he said, is the fact that another incident occurred involving the lithium-ion battery installed in 787s. Such batteries pack more energy and weigh less but are also potentially more volatile.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358540329808</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 15:18:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358540699528-135</Id><Topic><Title>The 787 isn't the only thing that BA builds.</Title><Username>laylow1991</Username><Timestamp>1358452764814</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 14:59:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If it takes a year Boeing will not go BK.

It doesn't matter what type of battery is being used. If a battery is depleted of power and a fast charge is implemented there will be problems. I've had a thermal runaway with NI Cad batteries 3 times. They can explode if not isolated from the electrical system. In one case we landed and the battery continued to overheat after we isolated the battery in flight. It may be a simple fix by controlling the output of the charging system. As I have pointed out before, all these battery problems have been during ground operations from the APU charging system. Some aircraft took off and quickly noticed the problem. If after takeoff there is no battery problem then not to worry.</Msg><Username>laylow1991</Username><Timestamp>1358544982671</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 16:36:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358545500284-157</Id><Title>Republicans Imaginary Girl Friend that Died = Deficit reduction</Title><Msg>neutered little boys</Msg><Username>trader.quick</Username><Timestamp>1358545500284</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 16:45:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358545571910-158</Id><Title>Iran needs to be nuclear armed to save itself</Title><Msg>Libya gave up its nuke program in 2005, agreed to end all insurgent activity and was wiped off the map.

THe latest is the requirement to wear an RFID tracking chip at a pilot program at a school district in Texas....obviously to see how students will react so the program can be implemented on a National level. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Having lost her appeal, 15 year-old student Andrea Hernandez is leaving John Jay High School after school officials denied her request to allow her to continue her "education uninterrupted" by permitting her to use her old (chipless) ID badge which "does not signify participation in a program which I believe conflicts with my religious beliefs." In her handwritten letter, Hernandez writes: "I do not wish to wear the new badge, even without the RFID chip, because it signifies participation in the program." Hernandez, who has been threatened with expulsion for refusing to wear a chipless RFID tracking badge, had her request for a preliminary injunction denied by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Western District of Texas. Rutherford Institute attorneys argue the school is violating her rights under Texas' Religious Freedom Act and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. "The case will definitely move forward now, and hopefully, we will eventually find justice in the courts," John W. Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute says. Hernandez is hoping the school will compromise. "If they did in their heels, however, she will have to change schools," Rutherford told "The Right Views."</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358549303761</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:48:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358549418781-172</Id><Topic><Title>What has the NRA done for America !!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358548136299</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:28:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Im not a fan of the NRA either.

Boeing says production is not stopping. The plane is assembled in Everett, Wash., and North Charleston, S.C. out of pieces built all over the world. The Federal Aviation Administration has grounded the 787s currently in use until Boeing can prove the batteries are safe. The FAA's emergency airworthiness directive issued late Wednesday said the 787's battery system would need to be modified, "or other actions" taken, under a method approved by the FAA. However, the agency has not said what those actions should be. Boeing said deliveries are stopped until an FAA-approved fix has been carried out. The FAA has said it is working on a fix but it has not said how long it will take. Boeing's move is not surprising. Many experts had suspected that airlines would not accept new 787s from the company until the FAA directive was carried out Boeing and the FAA have already certified the battery system is safe, so now the testing standards and the engineering may be a system wide fix, this will ground the 787 for a longer time than many message board users seem to think will happed. If you trade a stock chart on 1-9-2013 Boeing was a sell, Phil Grande also said that on his radio show, the #1 stock chart trader in the USA.

Stumbling upon the fact that you do not necessarily have a competent grasp of reality, that you have in fact been duped for most of your life, is not a pleasant experience. While it may be a living nightmare to realize that part of one’s life was, perhaps, wasted on the false ideas of others, enlightenment often requires that the worldview that we were indoctrinated with be completely destroyed before we can finally resurrect a tangible identity and belief system. To have rebirth, something must first die… In 2004, I found myself at such a crossroads. At that time I was a dedicated Democrat, and I thought I had it all figured out. The Republican Party was to me a perfect sort of monster. They had everything! Corporate puppet masters. Warmongering zealots. Fake Christians. Orwellian social policies. The Bush years were a special kind of horror. It was cinematic. Shakespearean. If I was to tell a story of absolute villainy, I would merely describe the mass insanity and bloodlust days of doom and dread wrought by the Neo-Con ilk in the early years of the new millennium. But, of course, I was partly naïve… The campaign rhetoric of John Kerry was eye opening. I waited, day after day, month after month for my party’s candidate to take a hard stance on the illegal wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I waited for a battle cry against the Patriot Act and the unconstitutional intrusions of the Executive Branch into the lives of innocent citizens. I waited for a clear vision, a spark of wisdom and common sense. I waited for the whole of the election for that man to finally embrace the feelings of his supporters and say, with absolute resolve, that the broken nation we now lived in would be returned to its original foundations. That civil liberty, freedom, and peace, would be our standard once again. Unfortunately, the words never came, and I realized, he had no opposition to the Bush plan. He was not going to fight against the wars, the revolving door, or the trampling of our freedoms. Indeed, it seemed as though he had no intention of winning at all. I came to see a dark side to the Democratic Party that had always been there but which I had refused to acknowledge. Their leadership was no different than the Neo-Cons that I despised. On top of this, many supporters of the Democratic establishment had no values, and no principles. Their only desire was to “win” at any cost. They would get their “perfect society” at any cost, even if they had to chain us all together to do it. There was no doubt in my mind that if the Democrats reoccupied the White House or any other political power structure one day, they would immediately adopt the same exact policies and attitudes of the Neo-Conservatives, and become just as power-mad if not more so. In 2008 my theory was proven unequivocally correct. It really is amazing. I have seen the so-called “anti-war” party become the most accommodating cheerleader of laser guided death and domination in the Middle East, with predator drones operating in the sovereign skies of multiple countries raining missiles upon far more civilians than “enemy combatants”, all at the behest of Barack Obama. I have seen the “party of civil liberties” expand on every Constitution crushing policy of the Bush Administration, while levying some of the most draconian legislation ever witnessed in the history of this country. I have seen Obama endorse enemy combatant status for American citizens, and the end of due process under the law through the NDAA. I have seen him endorse the end of trial by jury. I have seen him endorse secret assassination lists, and the federally drafted murder of U.S. civilians. I have seen him endorse executive orders which open the path to the declaration of a “national emergency” at any time for any reason allowing for the dissolution of most constitutional rights and the unleashing of martial law.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358558962049</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 20:29:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358558979171-205</Id><Topic><Title>Why do White Liberals Seem so Angry at White People?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1358544177653</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 16:22:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Offends valueless liberals.

Yet, many average Democrats actually defend this behavior from their party. The same behavior they once railed against under Bush. However, I have not come here to admonish Democrats (at least not most of them). I used to be just like them. I used to believe in the game. I believed that the rules mattered, and that it was possible to change things by those rules with patience and effort. I believed in non-violent resistance, protest, civil dissent, educational activism, etc. I thought that the courts were an avenue for political justice. I believed that the only element required to end corruption would be a sound argument and solid logic backed by an emotional appeal to reason. I believed in the power of elections, and had faith in the idea that all we needed was the “right candidate” to lead us to the promise land. Again, I believed in the game. The problem is, the way the world works and the way we WISH the world worked are not always congruent. Attempting to renovate a criminal system while acting within the rigged confines of that system is futile, not to mention delusional. Corrupt oligarchies adhere to the standards of civility only as long as they feel the need to maintain the illusion of the moral high ground. Once they have enough control, the mask always comes off, the rotten core is revealed, and immediate violence against dissent commences. Sometimes the only solutions left in the face of tyranny are not peaceful. Logic, reason, and justice are not revered in a legal system which serves the will of the power elite instead of the common man. The most beautiful of arguments are but meaningless flitters of hot air in the ears of sociopaths. Sometimes, the bully just needs to be punched in the teeth. This philosophy of independent action is consistently demonized, regardless of how practical it really is when faced with the facts. The usual responses to the concept of full defiance are accusations of extremism and malicious intent. Believe me, when I embarked on the path towards the truth in 2004, I never thought I would one day be called a potential “homegrown terrorist”, but that is essentially where we are in America in 2013. To step outside the mainstream and question the validity of the game is akin to terrorism in the eyes of the state and the sad cowardly people who feed the machine. During the rise of any despotic governmental structure, there is always a section of the population that is given special treatment, and made to feel as though they are “on the winning team”. For now, it would appear that the “Left” side of the political spectrum has been chosen by the establishment as the favored sons and daughters of the restructured centralized U.S. However, before those of you on the Left get too comfortable in your new position as the hand of globalization, I would like to appeal to you for a moment of unbiased consideration. I know from personal experience that there are Democrats out there who are actually far more like we constitutionalists and “right wing extremists” than they may realize. I ask that you take the following points into account, regardless of what the system decides to label us… We Are Being Divided By False Party Paradigms Many Democrats and Republicans are not stupid, and want above all else to see the tenets of freedom respected and protected. Unfortunately, they also tend to believe that only their particular political party is the true defender of liberty. The bottom line is, at the top of each party there is very little if any discernible difference between the two. If you ignore all the rhetoric and only look at action, the Republican and Democratic leadership are essentially the same animal working for the same special interests. There is no left and right; only those who wish to be free, and those who wish to control. Last year, the “Left and the “Right” experienced an incredible moment of unity after the introduction of the NDAA. People on both sides were able to see the terrifying implications of a law that allows the government to treat any American civilian as an enemy of war without right to trial. In 2013, the establishment is attempting to divide us once again with the issue of gun disarmament. I have already presented my position on gun rights in numerous other articles and I believe my stance is unshakeable. But, what I will ask anti-gun proponents and on-the-fence Democrats is this: How do you think legislation like the NDAA will be enforced in the future? Is it not far easier to threaten Americans with rendition, torture, and assassination when they are completely unarmed? If you oppose the NDAA, you should also oppose any measure which gives teeth to the NDAA, including the debasement of the 2nd Amendment. Democrats Are Looking For Help In The Wrong Place Strangely, Democrats very often search for redress within the very system they know is criminal. For some reason, they think that if they bash their heads into the wall long enough, a door will suddenly appear. I’m here to tell you, there is no door. The biggest difference between progressives and conservatives is that progressives consistently look to government to solve all the troubles of the world, when government is usually the CAUSE of all the troubles in the world. The most common Democratic argument is that in America the government “is what we make it”, and we can change it anytime we like through the election process. Maybe this was true at one time, but not anymore. Just look at Barack Obama! I would ask all those on the Left to take an honest look at the policies of Obama compared to the policies of most Neo-Cons, especially when it comes to constitutional liberties. Where is the end to Middle Eastern war? Where is the end to domestic spy programs? Where is the end to incessant and dictatorial executive orders? Where is the conflict between the Neo-Cons and the Neo-Liberals? And, before you point at the gun control debate, I suggest you look at Obama’s gun policies compared to Mitt Romney’s and John McCain’s – there is almost no difference whatsoever… If the two party system becomes a one party system, then elections are meaningless, and electing a new set of corrupt politicians will not help us.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358559051774</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 20:30:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358559077630-207</Id><Topic><Title>A Message to the "Left" from a Right wing Extremist !!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358558962049</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 20:29:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Democrats Value Social Units When They Should Value Individuals Instead Democrats tend to see everything in terms of groups. Victim status groups, religious groups, racial groups, special interest groups, etc. They want to focus on the health of the whole world as if it is a single entity. It is not. Without individuals, there is no such thing as “groups”, and what we might categorize as groups change and disperse without notice. Groups do not exist beyond shared values, and even then, the individual is still more important in the grand scheme of things. As a former Democrat, I know that the obsession with group status makes it easy to fall into the trap of collectivism. It is easy to think that what is best for you must be best for everybody. This Utopian idealism is incredibly fallible. Wanting the best for everyone is a noble sentiment, but using government as a weapon to force your particular vision of the “greater good” on others leads to nothing but disaster. The only safe and reasonable course is to allow individuals to choose for themselves how they will function in society IF they choose to participate at all. Government must be left out of the equation as much as possible. Its primary job should be to safeguard the individual’s right to choose how he will live. You have to get over the fact that there is no such thing as a perfect social order, and even if there was, no government is capable of making it happen for you. Democrats Can Become As Power-Mad As Any Neo-Con I think it is important to point out how quickly most Democratic values went out the door as soon as Barack Obama was placed in the White House. Let’s be clear; you cannot claim to be anti-war, anti-torture, anti-assassination, anti-surveillance, anti-corporate, anti-bank, anti-rendition, etc. while defending the policies of Obama at the same time. This is hypocrisy. I have heard some insane arguments from left leaning proponents lately. Some admit that Obama does indeed murder and torture, but “at least he is pushing for universal health care…”. Even if it did work (which it won’t), is Obamacare really worth having a president who is willing to murder children on the other side of the world and black-bag citizens here at home? Do not forget your moral compass just because you think the system is now your personal playground. If you do, you are no better than all the angry bloodcrazed Republicans that bumbled into the Iraq War while blindly following George W. Bush. There Is A Difference Between Traditional Conservatives And Neo-Cons Neo-Cons are not conservative. They are in fact socialist in their methods, and they always expand government spending and power while reducing constitutional protections. The “Liberty Movement”, of which I am proudly a part, is traditional conservative. We believe that government, especially as corrupt as it is today, cannot be trusted to administrate and nursemaid over every individual in our nation. It has proven time after time that it caters only to criminally inclined circles of elites. Therefore, we seek to reduce the size and influence of government so that we can minimize the damage that it is doing. For this, we are called “extremists”. Governments are not omnipotent. They are not above criticism, or even punishment. They are merely a collection of individuals who act either with honor or dishonor. In the Liberty Movement, we treat a corrupt government just as we would treat a corrupt individual. We do not worship the image of the state, nor should any Democrat. Liberty Minded Conservatives Are Not “Terrorists” There will come a time, very soon I believe, when people like me are officially labeled “terrorists”. Perhaps because we refuse gun registration or confiscation. Perhaps because we develop alternative trade markets outside the system. Maybe because some of us are targeted by federal raids, and we fight back instead of submitting. Maybe because we speak out against the establishment during a time of “declared crisis”, and speech critical of the government is labeled “harmful to the public good”. One way or another, whether you want to believe me now or not, the day is coming. Before this occurs, and the mainstream media attacks us viciously as “conspiracy theorists” and traitors, I want the Left to understand that no matter what you may hear about us, our only purpose is to ensure that our natural rights are not violated, our country is not decimated, and our republic is governed with full transparency. We are not the dumb redneck racist hillbilly gun nuts you see in every primetime TV show, and anyone who acts out of personal bias and disdain for their fellow man is not someone we seek to associate with. We fight because we have no other choice. Our conscience demands that we oppose centralized tyranny. We do what we do because the only other option is subservience and slavery. Many of the people I have dealt with in the Liberty Movement are the most intelligent, well-informed, principled and dedicated men and women I have ever met. They want, basically, what most of us want; to be free to determine their own destinies. To be free to speak their minds without threat of state retribution. To be free to defend themselves from any enemy that would seek to oppress them. To live within an economic environment that is not rigged in favor of elitist minorities and on the verge of engineered collapse. To live in a system that respects justice and legitimate law instead of using the law as a sword against the public. To wake up each day with solace in the knowledge that while life in many regards will always be a difficult thing, we still have the means to make it better for ourselves and for the next generation. To wake up knowing that those inner elements of the human heart which make us most unique and most endearing are no longer considered “aberrant”, and are no longer under threat.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358559077630</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 20:31:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358559399163-208</Id><Topic><Title>Why do White Liberals Seem so Angry at White People?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1358544177653</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 16:22:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama never made those comments you allude to.

Not 100% safe! Boeing had to prove to the FAA that these batteries would never ignite as part of the 787 certification and if they did ignite they would not explode. Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 25 [Docket No. NM375 Special Conditions No. 25-359-SC]. I guess fire is ok then ! So trust Boeing now or the FAA ? Remember the new saying if it's a outcourced 787, then I am not going. The only item on the plane that was engineered by SPEEA Everett Engineers is the Boeing logo on the plane. Boeing Reaches Endgame, Culmination Of Decade Of Problems With 'Nightmareliner' Boeing's problems have spanned a decade. Sept. 11 2001 was a hard hit for the entire aerospace industry, which saw both a decrease in air travel and big questions about the design of security. Before that, Boeing was still sorting through the details of its acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. in 1997. Experts are in agreement that this is more than a simple fix for Boeing, because of the trend of problems, and because regarding the Dreamliner, it has been one problem after another. Boyd, chairman of The Boyd Group, made a comparison to past new plane rollouts. "Is it going to be like a Lockheed (LMT) Electra that basically put the company out of the passenger airplane business?" Former American Airlines CEO Robert Crandall says the 787 problem can be "very expernsive". Past problems CFO Michael Sears left in 2003 in a procurement scandal -- he later went to jail -- and Boeing CEO Phil Condit quit. Stonecipher resigned in 2005 over an affair with a subordinate. Problems of a HR nature continued, settling cases involving sexual discrimination. On October 10, 2001, Boeing lost to its rival Lockheed Martin in the fierce competition for the multi-billion dollar Joint Strike Fighter contract. Boeing's entry, the X-32, was rejected in favor of Lockheed's X-35 entrant. Boeing continues to serve as the prime contractor on the International Space Station and has built several of the major components. , Boeing lost ground to Airbus and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in 2003. Multiple Boeing projects were pursued and then canceled, notably the Sonic Cruiser, a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the speed of sound, cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as 20 percent. It was launched in 2001 along with a new advertising campaign to promote the company's new motto, "Forever New Frontiers", and to rehabilitate its image. However, the plane's fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent weak economy and increase in fuel prices. The continued problems, with the focus being in the Dreamliner, indicate a deeper problem than a battery. This should be the concern of investors, not so much how they will get around the recent battery issue, but that this is a structural design flaw both in the product, and in the company. Sell Boeing The obvious trade to capitalize on the trend of the Dreamliner's problems is to sell. .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358560772061</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 20:59:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358561851066-210</Id><Title>Obama's affinity with others</Title><Msg>Yes, Obama is definately an (_o_) HOLE that Democrats can Unite With when having Backdoor Sex.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1358561851066</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 21:17:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358562141319-211</Id><Topic><Title>Remeber THE Russian Dreamliner?</Title><Username>boulmichone</Username><Timestamp>1358538003390</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:40:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was pilot error.
