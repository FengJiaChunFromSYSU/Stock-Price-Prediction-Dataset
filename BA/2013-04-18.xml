What do you do, sir? -- Variously attributed. As an honest answer, I've been persuaded and have changed my mind on something. Readers of this column know that I own more than a few firearms. They also know that I've often written, positively, regarding responsible firearm use and ownership, and will continue to do so in the future. However, I'm also the grandfather of a 7-year-old angel named Lori and, before she moved to Texas, I was a volunteer in her second-grade classroom. Because of that, and since the shootings in Newtown, there hasn't been a waking hour wherein I haven't thought, "There, but for the grace of God..." I've been thinking about other things too. More so since hearing the speech given by Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the NRA. I'd waited for that speech -- hoping it would include an offer to throw the weight, resources, and expertise of the NRA into an all-out effort to find solutions to the mass killings that've occurred in this nation. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Disappointed that there wasn't some acknowledgment that the right to "Keep and Bear Arms" must be balanced by a child's right to live. Disappointed at the tone. Disappointed at the narrowness of the proposed plan. As one proposal in an "all fronts" effort to end these tragedies, certainly worthwhile, but as the sole solution? Hardly. There isn't a "one idea will fix everything" solution to what we're facing and anything we do will, likely, not have provable effects in the short term. Society cooked this elephant and it'll have to be eaten one bite at a time. Still, that's not an excuse for us to avoid considering as many roadblocks to carnage as can be found to put in the paths of the killers amongst us.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366263226837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 01:33:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366263341374-5</Id><Topic><Title>Uncommon Sense About Civilian Firearms</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366263226837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 01:33:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If we want to consider possible steps, here's one. We could stop caring about how a firearm looks. Looks are cosmetic. Where we need to focus is on "what" and, more importantly, "how many" come out of the muzzle. Simply put, we need to decrease the volume of fire. In the area of military look-alike rifles, limiting the capacity of existing magazines or even banning "large capacity" magazines won't be effective as long as electrical tape exists. Limit any magazine to "X" (5, 10, 15, etc.) rounds and anyone can tape three together and we're back to square one in less time than it takes to read this sentence. Think, instead, of requiring civilian versions of such rifles to be designed with fixed, non-detachable magazines holding fewer rounds (I'm now for low, single digits) that have to be hand-loaded through the ejection port. This would slow things down by an order of magnitude. Further, every other idea must be on the table and given equal consideration. Better guidelines for identifying and getting the mentally disturbed into (funded) treatment. Denial of sales to those with serious and ongoing mental problems. Swift and harsh punishment for crimes involving the use of firearms. Legal accountability for incidents involving firearms not adequately secured. Ensuring that background checks occur with every purchase -- no matter where made. Consider a direct, federal tax credit equal to the current retail price of the firearm for anyone wishing to turn one in. Consider safety education in schools and required training when a firearm is purchased. Consider where media violence, games, movies, and a declining respect for authority and personal accountability have led us.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366263341374</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 01:35:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366263825272-6</Id><Topic><Title>Uncommon Sense About Civilian Firearms</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366263226837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 01:33:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Neither side will get everything (See: Compromise, n.) they wish. The hard-over, anti-gun faction will shout that anything short of banning everything including (dull) butter knives isn't enough and the pro-gun hardliners will swear that Dillon M134D Gatling Guns (chambered in 7.62mm Nato and capable of 3,000 rounds per minute) should be available to everyone -- "just in case." I've changed my mind about round capacity in these firearms because I believe that it's one, small "roadblock to carnage" that's needed. Too, I keep imagining those kids facing a literal fusillade of bullets in their last moments and, in my own worst moments, I can put my granddaughter's face into that picture. And, if that image wouldn't change a person's mind, I'm not sure what would. Finally, if such thinking makes someone the face of the "enemy" -- to either side -- then things are nowhere near as bad as we think. They are, in fact, far worse.

Tune in at any time over the next several months, and you'll likely hear the same arguments that have been going back and forth since this entire mess began. That said, I'll make a prediction regarding "assault weapon" bans and 10-round limits in magazines. If they're passed, neither will make a bit of difference. As regards "assault weapons," realistically, that horse has long since left the barn. There are millions of these rifles already out there, and more being sold each day. Thus, unless you want to debate confiscation or a mandatory turn-in (good luck with either one), the point is already settled. We couldn't control alcohol during Prohibition, and let's see a show of hands from those who believe we've got illegal drugs under control. The same would be true for these rifles. Further, what's being pointed at is purely cosmetic and cosmetics, in a rifle, don't kill.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366269212021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 03:13:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366269746404-9</Id><Topic><Title>More Uncommon Sense About Civilian Firearms</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366269212021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 03:13:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>test.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366269746404</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 03:22:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366270854694-10</Id><Topic><Title>More Uncommon Sense About Civilian Firearms</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366269212021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 03:13:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apparently one may post uncommon sense, as long as it isn't done too frequently.

The Airbus CEO made considerably less money and he has returned over 119% ( as of today 4-18-13) for their investors . bark and ouch for Boeing investors. Boeing investors should look for a better return on investment. The Dreamliner plane that McNerney is responsible for , the 787 is almost 4 years late, still not certified , and is 33 billion dollars over the original cost budget. Mr. McNerney was asked to leave his last job with GE as the GE CEO said he was not good enough. Mr. McNerney did much worst at 3M than the CEO that took over for him . bark and ouch Mr McNerney can not take any credit for the old 737, but can be credited with the newest version that need 1000 plane call backs to replace the fasteners on his watch. The man can also take credit for the extended 747 which is two year late and 2 billion over budget and not selling as predicted. The 777 was Phil Condit and Allan Mulallys plane and until Mr. McNerney messes with it , it will continue to be a winner. So until Mr. McNerney and his hand picked enabler Board of Directors are gone stay away from Boeing stock . I visited with a Boeing employee today at a social event. He told me the 787 has many more problems and to sell your boeing stock if you have any. He said Boeing purchased a bankrupt MD and then followed the same outsourcing plan that bankrupted MD.

Really ignorant people like the Kent Raven thinks Social Security is an investment. OK, here's the deal on Gold and silver. Ben Bernanke with his perpetual quantitative easing is creating money at 6 times the almost non-existent GDP growth rate. The government spends a lot of time lying about how low the inflation rate is. If you're a victim of socialized government education you won't be able to put two and two together and understand what this means. However, if you like insuring a portion of your wealth against the ability of the government to reach into your bank accounts and take whatever portion of your wealth they wish to take through a form of taxation known as inflation then gold and silver are good insurance policies. Insurance is not something you trade but if it gets cheaper, as it sometimes does, it's a good time to buy a little more if you need it. View gold and silver the same way.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1366295098645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:24:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366295372729-32</Id><Topic><Title>When the people fear their government, there is tyranny</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1366293014800</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:50:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good Quotes X.......one of my favorite TJ quotes is: "To take from one because it is thought that his own industry and that of his father’s has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers, have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association—the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it.

For years, we've been struggling with an issue that is as capable of rousing emotions and, seemingly, as intractable as abortion. But then came Newtown, and there was a window of time during which almost everyone recognized that something or some things needed to change. That common ground had to be found in the sea of distrust that now exists regarding the ownership and use of firearms. Sadly, I believe that window is closing and that the whole discussion is, yet again, going nowhere. The reason I say this is that there's all too much evidence that people on both "sides" are being driven deeper into their respective trenches and that the "No Man's Land" of compromise is becoming wider by the day. An example: "Citadel communities." In a recent column in this paper, Sid Schwab spent a few hundred words on such communities being proposed in Idaho. I'd also mentioned them in a column wherein I noted that P.T. Barnum would've enthusiastically approved of the idea. Sid isn't a believer in them. Nor am I -- for many of the reasons he stated. Another being that, during my time as a gunnery officer on a destroyer in Vietnam, I found it easier to deal with opponents when they were concentrated in one spot. Cannon fire, if the government is truly coming, really makes an impression on those who occupy a confined area. And this was long before the common use of cruise missiles, laser guided munitions, drones, or what have you. Too, there's a certain law of combat that states: "If you make it impossible for the bad guys to get in, then you're going to have a hard time getting out." Which made sieges all the rage back when. The entire idea is best characterized as fantasy.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366296073544</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:41:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366296150570-37</Id><Topic><Title>Even More Uncommon Sense About Civilian Firearms</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366296073544</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:41:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>test.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366296150570</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:42:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366296230022-38</Id><Topic><Title>Even More Uncommon Sense About Civilian Firearms</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366296073544</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:41:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmmm, same problem.....</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366296230022</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:43:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366297060363-39</Id><Topic><Title>Keep Youre Eye on Gold or Silver</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1366295098645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:24:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Someday the bottoms going to drop right out of your insurance policy than you going to just be a poor arrogant slob instead of a a rich arrogant slob.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1366297060363</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:57:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366297770280-40</Id><Title>Obama similar to President Lincoln</Title><Msg>... that the people Love him !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1366297770280</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:09:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366298375725-41</Id><Topic><Title>A Senate in the Gun Lobby’s Grip</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1366248919118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 21:35:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>censored err bumper err fascist err loser err delusional err spaz</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1366298375725</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:19:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366298426399-42</Id><Topic><Title>Common NonSense</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1366287455194</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 08:17:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spaz err censored err original garbage shovel expert err bumper</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1366298426399</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:20:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366298527379-43</Id><Topic><Title>If I move to South America, Will I be An American-American</Title><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1366128627983</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 12:10:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hyphenated - Americans are grammatically correct...and everything.</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1366298527379</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:22:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366298546735-44</Id><Title>the saudi connection</Title><Msg>looks like the fix is in. {{Obama Covering Up Saudi Link to Boston Bombing?}}</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1366298546735</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:22:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366298650852-45</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing CEO made the list of the top 20 paid CEOs, but the shareholders have made less than 5% in 5 years ouch , bark</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1366170938186</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 23:55:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4-18-13 update YTD BA up 14% and for 5 years up 4.34% , Airbus up 21% ytd and 5 years up 117% cnn money stock charts.

Today's Boeing top management is really a photocopy of a outsourced and bankrupt MD company that Phil Condit purchased before he was shown the door. So that is why your Boeing stock has only increased 4.34% in 5 years while Airbus is up 117%. Get it now ? Boeing is adding to the duties of( independent- sure you betcha) lead director Ken Duberstein as it seeks to head off a proposal to split the roles of chief executive officer and chairman that investors will vote on in two weeks.

On Wednesday, his considerable influence wasn’t quite enough. The former Beatle joined Tony Bennett's campaign for tightening U.S. gun laws -- Voices Against Violence. The British legend encouraged Americans to send a text, which led to the singer's message and connected the caller to their local Senate office after providing a zip code. His voice can be heard by Americans who send a text reading “MYVOICE” to 877877. A cast of celebrities and artists are supporting the initiative, including Gloria Estefan, Josh Groban and Juanes. The campaign, though, hit a major hurdle when the Senate on Wednesday voted-down a package of gun reforms, which were drafted in response to the Newtown school massacre. The 54-46 vote fell along party lines; most Democrats supported the legislation while and most Republicans rejected it. President Barack Obama went on to describe the Senate’s rejection of gun control as a “shameful” day for Washington. Obama has vowed to continue to the fight. And Bennett too has promised that his campaign will go on. Bennett also retweeted a comment from John Legend, who wrote, “Shame on our senate. Wow. Vote these cowards out next year.” McCartney knows only too well the damage firearms can do in the wrong hands. His former bandmate John Lennon was shot dead by a deranged fan in 1980. On March 20 of this year, on what would have been their 44th wedding anniversary, Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono made her own a plea for tougher gun control in the U.S when she tweeted a photo of the blood-spattered glasses her husband was wearing when he was killed.</Msg><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1366303390767</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 12:43:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366303400007-74</Id><Topic><Title>More Uncommon Sense About Civilian Firearms</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366269212021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 03:13:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A pistol grip won't kill you. Nor will barrel shrouds, bayonet lugs, collapsible stocks, accessory rails, laser pointers, flashlights, or what have you. At the end of the day, these are still simply semi-automatic rifles. Nothing more. Nothing less. What does kill, as noted in another column, is "what," "how quickly," and "how many" are coming out of the muzzle and headed your way. And, there, we meet with the 10-round magazine capacity which is, basically, pointless as currently proposed. Pointless, unless you re-design the rifle so as to make reloading (and detachable magazines don't help with this) a much slower process. Talk with any experienced firearms owner and they'll explain how anyone with access to electrical tape can marry two or three detachable magazines together and, voilà!, we're back to 30 rounds which can be brought into action in the space of seconds. Further, with high-capacity magazines (for which I don't see a need), you have the same problem as with the military-look-alike rifles. The horse and barn scenario. There are millions already out there and they're not going to disappear either. Like it or not, that's the reality of the situation. As for the executive orders -- universal background checks, better/quicker exchange of information between law enforcement agencies, attempting to get our mental health programs into better shape, research into the causes of gun violence, etc., -- many of the steps may help, sorely need to be tried, and some are, in fact, long overdue. With that, I'd like to mention something else. As a firearms owner, I'd also like to see a balance, an equality of effort, and an even-handed rationing of assets and funding in attacking this problem we face.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366303400007</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 12:43:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366303450100-75</Id><Topic><Title>When Peaople Actually Achieve the American Dream........</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1366301735234</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 12:15:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is usually organized crime and government that are the only barriers to accomplishment.

The problem remains that, as long as we're talking detachable magazines, none of these will make any difference since the magazines can still be taped together and, then, inserted, fired, and replaced in seconds. That said, we firearm owners should honestly and constantly ask ourselves why 30 to 100 round magazines are necessary in a civilized society. We basically won World War II with the M1 Garand -- a semi-automatic rifle with an eight round en-bloc magazine. Then there are other legislative proposals such as the one in Missouri "that would force gun owners to either surrender or destroy weapons including semi-automatic rifles with detachable magazines and semi-automatic pistols with a fixed magazine that can shoot more than 10 rounds before being reloaded." Gun owners who did not comply within 90 days would be charged with a Class C felony. This led to a counter proposal that would make "any member of the (Missouri) general assembly who proposes legislation that further restricts an individual's right to bear arms ... guilty of a class D felony." Neither bill, thankfully, was expected to pass. In our own state, there's SB 5737 which initially included the following: "In order to continue to possess an assault weapon that was legally possessed on the effective date of this section, the person possessing shall ... safely and securely store the assault weapon. The sheriff of the county may, no more than once per year, conduct an inspection to ensure compliance with this subsection." Imagine that. Elected representatives proposing annual "inspection" visits by the constabulary into the private homes of citizens who have broken no laws whatsoever.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366303567759</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 12:46:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366303609199-78</Id><Topic><Title>More Uncommon Sense About Civilian Firearms</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366269212021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 03:13:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>liberals (misnomer) know how to kill people, huh spart, err chrissie by the millions</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1366303609199</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 12:46:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366303613623-79</Id><Topic><Title>Even More Uncommon Sense About Civilian Firearms</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1366296073544</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:41:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The reaction to this -- from even staunch liberals -- was such that even the prime sponsor, Sen.

I'd like to believe that effective measures are forthcoming, that the issues of the troubled individuals behind the triggers and the effects of video games and other media will receive the same attention as magazines and semi-automatic rifles, but I don't.

The sacrifice referred to was of living children consumed in the fires of offering to Moloch. Ever since then, worship of Moloch has been the sign of a deeply degraded culture. Ancient Romans justified the destruction of Carthage by noting that children were sacrificed to Moloch there. Milton represented Moloch as the first pagan god who joined Satan’s war on humankind: First Moloch, horrid king, besmear’d with blood Of human sacrifice, and parents’ tears, Though for the noise of Drums and Timbrels loud Their children’s cries unheard, that pass’d through fire To his grim idol. (Paradise Lost 1.392-96) Read again those lines, with recent images seared into our brains—“besmeared with blood” and “parents’ tears.” They give the real meaning of what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary School Friday morning. That horror cannot be blamed just on one unhinged person. It was the sacrifice we as a culture made, and continually make, to our demonic god. We guarantee that crazed man after crazed man will have a flood of killing power readily supplied him. We have to make that offering, out of devotion to our Moloch, our god. The gun is our Moloch. We sacrifice children to him daily—sometimes, as at Sandy Hook, by directly throwing them into the fire-hose of bullets from our protected private killing machines, sometimes by blighting our children’s lives by the death of a parent, a schoolmate, a teacher, a protector. Sometimes this is done by mass killings (eight this year), sometimes by private offerings to the god (thousands this year). The gun is not a mere tool, a bit of technology, a political issue, a point of debate. It is an object of reverence. Devotion to it precludes interruption with the sacrifices it entails. Like most gods, it does what it will, and cannot be questioned. Its acolytes think it is capable only of good things. It guarantees life and safety and freedom. It even guarantees law. Law grows from it. Then how can law question it? Its power to do good is matched by its incapacity to do anything wrong. It cannot kill. Thwarting the god is what kills. If it seems to kill, that is only because the god’s bottomless appetite for death has not been adequately fed. The answer to problems caused by guns is more guns, millions of guns, guns everywhere, carried openly, carried secretly, in bars, in churches, in offices, in government buildings. Only the lack of guns can be a curse, not their beneficent omnipresence. Adoration of Moloch permeates the country, imposing a hushed silence as he works his will. One cannot question his rites, even as the blood is gushing through the idol’s teeth. The White House spokesman invokes the silence of traditional in religious ceremony. “It is not the time” to question Moloch. No time is right for showing disrespect for Moloch.</Msg><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1366307499593</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 13:51:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366307546835-88</Id><Topic><Title>The Battle That Lies Ahead Of Us</Title><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1366307499593</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 13:51:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The fact that the gun is a reverenced god can be seen in its manifold and apparently resistless powers.

We are required to deny that there is any connection between the fact that we have the greatest number of guns in private hands and the greatest number of deaths from them. Denial on this scale always comes from or is protected by religious fundamentalism. Thus do we deny global warming, or evolution, or biblical errancy.

President Obama could not have known that a fertilizer factory would blow a couple of hours after he went on his rant against people who disagree with him. But he could not have not known that all day long the hapless media had been broadcasting speculation and rumor about bombs and bombers in Boston and poison letters in D.C. and that unease is back in the land in a way not felt since 2001. The killers of Sandy Hook, Aurora and Tucson are monsters, hatched in a diseased culture and certain to have future versions already plotting their mayhem. They are, in a word, insane. Terrorists, though, are a much colder, much more dangerous sort of fanatic, and as any reader of The Looming Tower knows – and shame on you if you haven’t bothered to read even this basic primer of the origins of Islamist terror – the threat is not going away any time soon, whether or not any particular bomber or terrorist in this country is an Islamist. (Among those who haven't bothered to read this book – Jim Wallis of Sojourners. Incredible for a man who purports to have much to tell us.) The president’s job is to rally the country against all threats, both foreign and domestic, not to berate and belittle Americans of opposite political opinions, especially in a week of terror. Recall President Obama's words from his first inaugural address: On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics. That theme was missing from the Rose Garden yesterday. The president’s anger at being so visibly and thoroughly defeated – a defeat inflicted in part by members of his own party – led to his display of anger. That anger served no purpose, but it did reveal much. It is really up to other people to proclaim national goals and nation purposes now – Marco Rubio is doing a fine job this week though there will be disagreements ahead about his legislative goals as well – and others will emerge from among governors and perhaps temporarily retired former secretaries of state. But the president has lost it, choosing a week of terrible anguish and no little fear to divide the country rather than unify it and to chide an opposition rather than rally it to a common cause. His failure is not singular. The GOP-led House of Representatives has sunk into a morass of the personal rule of Committee chairs that obstructs even the most obvious reforms such as the repeal of the jobs-destroying medical device tax. Majority Leader Eric Cantor and his chief deputy Kevin McCarthy seem to have adopted a wait-out-the-Speaker’s-last-two-years strategy and trust to the power of redistricting and the enmity engendered by an angry, divisive president to protect their majority through the travails of 2014. That’s a bad bet. It is people like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul – people who are visibly leading and tackling real and difficult problems, often face-to-face with critics – and governors like Scott Walker and John Kasich who are grappling with hard choices who are winning the admiration of voters. There are real leaders in the country. They just aren’t in power in D.C. Yet. Eric Cantor should be among them, leading and visibly calling for his colleagues to rally around hard things that need doing now. The country is hungry for people who will do just that. It is good to remember that principled leadership – firm but never angry, articulate and passionate in defense of its beliefs but open to argument and persuasion – is genuinely charismatic and always necessary. It is important to remember that in a week when so many things and people failed, most obviously the president. Catastrophe illumines suffering but also capacity and character, and their absence.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1366308723318</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:12:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366308940780-96</Id><Topic><Title>the saudi connection</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1366298546735</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:22:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The "i" word mentioned in the link.</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1366308940780</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:15:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366308961874-97</Id><Topic><Title>Obama similar to President Lincoln</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1366297770280</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:09:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Barack Obama won two consecutive landslides for a reason: he is an excellent president.

We have not time to think, no means of calling the mis-managers to account, but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow suffers. Our landholders, too...retaining indeed the title and stewardship of estates called theirs, but held really in trust for the treasury, must...be contented with penury, obscurity and exile.. private fortunes are destroyed by public as well as by private extravagance. This is the tendency of all human governments. A departure from principle becomes a precedent for a second; that second for a third; and so on, till the bulk of society is reduced to mere automatons of misery, to have no sensibilities left but for sinning and suffering... And the fore horse of this frightful team is public debt. Taxation follows that, and in its train wretchedness and oppression."

But I grow weary of so many people who refer to the 'forefathers' as a group of infallible people. And of the people who imply they did everything so much better then than is being done today. People whine today about deficits and borrowing but there would have been no successful conclusion to the Revolution if Alexander Hamilton had not taught the 'forefathers' how to borrow to fund the Revolution. And much of the borrowed money paid salaries to the Continental Congress. And while Benjamin Franklin negotiated goods and services for the US with France, he participated in many salacious activities. Many of the 'forefathers' didn't get along with each other any better then than the sitting congress does now.

Teams of Boeing technical experts are poised to flock to those sites to help airlines do the work. A spokeswoman for Mr. LaHood declined to comment. Boeing said on Thursday that FAA officials also have given the company permission to resume routine Dreamliner production flights that would help determine if various systems are working properly on newly assembled aircraft.

What Boeing Commercial Airplane Vice President of Engineering Mike Delaney did not say in his message to employees announcing the reduction is it comes hand-in-hand with a new push to outsource more 787 engineering and technical work to the Moscow Design Center. Information of the push to send more work to Moscow came from multiple and varied sources within Boeing. “We find it extremely disappointing that Boeing Commercial Airplanes is actively outsourcing engineering work to the Moscow Design Center while laying off employees in the Northwest,” said Ray Goforth, executive director of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), IFPTE Local 2001. SPEEA contract administrators are working to get more information regarding Boeing’s employment reduction. The action, which could include 700 layoffs, will be closely monitored for compliance with SPEEA contracts and company procedures. The union is already working with a number of managers who are helping employees find new positions within Boeing. While the company says it is outsourcing less, key operations continue the push to use contract labor over more experienced and committed full-time Boeing employees. Boeing’s recent decision to move flight simulators from Renton to Miami will also result in the elimination of 36 simulator instructor pilot and five standards pilot positions by the first quarter of 2014.

(BA) resumed production test flights of the 787 Dreamliner with a plane destined for Japan’s ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) while awaiting approval of a fix for the smoldering batteries that spurred the model’s January grounding. The flights were approved without restrictions by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, said Marc Birtel, a spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle. They’re known as functional test check flights and are used to evaluate each 787’s systems before it’s delivered to a customer, he said. Yesterday’s flight from Everett, Washington, home to Boeing’s main widebody-jet factory, was with a Dreamliner outfitted with new batteries and a new containment system, Birtel said.

Now huge shareholders like Ashkenazi Phantom can cash in big while Moscow designs them and China builds them. It's a real good play for the Boeing of tomorrow, but the day after that when the fat cats in Chicago give away the technology who'll end up needing a job. Not them, they've got their golden parachutes. The smart, skilled, highly educated engineering talent over 50 can find they're next job saying "Welcome to Walmart". How do you like that 85% salary cut SPEEA? What a bunch of sheeple! I hope Airbus gets the KC-46 tanker refueling contract rather than let Russia or China have anything to do with it. Don, you sure know how to dispense bad news. I bet billionaire Putin is really laughing it up at the US. They might as well have let Bush give the US ports contracts to the UAE. What great product will the United Corporatocracy of America give the keys away to next?</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1366335159577</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 21:32:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366335554605-184</Id><Topic><Title>Lincoln = Emancipation Proclamation.....Barry = Cash For Clunkers</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1366312215785</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 15:10:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, they both were disasters for most Americans, and they both ignored the constitution whenever it suited their purpose. About 1 out of every 50 Americans died in the civil war. You think that was worth it????
