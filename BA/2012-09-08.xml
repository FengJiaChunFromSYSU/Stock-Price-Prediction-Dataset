All there is are putting greens, the 9th hole green and patios around the restaurant/club house.

They were the ones who hired working Americans and paid their wages. With the rise of Unions the employer - employee relationship is no longer a direct relationship. Employees no longer define themselves as company employees but rather union workers. Employers must deal with unions if it wants a chance to continue to stay in business and continue building the country. There are plus and minuses by the loss of the direct employer and employee relationship, including an ever present tension between employer and employee.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1347159898016</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 23:04:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
