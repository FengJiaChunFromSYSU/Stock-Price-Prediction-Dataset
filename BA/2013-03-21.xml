It must be very serious that's why FAA &amp; NTSB grounded them. 6 emergencies in little more than a month.

If you study the movement of BA stock price and events unfolded day by day , you could see how BA tried to calm public panics by manipulate the stock price . Look at volumes one and two days after 787's grounded. They pump 20 millions shares in each day . That's the different between political sciences and physical sciences. In political sciences , money talk, if you could read chart , you'll make big money. In physical science, money is not the governing force. Not enough hydraulic force, landing gear won't open nor close. Advance electrical system required large and fast movement of energy , battery will baked. In natural science, pigs can't fly. Murphy's law is if anything go wrong, it will go wrong. Any thing go wrong will cost you more and longer than you thought. Bad feng shui will result in bad luck. For example, Chinese believed # 4 as bad luck, death , look at Apollo 13=4, 787=22=4, emergency on runway 22 ???. Now think of # 7s in 7E7 series, as wings of an air plane, and the middle number as body of an airplane. Think of airplanes as birds. All the 707, 717, 727, 737, 747, 767, 777 , all doing fine, because as with flying birds , they all got wings much larger than bodies, Now look at 787. the # 8, represent the body, bigger than #7 represent wings . think of the penguin. can they fly?? . In the flying business of Big Birds, they use all senses, they must be very alert at all times, not sleepy nor dreaming about lines nor circles. May be E RAPIDO or GLOBAL RAYA a better name for 7E7's When you design anything that fly, think like a bird. That is my opinion. I hope BA will get over this soon.

It's hilarious when the communist minded minions start screaming, "but the poor and middle class spend a greater percentage of their income of the necessities of life." These mentally challenged goofballs just can't seem to stand the fact that "rich people" have more money left over after they pay their obligations than do poor and middle class people. So what? Do you want to live in a world where there are no rich people?

The U.S. Senate Commerce committee has postponed until a later date today’s scheduled hearing on aviation safety, where one focus was slated to be Boeing’s 787. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Michael Huerta and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Deborah Hersman were both expected to be questioned on the fix Boeing is now testing for its 787 battery system. The aviation subcommittee is chaired by Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington. A spokesman for Cantwell said the hearing was postponed due to a series of roll call votes scheduled for the time of the hearing. “We’re doing a bunch of budget votes today,” said Cantwell spokesman Jared Leopold. No new date has yet been fixed for the hearing. A top company engineer said the necessary certification tests should be completed by Boeing in 'the next week or two' and that afterward he expects 'timely' FAA approval of the fix."

The bill has already won the approval of Arizona’s State Senate and the Arizona House Financial Institutions Committee which voted the legislation out of committee on a 4-2 vote Monday. The measure now goes to a vote of the Arizona House. Thus far, only the State of Utah has officially recognized gold and silver as legal tender, (See: Gold, silver coins now officially legal tender in Utah) although the issue has been under consideration this year in four states including Arizona. The Arizona bill defines legal tender as a mode of paying debts and taxes. The measure also states that any coin or bullion that has gold or silver content and is issued by the United States Government can be defined as legal tender. However, no one can be compelled to accept coin or bullion containing gold or silver. The measure would also mandate that coin or bullion containing gold or silver issued by the U.S. Government cannot be taxed as property since it is to be considered money. If the Arizona Legislature enacts SC 1439 and Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signs the measure into law, gold and silver would go into effect as legal tender in the state in 2014. However, House Joint Resolution No. 590 --which would have established a joint subcommittee to study whether the Commonwealth of Virginia should adopt a rule recognizing gold or silver billion or gold or silver coin authorized by the U.S. Government as legal currency—died in the Virginia General Assembly’s State Senate last month. In January the South Dakota Legislature rejected House Bill 1100 which would have made U.S. Government-minted gold and silver coins legal tender that could be used to pay state taxes at their market value. Meanwhile, Senate Bill 99, Indiana’s version of recognizing U.S.-issued gold and silver coins as legal tender, appears to be buried in the Indiana State Senate Committee on Tax and Fiscal Policy. The organizations, the Gold Standard Institute and American Principles in Action, have both championed state efforts to rule gold and silver legal tender.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1363890289670</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 14:24:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363890566859-60</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Democrats Hate America's Children</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1363889275245</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 14:07:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>my guess is the same reasons Republicans do the very same thing.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1363890566859</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 14:29:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363892019331-61</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing delivered 27 planes and your point is ?

Spartacus99991, your Boeing Challenge was a debate style and one that you made up . So spartacus just a few days ago you and your fellow Boeing hacks told me to answer the question, I told you I make 25% on a regular basis and today was one of those days just a few days after your most recent challenge debate MO. The answer is ACAD 26% today. and out today Now for a swing stock compared to Boeing SVU for 6 months has made me 96% at my my cost basis. So spartacus99991, that means I can ride it down for more than 5% if I want or get out if it tops Spartacus9991 you can't supervalue now as the train has left the station, it may go up another large amount or not , but one thing is for sure spartacus99991 while you waste your time opinion about Boeing as a Boeing hack , your too late I am sitting in the cat bird seat on SVU your no,t get it now ?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1363893064629</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 15:11:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363893902687-63</Id><Title>Spartacus99991</Title><Msg>Let lying dogs lie.</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1363893902687</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 15:25:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363894371523-64</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing delivered 27 planes and your point is ?

Likewise, the totals attributed to previous presidents appear to have been invented out of whole cloth. G.W. Bush signed 291 executive orders during his eight-year term of office, not 62 as claimed. Ronald Reagan signed 381. It was Franklin D.

Ever wonder why there such wealthy communities of Germans and Italians in places like Brazil, Argentina and Chile? What ever you think of these people, they knew how to protect their wealth and move it vast distances with minimum degradation. Bastiat said this in 1850: "Now, legal plunder can be committed in an infinite number of ways. Thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it: tariffs, protection, benefits, subsidies, encouragements, progressive taxation, public schools, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed profits, minimum wages, a right to relief, a right to the tools of labor, free credit, and so on, and so on. All these plans as a whole—with their common aim of legal plunder—constitute socialism." Of course this has been going on in increasing measure ever since the progressive movement took root with T. Roosevelt. The progressive tax policy was gleaned from the communist manifesto then progressives like FDR, LBJ and GWB found other way to plunder our wealth. But the easy plunder is gone......they've run out of the easy money Big Sis knows it.....she been busy buying up billions of rounds of Ammo and now has refused to tell congress why. Folks the unimaginable, unbelievable happened in Germany......it's happening right here too. A president that thinks he has a right to assassinate an American citizen on American soil without due process is very dangerous person.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1363901465595</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 17:31:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363901815102-95</Id><Topic><Title>Time to look at American Silver Eagles - Yes, the Collapse is Still Coming</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1363898720025</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 16:45:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Silver is a good bet.

They refuse to answer to answer that,” Huelscamp said. “I’ve got a list of various questions of agencies about multiple things. Far from being the most transparent administration in the world, they are the most closed and opaque,” the Congressman added. “They refuse to let us know what is going on, so I don’t really have an answer for that. Multiple members of Congress are asking those questions,” he added. “It comes down to during the budget process, during the appropriations process, are we willing to hold DHS’s feet to the fire?” “We’re going to find out… I say we don’t fund them ’til we get an answer. Those type of things really challenge Americans. They are worried about this administration,” Huelscamp urged. The Congressman’s comments come in the wake of a demand for answers from New Jersey Congressman Leonard Lance on the same subject. “I would like a full explanation as to why that has been done and I have every confidence that the oversight committee ….should ask those questions,” said Lance, adding that he shared a belief, “that Congress has a responsibility to ask Secretary Napolitano as to exactly why these purchases have occurred.” The DHS has purchased over 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition over the past year – enough to wage a 20 year plus war. Earlier this month, Forbes Magazine called for a “national conversation” on the matter. During the CPAC interview, Congressman Huelscamp also spoke briefly about why he voted twice against the National Defense Authorization Act, stating that it was because of the lack of detail regarding the provision in the bill to allow for incarceration of Americans without due process. “I think it’s something that is so Constitutionally suspect,” Huelscamp said. “It’s one of those things, if you’re not absolutely crystal clear on a Constitutional issue like that, we shouldn’t take those chances.” “I gather there are folks on the other side who think they covered that. I just don’t think we did a good enough job,” the Congressman added. “And based on how hard it was for Senator Paul to get an answer out of the administration, very clearly we need to make it absolutely clear that there are Constitutional protections in this country.” The Congressman also spoke with regards to the recent and ongoing furor over the Obama administration’s intentions for using drones domestically and it’s withholding of information on it’s overseas drone program. “One of the difficulties I have as a member of Congress is the failure of this administration to provide information on what is actually going on,” Huelscamp said. “When we take office we sign an oath to office, but we also sign a little card that says we have access to classified military intelligence, and I’ll just tell you, this administration and prior administrations are not very clear or transparent with the folks that actually control their budget.” “Every member of Congress should know the answers to those questions, and whether or not they can share them,” the Congressman concluded.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1363902023866</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 17:40:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363902409332-97</Id><Topic><Title>Arizona considers gold, silver as legal tender...</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1363890289670</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 14:24:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Utah did this already......people increasingly distrust the government's ability to print money and devalue the wealth they've earned.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1363902409332</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 17:46:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363902884276-98</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Democrats Hate America's Children</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1363889275245</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 14:07:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is the same party telling people "you don't have personal responsibilities...those all belong to the collective,"</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1363902884276</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 17:54:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363903089190-99</Id><Title>Is The Government Stealing Your Money?</Title><Msg>Ever wonder why there such wealthy communities of Germans and Italians in places like Brazil, Argentina and Chile? Well, I haven't, either. I am still a British national becasue my net worth approaches 9 figures ( in U.S. dollars ). You see, truly rich guys like myself will never need tax protection. Ray Davies said this in 1967: "Save me, save me, save me, from this squeeze. I got a big fat mama who's trying to break me. But I love to live so pleasantly, I live my life of luxury, lazing on a sunny afternoon... in the summertime". Rich guys like me live like that. Of course, it was Donovan ( 1966 ) who said, "Sunshine came softly through my a-window today Could've tripped out easy a-but I've a-changed my ways It'll take time, I know it but in a while You're gonna be mine, I know it, we'll do it in style". That pretty much says it all.
