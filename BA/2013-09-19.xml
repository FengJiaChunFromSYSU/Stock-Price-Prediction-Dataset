"The board that oversees the U.S. Capitol Police has opened an investigation into whether a tactical team of officers that was one of the first on the scene during the Washington Navy Yard shooting was ordered to stand down. Several sources confirmed the probe to Fox News. The investigation follows reports that a highly trained and specialized Capitol Police team arrived soon after the shooting started, but was told by a supervisor to leave the scene.

Gallagher, Kim Parker and Kevin T. Maass Chapter 1: Overview SDT-2013-05-gun-crime-1-1National rates of gun homicide and other violent gun crimes are strikingly lower now than during their peak in the mid-1990s, paralleling a general decline in violent crime, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of government data. Beneath the long-term trend, though, are big differences by decade: Violence plunged through the 1990s, but has declined less dramatically since 2000. Compared with 1993, the peak of U.S. gun homicides, the firearm homicide rate was 49% lower in 2010, and there were fewer deaths, even though the nation’s population grew. The victimization rate for other violent crimes with a firearm—assaults, robberies and sex crimes—was 75% lower in 2011 than in 1993. Violent non-fatal crime victimization overall (with or without a firearm) also is down markedly (72%) over two decades. Nearly all the decline in the firearm homicide rate took place in the 1990s; the downward trend stopped in 2001 and resumed slowly in 2007. The victimization rate for other gun crimes plunged in the 1990s, then declined more slowly from 2000 to 2008. The rate appears to be higher in 2011 compared with 2008, but the increase is not statistically significant. Violent non-fatal crime victimization overall also dropped in the 1990s before declining more slowly from 2000 to 2010, then ticked up in 2011. Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence, most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago.</Msg><Username>vendetta35000</Username><Timestamp>1379590381623</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 07:33:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379590498841-16</Id><Title>BA 119.80 in pre markets</Title><Msg>Shorts must cover or lose more</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1379590498841</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 07:34:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379590643330-17</Id><Title>NEXT 7 DAYS MARKET WILL DROP !

The jobless rate in August for females 20 years and older was 6.3 percent, the lowest since December 2008, compared with 7.1 percent for men. As recently as January, the rate was 7.3 percent for both genders, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The downside is that the gains have been largely in lower-paying industries such as waitresses, in-home health care, food preparation and housekeeping. About 60 percent of the increase in employment for women from 2009 to 2012 was in jobs that pay less than $10.10 an hour, compared with 20 percent for men, according to a study by the National Women’s Law Center using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

HOUSTON – A Texas Court of Appeals in Austin has overturned the conviction of former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, attorney Brian Wice told KVUE sister station KHOU 11 News. DeLay, 66, was convicted in 2010 for his alleged role in a scheme to influence Texas elections. He was found guilty of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering after he was accused of helping funnel corporate money to Texas candidates in 2002.In documents released early Thursday, however, an appeals court said the evidence in the case was "legally insufficient to sustain DeLay’s convictions. "The court said all judgments against DeLay were reversed, and the former congressman was formally acquitted. For both DeLay and his critics, the process was frustratingly slow, due in part to some of the appeals court justices in Austin recusing themselves as well as DeLay’s successful effort to have a judge on the panel removed because of anti-Republican comments she made. DeLay was sentenced to three years in prison, but he stayed free while his case made its way through the appellate process.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379611769748</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 13:29:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379611796720-87</Id><Topic><Title>Charleston</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379611036206</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 13:17:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FMH, good point now the conclusion, tesla stock is up 7.5% today compared to Boeing up 1% there are no tesla cars sitting in the showroom they do not need show room they sell direct, no hanger space costs, and Boeing went to elon musk to learn how to try to fix the Boeing battery, tesla designed a safe battery for their cars..

Jones said he is still willing to file for Obama’s impeachment “for bypassing the Constitution and bypassing Congress to bomb another country,” but that in the short term Russia has helped stall the president from waging another unnecessary, unaffordable war. He also said that a strike on Syria without Congressional approval would cause both parties to file articles of impeachment against Obama. “There are many in both parties… that are very concerned that as this moves forward that we might wake up one day and we’ve been dropping missiles in Syria,” the Rep. stated, adding that because of the Syrian opposition’s known-affiliations with Al-Qaeda linked terror groups, that we may be aiding the wrong people. If the U.S. were to move forward with a strike on Syria without Congress’s approval, as Secretary of State John Kerry said would happen, Jones says Obama would face multiple articles of impeachment from both sides. Jones was proud to reveal that, of the over 500 phone calls and over 1,000 emails he received from constituents, 95 percent said no to military action in Syria. According to Jones, many members of Congress are also “sick and tired of America thinking we can borrow money from foreign governments.” “There’s got to be some sanity to these foreign policies of any administration and particularly this one now,” Jones stated, explaining that the United States, in its current fiscal insolvency, cannot afford to be the police of the world. “We can’t pay our own bills, we can’t police our own borders,” he said. “I mean, look at [Afghan President Hamid] Karzai. His family is in the drug business and we’re sending him roughly six to seven billion dollars a month to prop him up? And here we’re going to have a vote tomorrow to cut food stamps for the American people, particularly those who need it? I know there’s abuse in a lot of federal programs but there’s no abuse in funding Karzai, and he’s a #$%$.” “We are a debtor nation. We cannot even pay our bills without raising the debt ceiling of America so we can borrow money to pay last year’s bills. This whole place up here is out of control and when you come to foreign policy, as Ron Paul would say, let’s wake up, let’s rebuild America and the hell with the rest of the world.” Jones also slammed Obamacare, saying it is one of the worst pieces of legislation he’s seen since the Bush administration’s No Child Left Behind. “I can tell you Obamacare, in my opinion, would just bankrupt America.” Of the Navy Yard shooting and the subsequent attacks on the Second Amendment Jones held the level-headed approach that “If a person is going to commit mayhem, they will get whatever they need. I hate to say that but it is true. You cannot punish the law-abiding citizen who is following his constitutional rights, because it is not going to stop those who want to commit crime.”</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379623271922</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 16:41:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379623404967-142</Id><Topic><Title>sparti on TSLA and SCTY and now humm I told you in May to get in sparti you forget and IGZ was your pick har</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1379607583809</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 12:19:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spartacus99991 aka neospart you have worked yourself into a spam corner, it only took a few hours wow !</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1379623404967</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 16:43:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379623460898-143</Id><Topic><Title>sparti boeing is up today .49% tesla is up 7% and yes, I get it now, sparti is still a spammer then and now</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1379621453541</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 16:10:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simply amazing, from the man with 7 faces, (As to your spartacus99991 when you spammed Wayne what was your other name, neospart, and when did it start when will you step up and just admit you are a serial spam poster ) Oop's make another mistake, should have been " from the man with at least 7 yahoo" alias's"</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1379623460898</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 16:44:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379624225404-144</Id><Topic><Title>sparti boeing is up today .49% tesla is up 7% and yes, I get it now, sparti is still a spammer then and now</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1379621453541</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 16:10:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cbx spamming for neospart and spartacus99991 how is that any different ? spamming is not giving facts cbx here are the facts , acts BA up .49% today tesla up 7% today Airbus up 90% for a year Boeing up 70% for a year Tesla up 473% for a year that is not spamming but cbx here is your spamming , you can get angry and good for you I don't care, here is your spamming comments "Simply amazing, from the man with 7 faces, (As to your spartacus99991 when you spammed Wayne what was your other name, neospart, and when did it start when will you step up and just admit you are a serial spam poster ) 7 faces or 1 face it does not matter it is the facts not the spam , it is all about stock price facts . get it yet or now spam means nothing get is now tesla up 473% Boeing is not, Airbus up 90% Boeing is not ,only 70%for Boeing for a year that is a fact . cowen made a 6% increase today on price target for Boeing t but cowen has not reached their 131 price as yet and already pumping for Boeing prior to the first prediction@ 131 in other words your pump is not keeping up with the suggested target price. while the analyst for tesla made a 14% price gain target from 176 to 200 that is 14% bottom line I made 7 more dollar per share today on my tsla and Boeing investors made only .64 cents and you as a spammer who owns no Boeing stock wasted your time all day long cbx-spartacus99991,neospart. as usual a total waste of your time</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1379624225404</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 16:57:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379624343828-145</Id><Topic><Title>Current BA traders, I got a question</Title><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1379617360438</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 15:02:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not a fan of BA and am short the stock but why are you worried about a stock that you own from $35.

(CNN) - Boeing Co. inspectors have discovered intentional wire damage on at least seven Boeing 737s at a company assembly plant in Renton, Wash., the company confirmed to CNN Thursday. The damage was found during routine service testing over the past two weeks. Boeing says it notified the FAA of the sabotage Tuesday. The company also said an additional three aircraft also may have had sabotaged wiring, but evidence is not conclusive. A 737 jet is assembled at the Boeing plant in Renton, Wash. The company is investigating sabotage of wiring on 7 jets under construction there. There are no suspects at this time. "No airplane is delivered until it has met rigorous testing starting with Boeing, the FAA, and the airlines," spokesman Sandy Angers told CNN. "The fact that we found the damaged wires proves our quality system works." The Federal Aviation Administration said it is looking into the matter, but could not elaborate on details. The agency recently referred the case to the FBI, which is the only law enforcement agency working on the case. The FBI did not comment on possible suspects or motives, saying only it has just started investigating.�� Boeing (BA: down $0.22 to $65.88, Research, Estimates) employs about 12,000 people at the Renton plant, where the narrow-body 737 jet is assembled along with the 757, another narrow-body jet, and the Boeing business jet. It makes about 24 of the 737 jets a month. The world's largest aircraft manufacturer announced in March that some of the 757 assembly work now done in the Renton plant would be shifted to its plant in Wichita, Kan., although the fuselages of the planes will still be shipped by rail from Wichita back to Renton for final assembly.</Msg><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1379632042357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 19:07:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379632068463-186</Id><Topic><Title>for the record TSLAa up 473% for the year 7% today ----cbx and sparty BA is not, only 90% and .49% racism</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1379631826049</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-19 19:03:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, I'll just continue to point out when you make mistakes and you provide misinformation.

Even Bernanke said Obama's policies do not support a recovery.
