That ramped up to $10T and about 67% of GDP at the end of the second term. And an average $550B/year deficit increase over the eight years. With Obama, the deficits have been running about $1.3T/year average with the current total deficit reaching $16T at the end of the Obama era (Nov 2012) and equal to the whole of GDP (100%). So, despite Hooz's usual nonsense "cut and paste" articles full of convolutional logic applied to the debt numbers, Obama has run up a massive increase in debt - period.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1346691891018</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 13:04:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346692166781-15</Id><Title>Should Obama give 25% of his DNC Prime to Bill Cosby</Title><Msg>speaking to an empty Rmoney chair and going on about the different types of rape and incest in regards to abortion, even bigger tax cuts for the rich while slashing milk programs for babies, privatizing social security and medicare while slashing benefits for the elderly... heck he could do a whole bit just on Mittens holy underwear alone...etc. etc. etc. I am sure it would be hillarious, and biting commentary on the republicon fascist agenda... but then it would be as bad as the Rmoney decision to have an 82 year old semi-senile angry old white mutli-millionaire speak for 25% of Rmoneys FNC primetime instead of telling an inquiring public about his stance on the issues and some specifics, his decision not to release his tax-returns, etc.</Msg><Username>republicanfascists</Username><Timestamp>1346692166781</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 13:09:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346692222215-16</Id><Topic><Title>Republican Masquerade Ball on full tilt last week.</Title><Username>windyhorn</Username><Timestamp>1346599324839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:22:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bishop Lying Sack and Pathological Paulie were big time liars before the convention and then emerged as even bigger effin liars afterwards.

However, my grandfather, who died about 25 years ago, was very conservative and very hard working (also a union member!). And he only finished some portion of grade school. He migrated during the dust bowl years from OK to CA. He would have been aghast at what Obama is doing. And, you have the extreme liberals from the so-called highly educated side. I am inclined to think that we are simply giving up on self-reliance and initiative. If you watched John Stossel's treatise on lemonade stands in New York, he found that he had to have a permit and needed a fire extinguisher at hand next to the stand in order to sell lemonade. The government loves rules because they have to increase their numbers in order to monitor and enforce their ever increasing rules and regulations - that mean nothing in the end, but they do result in stagnation and depression. Stossel is author of "No, we can't" and is a libertarian. So, this lemonade example may seem silly, but then along comes Obamacare and goes fully into effect when a company reaches 50 employees. Any bird-brain will be able to figure out that such an inhibit/roadblock will simply limit hiring and stifle business and free enterprise - which by observation is what Obama is all about. So, when he said, "you did not build that", he was not taken out of context at all. He meant what he said. His view, and he has said this often, is that government needs to do more hiring and the "private sector is fine". Yet, the deficit numbers are staggering and we cannot afford his nonsense. He needs to be given the boot in November.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1346693703055</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 13:35:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346694462185-19</Id><Topic><Title>Democrates love 8.3% and surging in 47 states unemployment, 16T debt, 45% Food Stamps</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1346692909031</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 13:21:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What specifically do have against Obama's $4T tax reduction plan or his Jobs Bill?
