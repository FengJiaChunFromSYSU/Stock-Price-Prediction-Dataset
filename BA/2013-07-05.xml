The media seems to forget that George Z. was involved in in the community helping children (all kinds). He is not a racist. And the media seems to forget that he cared about his neighborhood and family. He had no intention of killing anyone. Quit using the word "stocking" the media seems to use that word a lot.. He went to find out who that guy was. He had every right to. Quit calling him a child with skiittles. He was 17+ years old (one can join the military at 18 years and train to kill other soldiers). He jumped George Zimmerman, broke his nose with a sucker punch, sent him to the ground and was on top of him. beating him and threatening him. The media loves showing that 13 year old picture of him smiling so innocent. So far the testimony shows that George was telling the truth. Who can remember every bit of a situation in the heat of fight. Even prosecuting witnesses have backed his statements. But then this seems to be political. Truth be damned.

Bloomberg is such a regular that he has his own booth, with a view of the Parliament building. The waiters have memorized his order: coffee-rubbed New York strip steak. The cabdrivers in Bermuda know Mr. Bloomberg by sight and jockey for a chance to drive him around town. (The billionaire mayor, they say, tips well.) Members of the Mid Ocean golf club, where he plays up to two rounds a day, can rattle off the strengths and weaknesses of his game. Mr. Bloomberg, who owns a waterfront estate here, has walled off his life in Bermuda from voters in New York, arguing it is none of their business. He steadfastly refuses to say when he is on the island, and to blindfold prying eyes, he has blocked aviation Web sites from making public the movements of his private planes. In dozens of interviews, residents described Mr. Bloomberg, 68, as a fixture on the island, dining out with lawmakers, cruising its streets in his golf cart and hosting small parties at his house. It is difficult to say exactly how often he stays on the island; neighbors and friends say he is here about twice a month, depending on the weather in Bermuda (no sun, no Bloomberg) and the political climate in New York. _____________________________________________ Isn't it great that Bloomy flies his private jet to his island mansion and spews several lifetimes worth of the average American's CO2 just to party? But woe are those who don't have island mansions and private jets who are guilty of emitting a fraction of what Bloomy emits just trying to keep their family from freezing to death. The best way to learn about phonies like Bloomy and Obonzo is to look past the rhetoric and watch their actions. If you want/need powerful hypocrites running your life and depriving you of attaining personal liberty, these are the imperialists that arre made to order for you.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1373037861600</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 11:24:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373039469278-33</Id><Title>2009 Obonzo shows what a failure 2013 Obonzo was</Title><Msg>Based on the data presented by Obonzo in 2009, the nation would face unemployment of 5.3% by the 3rd quarter of 2013 unless he enacted his stimulus package. So how did his stimulus plan do? We're headed for 7.6% unemployment or higher. Defenders of Obonzo conveniently suffer amnesia about the 5.3% projection they used to frighten the public into support for the stimulus, and try to weasel out of Obonzo's failure by spreading the false narrative that it would have been worse unless put us further into debt. In any segment of the private sector Obonzo would be fired for such incompetence in budget forecasting and programs failures. Instead, in government, the Peter Principle does not apply and we wath as incompetence thrives while we get hacks that shouldn't be trusted running a banana republic, like Obonzo, at the top running the country into the ground. Obonzo proves that having no talent and great speech writers will take you far in a country where people embrace the failures of symbolism over substance.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1373039469278</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 11:51:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373039530376-34</Id><Title>Sparty Board Fascist / Garbage Peddler</Title><Msg>won't let me append Barack's amazing vacation / schedule thread they returned Tuesday, been a blank slate ever since</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373039530376</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 11:52:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373039986026-35</Id><Topic><Title>2009 Obonzo shows what a failure 2013 Obonzo was</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1373039469278</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 11:51:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>unemployment is much closer to 16% than it is 7, huh spart....sparty's been a statistic since long before the 2nd great dumbocrat depression...with not so coincidentally corresponds closely with those on the receiving end of food stamps.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373039986026</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 11:59:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373040267445-36</Id><Title>BA is a overvalued junk</Title><Msg>time to short it</Msg><Username>oih_2007</Username><Timestamp>1373040267445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 12:04:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373040963271-37</Id><Topic><Title>BA is a overvalued junk</Title><Username>oih_2007</Username><Timestamp>1373040267445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 12:04:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go ahead.

"If the number of workers who have run out of unemployment compensation or have been searching for a job for more than a year are counted, and the number of laborers who are underemployed and working part time are added, the unemployment figures are approaching 22 percent." It's far easier for Obonzo to use fraudulent accounting methods to convince worshipping munchkins that know as much about economics as Bo the dog that the economy is rocking, than it is for him to do anything to actually help the economy. So that has been what he has chosen to do.

Back at you putz. "Thirty-three years ago, I organized the Vietnam Veterans for a Just Peace in reaction to Kerry's organization Vietnam Veterans Against the War. John O'Neill and others joined me, and with the support of tens of thousands of Vietnam veterans, we rebutted Kerry's charges that we were all war criminals. Literally, no one was defending us, many Americans were discouraged by the charges, and we young Vietnam veterans were suffering horribly from discrimination in our efforts to get on with our lives. Thirty-three years later, the surprise emergence of John Kerry as candidate and his centerpiecing of his Vietnam service stirred many Vietnam veterans to reclaim the image and honor that Kerry besmirched. We knew better. John Kerry continued the past 33-years to consistently misrepresent his activities and the calumny he brought upon us. That led to an enormous groundswell among now middle-aged Vietnam veterans, emerging from every walk of non-political life that we had individually built, to set the record straight. It is well documented that most of the claims made by Kerry and his Vietnam Veterans Against the War were fraudulent, none of his anti-war vets were willing to provide evidence, and many of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War members had not served in Vietnam. We now know that the true leadership of the vets against was extreme radicals, directed by a Vietnam vet impersonator. Yet, John Kerry has never apologized. Youthful excess and zeal is one thing. Mature hypocrisy is another". Bruce N.

Dionne, Jr. WASHINGTON—Here is the sentence in the Declaration of Independence we always remember: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” And here is the sentence we often forget: “And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.” This, the very last sentence of the document, is what makes the better-remembered sentence possible. One speaks of our rights. The other addresses our obligations. The freedoms we cherish are self-evident but not self-executing. The Founders pledge something “to each other,” the commonly overlooked clause in the Declaration’s final pronouncement. We find ourselves, 237 years after the Founders declared us a new nation, in a season of discontent, even surliness, about the experiment they launched. We are sharply divided over the very meaning our founding documents, and we are more likely to invoke the word “we” in the context of “us” versus “them” than in the more capacious sense that includes every single American. There are no quick fixes to our sense of disconnection, but there may be a way to restore our sense of what we owe each other across the lines of class, race, background—and, yes, politics and ideology. Last week, the Aspen Institute gathered a politically diverse group of Americans under the banner of the “Franklin Project,” named after Ben, to declare a commitment to offering every American between the ages of 18 and 28 a chance to give a year of service to the country. The opportunities would include service in our armed forces but also time spent in educating our fellow citizens, bringing them health care and preventive services, working with the least advantaged among us, and conserving our environment. Service would not be compulsory, but it would be an expectation. And it just might become part of who we are. The call for universal, voluntary service is being championed by retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, in league with two of the country’s foremost advocates of the cause, John Bridgeland, who served in President George W. Bush’s administration, and Alan Khazei, co-founder of City Year, one of the nation’s most formidable volunteer groups. The trio testifies to the non-ideological and nonpartisan nature of this cause, as did a column last week endorsing the idea from Michael Gerson, my conservative Washington Post colleague. “We’ve a remarkable opportunity now,” McChrystal said, “to move with the American people away from an easy citizenship that does not ask something from every American yet asks a lot from a tiny few.” We do, indeed, owe something to our country, and we owe an enormous debt to those who have done tour after tour in Iraq and Afghanistan. McChrystal sees universal service as transformative. “It will change how we think about America and how we think about ourselves,” he says. And as a former leader of an all-volunteer Army, he scoffs at the idea that giving young Americans a stipend while they serve amounts to “paid volunteerism,” the phrase typically invoked by critics of service programs. “If you try to rely on unpaid volunteerism,” he said, “then you limit the people who can do it. ... I’d like the people from Scarsdale to be paid the same as the people from East LA.” There are real challenges here. Creating the estimated 1 million service slots required to make the prospect of service truly universal will take money, from government and private philanthropy. Service, as McChrystal says, cannot just be a nice thing that well-off kids do when they get out of college. It has to draw in the least advantaged young Americans. In the process, it could open new avenues for social mobility, something the military has done for so many in the past. Who knows if the universal expectation of service would change the country as much as McChrystal hopes. But we have precious few institutions reminding us to join the Founders in pledging something to each other. We could begin by debating this proposal in a way that frees us from the poisonous assumption that even an idea involving service to others must be part of some hidden political agenda. The agenda here is entirely open. It’s based on the belief that certain unalienable rights entail certain unavoidable responsibilities.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373061130155</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 17:52:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373061813778-107</Id><Title>Shocker: GOP small government fetish is selective garbage</Title><Msg>Shocker: GOP small government fetish is selective garbage The right likes massive programs -- if they detain people rather than give them healthcare. Next: Talking drones? By Alex Pareene The delicate immigration reform negotiations in the Senate were supposed to pass a bill that allowed undocumented immigrants to earn American citizenship — because that is the entire point of doing immigration reform, for reformers. It is also, apparently, supposed to make the process, and America’s immigration system in general, as inconvenient as possible — for conservatives who wish to see immigrants punished for their border crossing — without making the process so punitive that liberals could no longer support the bill. Late in June, two Republicans, Sens. Bob Corker (Tenn.) and John Hoeven (N.D.), inserted an amendment into the Senate bill to strengthen security at the American border with Mexico. No Democrats opposed the measure in a “test vote” before the Senate’s passage of the larger bill. The amendment’s proposals are referred to as a “border surge,” because “surges” are a great thing in Washington ever since “the surge worked” became a very popular catchphrase for a while. (Washington is full of very simple-minded people, on the whole.) So we will “surge” the border, just like we “surged” Iraq, and, like Iraq, we will Win the War, against Mexico and Mexicans. Basically the “border surge” is a very expensive new expansion of a massive government program, only it’s the sort that conservatives like because it involves detaining people instead of giving them healthcare or something. The “surge” is a massive military buildup along the border, involving 700 miles of fencing, 20,000 new border agents, and more drones, perhaps even ones fitted with “nonlethal weapons,” for the Border Protection Agency to loan out to various other law-enforcement agencies. It will install, at various points along the border, an exciting array of new infrastructure and equipment of the sort usually not seen outside of actual war zones. Many lucky communities will soon have multiple new “fixed towers,” dozens of “fixed camera systems (with relocation capability), which include remote video surveillance systems” and “mobile surveillance systems, which include mobile video surveillance systems, agent-portable surveillance systems, and mobile surveillance capability systems,” and hundreds of new “unattended ground sensors, including seismic, imaging, and infrared.” Chuck Schumer described the entire deal as “a breathtaking show of force.” Even actual border-patrol agents are sort of confused by the proposal, which will double their ranks. “I’m not sure where this idea came from, but we didn’t support it, and we didn’t ask for it,” their union vice president told the National Review. The whole thing will cost $38 billion. Fun fact! House Republicans recently attempted to cut $20 billion from the federal budget for food stamps. The measure failed when many Republicans decided the cuts weren’t large enough. But there is always money for new unattended ground sensors! This week, two things happened as a result of the Corker-Hoeven “border surge” amendment. First, the Congressional Budget Office “scored” it. The CBO found that it will be expensive. Second, it found that under the proposal, illegal immigration “would be reduced by between one-third and one-half compared with the projected net inflow under current law.” Success! This, honestly, seems like one of those findings that the CBO just sort of made up. There will be … half as much illegal immigration, we guess. “CBO once again vindicated immigration reform,” Chuck Schumer said. Second, Rep. Filemon Vela, a Democrat from Texas, quit the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, after the caucus failed to do anything to stop the amendment from passing. He posted an explanatory message on his Facebook wall, saying: I grew up on the border, and until recently, border towns in Mexico and the United States shared a common economic and cultural vitality. Now we have border fences, and they don’t work. They harm the environment, inconvenience everyone and promote fear between neighbors. And: “Mexico is a friend, neighbor and one of our top three trading partners. The US-Mexico border should not remind us of places like East Berlin, West Berlin, North Korea and South Korea.” (As Molly Ball reports, Vela’s decision came after two immigrant advocacy groups turned against the Senate bill for its inclusion of the Corker-Hoeven proposal.) The best hope for getting something that resembles the Senate bill through the House is with a great deal of Democratic support. This probably isn’t a great time for the bill to start dropping liberals. Especially if the House ends up passing something after all, and then security is “beefed up” even more in conference with the Senate. (“Let’s say, 100,000 new agents, plus maybe some tanks, and also the drones can talk now.”) Still, it looks like the price for a legal route to security for millions of undocumented Americans is the total militarization of vast swaths of the country at great expense, simply so that some conservatives feel we’re being sufficiently “tough.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373061813778</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 18:03:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373062632225-108</Id><Topic><Title>Freedom and 'Our Sacred Honor'</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373061130155</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 17:52:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This would have been a great alternative for Obama instead of his Chume gang youth experience.

The diversion of the airplane of Bolivian President Evo Morales to Vienna as he flew home from Moscow was one. The outrageous hijacking of a head of state revealed the contours and power of the U.S. Empire more starkly than any secrets leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Despite implausible and half-hearted denials, it is abundantly clear that France, Portugal, Italy and Spain refused permission for President Morales' plane to pass through their airspace. According to the Austrians, their officials boarded the plane in Vienna to search for Snowden before allowing it to leave. Bolivia says President Morales refused to allow Austrian police on board. Whatever the exact details, the Bolivian Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera was surely right when he said the events constituted one of the more shameful pages in the history of Europe. "We want to say to all the people of the world that the plane of President Morales has been kidnapped by imperialism," Garcia Linera said in La Paz Tuesday. (OK Oily_taint here's the part that nobody but you denies) It is absolutely clear that France, Portugal, Austria and the others were acting under orders from the United States to deny a possible escape route for Snowden. But who has the authority to divert an airplane carrying the president of a sovereign state? Not even high officials such as Secretary of State John Kerry would dare make such a move without first clearing it at the very top. There can be no doubt that the command came from Barack Obama himself. ________________________________ Oily_taint is another Obonzo sock puppet and turd polishing zealot zombie. rotfl</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1373082086435</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 23:41:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
