Newsmax magazine has been awarded top honors by the Florida Magazine Association (FMA), which recognizes industry publications that have had significant impact for readers. Last Friday at its Annual Publishing Conference &amp; Exposition held this year in Orlando, Fla., the FMA bestowed five Charlie Awards – its highest honor — to Newsmax. Newsmax won the highly coveted Charlie Award in each of the following categories: Best In-Depth Reporting for Judith Miller’s April 2012 article “The Go-Between,” about the Sultan of Oman’s role as an intermediary between Washington and Tehran; Best Department for the March 2012 America section; Best Column for Ben Stein’s Feb. 2012 Dreemz column, “Finding Myself an Outcast in Hollywood”; Best Feature Design for the Oct. 2011 Rick Perry cover story, “The Real Rick Perry”; and Best Illustration for the April 2012 “Defending Israel” article. The FMA is the largest state magazine association in the nation, representing over 200 magazines and 25 suppliers of publishing products and services. For more than five decades, the FMA has provided Florida’s magazines with a vital forum for information-sharing and updates on trends to assist and direct their growth. More than 600 entries were submitted for the 2012 Charlie Awards contest from 70 publishing companies. Winning entries were evaluated by seasoned journalism professionals from across the country who specialize in all facets of magazine publishing. Y.T.

Boeing hires you because you’re the smartest people on the planet but they delude themselves into believing that you’re too stupid to see through their bargaining tricks. So here’s the Boeing corporate trick: They proposed a terrible offer which the members voted over 96% to reject on Oct. 1. In the wake of that vote, Boeing takes some of the awful things out of their proposal and calls that progress. The hope is that when they drop their next bad offer, members will compare it to the last terrible offer and feel relief. It’s a game of false perspective that assumes SPEEA members are gullible. SPEEA’sr current contract was negotiated at a time when the global economy was collapsing and Boeing was in serious financial trouble due to the 787 outsourcing debacle. Since then, SPEEA and IAM members put their shoulders to the wheel and turned the company around to post record profits. Boeing recently sold , $4.9 billion dollars worth of 737s. It’s false that SPEEA had a negotiation session scheduled for Thursday. SPEEA had told Boeing that we could be available to meet Thursday. However, Boeing’s OWN GROUND RULE for these negotiations was that any negotiation session was to be scheduled 48 hours in advance. We’ve honored this request from Boeing and assumed that they’d follow their own rules. Because Boeing hadn’t scheduled anything with us, our medical subject matter experts were dispatched to California to help resolve the Palmdale arbitration win. When Boeing called late Wednesday asking to meet with our medical subject matter experts, we explained that they were out of state but asked Boeing to send us their proposals anyway (which they refused to do). So here’s the Boeing corporate trick: Ask for a meeting with people you know aren’t available, and then send an email to SPEEA members blaming SPEEA for refusing to meet with you. The dishonesty of this is startling. and par for the coarse when it comes to Boeing Corporate. It is a case of Boeing send the SPEEA and public a message, saying that they had proposals available but simultaneously refuse to provide those proposals to SPEEA The Boeing Corporate trick of scapegoat with the sole purpose to sow dissension. No wonder the Boeing stock price has been a dead cat bounce since Corporate moved to Chicago so they can ignore reality. If Boeing needs to file for bankruptcy and have Hostess buy them out, then go for it otherwise get in here and stop the games. Or you can go for that cheap outsourcing that SPEEA has had to send local engineers all over the world to fix your cheap outsourcing for you in Chicago, we could have built the 787 for the original 5 billion , you know like we did for the 777 on time and on budget. How did that 787 outsourcing work for you Corporate employee’s in Chicago? So far 3 years late and 30 billion cost, good idea, got any more ideas ? We all want to know .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353083334477</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 11:28:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353083492013-37</Id><Topic><Title>Wow Americans are going to be punished for this last Election.

Boeing revenue is down 6%, Boeing executives gave themselves a bonus equal to their yearly income, so Boeing is using shareholder money to pay excessive money for management failure to deliver on time and budget planes. It shows in the acid test, the stock price, Boeing stock is down in price 3.6% for the year! Boeing has given a nice dividend but if the price of the stock is down 3.6% then you will have to subtract the dividend from the stock loss to get a net gain or loss, just like Boeing has to account for revenue!, The stock price problem will not change until the Boeing leadership is replaced, do not expect that airplane's will be built on time or budget . Instead of Boeing stock investors have spoke, they have invested elsewhere, so look to areas like banks and home builders for real gains . Lets start with the terrible loss on apple since the 700 dollar high, it is still up 30%for the year, HOV is up 227% for the year and up 8% today , PHM is up 150% for the year and 3.6% up today,KBH is up 114% for the year and 5.6% today, and banks are a better investment , BAC is up 62% for the year. remember the stock market is being pumped by the fed so follow the money. thanks</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353094332755</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 14:32:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353095024065-64</Id><Topic><Title>Still hate talk.

Apparently, in testimony today, General Petraeus tried to tell that to the White House immediately after the attack, but someone in the White House, according to Petraeus, changed the "talking points" of his presentation by taking out "al Qaeda" and "terrorists". One might assume the reason is because it would conflict with the lies that were told to all of the gullible Democrats at the Democrat National Convention that "al Qaeda" was defeated - only one week prior to the attack. So, either the President and SecState are lying or Petraeus is lying. Given that Petraeus was just caught in the lie of infidelity, that tends to impugn his testimony. On the other hand, the President said that he gave the order to do everything to help the folks during the attack of Benghazi, but, as we know, nothing was done. So, in the case of the President, either he is lying about that or no one pays any attention to his orders. Both are really bad. Bill Clinton lied about his sex life - and was impeached. Obama likely lied about national security or he is surrounded by liars. Hmmm. But, some folks have their toes in the water, so all is well. Impeachment, anyone?

While home builders and other stocks are up big. .Until the GE-MD fails are retired or removed Boeing stock price will be in a dead cat bounce. It ahs been trapped in the 65 to 75 range and very slow moving, today most of the home builders were up 3 to 55 and many are up over 100% year to date. apple even after the huge run down is still up 30% . The DOW had a nice run up today and Boeing is right in the middle of its price range yet was unable to follow the up trend down .5% today. Not good for the company , the shareholder, or all the taxpayers that have supported Boeing for all these years. It is in the interest of the USA to stop supporting Boeing if we wean them off the government dole maybe they will start acting like they actually have to stop giving themselves huge bonus in chicago while treating the workers like competitive means we do not have a USA cost of living, house payment, insurance, car payment, food, cloths, is all at 100% USA prices in Puget Sound, not in terms of a 50 dollar per month Chinese worker. If Boeing wants that then like Airbus they need to go to China for final assembly, not take 3 billion from the Washington State taxpayers to set up 787 final assembly in Everett then move to another State , BTW that other State gave only 170 million subsidy. so far what one 787 done another example of you get what you pay for, cheap outsourcing is a good term.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353103436379</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 17:03:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353103729484-76</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing, SPEEA union far apart after top-level talks</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1352991774888</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:02:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that would be compared to those cheap outsourced engineers who did the 3 year late and 30 billion over budget job on the 787, you get what you pay for , how was that outsorcing working for you now ?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353103729484</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 17:08:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353104077535-77</Id><Title>The Sore Losers Club !!</Title><Msg>Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are already starting to channel the last guy who lost to Obama.... .... Romney and Ryan have an excuse, of course: It was only last week that they lost, so the wounds are still raw. The question is whether they’ll end up like John McCain, who is still clearly not over his loss to Obama four years ago. As I’ve written before, McCain’s various self-reinventions as a politician are best understood as acts of sore loser-dom. A decade ago, for instance, he took up a sudden interest in closing the gun show loophole, enacting a patients’ bill of rights, and stopping tax cuts for the wealthy. Not at all coincidentally, this came just after he’d lost a bruising campaign against George W. Bush. Bush and his team had been rough – very, very rough – on McCain, and McCain had deemed them unworthy victors. His sudden cooperation with Democrats in 2001 was his version of payback, giving the new Bush White House fits. When he lost to Obama in 2008, McCain shifted in the other direction, becoming a more reliable Republican vote in the Senate and playing a leading role in the right’s attacks on the new president. At a 2010 White House summit on healthcare, McCain communicated something approaching contempt for Obama, and he threw himself into Romney’s campaign against the president this year. Nor is he giving up in the wake of the election. Along with Lindsey Graham, McCain is now the GOP’s point-man for going after U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice over the Benghazi incident. This week, McCain vowed to filibuster her nomination if Obama chooses her to run the State Department, a threat that prompted an unusually heated response from Obama at his Wednesday press conference. “When they go after the U.N. ambassador,” Obama said of McCain and Graham, “apparently because they think she’s an easy target, then they’ve got a problem with me.” Obviously, McCain got under the president’s skin, which surely makes him happy. But this is probably short-sighted. For years, McCain was one of the most popular politicians in the country. His reputation took a hit in ’08, but he had an opportunity to restore it in defeat. Instead, he’s behaved like an embittered partisan warrior. And so far, it’s an example that Romney and Ryan are following.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353104077535</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 17:14:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353104679564-78</Id><Topic><Title>The Sore Losers Club !!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353104077535</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 17:14:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Remarkable... how infantile the GOPig is!</Msg><Username>brodens_comes_alive</Username><Timestamp>1353104679564</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 17:24:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353105227288-79</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing, SPEEA union far apart after top-level talks</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1352991774888</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:02:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you new yorkers should wake up It was BA MISS Management ( not a hydroplane ) that caused the fubar 7 late 7, it was the iam and speea that went all over the world to correct the mess.
