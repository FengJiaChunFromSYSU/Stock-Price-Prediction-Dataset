And now another adviser is admitting that benefits cuts are definitely on the table. If Romney is to achieve its separate goal of reducing overall federal spending to modern lows. But he notes thatRomney could make up the difference elsewhere in the budget or, by “mak[ing] other changes to the Medicare program, such as increased means-testing, that don’t alter the program’s basic structure.” Means testing would apply to people on Medicare now, and it would be a cut to benefits, benefits that retirees earned and paid for through years of work and contributing to the system. That's not the only thing seniors would be losing under Romney/Ryan. If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, with it goes the $4.1 billion seniors and disabled people have saved on prescription drugs. That amounts to an average of $768 in annual savings for Medicare patients, a significant chunk of money for anyone on a fixed income. Also gone with repeal are the free cancer screenings, mammograms and other preventive services. Romney and Ryan are lying, no surprise, when they say that anyone on Medicare now won't see a change in their benefits. They're playing a shell game with American seniors.</Msg><Username>clowncramer</Username><Timestamp>1346596360253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 10:32:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346596513901-8</Id><Topic><Title>A Message To The American People</Title><Username>sir_paul_mccartney55</Username><Timestamp>1346526697526</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 15:11:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We need to keep it simple so the libs can understand.

Martin O'Malley, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, says, "Yes, we can." "More jobs were created in the private sector last year alone than in all eight years of George W. Bush. Look, we did not get into the economic problems we did because President Obama was in office for two months. The ground was laid by the bad policies of George W. Bush, and that came at the expense of the growing middle class and giving huge tax breaks to the billionaires." Poll: More blame Bush than Obama Though Bush has been out of office for nearly 3½ years, over 70% percent blame him a “great deal” or “moderate amount” for the nation’s economic woes. Bush’s continued unpopularity — he was recently polled as the least popular living ex-president — will have an impact on the 2012 presidential race, hence his conspicous absence from the RNC.</Msg><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1346598533970</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:08:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346599236610-14</Id><Topic><Title>'Yes, We Can' Blame GOP For Unemployment</Title><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1346598533970</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:08:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The baggers and flat earthers block evey attempt by Obama to get a jobs bill thru the house because they would rather destroy America than let Obamas job policys succede</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1346599236610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:20:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346599251056-15</Id><Topic><Title>Rmoney to hurricane victim who lost home - "go home, call 211"</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1346514099375</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 11:41:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How did Rmoney expect a woman who's home was undewater to go home and call 211? “Last night, Democrats tried to move forward on a measure that would have granted the Federal Emergency Management Agency additional funding to help communities devastated by natural disasters,” Sen. Reid said in an advisory. “This ought to be the least political issue going – whether to reach out a helping hand to our friends and neighbors in their time of need,” he continued. “They have lost friends and loved ones. Their homes, businesses and livelihoods have been destroyed by acts of god. Their communities are under water or reduced to rubble. “It’s in our power to help them. But last night Republicans overwhelmingly voted to prevent us from coming to their aid. They prevented us from getting disaster aid to American families and businesses that need it now.” The vote was 53-33, with Republicans uniting against measure that would have brought the aid package to a vote and put a rush on some emergency funds. A 60-vote majority was required to pass it. “They don’t need help next week or next month,” Reid railed. “They need it now. They need it today.”</Msg><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1346599251056</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:20:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346599324839-16</Id><Title>Republican Masquerade Ball on full tilt last week.</Title><Msg>"The Republicans knocked themselves out producing a convention that was a colossal hoax.

Johnson declared a war on poverty, and then proceeded to pass all of the Great Society welfare programs? Answer: It was about 15%. Question: Do you know what the current poverty level is now? Answer: It's 14.3% and rising. Question: Do you know how much America has spent on Great Society welfare programs since Lyndon B. Johnson passed the welfare legislation that was suppose to create utopia? Answer: Google that your self so you'll know where to tell your friends to look. Hint = know what the current American debt is? Virtually every single gov't program and cabinet has failed to do what it promised to do, and cost 4 - 10 times more than originally advertised. When individuals invest in something that doesn't work, they stop throwing the money down the toilet and try something else. When gov't programs fail to deliver, Democrats tell us it's because they need more money and investment. Hence why we've paid 4 - 10 time more than what programs were originally advertised to cost. How stupid are they? Are they truly trying to destroy the country from within? Is their lust for power and buying more votes so great that they are willing to bankrupt the country and future generations? Incredible.</Msg><Username>panthers_108</Username><Timestamp>1346636347759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 21:39:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346641021345-38</Id><Title>And Daniel Webster</Title><Msg>Obama told CNN today that he does not have time to “network” with others in governmental leadership as he and Michelle “are too busy as parents”. Therefore, he does not have time to “smooze” as CNN puts it. He also tells college students that there should be more money for college education, whatever is needed – even though he borrows like Popeye’s friend Wimpy who often said, “I will gladly pay you on Tuesday.” So we have a President who refuses to participate at the level that is necessary in order to coordinate the business of the many unemployed and fewer employed hundreds of millions of Americans because he is "too busy with his own daughters" and he tells college students that they will have whatever they need in additional funding for their education – even thought there is no money and the students will obviously have to suffer the future overwhelming massive debt. Sounds like what the Devil promised Daniel Webster. Only the Democrats will continue to vote for the Devil no matter what he does.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1346641021345</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 22:57:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
