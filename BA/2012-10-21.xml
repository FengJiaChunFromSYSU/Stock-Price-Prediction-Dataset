During the visit I learned that the facility produces 300 megawatts of electricity plus hot water for the region (or about 1/3 of a conventional nuclear power plant). Of particular note is that the plant facility is also home to Carbon Recycling International, a joint US-Iceland company that is actually turning carbon dioxide into liquid methanol fuel. Our host at the power plant explained to us: "We don't see carbon dioxide as a pollution stream, we see it as a resource." The use of methanol as a fuel additive in Iceland is limited by regulations, however, the Svartsengi production has potential to increase dramatically and a second plant further north is in the works. Presently, only 10% of the carbon dioxide released by the Svartsengi power plant is used by the co-located methanol facility. According to a recent news article: Benedikt Stefánsson, Manager of Business Development at Carbon Recycling International (CRI) which operates the only methanol plant in the country at Svartsengi in Grindavík, says present regulations do not assume higher than 3% methanol mixed with gasoline. Iceland, however, is committed to increasing the country's fuel consumption coming from renewable fuels to 10% by the year 2020. Changes are being made in this regard and Benedikt is hopeful these changes will be a step in the right direction. It is possible to produce 5 million liters of methanol in the Svartsengi plant. ´´We have also been exploring the possibility of producing 40 to 80 million liters from waste [CO2],'' he says. "Additionally, it´s possible to produce much more with electricity. Indeed, there are already projects in place in the energy sector which could allow us to produce fuel to meet the total demand.´´ The fuel consumption of the entire car population is around 350 million liters annually. The power plant official we spoke with even spoke of an export market for Iceland for methanol. What seems clear is that energy innovation is moving ahead on many fronts, many of which are quietly out of sight, unless you are looking. In Iceland, carbon capture and "recycling" is now taking place. Can it be done at larger scale at economic returns? It bears watching. Posted by Roger Pielke, Jr. at 8/14/2012 02:44:00 PM Then there is also this: Zepps interviews Ken Caldeira, an atmospheric scientist with the Carnegie Institution at Stanford University, who says it will take decades to clean up the excess carbon dioxide that's heating up the atmosphere. But Allen Wright and Klaus Lackner of the Earth Institute's Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy at Columbia University may have an answer: A type of plastic "leaf" that soaks up carbon dioxide from the air -- about one ton a day for a piece the size of a large tree. To release the CO2, they the wet the plastic and catch the bubbles. Allen says the carbon dioxide can be used to create a synthetic gasoline that's carbon neutral because its emissions can be soaked up again. So with these new technologies fossil fuels are renwable alternatives just as much as wind or solar.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1350793903483</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 00:31:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350795283933-3</Id><Topic><Title>President Obama's Colors Don't Run</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1350781515872</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 21:05:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Any offspring of yours are automatically DOOMED to a pretty miserable life.</Msg><Username>sammy.shakedown</Username><Timestamp>1350795283933</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 00:54:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350797422378-4</Id><Title>TIC TOC get ready for the drop, It's time to protect your 401k's and IRA's Almost every company that has reported earnings also reported layoffs</Title><Msg>TIC TOC get ready for the drop, It's time to protect your 401k's and IRA's Almost every company that has reported earnings also reported layoffs</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1350797422378</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 01:30:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350802032280-5</Id><Topic><Title>Liberal generated media win for Obama.

This number peaked at around 9 percent two separate times over the summer, according to data collected since January. Who are these defectors? Jeff Waltrip, 56, is a retired electrician and retail worker who has voted Republican all his life. But in his view Obama "has done a good job with what he was left with, and I truly believe that allowing Mitt Romney in there is going to make the world a whole lot worse than it is now." Waltrip said he liked the Republican ticket in 2008 because McCain is a veteran and because Sarah Palin "made me laugh." The McCain-to-Obama switchers are 55 percent male, and 34 percent of them are 55 or older. (Overall, Obama trails Romney 34 percent to 52 percent among white men over 50.) About 72 percent of them are white. They are largely from the East Coast; nearly 4 in 10 live in the mid- or South Atlantic. Nearly 3 in 10 finished their education after high school, and nearly 2 in 10 have a bachelor's degree. Two-thirds say they are absolutely going to vote, choosing "10" on a 1-10 scale for likelihood of voting. Even though 38 percent of all voters believe the economy is the election's most prominent issue, just one-third of the McCain defectors agree. Character matters more. "Right now if I had to choose it would be Obama, because he's more personable," said William Holliday, a 58-year-old retiree from Convis Township, Michigan. "Romney has changed his position so many damn times, you don't know what he thinks at all. But they're both liars." Holliday said that in general he leans Republican. "I did vote for McCain four years ago in spite of the fact he picked Palin. Because I thought that was a cheap trick he pulled there." He worries that if Romney is elected he will put "Cheney and Rumsfeld back in there to run the show." Jeffrey Baker, 56, a retiree in Strong, Maine, thinks Romney's refusal to release his taxes disqualifies him. "If you can't be honest from the start, I don't want you in the Oval Office," he said. Romney, whose personal worth has been estimated at roughly $250 million, has faced criticism from Democrats for not releasing enough years' worth of his tax returns. "Four years ago I voted for John McCain because I thought he was more experienced, and I thought we needed someone with some military background," Baker said. "Mitt Romney - I don't believe he has the experience that's needed. He's a businessman, he knows how to make money. That's all well and good, but we've got people to worry about." Baker is unhappy with the entire campaign. "There's nothing going on. No information, no nothing," he said. "Everybody says they're going to do this, they're going to do that. But nobody says how they're going to do it." He's basing his vote on a general sense that "Obama is more for the whole country than Romney is," alluding to the leaked video. "Romney, that's his honest feelings. He doesn't really care about the 47 percent." Waltrip also believes Romney is out of touch with lower-income Americans, and he mistrusts the candidate's religious convictions. "I've always felt like the Mormon Church was more of a cult," Waltrip said. "I'm sort of afraid that his interests are going to be strictly for the Mormon Church." Overall about 34 percent of likely voters said they would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate if he or she were Mormon, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted during the week ending October 21.</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1350836664452</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 12:24:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350837076675-17</Id><Title>Republicans don't understand that people don't want them politicizing a mole-hill</Title><Msg>Comapred to the massive failures of the republicans concerning 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq, the attack on our consulate in Benghazi, which President Obama immediately called an act of terror, is a mole-hill.

By formally converting ‘Obamacare’ into ‘Obamatax,’ the court allows Obama to raise taxes on the middle-class. The decision is a distressing blow to taxpayers and represents the single largest tax increase on young people in the nation’s history. When it takes full effect, the Internal Revenue Service will have immense new power and authority to persecute and prosecute a whole new group of taxpayers. If the law takes full effect, it will devastate small businesses and destroy any chance for a sustainable economic recovery. It will add trillions of dollars to the national debt and push the country toward bankruptcy even faster than current projections. Any individual who believes that this decision must be overturned must do everything possible to undo the damage that has been done, especially at the ballot box on November 6.</Msg><Username>obama_tax_secrets</Username><Timestamp>1350853466000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 17:04:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350854624193-31</Id><Topic><Title>'Cranks and crazies' have taken over US Republicans, says Australian minister</Title><Username>cloroxcowboy</Username><Timestamp>1348463495560</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 01:11:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>commie socialists hate republicans, they're the enemy, huh spart</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1350854624193</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 17:23:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350854704479-32</Id><Topic><Title>Character and honesty matter - R voters swithching to Obama</Title><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1350836664452</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 12:24:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, if that's true that 34% are less likely to vote for a Mormon, it sure looks like the Republican leadership really doesn't want to win the WH!

The Largest Tax Hike in US History has just been upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States and President Obama sees this assault on the middle class as a victory. The already unpopular 2010 health care reform law has been converted by the court into a $1.76 trillion tax increase funded by escalating taxes to be paid the vast majority of taxpayers. The high court’s ruling leaves in place 20 tax increases in the health-care law, of those, 12 tax hikes would affect families earning less than $250,000 per year, including a “Cadillac tax” on high-cost insurance plans, a tax on insurance providers, and an excise tax on medical device manufacturers. By formally converting ‘Obamacare’ into ‘Obamatax,’ the court allows Obama to raise taxes on the middle-class. The decision is a distressing blow to taxpayers and represents the single largest tax increase on young people in the nation’s history. When it takes full effect, the Internal Revenue Service will have immense new power and authority to persecute and prosecute a whole new group of taxpayers. If the law takes full effect, it will devastate small businesses and destroy any chance for a sustainable economic recovery. It will add trillions of dollars to the national debt and push the country toward bankruptcy even faster than current projections. Any individual who believes that this decision must be overturned must do everything possible to undo the damage that has been done, especially at the ballot box on November 6. –Obamacare law contains 20 new or higher taxes on American families and small businesses– WASHINGTON, DC – Obamacare contains 20 new or higher taxes on American families and small businesses. Arranged by their respective effective dates, below is the total list of all $500 billion-plus in tax hikes (over the next ten years) in Obamacare, where to find them in the bill, and how much your taxes are scheduled to go up as of today: Taxes that took effect in 2010: 1. Excise Tax on Charitable Hospitals (Min$/immediate): $50,000 per hospital if they fail to meet new “community health assessment needs,” “financial assistance,” and “billing and collection” rules set by HHS. Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,961-1,971 2. Codification of the “economic substance doctrine” (Tax hike of $4.5 billion). This provision allows the IRS to disallow completely-legal tax deductions and other legal tax-minimizing plans just because the IRS deems that the action lacks “substance” and is merely intended to reduce taxes owed. Bill: Reconciliation Act; Page: 108-113 3. “Black liquor” tax hike (Tax hike of $23.6 billion). This is a tax increase on a type of bio-fuel. Bill: Reconciliation Act; Page: 105 4. Tax on Innovator Drug Companies ($22.2 bil/Jan 2010): $2.3 billion annual tax on the industry imposed relative to share of sales made that year. Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,971-1,980 5. Blue Cross/Blue Shield Tax Hike ($0.4 bil/Jan 2010): The special tax deduction in current law for Blue Cross/Blue Shield companies would only be allowed if 85 percent or more of premium revenues are spent on clinical services. Bill: PPACA; Page: 2,004 6. Tax on Indoor Tanning Services ($2.7 billion/July 1, 2010): New 10 percent excise tax on Americans using indoor tanning salons. Bill: PPACA; Page: 2,397-2,399 7. Medicine Cabinet Tax ($5 bil/Jan 2011): Americans no longer able to use health savings account (HSA), flexible spending account (FSA), or health reimbursement (HRA) pre-tax dollars to purchase non- prescription, over-the-counter medicines (except insulin). Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,957-1,959 8. HSA Withdrawal Tax Hike ($1.4 bil/Jan 2011): Increases additional tax on non-medical early withdrawals from an HSA from 10 to 20 percent, disadvantaging them relative to IRAs and other tax- advantaged accounts, which remain at 10 percent. Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,959 Tax that took effect in 2012 9. Employer Reporting of Insurance on W-2 (Min$/Jan 2012): Preamble to taxing health benefits on individual tax returns. Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,957 Taxes that take effect in 2013 10.

Barack Obama had held a 10 vote advantage over Romney up until then. According to the map, Romney leads Obama 206-201 with several 131 votes are counted as “toss-up.” Several battleground states have moved towards Romney, including North Carolina, in which the RCP polls indicate he has a six point advantage. In Florida, Romney is up by 2.5 points. Virginia is also a close race. The Romney campaign has gained momentum since the first debate. this has caused a shift in the polling data and now the Obama campaign is circling the wagons around Ohio, New Hampsire, Nevada and Iowa. Theoretically, if he were able to stay where he is in terms of electoral votes and keep these four states, he would win re-election, but as we have seen, things can change quickly depending on what mistakes or gaffes a candidate makes. This is good news for the Romney campaign and not so good news for Team Obama.</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1350864330179</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 20:05:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350864398863-49</Id><Topic><Title>Salt Lake Tribune: Obama Has Earned A Second Term, Mittens Doesn't A First</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1350849638811</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:00:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ouch!

"The White House's new health-care proposal promises the "largest middle class tax cut for health care in history," which is a creative way of describing a vast taxpayer-subsidized insurance entitlement. Naturally, the fine print goes on to describe one of the largest tax increases for health care in history, too. This new ObamaCare bargain would for the first time apply the 2.9% Medicare payroll tax to "interest, dividends, annuities, royalties and rents," so-called passive income that we are told includes capital gains, though the latter wasn't explicitly mentioned in the proposal. This antigrowth investment tax would apply to singles earning more than $200,000 and joint filers over $250,000 and comes on top of the Senate's 0.9-percentage-point increase in the payroll tax, which would bring the combined employee-employer share to 3.8%. The rate hike on investment income would presumably take effect at the same time the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts are due to expire next year, bringing the top rate to 22.9% as the current top capital gains rate would also rise to 20% from 15%. That's a 52% jump, and the last time investors were slammed with anything comparable was 1986 when the capital gains rate bounced to 28% from 20%—or a 40% increase—as part of the Reagan tax reform that reduced income tax rates. [obama] In part this is a sneaky way of waging the House's war on "the rich" by other means while appearing to compromise. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 5.4-percentage-point "surcharge" on modified adjusted gross income above $1 million—which also includes capital gains—was supposedly too extreme for the Senate, but the White House is trying to smuggle in its 2.9-percentage-point cousin. Of course, $250,000 is a lot lower income threshold than $1 million, and the rate can always be inched up later once the tax is already in place. The House surcharge is certainly destructive but it is at least above-board. The White House levy muddies up both the tax code and Medicare financing. The Medicare payroll levy was designed as a social insurance program with some connection, however attenuated, between taxes paid and benefits received. When Medicare passed in 1965 it was modelled after Social Security and the tax was supposed to be equivalent to a "premium" for guaranteed health-care insurance for seniors; everyone "contributed" at the same rate. Until 1993, the payroll tax was assessed only on the first $135,000 of wages, until the Clinton Administration and the Democratic Congress lifted the Medicare cap entirely.
