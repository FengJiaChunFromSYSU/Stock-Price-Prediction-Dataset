This included 5-star ratings in the frontal and side crashes as well as in the rollover test. Meanwhile the man that helped bring outsourcing to Boeing is now a Ford guy, while he did ok , he is not Elon Musk- Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F): Ford’s Russian joint venture is planning to scale back production at its plant near St. Petersburg given that demand for the compact cars made there has seen dramatic reductions. The plant — which produces 125,000 cars per year with 3,000 employees — has experienced ”changes in customer demand with shifts between market segments” that has resulted in a 16 percent decline this year in the compact car segment. . Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE:TM): Lawyers acting on behalf of the plaintiffs in a wrongful death lawsuit against Toyota are demanding a $20 million settlement from the company as compensation for the family of a woman who died when her Camry suddenly accelerated and crashed, despite her efforts to stop. The trial is expected to last two months.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376107455023</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-10 00:04:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376107553450-2</Id><Topic><Title>The Best time in Human history happened without a Federal Reserve and No IRS.</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1376049017080</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-09 07:50:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WRONG...WRONG WRONG.....Since the foudning of the Fed...the inflation rate is 2258.6% For 200 years before that...with money actually BACKED by something other then hot air...the inflation rate was essentially flat.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1376107553450</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-10 00:05:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376107631854-3</Id><Topic><Title>Letter from Boeing today</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1376106522609</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-09 23:48:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Based on the total miss in each quarterly report on the 787 for years now and only 13 weeks apart, , Boeing is the last place to get correct information</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376107631854</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-10 00:07:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376108057992-4</Id><Topic><Title>you missed Tesla now pay attention Elon Musk on the Hyperloop, August 12 , 2013 start reading, sell Boeing</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376085814491</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-09 18:03:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ha ha I bet you 3 stooges don't read anything, just thumbs down osulinn, domerrrrr45 and company. how is that Boeing stock working for you this week, down every day this week for a loss of 2.38% While my stock Tesla is up 11% this week and 352 % year to date ha ha keep your ego on boys you missed my call on apple , ACAD and now your missing tsla .

Spartacus99991 , a loss is a Boeing loss of 2.4% this week in Boeing Spartacus99991, while you constantly pimp for Boeing the bottom line is clear. Boeing is not as good an investment as TSLA or Airbus. . , .TSLA, for the year to date, TSLA is up 351%. Spartacus99991, Boeing is never going to gain 350% this year, and ever from this point forward, it is going to go bankrupt in 10 years. Spartacus99991,Boeing is up 39% year to date. and trails Airbus which gained 2.1% this week and Airbus betters Boeing agin this week and this year to date and Airbus is up 55% year to date, up from 50% a few weeks ago . Just like Tom O"brien said, Boeing will peak at or around $ 107 the last high and is" dead on the vine" and then Boeing stock price will retrace to 71 dollars. So far for a month now Tom Obrien is right. BTW, per Tom Obrien, Boeing stock price , year to date did peak a few weeks ago at $107, is now going down down from the YTD high range of 42% a few weeks ago . the trend is not good , right ! . If American Airlines wants 260 Airbus planes up from a once all Boeing fleet, then that reality is not a good thing for your barker Boeing stock. Spartacus99991, reality check, and that makes you a loser., not a winner. As to my call on Steve Jobs after he died that is clear once more you know I called it several times ,as a Boeing barker, if you can change the subject to old news by the diversion that would make you a deceitful neutral , not going to happen. So all you can do is the barker clown , come on in folks and spin the wheel like osulinn said Boeing would be 110 Friday, nope it was down , osulinn ,domerrrrr45, are barkers for Boeing ,TSLA up 351% Boeing bettered by both TSLA and Airbus Steve Jobs is dead, Elon Musk is alive get over it .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376158336938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-10 14:12:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376159511697-22</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing and McDonnell Douglas and stock price and how to pick a stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373820931044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 12:55:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I do agree the new Boeing is nothing like the old Boeing.

O lies all the time about everything. I like how O just flat out lied to Jay Leno and the country "We have no domestic spy program" when the facts are so obvious and when the creep is doing everything in his power to destroy an honest person like Snowden who brought the crimes to light. O would like to make an example of Snowden to keep other whisleblowers quite. It's so silly that anyone could believe a serial liar like O, but his low intelligence followers still take his unsupported word on things that are just transparent lies. His lies and cover-ups are now almost too many to count. O's policies and treachery are turning the whole world against the US, and with good reason.</Msg><Username>zombiegrunt</Username><Timestamp>1376193450566</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-10 23:57:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
