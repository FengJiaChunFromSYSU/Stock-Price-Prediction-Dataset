Glenn Danzig / Photo by Jonas Rogowski, via Wikimedia Commons Glenn Danzig / Photo by Jonas Rogowski, via Wikimedia Commons In an interview with music blog Gimme Noise, the legendary rocker spoke candidly about his band’s latest tour, his success in the studio and about the leftist government’s intrusion on art. He specifically cited the Gore family’s album labeling scheme as a prime example of brainless liberal ideology. Speaking about Danzig’s breakthrough song “Mother,” he explained that it was written as a jab to the Parental Music Resource Center (PMRC) – the association responsible for deciding which albums should receive Parental Advisory labels – who believed they knew what was musically best for the American consumer. “… Yeah, you know, Al Gore wanted to tell people what they could listen to and what they couldn’t, what they could record. It was basically coming down to the idea that he wouldn’t let anybody record any music that he didn’t think you should be doing. There was going to be an organization that would tell you what you could and couldn’t record. And certainly if you couldn’t record it, you couldn’t put it out. It was really fascist.” Danzig went on to cast a more inclusive net around Democrats’ policies and specifically highlighted the hypocrisy of fascists who masquerade as liberals, rallying behind more egregious policies like extra-judicial drone killings, simply because in their eyes, their leader Obama can do no wrong. “My view on Democrats is that they’re fascists disguised as liberals, or liberal moderates. You’re not allowed to say anything that they don’t agree with. You’re not allowed to do anything.

Kucinich, known for his strong stance on privacy and civil liberties, urged attendees at the premiere of a documentary on government and corporate abuse of digital data that it was unacceptable to allow the government to continue to destroy constitutional rights. “We have the CIA, the FBI, a dozen other intelligence infrastructures. Frankly — and I’m saying this with a lifetime’s experience in government here — it’s time to punch the NSA’s ticket here.” Kucinich stated at the showing of the film Terms and Conditions May Apply.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376997802130</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-20 07:23:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376998516734-11</Id><Topic><Title>My Impersonation of HoozdikHertz</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376876757320</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-18 21:45:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You already ADMITTED you are Nowarrantneeded ...just for starters.....I make it all too easy to expose your never ending Hypocrisy as the small minded and perpetually petty human being you have proven yourself to be.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376998516734</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-20 07:35:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376998608164-12</Id><Topic><Title>Former Congressman (and Real Liberal) Dennis Kucinich Slams Obama Administration</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376997802130</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-20 07:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“They’ve ruined the brand. They’ve destroyed the idea of privacy.” he added. “We need some kind of symbolic and profound approach here, that says, ‘look, you’ve violated something that’s very dear to the American people — you don’t get to do that.’” Kucinich urged. “We talk about the death penalty for individuals, which I oppose, but I think there needs to be for government agencies that so broadly betray the public interest,” Kucinich added. “There needs to be a measure of responsibility. And if they go beyond the pale, which the NSA has, they just ought to be abolished. We don’t need the spying.” he asserted. The former Ohio Congressman, who left office earlier this year, stated “In a just world, Snowden, we’d be having ticker tape parades for him. But that’s not what’s going to happen.” Speaking about Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper lying to Congress about the NSA’s spying techniques, Kucinich stated: “Well, you know it’s illegal to lie to Congress, but everyone lies to Congress. As soon as they raise their right hand, watch out! Clapper should be held responsible, but he won’t be, because that’s the condition we’re in right now.” Fresh revelations of NSA abuses were met late Friday by with a response from the agency that the spy agency was “not trying to break the law.” “These are not willful violations, they are not malicious,” John DeLong, NSA director of compliance, told reporters. In a blatant attempt to diffuse the revelations, Senator Diane Feinstein, Chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, echoed the comments, stating “The majority of these ‘compliance incidents’ are unintentional and do not involve any inappropriate surveillance of Americans.” “As I have said previously, the committee has never identified an instance in which the NSA has intentionally abused its authority to conduct surveillance for inappropriate purposes.” Feinstein added. Basically, as yet more proof of abuse of authority is unveiled (as if it was needed), the NSA and intelligence oversight officials have been reduced to arguing that the agency didn’t mean to spy on millions of Americans, so therefore it’s OK that it spied on millions of Americans, and its also OK that it is continuing to spy on millions of Americans. Senator Rand Paul slammed the ludicrous response Sunday, saying that the NSA’s massive surveillance program is “fundamentally unconstitutional” and that it cannot be saved by more oversight. “They basically are looking at, I believe, all of the cell phone calls in America every day.” Paul stated, adding “We need more people doing specific intelligence data on people who we have suspicion of rather than doing it on suspicion-less searches of all Americans’ phone calls.”</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376998608164</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-20 07:36:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377000495777-13</Id><Topic><Title>NEW BOOK: IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1376996599231</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-20 07:03:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dream on, nut job!

On Friday afternoon one of the companies, Silent Circle, posted further explanation of its argument. Basically it comes down to this: While it may be possible to encrypt the contents of e-mail to prevent someone else from reading it, there is no way for an e-mail provider to secure the information about who is communicating with whom. Over the past few months it has become clear that this information may be as desirable as the content of the messages themselves. This has always been a potential vulnerability with e-mail, but one that was difficult to exploit until relatively recently, wrote Louis Kowolowski, Silent Circle’s technical operations manager, on the company’s blog: In the past, securing the body of the message was sufficient. The tools and techniques used for snooping were not on a large enough scale to allow the metadata to be useful. With the tapping of backbone internet providers, interested parties can now see all traffic on the internet. The days where it was possible for two people to have a truly private conversation over e-mail, if they ever existed, are long over. continued</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1377023216087</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-20 14:26:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377023267035-56</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden: Hero, Knave or Fool?</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373392716386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are two technical issues that lead to this insecurity. The first is that encrypted messages are sent by the recipient and the sender exchanging encryption keys–tools that scramble a message and allow only the intended recipient to unscramble it. To do this, both parties need to be online whenever a message is sent. This is not how people use e-mail. Second, current technical standards for e-mail require that some information remain unencrypted, such as the identity of the people communicating, the time messages were sent, and the subject. “So, a PGP-encrypted message with the subject line ‘Pricing info for blasting caps’ may be sort of ridiculous,” writes Kowolowski. There are some situations where this matters and others where it does not. E-mail can be secured if the only goal is to make sure no one can intercept sensitive information being passed along over it. One example is a company trying to protect its intellectual property. The parties aren’t worried about someone finding out they are in communication with one another. In other instances, such as activists organizing political activity, a record of who is communicating could be just as important as what they’re saying. In an analysis earlier this summer, for instance, an associate professor of sociology at Duke showed how simple information about which American dissidents were involved in which organizations during the 1700s could have led the British to Paul Revere’s door before he had a chance to ride. There is widespread agreement among security experts that digital privacy is much more complicated in the wake of recent discloses about the National Security Agency’s surveillance practices. Some believe that the challenges will simply serve as a way to spark innovation to solve those issues. But doing so with e-mail will likely require a change in the way that all links of the e-mail chain work. A single provider can’t make its communications secure, argues Kowolowski. It would take all of them.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1377023267035</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-20 14:27:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377024733876-57</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden: Hero, Knave or Fool?</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373392716386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is true.

CBS/AP/ August 20, 2013, 5:41 PM Aussie baseball player killed by "bored" Okla. teens, police say Updated 5:43 p.m. ET OKLAHOMA CITY An Australian baseball player out for a jog in an Oklahoma neighborhood was shot and killed by three "bored" teenagers who decided to kill someone for fun, police said. Christopher Lane, who was visiting the town of Duncan, where his girlfriend and her family live, had passed a home where the boys were staying and that apparently led to him being gunned down at random, Police Chief Danny Ford said Monday. Prosecutors charged 15-year-old James Francis Edwards Jr. and 16-year-old Chancey Allen Luna with first-degree murder on Tuesday. Police say the two killed 22-year-old Christopher Lane on Friday to overcome boredom. Under Oklahoma law, anyone who is 15 or older and facing a first-degree murder charge is automatically tried in adult court. Also Tuesday, 17-year-old Michael Dewayne Jones was charged with being an accessory after the fact and with using a vehicle during the discharge of weapon. Jones is charged as a youthful offender but will still have his case heard in adult court. Chancey Allen Luna, 16, left, and James Francis Edwards, 15, center, have been charged with first degree murder; at right, the driver of the car, Michael Dewayne Jones, has been charged with an accessory to the crime. No bond was set for the younger boys. Bond was set at $1 million for Jones.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1377042184228</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-20 19:43:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377042416526-70</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden: Hero, Knave or Fool?</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373392716386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So many thumbs down on the TRUTH.

Do not attempt to adjust the picture. I am controlling transmission. If I wish to make it louder, I will bring up the volume. If I wish to make it softer, I will tune it to a whisper. I will control the horizontal. I will control the vertical. I can roll the image, make it flutter. I can change the focus to a soft blur or sharpen it to crystal clarity. For the next hour, sit quietly and I will control all that you see and hear. I repeat: there is nothing wrong with your television set. You are about to participate in a great adventure.
