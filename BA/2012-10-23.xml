That thrust? Taxes simply MUST be raised on the evil rich. But when it did come to foreign policy there were two winners last night … a winner for low-knowledge voters, and another for voters with a greater understanding of America’s foreign policy problems and opportunities. Low-knowledge voters would be impressed by Obama’s “I got bin Laden” bravado. More informed voters would be impressed by Romney’s recitation of our failures to more deftly manage the changing situation in the Middle East.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1350996009425</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 08:40:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350997143853-17</Id><Title>The Campaign ...

The man had no problem circumventing our Constitution and our Congress when it came to immigration or welfare work requirements or making recess appointments when the Congress wasn’t actually on recess. He also ignored the law when it came to his bailout of the United Auto Workers. But when Obama is challenged on a promise he made and failed to keep, suddenly his fondness for executive power is MIA. Dear Ruler was recently asked about his failure pay off on his promise to close Guantanamo Bay. Suddenly this becomes the fault of … the Congress? Obama tells John Stewart … “There are some things that we haven't gotten done. I still want to close Guantanamo. We haven't been able to get that through Congress,” Obama said during his Oct. 18 appearance on the program. “One of the things that we got to do is put a legal architecture in place, and we need congressional help to do that to make sure that not only am I reigned in, but any president is reigned in, in terms of some of the decisions that we're making,” he said. Convenient, isn’t it? When Obama is called out, suddenly he is concerned about the abuse of executive privilege. But if he needs to use it for political gain, he seems to have no problem trampling our Constitution.

Looking at any of the three, Romney was the clear winner, and Obama the loser. Obviously, Romney's overarching objective wasn't to score debate points on Benghazi or Syria. It was to prove that he is competent, calm, knowledgeable and -- most emphatically -- not a warmonger. It was to make sure he seemed presidential. He achieved it. By contrast, the President needed to highlight some perceived Romney mistake or lack of knowledge, or unsuitability of temperament or other disqualifying characteristic. He failed -- and worse, he made himself dislikable in his efforts to goad Romney into a fight . . . especially when Romney serenely declined to take the bait. On memorable lines that provide the moments viewers remember, Romney obviously had it all over the President. From "attacking me is not an agenda" to "Mr. President, America Has Not Dictated to Other Nations; We Have Freed Other Nations From Dictators” to "Nowhere in the world is America's influence stronger than it was 4 years ago" (an echo of "are you better off than you were four years ago?") he had the memorable take-away phrases. Ticking time bombs? How 'bout Obama's statement that the sequestration "would not happen" -- already being walked back and shown up for the bluster that it was? Or the dismissive invocation of "bayonets" and the Navy -- sure to sit well in Virginia (and ignorant of the fact that Marines still fight with bayonets)? Or his misstatements on Iraq status of forces agreement? Look, some focus groups feel like Obama won the foreign policy portion of the debate. Fine. But Romney didn't need to win on debate points -- he needed not to lose, and to maintain his strong advantages on the economy, and to remain presidential. He did all of it, and more. At the same time, President Obama seemed nervous, on the attack, again condescending and did nothing to raise his flagging likability numbers (he even seemed to me to be lecturing voters in his closing statement!).

With his "me too" refrain in last night's last debate, the guy who reminds us of an America bygone, the one where teenagers collected 45s of their favorite songs, sounded like a broken record. You might have thought the man running to become the 45th president of the United States would have come to Boca Raton with a song of his own, but Romney's 45 was playing music recorded by President 44. Over and over the challenger tried to reassure us, humming the night away with the melody of Barack Obama's foreign policy. Like presidential campaigns, foreign policy is all about strategy. Watching the debate last night you had to wonder what strategy Romney was pursuing. Most Americans give the president pretty strong marks on his foreign policy. And when Romney tried during the second debate to target the president's handling of the terrorist attacks on the American Consulate in Benghazi he ended up shooting himself in the foot. So maybe he decided there just wasn't much to be gained in attacking the president on specifics? The goal behind "me too" was probably limited to placing Mitt in the foreign policy mainstream</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1351000045357</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:47:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351000188799-27</Id><Topic><Title>The Campaign ...

The limits were part of President Obama's promise to curtail the role of big money in politics, a goal he has struggled to meet.

But the extent of its failure has been largely ignored by the press. Sure, single instances garner attention as they happen, but they ignore past failures in order to make it seem like a rare case. The truth is that the problem is widespread. The government’s picking winners and losers in the energy market has cost taxpayers billions of dollars, and the rate of failure, cronyism, and corruption at the companies receiving the subsidies is substantial. The fact that some companies are not under financial duress does not make the policy a success. It simply means that our taxpayer dollars subsidized companies that would’ve found the financial support in the private market. So far, 34 companies that were offered federal support from taxpayers are faltering — either having gone bankrupt or laying off workers or heading for bankruptcy. This list includes only those companies that received federal money from the Obama Administration’s Department of Energy and other agencies. The amount of money indicated does not reflect how much was actually received or spent but how much was offered. The amount also does not include other state, local, and federal tax credits and subsidies, which push the amount of money these companies have received from taxpayers even higher.

Posted on June 1, 2012 Bookmark and Share Summary An ad from the Romney campaign strains facts to make its point that federal grants and loans to green-energy companies were improperly steered to Obama’s political backers, and that federal money was wasted on failing companies that are now laying off employees. It claims the “inspector general said contracts were steered to ‘friends and family.’ ” But that’s not exactly what the inspector general said. And in the year since he said he was investigating such alleged “schemes,” no public charges have been made, at least not yet. The ad highlights the struggles — company losses, nose-diving stock and layoffs — at several companies that received substantial Department of Energy loans and grants. The ad fails to note, however, that most of the layoffs at those companies were overseas, or that the projects backed by DOE are largely moving along as planned. An independent review of the DOE program says its failure rate has been better than anticipated. The ad uses an inflated figure from a partisan source to quantify loans and grants that went to Obama donors. Analysis In a speech standing in front of Solyndra’s headquarters on May 31, Mitt Romney made clear that he intends to make “crony capitalism” a major theme in his campaign, and a counter-attack to the Obama side’s emphasis on the worst-performing investments of Bain Capital during Romney’s time there. The Romney ad — which employs an arresting strobe-like effect to create a sinister vibe — says Obama is “spending your tax dollars to create jobs” and asks rhetorically, “How’s he doing?”</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1351015593271</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:06:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351015606270-91</Id><Topic><Title>Not quite the truth you posted from The Heritage Foundation. they left a lot out</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1351015593271</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:06:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The opening volley is an attack on Obama with a familiar punching bag, Solyndra. “You’ve heard of Solyndra,” the narrator states. “They took $535 million in taxpayer loan guarantees and went bankrupt.” Solyndra’s downfall is well-documented. The California start-up solar company announced in August it would file for bankruptcy protection — about two-and-a-half years after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy. Solyndra remains the subject of a months-long investigation led by House Republicans. Among the revelations so far are that an Energy Department adviser and former Obama fundraiser sent emails pushing for Solyndra loans even though he had pledged to recuse himself because his wife’s law firm represented Solyndra. But, the ad’s narrator states, “that’s not even half the story.” The ad then highlights a series of federal loans to green-energy companies that have since lost money or stock value, or have slashed employees. We’ll get to each of those companies, but first let’s deal with the ad’s most explosive claims: “More than $16 billion have gone to companies like Solyndra that are linked to big Obama and Democrat donors. The inspector general said contracts were steered to ‘friends and family.’ Obama is giving taxpayer money to big donors. And then watching them lose it. Good for them. Bad for us.” We’ve dealt with this $16 billion figure before when it was cited in TV and print ads from the Republican-leaning Crossroad GPS. As Crossroads did, the Romney ad misleadingly cites Newsweek as the source of the figure, but the magazine was just publishing an excerpt from the book “Throw Them All Out,” by conservative writer Peter Schweizer. A former foreign policy adviser for Sarah Palin and speech-writing consultant for the George W. Bush administration, Schweizer is now a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution. We found Schweizer’s $16.4 billion claim to be too high by nearly $6 billion. But that still leaves billions of dollars that went to companies run by or primarily owned by Obama financial backers. Payola? One might expect that a healthy percentage of owners of green-energy companies might lean Democratic, so it’s not surprising that some loans and grants went to companies run by Democratic donors. Some went to Republican donors as well. The question is whether those federal dollars were improperly or unfairly steered to donors in a quid pro quo arrangement. The next line in the ad, “The inspector general said contracts were steered to ‘friends and family’ ” suggests that’s exactly what was going on. But the inspector general’s words have been twisted.

So my fine feathered friends..........if you get Romney I hope you are happy with your result. All his advisers worked in the Bush administration and we saw how well that did. Bye ya all.

Only in the land of MSNBC were sparks flying. Famously tingly MSNBC host Chris Matthews decided the whole race came down to, well, race. In one of the more outlandish rants of an outlandish career, Matthews said the right hates Obama more than they want to destroy Al Qaeda, according to The Hill. The rant is too priceless to edit: “I think they hate Obama. They want him out of the White House more than they want to destroy Al Qaeda. Their No. 1 enemy in the world right now, on the right, is their hatred, hatred for Obama. And we can go into that about the white working class in the South and looking at these numbers we're getting the last couple days about racial hatred in many cases … this isn't about being a better president, they want to get rid of this president,’ he said.”</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1351025845802</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 16:57:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351025945759-120</Id><Topic><Title>Romenys bain capitol money is deferred income</Title><Username>andse2003</Username><Timestamp>1349280891100</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 12:14:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>andse...

Is Virginia next? October 23, 2012 | 11:31 am Paul Bedard Washington Secrets The Washington Examiner @SecretsBedard MSNBC's Chuck Todd: Obama has big problems and is running out of time D'oh: Obama ads boost enthusiasm for Romney Romney has solid edge in 269-269 electoral vote tie scenario Facing a Mitt Romney surge in North Carolina polls, Team Obama is poised to pull back forces in the state that hosted the Democratic National Convention and Democratic advisors suggest that Virginia may be next to fall. While Obama aides on the ground in both states reject suggestions the campaign has given up to devote more resources to Iowa, Ohio and Florida, those close to the Obama campaign say it's getting to be time to cut bait. Democratic strategist Paul Begala, asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer if the Obama campaign has given up on North Carolina, said "Yes. I'm not supposed to say that Wolf. I work for the pro-Obama super PAC, so I'm being paid to help reelect the president, but if you look at where he's going and where he's spending money, yes, it looks like Governor Romney is likely to carry North Carolina." The latest Rasmussen Reports poll had Romney leading Obama by 6 percent and trending upward. What's more, North Carolina, which Obama won in 2008, does not appear on the new list of Obama battleground states. Former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel agrees. He told the Tampa Bay Times that Romney is likely to win North Carolina. A campaign aide told a Washington Post blogger, however, that the campaign is doing well in early voting and is not withdrawing any campaign troops. Pollster John Zogby told Secrets that while Obama looks to be giving up on North Carolina, it is still winnable. "North Carolina should be in play, but Obama is pulling out, never a good vibe to send to voters. He is competitive, has a large and growing African-American and creative class base, and a small and growing Latino vote.

At the same time, the Romney campaign has bought television advertising in the Boston market, which reaches screens in New Hampshire, a state Obama won by almost 10 points in 2008. Asked whether Romney himself would be visiting Wisconsin in the closing days of the race, Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior Romney adviser, said: 'Yes. Paul Ryan was just in Pittsburgh.

Nearly all the people who constantly post and complain and surf for stories about this have something to fear deep down that they hate, so the self-hatred you have is what needs professional help.
