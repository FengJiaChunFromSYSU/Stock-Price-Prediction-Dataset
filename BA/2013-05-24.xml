In 2008, the Canadian company TransCanada proposed the construction of a pipeline to move tar sands oil, one of the dirtiest fuels on Earth, from Alberta to the Gulf Coast of Texas for export. The project, called Keystone XL, was rolled out like a luxury car, with promoters touting it as a crucial energy and jobs project during a period of high unemployment and rising gasoline prices. "Tens of thousands of jobs," "secure, stable oil from a friendly neighbor in Canada" and "home run" are some of the selling points Americans have heard in television ads, congressional hearings and across the Internet. But there are alarming details in the fine print. Keystone XL will create few long-term jobs, will do nothing to lower gas prices or improve our energy independence and poses serious risks to our environment. Keystone XL backers have widely touted a TransCanada report that projects the pipeline will create 20,000 U.S. jobs, including 13,000 in construction and 7,000 in manufacturing. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been even more optimistic, crowing that it will create 250,000 permanent jobs. But the State Department's recent projections, made in consultation with TransCanada, reveal the truth. During construction, up to 42,100 direct and indirect temporary jobs will be supported by the project. However, in less than two years when construction is completed, Keystone XL is expected to support only 35 permanent jobs. In other words, this multibillion-dollar project will be responsible for almost as many permanent jobs as a new drive-through for burgers and shakes.

In fact, consumers won't see one drop remain in the U.S. market. TransCanada's president of energy and oil pipelines, Alex Pourbaix, admitted this under questioning at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in 2011 when he said the company was not willing to put into law or shipping contracts language that guarantees the oil remains in the U.S. Because tar sands oil is expensive to produce, oil companies want an export route to the more lucrative international market. Keystone XL would actually increase the price of oil for Americans. If built, Canadian tar sands oil currently flowing to Midwest refineries will be diverted to the Gulf, causing U.S. prices to rise to the international price. TransCanada has admitted in filings before the Canadian National Energy Board that this is indeed their strategy. Furthermore, the U.S. will bear 100 percent of the risk of a catastrophic spill in return for serving as a conduit for Canadian oil to reach the international market. This is not a theoretical risk. Last month, an Exxon Mobil pipeline spilled about 5,000 barrels of oil in Mayflower, Ark., forcing residents to evacuate their homes. In Marshall, Mich., cleanup is still ongoing after a spill of 800,000 gallons in 2010, which is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. America needs reliable energy resources and job growth. The proposal partially addresses one of those needs with its temporary job projections. But the costs outweigh the benefits, and the project does nothing to address our job and energy security challenges with long-term solutions.

When you strip away the rhetoric, the facts are clear: Keystone XL will export Canadian oil through our country — not to our country. As an export pipeline, Keystone XL does not reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It does not protect American families from increasing gas prices or price spikes on the global market. The history of tar sands pipelines is full of failed promises, difficult cleanups and environmental damage. Tar sands crude is both more toxic and more difficult to clean up than conventional oil. A 2010 spill involving tar sands crude on the Kalamazoo River has still not been remedied. The climate impacts are perhaps even greater than the immediate damage to water sources, and will be felt by every American for decades to come. The State Department’s conclusion that we might as well approve Keystone XL because the tar sands will inevitably be burned is not only untrue, it is a stunning breach of our national security. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta is hardly alone in the military community in declaring that climate change “has a dramatic impact on national security.” Keystone XL will increase global demand for tar sands, which produce far more climate-heating emissions than conventional oil. There is a better way forward, and we call on you to continue leading the way. The only way to reduce high gas prices is to use less fuel. We applaud your administration’s historic efforts to increase vehicle fuel efficiency, your investments in sustainable technologies, and your inspiring call in the State of the Union Address to fund research to move our vehicles away from oil altogether. Rejecting Keystone XL should be another part of your positive environmental legacy.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1369368266844</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 00:04:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369368404059-5</Id><Title>Part 2.

Piplines are always a danger to the environment if they break and spill oil on neighboring lands. The US is criss crossed with pipelines transporting crude oil and refined oil products from the areas of production to the areas of consumption. Many of the pipelines are 50-75 years old and we are having spills on a regular basis anymore. The recent spill in Arkansas is a good example. Obama is likely to approve of this reroute of the pipeline since he has already approved earlier segments of the pipeline route. As it stands now Obama will preside over the rebirth of an American oil industry which far outstrips the production achievements of the bagger presidents Raygun, Bush 1 and Bush 2.</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1369391574036</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 06:32:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369399204903-15</Id><Topic><Title>freeveritas • the DOW is the lagger index and Hewlet Packard is up 70% and Boeing only 32% for Dow gainer</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369326255996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 12:24:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Said the pot to the pan.......</Msg><Username>duffymagoo</Username><Timestamp>1369399204903</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 08:40:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369399501826-16</Id><Topic><Title>Trying to Tell a Liberal that Socialism is Immoral is the same as.......</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1369325930965</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 12:18:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pay4 are you aware that Republicans and Democrats have traded places/positions since Richard Nixon instituted his "Southern Strategy"?? if not then you simply don't know what you are talking about.

Boeing is not a good stock it took forever to righ the 100 dollar bell once it got close and immediately retreated , a bad sign a good stock would push through and keep going Boeing is up about 30% ytd and anther Dow stock is up twice that, Hewlett packard is up 70%. for long term growth Boeing for 5 years is up 21% while Disney is also up 30% ytd and up 95% for 5 years Boeing is just not a good or the best stock in spite of domerrrr45 and his avatar names they all have numbers like JoeDokes 45, spartacus9991, and this is one man and his constant attempt to advertisem Boeing in a false and misleading way. Boeing is up mainly on stock buyback which was doen at the expense of Boeing shareholders over the past 4 months and has nothing to do with the 4 year late and 30 billion over cost 787. In fact the 787 will not make a profit . You can not build a plane 4 years late and not discount the delivery price and sell it at a profit when you priced it at a 30 billion dollar less cost to build Boeing has not increased the price of the 787 so they are taking a loss on each palne and have less than 50% of the palnes on order to break even according to their most excessively optimistic figures get it now !. So tsla from two days ago at 85.85 to today now is a gain of 12.48% Boeing is as usual down and failed at triple digits it may go higher but very slow and not as good as many other stocks like tsla. domerrrr45 I have as much right to make my opinion as you do get it now ? insults from domerrrr45, well they simply point out what you are a troll</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369415089246</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 13:04:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369415430394-62</Id><Topic><Title>which is better Boeing or TSLA, or Hewlett Packard or Disney ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369415089246</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 13:04:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>in one second domerrrr45 gives me a thumbs down, once more domerrrr45, you need to get a life all your crapola is not going to change TSLA being better than Boeing up by over 12.5% now in two days , or make a 4 year late and 30 billion over cost 787 Boeing plane make any money .

Boeing first sent out a letter statting our insurance is changing. For starters the co-pay went up, the $150 deductable doubled to $300. As the letter statted, thats just the beginning. Even today and as Pelosi suggested our leaders have began to read the language of the Affordable Health Care Act and the costs which is not what they had thought. Sometime ago a black surgeon gave Obama a dressing with an audience of the loopholes and failures in the AHA, unfortunatly, the media was not allowed to cover it. I read the article from one of the attendees. Soon after the dressing Obama was hyping the ACT, a reporter spoke up and asked, "So your family will get thier healthcare via the ACT"? Obama did not speak a word as he beemed at the reporter. Many don't realize it but small business's are looking into high deductable and very limited alternatives. Obama has handed out waivers to companies who supported his re-election. 30M Americans will not be covered at all. The full story has not been written yet, as it stands today it looked better when Congress voted on it then it does today.</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1369417779957</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 13:49:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369418816624-82</Id><Topic><Title>MY HEALTH CARE WON'T CHANGE A BIT......</Title><Username>imapigeondic</Username><Timestamp>1369407941431</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 11:05:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you couldn't possibly be a boeing retiree unless you worked with WayneDickensen cleaning the Renton urinals and got canned for the same reason he did</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1369418816624</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 14:06:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369418891033-83</Id><Title>120-140 before year end..</Title><Msg>Mark it down..</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1369418891033</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 14:08:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369419016018-84</Id><Topic><Title>Global Warming nuts killing themselves and their children</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369409806041</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 11:36:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we thought you changed names a lot because you didn't know how to spell your 'nym-- we still think that and with good reason</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1369419016018</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 14:10:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369419074506-85</Id><Topic><Title>Global Warming nuts killing themselves and their children</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369409806041</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 11:36:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bet you yourself don't believe the Argentine newspaper or its story</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1369419074506</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 14:11:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>15</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369419432313-86</Id><Title>tsla makes a new high today up over 5.5% I suggested you get back in two days ago at 85.85 or 13.5% ago</Title><Msg>TSLA is up 5.5% today and up 13.5 since I suggested 3 days ago to get back in at $85,85.
