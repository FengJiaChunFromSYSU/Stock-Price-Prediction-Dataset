Obama fights video-game "done wars" these days. Who needs to have troops on the ground? Relative to Libya, Obama provided the "national technical means", as SecState Clinton called it, to monitor and support the demise of Gaddafi and his regime. How do you think that the rebels were able to locate Gadaffi as he fled from Sirte? "At one point, a convoy tried to flee and was hit by NATO airstrikes, carried out by French warplanes. France's Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said the 80-vehicle convoy was carrying Gaddafi and was trying to escape the city. The strikes stopped the convoy but did not destroy it, and then revolutionary fighters moved in on the vehicle carrying Gaddafi." (from HuffPo) How was NATO alerted to Gadaffi fleeing? According to the WIKI, Gadaffi was making a “satellite” phone call which was intercepted, and then a U.S. Predator, operated out of Las Vegas, Nevada, fired the first shots at the convoy. The United States provided the technical and moral support and leadership to NATO to carry out the destruction of Libya’s government and military, and, in the end, Gadaffi himself. Again, who needs troops on the ground? Please do not be a “revisionist”. That is so Sovietesque. BB Not sure what is your point. Obama fights "done wars" these days. And "natinal assets", according to SecState Clinton were used to support the demise of Gaddafi and his regime. How do you think that the rebels were able to locate Gadaffi as he fled from Sirte: "At one point, a convoy tried to flee and was hit by NATO airstrikes, carried out by French warplanes.

Your question is why the "fire proof box"? Being fireproof and containing explosions are specific guidance provided by the FAA. While well intentioned (and perhaps appropriate for human safety), those requirements work against effective venting and heat management (particularly dissipation) of a Lithium-ion battery. All batteries, however, require some amount of this kind of care. At this point, Boeing may have a volume issue as the installation of Ni-Cad replacements may not be simple or feasible. Given that Li-ion is about 2X the storage capability of Ni-Cad, we can assume, for simplicity, that we need twice the volume, or more, to support a different battery solution. It is easy to say, "use a different battery", but the issues are not limited to electrical. Li-ion batteries are used in satellites with 15 year lives (but no human factors involved), the X-37B and Predators (human factors associated with range safety), and consumer electronics (totally human factor). It may be that the specific FAA guidance (fires/explosions) makes use of Li-ion battery technology impossible on airplanes, but such technology is used extensively everywhere.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1361780590467</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 03:23:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361784701639-7</Id><Topic><Title>why is Boeing going with a fire proof box instead of a mature battery solution?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361740303567</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 16:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks to bulky,Don and techpath2000, interesting comments . I am guessing, but if the 787 sales agreement or contract specified LI batteries and the customer is given some other battery then Boeing eats a discount price and the FAA does a start over on the certification process. LI or NICAD. This seems a combination of certification, contract, and engineering issue of resistance to change . From a PR perspective it would seem Boeing needs more than a containment box approach to satisfy the passenger concerns. If the car batteries were to burn as a buyer or a passenger I would not want that any more than a explode a pinto, or the corvair unsafe at any speed. In a way Nadar actually helped the corvair car last longer Detroit deliberatly continued the corvair as they did nto want to be dictated to by some young lawyer so in 1965 GM engineered the fix and then kept teh corvair in productions at least 2 years longer than they planned to. The cars still were hard to drive in side winds , I had a Crown conversion and used a NASCAR race shop engineer a better suspension for my small block chevy powered corvair and painted it ford colors the corvair club still let me in. It ran great but speed bumps were a challenge as low as it was taken down. pulled a nice second gear wheel stand . My (pintabago) pinto station wagon great camper poor mans camper in college. . If Boeing gets enough heat( pun intended) they will actually fix the dreamliner instead of making a patch the thing approach. I wish some crusader like a Nadir would write a book about the dreamliner something like the firestarter at any altitude and get Boeing to do the right thing and fix this plane.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361784701639</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 04:31:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361787797742-8</Id><Title>.Chinese Official Yan Linkun Caught On Camera Trashing Airport After He Misses Flight</Title><Msg>Great video (copy and paste Subject into YouTube search): ============ WHAT happens when an angry Chinese official misses his flight? Say goodbye to your computers, your telephone and your airport signs. The man, identified as Yan Linkun, a member of China's top level government advisory board CPPCC, went to breakfast with his wife at Kunming's Changshui airport after purchasing his plane ticket. His breakfast was a leisurely one. So leisurely that they missed the boarding What happens next was captured on CCTV. It's not pretty. Mr Linkun approaches the boarding gate with his wife. After speaking to staff members he is denied boarding. Mr Linkun and his wife are asked to wait. Instead, they try to open the door to the tarmac. It doesn't work. As his frustration builds Mr Linkun moves back to the boarding gate desk. He grabs the computer keyboard and points aggressively at the female airline staff member. Then Mr Linkun starts to smash things. First the computer keyboard. He rips it from it's socket and smashes it against the floor. Then he destroys the computers, then the phones. Not content with that damage he finds the airport signs. A large crowd gathers as Mr Linkun picks up the boarding gate sign and smashes it against the locked airport tarmac door. Once everything is smashed Mr Linkun appears to address the crowd as his wife rips up her ticket. During the tirade, security staff can be seen gathering on the other side of the boarding gate barrier. They watch, but don't move</Msg><Username>cloroxcowboy</Username><Timestamp>1361787797742</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 05:23:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361789564939-9</Id><Topic><Title>why is Boeing going with a fire proof box instead of a mature battery solution?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361740303567</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 16:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I ma doing my pre stock trading review this morning, just listened to John Leahy, being interviewed (Airbus). He said the difference in weight between a li and nicad is 60 kilos (132 pounds) and that is nothing but one passenger compared to the problems associated with the new technology. He said he is for li but for now it makes no sense to run a Lithium battery in terms of risk to reward. On Boeing being the largest supplier for this year, Mr Leahy said, " well once every 10 years is ok with Airbus " and if you look at each two years then Airbus is still the leader by a margin of 54% and he expects Airbus to be in the leader next year( so that is his word on that subject) , BTW he has a much better record for being right than James Mcnearney has been on his predictions . so that is his word. EADS stock has gained 11% YTD compared to less than 2 % gain for Boeing shareholders. On china he said that China nad India will be major buyers of airplanes in the next 10 years and that China will not be able to make a complete line of airplanes for another 20 years but they will get there and be a major supplier of airplanes . Mr Leahy supports lithium batteries and will use them more , ( my opinion here ) after Boeing makes the mistakes on their dime first and uses Boeing as a test mule for their lithium program. Airbus will have all the engineering ready to go and be able to switch seamlessly when the technology is more mature. Smart move ! Let Boeing management be the game changer at 4 years late and 33 billion over budget first(787) then come on in at less cost per plane and clean up and regain the first place in airplane deliveries for those yahoo message board users who constantly post airplane deliveries Remember a stockholder is more impressed with a . 11% YTD stock price gain for airbus for shareholders than better than more airplanes delivered for Boeing shareholders when the stock gain for Boeing shareholders is under 2% YTD .

Are we to believe since assault weapons are banned the gang banging thugs terrorizing our cities will all of a sudden give up thier illegal assault weapons. ? BTW, check out what makes an assault weapon.. Pistol grip, flash suppressor, and the one I love, bayonet mount... When have you heard of an assault with a bayonet mounted on an assault rifle ? And that flash suppressor really packs apunch (not)..Perhaps if the cops put away thier radar guns and stopped strutting aroun NYC with all their battle gear on they could do some aggressive police work , of course the court systems would have to participate. Look at NYC, Bernie Kerick, top cop, nominated for Homeland Security head, now serving prison time in a farkin jail that used to bear his name. Kerick, Guiliani's pick / protege.. And we are to believe Guliani knew nothing of this mans background and character? Bullcrap, it's much easier to keep the sheep frightened, take their guns and promise "we" the govt will protect you.

The airline says flights from Frankfurt to Tokyo's Haneda airport will continue on a different type of plane. ANA has now had to cancel 3,600 flights that would have carried almost 168,000 passengers. The 787 has been grounded since Jan. 16 because of the risk of battery fires.

The reason rich guys like myself have left the mediocre class and now reside in the top1% is we think., we achieve and we don't buy dumb lies like this. Consumers will always pay the bulk of the bulk of taxes because we rich guys always have the ability to pass the cost of taxes on to you consumers. Unless you want full blown soviet style communism - and that's possibly Obama's goal - you are not going to be able to keep rich guys from attaching the full cost of goods and services to be paid by the ones who consume them.

My reply was he does not know how to read a stock chart so it would not have helped him. then I sent on to suggest he had better invest in another stock once he claimed he sold his boeing two weeks earlier. I told him he should have been in zynga as it had gained substantially in the last two weeks. Well today from that level on February 6, at $2.90 I booked a 26% profit today at $3.67 !. Boeing on February 6, closed at $76.29 and today right now is trading at $75.49 a loss of 1%. Nevada just passed a law making online money gambling legal and if other states go along eventually this gaming stock will be a great investment, for me I have make 100% in wnr and out and znga I have made 50% so far this year . If you trade your opinion instead of the stock chart you keep your opinion and can loose your money like with boeing .

Looking over my notes from an aircraft systems safety class I took a long time ago there was a chapter on the loss of a DC-6 because a fuel overflow vent was located in front of the air intake. Even though it wasn't directly in front of the inlet the fuel vapor got sucked into the inlet and was ignited by the heater. Turns out the airflow around the fuselage was more complicated than the designers had assumed. Given that the 787 doesn't use bleed air from the engines is it possible that the inlets are on the fuselage? And, looking at the 787 it would appear that the outflow vent location for the forward battery is ahead of the inlets on the lower fuselage? I would hope that either the inlets are well out of the way and/or that a flight test is conducted to verify that history does not repeat itself.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1361821114029</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 14:38:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361821308338-75</Id><Title>Sen. Ted Cruz is another Senator who has a pair.</Title><Msg>When the left-wing lunatics start calling you names, you know you're doing something right. "The left’s war against Senate newcomer Ted Cruz continues to rage on as the mainstream media bristles while Cruz maintains his conservative principles. At a time when many on both the right and the left complain that politicians are too apt to “say anything for a buck,” Cruz has earned the scorn of the left for doing exactly the opposite and sticking to his conservative principles. Cruz came to Washington speaking harsh truths about Washington and claiming that he would work to turn things around by implementing conservative policies. His resistance to failed economic policies and his brash stance against many of the left’s supported policies has earned him some nickname- some of which are not as flattering as others- including “Cruz Missile,” “Senator No” and “The GOP’s Nasty Newcomer.” His firm conservative stances have not endeared him to the liberal media, however, who have taken issue with Cruz’ vehement vetting and questioning of Chuck Hagel, whose past stances and policies make him a controversial pick for a Secretary of Defense nominee. Cruz’ firm questioning of Hagel’s past has earned him an unflattering comparison from several media outlets who have called him a modern-day Joe McCarthy- who rose to fame rooting out Communists and suspected Communists in government. In an article in the New Yorker entitled, “Is Senator Ted Cruz Our New McCarthy?,” Jane Mayer discussed Cruz’ 2010 assertion that Harvard Law, which Cruz attended in the nineties, employed a majority of leftist radicals as professors. Mayer wrote, “[Cruz] then went on to assert that Obama, who attended Harvard Law School four years ahead of him, ‘would have made a perfect president of Harvard Law School.’ The reason, said Cruz, was that, ‘There were fewer declared Republicans in the faculty when we were there than Communists! There was one Republican. But there were twelve who would say they were Marxists who believed in the Communists overthrowing the United States government.’” But Joel Pollak rebutted, “Cruz was absolutely correct that there were, and are, many radicals on Harvard Law’s faculty, and few Republicans… Several members of Harvard Law’s faculty espouse other radical left ideas. They are not card-carrying Communists, but some do see themselves as proponents of different forms of Marxist thought, and would like to see revolutionary changes in both the U.S. government and the international order. Saul Alinsky, too, was not a Communist–but he believed in the radical disruption of our political system and the redistribution of wealth. Those views are distinguishable from formal Communism only by virtue of the fact that they do not call for a proletarian dictatorship. Our contemporary ‘social democrats’ wish to impose such revolutionary changes through our present political system, transforming our Constitution and our society through democratic means. There are far more of such radical professors at Harvard Law School than those who defend conservative thought. The media’s crusade against Cruz proves that in Obama’s America, it is considered far worse to accuse someone of being a Marxist than to be one. The same journalists who demand full disclosure of every penny that conservative financiers might have put into lobbying or politics now mock Cruz’s attempt to probe Hagel’s financial disclosures–or the lack thereof, since Hagel has refused to supply much of the requested information."</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1361821308338</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 14:41:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361821474351-76</Id><Topic><Title>I love it when I wake up in the morning and Obama is President !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1361805062809</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:11:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>everyday Obama is President is a great day for America !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1361821474351</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 14:44:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361821570845-77</Id><Topic><Title>why is Boeing going with a fire proof box instead of a mature battery solution?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361740303567</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 16:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the problem is outsourcing to the cheapest provider is a fail, Boeing would never have over engineered the battery box that would be a bean counters kill on a Six Sigma is a set of tools and strategies for process improvement originally developed by Motorola in 1986.] Six Sigma became well known after Jack Welch made it a central focus of his business strategy at General Electric in 1995 and today it is used in different sectors of industry.

Coolidge spoke in concise language about character, culture, and religion, all of which he considered we needed more than bigger government: We do not need more intellectual power, we need more moral power. We do not need more knowledge, we need more character. We do not need more government, we need more culture. We do not need more law, we need more religion. We do not need more the things that are seen, we need more of the things that are not seen. Back in 1924, when the first biography of Coolidge appeared, it was prominently reviewed in the New York Times Book Review. The reviewer thought the author’s claim that Coolidge’s speech to the Massachusetts Senate as its president had been quoted as often as any in American history other than Lincoln’s Gettysburg address was an exaggeration; but that “if the speech has not been quoted as often as [the author] thinks it has, it deserves to be.” Parts of that speech, he wrote, “ought to be in every American citizen’s Bible.” He singled out this paragraph: Do the day’s work. If it be to protect the rights of the weak, whoever objects, do it. If it be to help a powerful corporation better to serve the people, whatever the opposition, do that. Expect to be called a standpatter, but don’t be a standpatter. Expect to be called a demagogue, but don’t be a demagogue. Don’t hesitate to be as revolutionary as science. Don’t hesitate to be as reactionary as the multiplication table. Don’t expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong. Fast forward nearly a century, to the February 17, 2013 review of Coolidge in the New York Times Book Review, which treated the book as part of an attempt to “resurrect” Coolidge as a “prophet” of an “austere doctrine” of “Republican Calvinism,” with a “liturgy” based on Coolidge’s belief that the federal government should shrink, not grow. The use of the religious imagery was not intended as complimentary. The reviewer asserted that Coolidge’s “actual record” shows he was “an extraordinarily blinkered and foolish and complacent leader” who is “no model for the present,” but rather “a bleak omen from the past.” Coolidge’s “actual record”: he inherited a national debt of $28 billion and reduced it to less than $18 billion; he cut the top income tax rate to 25% while balancing the budget and producing surpluses each year; and unemployment was reduced from 5.7 million at the beginning of the decade to 1.8 million when he left office. The economy became popularly known as the “Coolidge prosperity.” As actual records go, that is not too bad — particularly compared to more recent ones. The last four years have shown that “stimulus” (which Coolidge would have called “spending”) and “investments” (which Coolidge would have called “spending”) are not panaceas, but rather part of the problem. We have also learned that it is extraordinarily blinkered and foolish for a government that already has unsustainable financial obligations for existing “entitlements” (which Coolidge would have called “spending”) to enact not only a record “stimulus” and huge new “investments” but also a massive new “entitlement,” relying on borrowed funds and no budget. It is a bleak omen, produced by a quasi-religious belief in the power of an ever-larger government to produce “fairness” while allegedly adding not one dime to the deficit, nor costing anything for 99 percent of the people, and allowing people who like their plan to keep it, although Catholics with religious objections will be ignored. It seems less like a model for the present than like the last stage of an unsustainable plan. We should have known by now that increased “revenues” (or “taxes,” as Coolidge would have called them) depends on a growing private sector (“commerce”) stimulated by lower tax rates. It has already been demonstrated not only by Coolidge, but by Kennedy and Reagan. We should know that the Clinton surplus in its later years was produced not by increased tax rates, but by acts that limited government and stimulated commerce: (1) the rejection of HillaryCare; (2) the welfare reform that imposed work requirements; (3) the NAFTA free trade legislation; and (4) the 40% reduction in the capital gains tax rate (from 28% to 20%). Most of us know Coolidge only for his legendary reticence. He is famous for having told a woman, who had bet she could get him to say three words, that “you lose.” He once explained why he often sat silently through interviews: “Many times I say only ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to people. Even that is too much. It winds them up for twenty minutes more.” When he died, his will was 23 words long (it left his entire estate to his wife). Coolidge’s eloquence is much less known, but for eloquence it is hard to match his July 5, 1926 “Address at the Celebration of the 150th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence” in Philadelphia, with its concluding paragraph that treated the Declaration as “the product of the spiritual insight of the people”: We live in an age of science and of abounding accumulation of material things. These did not create our Declaration. Our Declaration created them. The things of the spirit come first. Unless we cling to that, all our material prosperity, overwhelming though it may appear, will turn to a barren scepter in our grasp. If we are to maintain the great heritage which has been bequeathed to us, we must be like-minded as the fathers who created it. We must not sink into a pagan materialism. We must cultivate the reverence which they had for the things that are holy. We must follow the spiritual and moral leadership which they showed. We must keep replenished, that they may glow with a more compelling flame, the altar fires before which they worshiped. Is it too late for us to recover the values in the public sphere that Coolidge embodied, and to re-establish a more limited government as an ideal? Perhaps. Coolidge lived at a different time, in what seems like a less complicated world. But Dr. Benjamin Carson’s recent speech at the National Prayer Breakfast is an indication that the values Coolidge articulated still resonate. (The YouTube videos of the speech have been viewed by nearly three million people so far.) The speech was Coolidge-like in its understated eloquence, its focus on moral decay and fiscal irresponsibility, its religious power and sense of history, and its warning against trying to build up the weak by pulling down the strong. If we are unable to recover the values Coolidge championed, and if our politics cannot produce another president like him, it will ultimately say less about Coolidge than about us.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361822828884</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 15:07:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361822869945-81</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP's mir_roguns Problem</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1361818653040</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:57:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mir is a joke.

The Boeing solution to engineer around the possible causes introduces new problems but these problems will be handled by Boeing without our help and intervention</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1361825009570</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 15:43:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361825616759-86</Id><Title>787 is not a real pig -it is lighter and more efficient than the 1970's tech it replaced by one helluva lot</Title><Msg>There are always technical morons running around pronouncing the most stooopid things - things they obviously know nothing about.</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1361825616759</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 15:53:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361826256660-87</Id><Topic><Title>787 a real pig -- heavier, less efficient than the 1970's tech it replaced</Title><Username>leftwinggunowner</Username><Timestamp>1361825338402</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 15:48:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody does it better than Boeing.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1361826256660</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 16:04:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361826619298-88</Id><Topic><Title>About Venting Hot Battery Electrolytes Out of the Fuselage</Title><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1361821114029</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 14:38:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>techpath 2000, good points certainly better than claiming a Japanese worker sabotaged their own planes, costing both Boeing and the Japanese contractors and the Japanese airlines who have the most planes and therefore the most likely potential for a problem to come up, and the potential shut downs on their parts business , and the airlines the PR disaster on their 787 customer and passenger PR nightmare. a hack for Boeing is so easy to spot.

President Pranab Mukherjee watched the rocket carrying the seven satellites take off from Sriharikota launch centre in southern Andhra Pradesh state. The six other satellites include two each from Canada and Austria and one each from Denmark and Britain. India is emerging as a major player in the multi-billion dollar space market. It plans up to 10 missions this year. It has also announced plans for an unmanned voyage to Mars. The satellite built in collaboration with France will carry two climate tools developed for analysing ocean current and sea surface heights by the French space agency CNES, reports say. This is the 23rd mission for India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) - a seven-storey-high, 230 tonne rocket. The PSLV has so far successfully launched more than 50 satellites into space. In 2008 the Indian Space Research Organisation successfully launched 10 satellites in a single mission.</Msg><Username>tania11368</Username><Timestamp>1361853408100</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 23:36:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
