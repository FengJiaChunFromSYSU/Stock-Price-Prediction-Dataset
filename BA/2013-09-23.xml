I don't consider myself "religious". I only know and speak the truth. But, in reference to your point about "getting involved", the issue is whether or not we are being attacked. Afghanistan was guilty of harboring those that attacked us on 9-11. Bush was RIGHT to go to war against Afghanistan and WRONG to attack Iraq. In Libya, Obama was WRONG to bring down the government and military of Qaddafi - which posed ZERO threat to the United States - and then he was WRONG by not retaliating for the attack in Benghazi that took the life of four Americans - including the ambassador. Obama demonstrated great apparent ineptitude by his capacity to always do everything that is counter to the safety and security and well-being of the United States. He is either inept or his intent is nefarious.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1379916895307</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 02:14:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379919879735-3</Id><Title>Norwegian 787s problems</Title><Msg>OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS.OL) suffered fresh technical problems with both its Boeing (BA)787 Dreamliners on Sunday, the airline said, in another set of glitches to hit the new jet. One of the planes remained grounded in Oslo on Monday due to problems with the oxygen supply to the cockpit, according to Norwegian Air spokeswoman Aasa Larsson. "Technicians are working to fix the problem," she told Reuters. A valve had been repaired on the second plane on Sunday, and the delayed flight eventually left Oslo for New York. "It has now landed there," Larsson said. Technical problems have forced Norwegian Air to ground the planes several times in recent weeks, due to problems with brakes, hydraulic pumps and power issues. The Dreamliner was expected to be a game-changer for the aviation industry as its use of lighter materials and new engines promised 20 percent savings in fuel consumption. But the programme has been troubled by delays in getting the planes into service and setbacks including the temporary grounding of all planes because of overheating batteries.</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1379919879735</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 03:04:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379929819021-4</Id><Title>The Emmy for Most Hypocritical goes to.....</Title><Msg>The Kent Raven in "I Was Against The War That I Am For"</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1379929819021</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 05:50:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379932272839-5</Id><Topic><Title>The right throws in the towel!

Wow, you're really going out on a limb there (eye roll). The reality is that just about any A/P that's in service long enough experiences one or more incidents and/or accidents and the vast majority of them are caused by human error, like the 777 that recently landed in the water short of the runway likely because the crew simply lost situational awareness and allowed themselves to get too low and too slow. There are countless examples of crews literally flying a perfectly good A/P into the ground and it has been such a problem throughout the history of manned flight that it even has a name. It's called CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) and it can, and does, happen to even the most experienced crews. About BA stock plunging to $30 when a 787 eventually does experience an incident and/or accident ... Nope. History suggests that it'll lose a little value for period of time, but it won't plunge to the basement like you appear to be hoping. 20+ Year Aircraft Engineer</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1379934854293</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 07:14:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379935083801-10</Id><Topic><Title>The Emmy for Most Hypocritical goes to.....</Title><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1379929819021</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 05:50:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Among those that the Raven thanked were his aliases, too many to mention and his refrigerator.</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1379935083801</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 07:18:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379935795660-11</Id><Title>Saudi Arabia Threatens to “End Career” of AP Reporter Over Chemical Weapons Story</Title><Msg>Once more...telling the truth is a criminal act.... Journalist who exposed how rebels were behind August 21st attack faces intimidation Paul Joseph Watson September 23, 2013 Associated Press reporter Dale Gavlak has been threatened over her involvement in a story which exposed how Syrian rebels were responsible for the August 21st chemical weapons attack after being handed the weapons by Saudi intelligence agents. On August 29th, Mint Press News published an article written by Gavlak which detailed how FSA militants in Ghouta admitted to reporter Yahya Ababneh that they were behind the August 21st chemical weapons incident, which the United States blamed on President Bashar Al-Assad, having mishandled chemical weapons provided to them by Saudi Arabia. Although Gavlak did not write the story in her capacity as an AP correspondent, according to Mint Press News executive director Mnar Muhawesh, within 48 hours Gavlak received threats to “end her career” if she didn’t disassociate herself from the article. The threats came from a third party who was most likely acting on behalf of Saudi Intelligence chief Prince Bandar bin Sultan, according to Gavlak. Bandar is named in the article as having ordered the transfer of chemical weapons to Syrian rebels in Ghouta. Gavlak also “confirmed with several colleagues and Jordanian government officials that the Saudis have been supplying rebels with chemical weapons,” according to Muhawesh.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379935795660</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 07:29:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379936574933-12</Id><Topic><Title>787 Dreamliner crash will send BA back to $30 !</Title><Username>lgbt_2b_free</Username><Timestamp>1379932972240</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 06:42:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why is Norwegian Airlines meeting with Boing today as they say the plane is junk ?</Msg><Username>lgbt_2b_free</Username><Timestamp>1379936574933</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 07:42:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379936632109-13</Id><Title>787 is not the 777 Obama is not Reagan</Title><Msg>Get it !</Msg><Username>lgbt_2b_free</Username><Timestamp>1379936632109</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 07:43:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379936800304-14</Id><Topic><Title>Norwegian 787s problems</Title><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1379919879735</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 03:04:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Change the subject, just say the 777 had the same problems.

The ruling opens the door for a wider crackdown on the vast network of the Brotherhood, which includes social organizations that have been key for building the group's grassroots support and helping its election victories. The verdict banned the group itself - including the official association it registered under earlier this year - as well as "any institution branching out of it or ... receiving financial support from it," according to the court ruling, made public on Egypt's state official news agency MENA. The judge at the Cairo Court for Urgent Matters also ordered the "confiscation of all the group's money, assets, and buildings" and said that an independent committee should be formed by the Cabinet to manage the money until final court orders are issued. The verdict can be appealed.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1379941407673</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 09:03:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379941498055-17</Id><Topic><Title>The Carzy Party</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1379803683494</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-21 18:48:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The bagger rubes are, the whiningest, cryingest, most self indulged, scared, hate filled group of people in American history,</Msg><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1379941498055</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 09:04:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379942725341-18</Id><Topic><Title>787 status 9-20</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379688857337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 10:54:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too bad they have buried so much expense in that inventory line with their BS accounting.

Their inventory stands at $40billion and their suppliers are taking multi-billion dollar charges against their BA programs. What's really in there? The introduction in January of "operating EPS" that specifically excludes pension costs. CNBC was gushing in their admiration of the 31% earnings growth year over year earnings growth in July. That was last year's GAAP versus this years la-la land "Operating Earnings". Nobody cared and that's what Bloomberg now shows. Anyone doing screens looking for earnings growth or automated earnings models will be using completely errant numbers. Apples to apples GAAP they have no earnings growth. The GAAP numbers back in 2010 were $7.10 for 2013. BA has guidance of $6.30 for 2013 BS operating earnings and the street has now gone to $6.50+ in their love fest, but really that is about $5.10 GAAP. All the analysts are changing their metrics following the pied piper of BS that is BA management. JPM admitted to using their old HIGH END historical GAAP PE and applying it to the "operating EPS". Goldman has a note out saying, "north of $20 per share in FCF is possible." That is their 2020 estimate....2020. Little green men from Mars might invade before then. They assume that everything goes perfect and all aircraft deliveries grow 8-10% for the NEXT SIX YEARS STRAIGHT. In past 20-25 years Boeing hasn't had a string of more than FOUR positive years of simply positive delivery growth much less 6 years of growth. The Goldman assumption on 787 margins year 2020 are also the same as 737 margins right now. How is that going to happen? So you are ignoring some very onerous pension issues and placing historically high multiples on that in order to justify the stock price since it blasted through your already overly aggressive target. Should I continue? There is plenty more regarding their program accounting and "one-time" charges that have now erased most of their book value and retained earnings.</Msg><Username>cunyhound</Username><Timestamp>1379946904479</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 10:35:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379947351883-28</Id><Title>Under Obama The Wealthy Have Done Verry Well but the Working Class has.......</Title><Msg>.....been devastated.

In other words, 'when we said "start," we didn't mean start-start.' Good luck with that, guys. You've only had three-and-a-half years to get this thing ready. Some states, like Oregon, have already redefined 'start' -- which hasn't stopped the government there from spending millions on hippy-dippy ads promoting the unready law. Meanwhile, a prominent clinic that President Obama touted as "a model" for Obamacare is cutting its budget because of the law, unions are "raging" against the law and its implications for working Americans, and some of the citizens who qualify for Obamacare subsidies may be in for an unpleasant surprise: A new study suggests that, for many families, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will be less affordable than they expect. Since subsidies determined on a sliding scale based upon annual income, if your income changes, you may have to pay back some of that subsidy once tax time rolls around in April. According to a recent study, funded by the California Program on Access to Care at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health, up to 38 percent of families may have to repay some portion of their subsidy due to changes in income.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1379950637487</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 11:37:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379950833324-38</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's policies</Title><Username>zombiegrunt</Username><Timestamp>1379949091537</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 11:11:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You got that right!

The vote of confidence comes as Levenson revisits his earnings estimates to reflect Boeing's decision to end the C-17 Globemaster military transport aircraft program after the next 22 deliveries (roughly through the end of 2015). Levenson still sees the company earning $6.42 a share for the full year, ahead of the company's guidance for $6.20 to $6.40 a share, and boosted his 2014 EPS forecast by 30 cents. He writes that his increased target price is "based on expectations for further improvement in performance in 2014 from commercial programs and the reduced expected impact on remaining C17 deliveries."</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379962834541</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 15:00:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379962991881-79</Id><Topic><Title>Charleston activity</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379959634617</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 14:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wouldn't believe your if your swore you were lying</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1379962991881</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 15:03:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379963001749-80</Id><Title>More "sons of Obonzo" prospects kill man with their fists</Title><Msg>According too Obonzo turd belching fanatics, those that look like they could be Obonzo's son are not a threat to kill anyone with their bare hands especially if they have skittles.

TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE, Fla., Sept. 23, 2013 – Boeing [NYSE: BA] and the U.S. Air Force have completed the first unmanned QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target flight, demonstrating the next generation of combat training and testing. Two U.S. Air Force test pilots in a ground control station remotely flew the QF-16, which is a retired F-16 jet modified to be an aerial target. The QF-16 mission profile included auto takeoff, a series of simulated maneuvers, supersonic flight, and an auto land, all without a pilot in the cockpit. “It was a little different to see an F-16 take off without anyone in it, but it was a great flight all the way around,” said Lt. Col. Ryan Inman, Commander, 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron. “Now we have a mission capable, highly sustainable full scale aerial target to take us into the future.” The milestone flight initiates more operational evaluations, including a live fire test at Holloman Air Force Base, N.M. The Navy, Army and Air Force will ultimately use QF-16s for weapons testing and other training. Boeing has modified six F-16s into the QF-16 configuration. Low-rate initial production is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter, with first production deliveries in 2015.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379964201822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 15:23:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379964226402-87</Id><Topic><Title>Up grade at Barons</Title><Username>infooas</Username><Timestamp>1379960908238</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 14:28:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks.

Free market medical care started falling by the wayside when doctors began joining clinics and working in groups to share costs of equipment and space. That made for less individual doctors to choose from, priced them out of the market in fact. That, compiled with negotiated insurance plans, followed by said clinics spotting all the maximum charges to insurance and government plans to stabilize and maximize their incomes created a huge machine that is difficult to undo. The bigger it gets, the more people who rely on it for their jobs. The fact still is it has made medical care too expensive without insurance, and insurance has gotten too difficult to get or afford without legal interference. Companies could deny those who needed it the most, and drop those who used it.

Dionne, Jr. COLUMBUS, Ohio—It was the last thing the Rev. Tim Ahrens expected to do during a chat in his book-lined office at the historic First Congregational Church here: He expressed admiration for Gov. John Kasich. Ahrens is a progressive social activist whose house of worship has deep roots in the old Social Gospel movement. He has demonstrated and organized against Ohio’s conservative governor and, in 2011, even gave a kind of counter State of the State message outside the Capitol while Kasich was presenting his plans inside. Yet Kasich, a one-time scourge of labor unions who was a top lieutenant in Newt Gingrich’s revolution in the 1990s, has endeared himself to liberal and low-income Ohioans by insisting, loudly and incessantly, that his state participate in the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. An unapologetic conservative is fighting the tea party and his own Republican Legislature because he thinks the less privileged people of Ohio deserve health coverage. Thus Ahrens’ surprising confession last week, offered with a rueful smile: “One of the things I admire about John Kasich—yes, I did say ‘admire’—is that if he connects to an individual who is hurting, he will respond.” And having responded on the Medicaid issue, Kasich has gone all in. “He has not wavered from that place,” says Ahrens, who chairs the Central Ohio Medicaid Expansion Coalition. “He has become a crusader. He will not let go of this.” Kasich’s witness is important as an expression of his commitment to a form of evangelical Christianity that places a high priority on the poor. The governor told The Wall Street Journal last month of an encounter with a state legislator who disagreed with him on Medicaid. At Heaven’s door, Kasich preached, St. Peter is “probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor.” Advertisement Yet at a moment when the Beltway wing of the GOP is on the verge of shaking the economy to its foundations in an effort to block Obamacare, there’s also a political lesson to be drawn from Ohio and from other states where Republican governors have embraced the expansion of Medicaid that is a central component of the Affordable Care Act. Just last week, Rick Snyder, Michigan’s Republican governor, signed a Medicaid expansion bill with an explanation that President Obama himself would endorse. “This is about the health of fellow Michiganders,” Snyder said. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Corbett once excoriated Obamacare but said he’d go along with a modified expansion. Another half-dozen Republican governors have also supported enlarging Medicaid, among them Chris Christie in New Jersey, Jan Brewer in Arizona and Susana Martinez in New Mexico. These chief executives usually follow the party line in being critical of the health law in principle. But they have responsibilities that the radical ideologues in Washington don’t have—to their local hospitals, to their economies and, yes, to their constituents among the working poor who now lack insurance. They understand the difference between “Obamacare” as a right-wing bogeyman and the Affordable Care Act as a reality. Here in Ohio, another of Kasich’s new allies on Medicaid is Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman. The first African-American to lead the city, Coleman proudly describes himself as a “pro-business Democrat,” a coalition builder, and an advocate of school reform. “Kasich and I don’t agree on too much,” Coleman, the 14-year incumbent, told me. “But on this one, he’s right.” Like many Americans in the middle of the country, the mayor finds Washington’s current antics entirely strange, and he’s especially impatient with ideologues whose views are based on a sweeping anti-government philosophy, not on pragmatic thinking about what efficiently-run government can achieve. “Those people who talk that way have no real life experiences,” Coleman said. The mayor then issued an invitation to a hypothetical congressional dogmatist—“Mr. Philosophizer,” he called him—to walk his city’s neighborhoods with him to learn about the problems of flesh-and-blood citizens. It’s not clear that Kasich will win his fight on behalf of such citizens. Conservatives in his Legislature worry as much about tea party challenges as congressional Republicans do, and Ahrens said that advocates of expansion are preparing to place the issue on Ohio’s ballot. Current polls suggest it would win. Tea party “philosophizers” in Congress really should accept Coleman’s invitation. Seen from the ground, expanding health coverage is at once a practical and compassionate goal. Practicality and compassion are both missing in the manufactured rage against the abstraction known as “Obamacare.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1379979304352</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 19:35:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379980403176-152</Id><Topic><Title>The duty of a True Patriot....</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379863658199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-22 11:27:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If we took a collection, could you possibly be persuaded to get a life?

The National Park service posts a series of Muslim promotion videos on its website. When asked why they were doing that their response was: no tax payer dollars were spent and that they do not endorse any religion. But did they answer the question why they were promoting Islam or even discussing human rights? No. The National Park Service is about parks, not about rights. Sounds like an area of budget savings. 2. In Baltimore, a man stands up to ask a question in a "town hall meeting" about the federal government's school curriculum program called "Common Core.

A family of four's health insurance premium through Humana jumps from $333/month to $965/month under Obama's "Affordable Care Act" and just today Pelosi, Reed, and Obama accuse Republicans of terrorism, arson, and extortion because the Republicans are trying to protect the average American from what Obama is doing to this country by putting a stop to the madness. 5.

We believe Boeing will set the initial 787 accounting quantity in such a way that the program has razor-thin margins initially, perhaps in part to avoid any negative and potentially embarrassing publicity that would almost assuredly arise if it reported an initial 787 program loss. However, management's flexibility to effectively "manage" earnings through program accounting may not result in the representation of the true profitability of the 787 program, in our opinion, due to the over-reliance on estimates. And while we hold Boeing management in very high regard, we are surprised at the similarities between now (737 and 777 production ramp ups; 787 and 747-8 deliveries) and that of the 1997 debacle when Boeing encountered massive production problems and allegedly masked costs in its brand new 777 at the time. Although it never admitted guilt during the episode in 1997, Boeing agreed to pay over $90 million in a private-securities fraud suit in 2002 as a result of actions taken during that time period.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1379993200741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 23:26:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379994144636-183</Id><Topic><Title>787 status 9-20</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1379688857337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-20 10:54:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you have any skin in the game or do you just like bellyaching?</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1379994144636</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-23 23:42:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
