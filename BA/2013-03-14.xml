The airplanes, valued at $1.9 billion at list prices, were selected for the airline's long-haul fleet renewal. Boeing looks forward to working with SWISS to finalize the details, at which time the order will be posted to the Boeing Orders &amp; Deliveries website. "The Boeing 777-300ER is the ideal size and range to meet our Swiss market needs," said Harry Hohmeister, chief executive officer of SWISS. "We have made a landmark decision to further invest in an advanced aircraft fleet to retain our competitive edge over many of our competitors who are operating aircraft with more than 300 seats on similar routes." "The 777-300ER is a favorite among the world's leading airlines, bringing unrivaled twin-engine efficiency and reliability to the long-range market," said Todd Nelp, vice president of European Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "We are honored by SWISS's decision to put the 777-300ER at the forefront of its fleet renewal and look forward to playing a key role in its future success." The Boeing 777-300ER is the largest long-range twin-engine commercial airplane in the world, seating up to 386 passengers in a three-class configuration and has a maximum range of 7,825 nautical miles (14,490 km). "With the 777-300ER, SWISS's passengers will experience the most spacious interior cabin ever developed," said Bob Whittington, vice president and chief project engineer for the 777 Program. "With these airplanes, SWISS will be able to offer wider seats, wider aisles, more headroom and more seating flexibility." SWISS is part of the Lufthansa Group and currently serves 69 destinations across 37 countries worldwide from Zurich, Basel and Geneva international airports with a fleet of more than 90 narrow and wide-body airplanes.</Msg><Username>mrstock52</Username><Timestamp>1363263706847</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 08:21:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363265078754-14</Id><Topic><Title>In memory ...</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1363108954688</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 13:22:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looks like ahkmed has a NEW clone of my ID i'm flattered</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363265078754</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 08:44:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363265215814-15</Id><Topic><Title>If Genna is also Hoozdik_Hertz</Title><Username>censored4567</Username><Timestamp>1363226316363</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 21:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sparty are you having a spat with chrissie again?</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363265215814</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 08:46:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363265418133-16</Id><Topic><Title>If Genna is also Hoozdik_Hertz</Title><Username>censored4567</Username><Timestamp>1363226316363</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 21:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone with 4th grade reading skills or better would see a clear difference in the writing styles of Hooz and Mr. Genna.

The plan means Germany will reach budget balance in 2015, a year earlier than required under the “debt brake” written into its constitution. He described the 2014 spending plan as “growth-friendly consolidation”, intended to prove to the rest of the eurozone that “consistent sustainable budgeting and growth are not mutually exclusive”. Philipp Rösler, economy minister, said Germany’s public finances were the “envy of the world”.

Catholics forbid the priesthood to marry. 1 Timothy 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, GIVING HEED TO seducing spirits, and DOCTRINES OF DEVILS; 4:2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 4:3 FORBIDDING TO MARRY, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. Catholics claim Peter was the first Pope but Peter was married. Matthew 8:14 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever. Mark 1:30 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. Luke 4:38 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house.

From about 1865 to about 1900 there were dozens, if not hundreds of 'civic' groups using frightful activities to pressure their friends and neighbors to conform. These activities, such as whippings and lynchings were often done under the guise of religion, or morality, but often the ultimate goal was to cause people to vacate their property so it could be gotten on the cheap, or to influence their vote for the benefit of the leaders of the 'organizations'. Unlike the Ku Klux Klan, these other organizations did not necessarily focus their hazing and terror on black people.

With the recent, historic visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the U.S., many Christians may be wondering what exactly Catholics believe about the robed figure with the German accent and his line of predecessors. Why do Catholics have a Pope? Do Catholics worship him? Is his authority political, spiritual, or is he just a figurehead? While I had a basic understanding of the Catholic papacy before his visit, I didn't fully grasp it. So, in an effort to better understand this central figure in Christendom and to help Christians more effectively dialogue, I dove into some heady reading materials from both Catholic and non-Catholic sources. Hopefully, my explanation here will offer some clarity on what Catholics really believe. First, a summary: For Catholics, the Pope is more than a ceremonial leader. The Pope is considered the spiritual successor to the Apostle Peter. As successor to the "Chair of Peter," he is the Supreme Pastor of the Catholic Church, God's steward ordained to authoritatively teach, unify, and protect God's people, keeping them free from error and deception (CCC 882, 890). Of his many official titles, the Pope is the Bishop of Rome and the head of the Magisterium (the teaching authority of the Church made up of the college of Bishops). He holds the final word on matters of faith and morals (known as "papal infallibility"). In the words of the Catechism of the Catholic Church (937): The Pope enjoys, by divine institution, 'supreme, full, immediate, and universal power in the care of souls' (CD 2)." There's a lot of strong wording here, but before we dive into some of the details, it's important to clarify that Catholics, in fact, do not worship the Pope or see him as a replacement of Christ or the Heavenly Father. From the Catholic perspective, the office of the papacy affirms Christ's Kingship and the Church's confidence in the Holy Spirit to guide believers. So, to fully understand the relationship Catholics have with the man they call both "Papa" and "Supreme Pontiff," let's look at a source all Christians have in common: Scripture. Matthew 16: 13-19 While Catholic doctrine pulls from many Scriptures when defining Church authority, Matthew 16:13-19 is one of the most important. Indeed, Catholic teachings point to Matthew 16: 18 as the moment when Christ officially instituted Peter as the first Pope, so it's worth spending the bulk of our time here. The scene opens with Jesus and the Twelve in the region of Caesarea Philippi – an area where ancient pagan worship of the Greek god Pan, the god of Spring and shepherds, once flourished (Ray 1999, 32-33). It was a dramatic place located on the side of a mountain with a sheer rock wall overshadowing the town with Pan's namesake, Paneas. Adding to the already stunning landscape, a temple to the Roman Caesar Augustus stood at the wall's highest point. The scene is ripe with symbolism for Catholics. Catholic apologist Stephen Ray points out, "By choosing this location for the appointment, Jesus clearly shows that he is setting up his divine kingdom in opposition to the worldly kingdom of the Roman Caesars, who claimed divinity for themselves" (1999, 32).</Msg><Username>the_loading_dock_01</Username><Timestamp>1363292101665</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:15:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363292644424-141</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes 500 Rich List Acquiring BA Shares!</Title><Username>james.tingle</Username><Timestamp>1362414215788</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:23:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report !</Msg><Username>coral.elliot</Username><Timestamp>1363292644424</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:24:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363292887095-142</Id><Topic><Title>BA Insider Trading Reported !!!</Title><Username>doris.shealey</Username><Timestamp>1361811207875</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 11:53:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report !</Msg><Username>coral.elliot</Username><Timestamp>1363292887095</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:28:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363293022746-143</Id><Title>There is a mention of a pope in the bible.</Title><Msg>The Catholic Church believes the Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the "rock" of his Church.

Matthew 16:18 reads "And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." A simple cross reference of Matthew 16:18 with 1st Peter 2:7 reveals the true context, "Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner." JESUS is the cornerstone upon which the Church is built. Even today, architects and builders realize that to build ANY structure, you MUST have a very accurate starting point upon which everything else can be built. Jesus is that Precious and Perfect cornerstone upon which everything in the Christian life is based. Surely, a flawed sinful man such as Peter could NOT have been the cornerstone of the church. In Matthew 16:23, just five verses after Jesus spoke of the "rock," he called Peter "Satan." There's no way Jesus was referring to Peter as the "rock" in Matthew 16:18. Jesus Christ is the ONLY Rock upon which the Church is built..."For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (1st Corinthians 3:11). Though the Catholic church claims that Popes are successors of Peter and the apostles, yet they openly admit the following: "Peter, it is true, ... possessed also the gift of inspiration and the power of working miracles. These two latter gifts are not claimed by the Pope ... The Apostles were endowed with the gift of inspiration ... No Catholic, on the contrary, claims that the Pope is inspired or endowed with Divine revelation properly so called" (Faith of Our Fathers, pp. 89,99). It is argued that these powers are not essential to the office of Pope. But read again the passages cited above and you will see that these powers were essential to the office of apostles. If Popes do not have these powers, how can they be successors of the apostles? Modern Popes cannot be successors of apostles because they are not eyewitnesses of Christ, they do not possess miraculous powers, they cannot impart such powers to others, and they are not directly guided by the Spirit. They possess none of the unique qualifications of apostles! How then does a man become Pope today? He is chosen by a body of men called Cardinals. Yet the Catholic Dictionary admits: "For a long time there was no such thing as a cardinal bishop..." It claims the first such men were named in 304 AD. Finally, a council in 1059 AD "decreed that Popes should henceforth be elected on the judgment of the six cardinal bishops..." (p. 118). The Catholic Church claims that the succession of Popes is a chain that connects the modern church to the first-century church. But Popes were unknown in the Bible, Peter was not a Pope, modern Popes have none of the essential qualifications of the apostles they are supposed to succeed, and it is admitted that there are times at which no one knows who was Pope. Furthermore, the men who select the Pope were unknown in the Bible and in history for centuries after the church began. And the modern means of selecting Popes was not determined until a millennium after the church began! The whole "chain" is missing! And this is the evidence used to prove that the Catholic Church is the true church!</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1363293454012</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:37:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363293631354-145</Id><Topic><Title>787's NIGHTMARES</Title><Username>nicehereinca</Username><Timestamp>1363291393451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:03:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice try moron.

The nation's big health insurers say they expect premiums — or the cost for insurance coverage — to rise from 20 to 100 percent for millions of people due to changes that will occur when key provisions of the Affordable Care Act roll out in January 2014. Mark Bertolini, CEO of Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest insurers, calls the price hikes "premium rate shock." "We've done all the math, we've shared it with all the regulators, we've shared it with all the people in Washington that need to see it, and I think it's a big concern," Bertolini said during the company's annual meeting with investors in December. To be sure, there will be no across-the-board rate hikes for everyone, and there's no reliable national data on how many people could see increases. But the biggest price hikes are expected to hit a group that represents a relatively small slice of the insured population. That includes some of the roughly 14 million people who buy their own insurance as opposed to being covered under employer-sponsored plans, and to a lesser extent, some employees of smaller companies. The price increases are a downside of President Barack Obama's health care law, which is expected to expand coverage to nearly 30 million uninsured people. The massive law calls for a number of changes that could cause premiums for people who don't have coverage through a big employer to rise next year — at a time when health care costs already are expected to grow by 5 percent or more.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1363296398767</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 17:26:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363297070975-159</Id><Title>BANKRUPTCY LAWYER TAKES OVER IN DETROIT...</Title><Msg>Another Democrat run City bites the dust.

But any organization pushing 2,000 years old has dogma (so what's the GOP's excuse?). The Bible offers no names for the thieves crucified on either side of Jesus, but the Catholic church does. The bible doesn't tell us the name of the centurion who pierced Jesus' side, or what became of that spear, but the Catholic church does. The bible doesn't mention many thousands of things any Catholic can expound upon at the drop of hat. What's it to you? You are free not to believe their stories, or simply not to care, or just about anything. The Bible isn't all there is to religion. If you knew the POLITICAL process that went into deciding which holy writings were included in the Bible and which were excluded, you'd know that. (And hint: Those decisions were ALL made by CATHOLICS. Ain't that a scream for the born-again Bible-thumpers out there?)

A lot of misconceptions by many critics on this board were cleared up (not that those vocalizing those myths will stop regurgitating them). Mr Spinnett did a great job. AS for being CEO, while I feel he could do a great job in that capacity, I am happy that he has his hands on the engineering end of the business. He might not enjoy the business level of #$%$ that goes with the CEO job as much as the engneering part. But he appears clearly capable of doing it..</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1363315673616</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 22:47:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363316104670-205</Id><Topic><Title>a black mans hobnesty is different then a white mans</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1363303230625</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 19:20:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a black mans honesty is only different to the ignorant rednekk racist who cant contain his fear and hate of the black man.
