I'm financially independent and very secure, in myself and my financial situation. Do you honestly think I care what you or anyone else does? I do not. A person with issues? Just angry and bigoted? Me? You've made this claim before and it's false. What you're doing has a name. It's called projection. You take behaviors and characteristics which YOU are guilty of and accuse others of them. Nice try, but nobody's buying the bologne you're peddling. I don't hate anything. What I don't like however are your constant lies. You're just a #$%$ artist who's obsessed with painting Boeing in the least favorable light possible. You're clearly on some kind of weird vendetta against Boeing and have a HUGE chip on your shoulder, probably because they fired your #$%$ for doing something stupid. To the best of my knowledge, I've never posted anything on this board about Boeing that's anything other than factually accurate and correct. If you believe otherwise, then find one of my posts, just one, where I've violated that claim. You won't, because you can't. Do you know what your perpetual bleeting about Airbus, Boeing and Tesla stock and which has done better over some period of time tells me? It tells me that you're very insecure and have little in your life that gives you pleasure. It tells me that you're obsessed with "riches". It is a fool's errand. There are many ways in which one can be rich or poor (e.g. family, friends, health, true happiness, etc). Money is just one measure and not a very good one at that. If all you've got in your life is money and stock, you're poor ... very, very poor and if you weren't such a jerk I'd actually feel sorry for you. I am so very glad I'm not you.</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1380284292757</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 08:18:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380286591584-17</Id><Title>VN attention-Norwigian's 787 broke down again, tell me if I am telling the truth LOL</Title><Msg>Norwegian Air Shuttle suffered yet another Boeing Dreamliner breakdown on Friday when a hydraulic pump failed, delaying a flight to Stockholm from Bangkok, a spokesman said on Friday. Norwegian's two Dreamliners have broken down several times this month. The company could not say how long the plane would be grounded this time and was making alternative travel arrangements for passengers should the delay prove extensive. Norwegian launched long-haul operations this year and hoped to capitalize on Dreamliner's lower operating cost. The plane is lighter and its engines promised 20 percent savings on fuel. Boeing's plane was expected to be a game-changer for the aviation industry but there have been delays getting it into service and setbacks including the grounding of all planes because of battery problems. Norwegian summoned Boeing's management this week and the U.S. firm promised to locate spare parts centers at all Norwegian's Dreamliner destinations as well as sending a team of engineers to Oslo to monitor the planes' performance.</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380286591584</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 08:56:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380287023712-18</Id><Topic><Title>whats better 63% gain in stock price in 60 days for tesla or in " a lttle more than a month 17% for boeing"</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380243800976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-09-26 21:03:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lets bump this for VN the 787 is broke again today, am I telling the truth LOL</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380287023712</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 09:03:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380287540475-19</Id><Topic><Title>why does the president, Dems in congress and Federal employees love Obamacare when they are exempt from it?</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1380255712210</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 00:21:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is a toilet paper roll of Fed govt employee exemptions....laws they passed the folks have to comply with that they are exempt from.

Norwegian has had two brand new 787's in service for just 4 weeks. One of them broke before they could even fly the first commercial sortie. How many times have they had customers stranded because of a mechanical problem, are we up to 6 incidents now? There's a clear pattern here. Boeing is rushing these out the door. They've made promises to investors for number of 787 deliveries this year and resulting cash flow. I didn't think delivering more than 60 787s would be a problem, but now I wonder. They delivered 9 787s in June, 7 in July, and 10 in August. For this month I count just 2. I understand there are seven planes "ready for delivery", but they've had that status for weeks. It's going to be a busy weekend. One of those seven "ready for delivery" is going to Qatar, which has been vocal about their disappointment. If Boeing has been rushing to the extent that brand new planes are out of service for a week due to problems immediately after delivery, then make Boeing do a couple more weeks of pre-delivery checkout work. If that's the case then Boeing will miss their delivery target by 10 or more 787s this year. That will be a $1.5 to $2 billion hit to cash flows.

It doesn't take much to fire up Hersh, the investigative journalist who has been the nemesis of US presidents since the 1960s and who was once described by the Republican party as "the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist". He is angry about the timidity of journalists in America, their failure to challenge the White House and be an unpopular messenger of truth. Don't even get him started on the New York Times which, he says, spends "so much more time carrying water for Obama than I ever thought they would" – or the death of Osama bin Laden. "Nothing's been done about that story, it's one big lie, not one word of it is true," he says of the dramatic US Navy Seals raid in 2011. Hersh is writing a book about national security and has devoted a chapter to the bin Laden killing. He says a recent report put out by an "independent" Pakistani commission about life in the Abottabad compound in which Bin Laden was holed up would not stand up to scrutiny. "The Pakistanis put out a report, don't get me going on it. Let's put it this way, it was done with considerable American input. It's a #$%$ report," he says hinting of revelations to come in his book. The Obama administration lies systematically, he claims, yet none of the leviathans of American media, the TV networks or big print titles, challenge him. "It's pathetic, they are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [Obama]," he declares in an interview with the Guardian.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380303480290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 13:38:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380303673541-68</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh on Obama, NSA and the 'pathetic' American media</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380303480290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 13:38:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"It used to be when you were in a situation when something very dramatic happened, the president and the minions around the president had control of the narrative, you would pretty much know they would do the best they could to tell the story straight.

He isn't even sure if the recent revelations about the depth and breadth of surveillance by the National Security Agency will have a lasting effect. Snowden changed the debate on surveillance He is certain that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden "changed the whole nature of the debate" about surveillance. Hersh says he and other journalists had written about surveillance, but Snowden was significant because he provided documentary evidence – although he is sceptical about whether the revelations will change the US government's policy. "Duncan Campbell [the British investigative journalist who broke the Zircon cover-up story], James Bamford [US journalist] and Julian Assange and me and the New Yorker, we've all written the notion there's constant surveillance, but he [Snowden] produced a document and that changed the whole nature of the debate, it's real now," Hersh says. "Editors love documents. Chicken#$%$ editors who wouldn't touch stories like that, they love documents, so he changed the whole ball game," he adds, before qualifying his remarks. "But I don't know if it's going to mean anything in the long [run] because the polls I see in America – the president can still say to voters 'al-Qaida, al-Qaida' and the public will vote two to one for this kind of surveillance, which is so idiotic," he says.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380303673541</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 13:41:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380303728450-69</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh on Obama, NSA and the 'pathetic' American media</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380303480290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 13:38:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Holding court to a packed audience at City University in London's summer school on investigative journalism, 76-year-old Hersh is on full throttle, a whirlwind of amazing stories of how journalism used to be; how he exposed the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, how he got the Abu Ghraib pictures of American soldiers brutalising Iraqi prisoners, and what he thinks of Edward Snowden. Hope of redemption Despite his concern about the timidity of journalism he believes the trade still offers hope of redemption. "I have this sort of heuristic view that journalism, we possibly offer hope because the world is clearly run by total nincompoops more than ever … Not that journalism is always wonderful, it's not, but at least we offer some way out, some integrity." His story of how he uncovered the My Lai atrocity is one of old-fashioned shoe-leather journalism and doggedness. Back in 1969, he got a tip about a 26-year-old platoon leader, William Calley, who had been charged by the army with alleged mass murder. Instead of picking up the phone to a press officer, he got into his car and started looking for him in the army camp of Fort Benning in Georgia, where he heard he had been detained. From door to door he searched the vast compound, sometimes blagging his way, marching up to the reception, slamming his fist on the table and shouting: "Sergeant, I want Calley out now." Eventually his efforts paid off with his first story appearing in the St Louis Post-Despatch, which was then syndicated across America and eventually earned him the Pulitzer Prize. "I did five stories. I charged $100 for the first, by the end the [New York] Times were paying $5,000." He was hired by the New York Times to follow up the Watergate scandal and ended up hounding Nixon over Cambodia. Almost 30 years later, Hersh made global headlines all over again with his exposure of the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380303728450</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 13:42:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380303762015-70</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh on Obama, NSA and the 'pathetic' American media</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380303480290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 13:38:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who wrote the article, edited it, printed it, and published it which you pinched/plagiarized...</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380303762015</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 13:42:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380303792732-71</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh on Obama, NSA and the 'pathetic' American media</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380303480290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 13:38:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For students of journalism his message is put the miles and the hours in. He knew about Abu Ghraib five months before he could write about it, having been tipped off by a senior Iraqi army officer who risked his own life by coming out of Baghdad to Damascus to tell him how prisoners had been writing to their families asking them to come and kill them because they had been "despoiled". "I went five months looking for a document, because without a document, there's nothing there, it doesn't go anywhere." Hersh returns to US president Barack Obama. He has said before that the confidence of the US press to challenge the US government collapsed post 9/11, but he is adamant that Obama is worse than Bush. "Do you think Obama's been judged by any rational standards? Has Guantanamo closed? Is a war over? Is anyone paying any attention to Iraq? Is he seriously talking about going into Syria? We are not doing so well in the 80 wars we are in right now, what the hell does he want to go into another one for. What's going on [with journalists]?" he asks. He says investigative journalism in the US is being killed by the crisis of confidence, lack of resources and a misguided notion of what the job entails. "Too much of it seems to me is looking for prizes. It's journalism looking for the Pulitzer Prize," he adds. "It's a packaged journalism, so you pick a target like – I don't mean to diminish because anyone who does it works hard – but are railway crossings safe and stuff like that, that's a serious issue but there are other issues too. "Like killing people, how does [Obama] get away with the drone programme, why aren't we doing more? How does he justify it? What's the intelligence? Why don't we find out how good or bad this policy is? Why do newspapers constantly cite the two or three groups that monitor drone killings.

That doesn't happen enough. It costs money, it costs time, it jeopardises, it raises risks. There are some people – the New York Times still has investigative journalists but they do much more of carrying water for the president than I ever thought they would … it's like you don't dare be an outsider any more." He says in some ways President George Bush's administration was easier to write about. "The Bush era, I felt it was much easier to be critical than it is [of] Obama. Much more difficult in the Obama era," he said. Asked what the solution is Hersh warms to his theme that most editors are pusillanimous and should be fired. "I'll tell you the solution, get rid of 90% of the editors that now exist and start promoting editors that you can't control," he says. I saw it in the New York Times, I see people who get promoted are the ones on the desk who are more amenable to the publisher and what the senior editors want and the trouble makers don't get promoted. Start promoting better people who look you in the eye and say 'I don't care what you say'. Nor does he understand why the Washington Post held back on the Snowden files until it learned the Guardian was about to publish. If Hersh was in charge of US Media Inc, his scorched earth policy wouldn't stop with newspapers. "I would close down the news bureaus of the networks and let's start all over, tabula rasa. The majors, NBCs, ABCs, they won't like this – just do something different, do something that gets people mad at you, that's what we're supposed to be doing," he says. Hersh is currently on a break from reporting, working on a book which undoubtedly will make for uncomfortable reading for both Bush and Obama. "The republic's in trouble, we lie about everything, lying has become the staple." And he implores journalists to do something about it.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380303851735</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 13:44:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380303852599-73</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare critics are 'desperate' fat-cat Fox News watchers</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380300973742</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 12:56:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if you really want the facts you have to look.

All of the airline's 787s, including the new jets, will be powered by General Electric Co engines, the sources said. GE already is a significant supplier to the airline. Emirates Airline has received an official offer from Boeing Co.(BA) over a planned order of its upgraded 777X jet, though the head of the Dubai-based carrier said Friday that the two sides still have to thrash out a number of issues. Tim Clark, the airline's president, said the companies "haven't locked horns on a contract yet" in a deal that will be closely watched across the industry as Emirates is already the largest operator of the existing 777 twin-aisle jet.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1380314494741</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 16:41:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380316106270-114</Id><Title>The U S Army ?</Title><Msg>the hawkeyes the tritons the knights the cougars the los altos hillview elementary school go f yo momma just get to kndergarten Loyal with the fifth-grade organizer/feminist/ future democrat beyatches walk the mile and broadjump the railroad tracks (if you mean we can collect bottlesand cans for fice-cents apiec the sameprice as a candy-bar) her daddy was the one of top legal minds of the raygun administration well i do not want to walk with 5th-graders like them the first day of skool or any other day I have found a ride to the place where we get est cookies and take naps and if your week is called you get to go over to the cafeteria and get an Obamacrae sized crate with 27 little-cartons of milk in it and some lettuce for thew guinea pigs our pets named... yu F with me,and yu F yurself</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380316106270</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 17:08:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380316434580-115</Id><Topic><Title>The U S Army ?</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380316106270</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 17:08:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We Only Buy BOEing there is little 'otter' choice ever SEE the Roots with Carley Rae Jepson on the Jimmy Fallon Show all good musicains\</Msg><Username>skooterlibby</Username><Timestamp>1380316434580</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 17:13:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380317137336-116</Id><Topic><Title>The U S Army ?</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380316106270</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 17:08:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this should make it 0 -0 -1 reply got a brick or eight Roots, one carley rae and on jimmy FALLON is he from Nevada small sprms no link but 16M HITS ON YOUTUBE</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380317137336</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 17:25:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380317417688-117</Id><Title>Should the US start withdrawing from South Korea?</Title><Msg>SK has a strong economy.

That’s because, unlike most other belief systems, religion is impervious to empiricism. Most claims people make are subject to real-world tests. Are you in denial that your spouse is cheating on you? If you’re given photographic evidence that it’s true, that’s probably enough to shake you from your convictions. Want to believe the Earth is flat and not round? Shoot you into space and see how long that belief lasts. Sure, there are always fools who won’t believe the evidence, no matter how overwhelming, but for most of us, most of the time, we have a limit. With religion, however, there’s no limits about what you can claim to believe. Jesus is a mythological character: he believes whatever the person speaking for him says he believes. For one person, Jesus believes we should feed the hungry and clothe the naked. For another, Jesus didn’t really mean it when he said that stuff; he was just handing out goodies in order to recruit new believers. We weren’t there (and it probably didn’t even happen), so the sky’s the limit when making up reasons why what you believe counts as “Christian.” If you want to believe Jesus was actually a space alien brought here by Martians to teach us how to fly, you have as much right as anyone else to believe what you want. It all has equal amounts of evidence to back it up. That’s one reason politicians love to talk about religion, because they don’t have to prove anything. But that’s the major reason religion really has no place in politics. It’s hard enough for voters and policy makers to hash through the real-world claims that fly around in politics. Trying to figure out what some silent, mythical god wants us to do is a fool’s errand. That god is always and forever going to want what the person speaking for him wants him to want, and nothing else. If Ken Blackwell was only allowed to speak for Ken Blackwell and not claim authority from on high, the true cruelty of his words would be all the easier to see.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380317808405</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 17:36:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380317876815-119</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Dylan's Back Pages</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380306754532</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 14:32:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You forgot a song by ole Bob that could be written for Barry Soetoro Verse 1] Come you masters of war You that build all the guns You that build the death planes You that build all the bombs You that hide behind walls You that hide behind desks I just want you to know I can see through your masks [Verse 2] You that never done nothing But build to destroy You play with my world Like it’s your little toy You put a gun in my hand And you hide from my eyes And you turn and run farther When the fast bullets fly [Verse 3] Like Judas of old You lie and deceive A world war can be won You want me to believe But I see through your eyes And I see through your brain Like I see through the water That runs down my drain [Verse 4] You fasten the triggers For the others to fire Then you set back and watch When the death count gets higher You hide in your mansion As young people’s blood Flows out of their bodies And is buried in the mud Bob Dylan</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380317876815</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 17:37:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380319189321-120</Id><Topic><Title>The U S Army ?</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380316106270</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 17:08:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>some nice old guy wants to tech me to build aerop[lanes and the paint 'em watch out nice old mister i can pound my own nails into some pre-cut wooden parts to make a toy wooden aeroplane which don't fly i have personally shot a bottle-rocket over one mile4 by kindergarden</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380319189321</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 17:59:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380320095415-121</Id><Topic><Title>STOP ANSWERING WAYNE,ELON</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1380296411250</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 11:40:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just stop answering him and he will go away.Let him play his games with his army of screen names.Ignore him.</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1380320095415</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 18:14:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380320490570-122</Id><Title>Somebody is gonna have to die to prove Obamacare wrong</Title><Msg>I propose the elonmusk ba-messageboard poster</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380320490570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 18:21:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380320930084-123</Id><Topic><Title>The U S Army ?</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380316106270</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 17:08:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>at 11M hits hey soul sister alyssa bernal cover of \Train song hey soul sister and then there is always Cream Wheels Of Fire live at Winterland in one week</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380320930084</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 18:28:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380321451182-124</Id><Topic><Title>Somebody is gonna have to die to prove Obamacare wrong</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380320490570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 18:21:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Death Panels will be the new reality starting in 2014.

"We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability (POI) to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they have some idea of what they are doing." In a Capitol Hill press conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pointed to the success of the U.S. Postal Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has an excellent record of hiring Persons with No Ability (63 percent). Under the Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million mid-level positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance. Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given to guarantee upward mobilityfor even the most unremarkable employees. The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that promote a significant number of Persons of Inability (POI) into middle-management positions, and give a tax credit to small and medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380323452424</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 19:10:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380323571541-139</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Dylan's Back Pages</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380306754532</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 14:32:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cry me a river.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380323571541</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 19:12:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380323789947-140</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Dylan's Back Pages</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380306754532</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 14:32:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Cry me a River" ...... build a bridge and get over it</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380323789947</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 19:16:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380324194006-141</Id><Topic><Title>The Kent Raven and "The Americans With No Abilities Act"</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380323452424</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 19:10:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who did you plagiarize that from?</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380324194006</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 19:23:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380324215023-142</Id><Topic><Title>A 'friend' of mine tried to engage me in a debate over Iran-Contra recently</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380309639444</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 15:20:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>live webcam reno everything this weekend \get'r done</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380324215023</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 19:23:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380324304866-143</Id><Topic><Title>Somebody is gonna have to die to prove Obamacare wrong</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380320490570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 18:21:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here is one of the "low information voters" in the hall of shame: sdmiller4747 • May 03 2013 "Blacks really aren't operating under full control.

In hastily arranged remarks in the White House briefing room to announce the breakthrough, Obama also sharply scolded congressional Republicans demanding that he agree to roll back Obamacare in return for avoiding a government shutdown or raising America’s debt limit. “That’s not going to happen,” the president declared. “Do not threaten to burn the house down simply because you haven’t gotten one hundred percent of your way.” And Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s communications director, Rory Cooper, charged on Twitter that “The President won't talk to people with bombs strapped to their chest...only the Iranian president, who literally funds that.” The surprise diplomatic overture came after Obama and Rouhani had traded letters following Rouhani's election earlier this year. The White House had proposed an informal meeting between the two leaders this week in New York around the United Nations General Assembly, which both men attended. But officials said the Iranians had concluded that the timing was wrong.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380324466288</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 19:27:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380324529552-146</Id><Topic><Title>The Kent Raven and "The Americans With No Abilities Act"</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380323452424</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 19:10:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Luckily for you, the ACA will provide you with the mental health care you so desperately need.

Image: President Obama. In a wide-ranging interview published today by the Guardian, Hersh savages the US media for failing to challenge the White House on a whole host of issues, from NSA spying, to drone attacks, to aggression against Syria. On the subject of the Navy Seal raid that supposedly resulted in the death of the Al-Qaeda terror leader, Hersh remarked, “Nothing’s been done about that story, it’s one big lie, not one word of it is true.” Hersh added that the Obama administration habitually lies but they continue to do so because the press allows them to get away with it. “It’s pathetic, they are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [Obama],” Hersh told the Guardian. The raid that supposedly led to Bin Laden’s death has been shrouded in mystery for over two years. Speculation that the Obama administration may have embellished or outright lied about the true account of what happened has persisted, mainly because the White House has refused to publicly release images of Bin Laden’s body. Although the White House said the corpse was immediately “buried at sea” in line with Islamic tradition, it quickly emerged that this was not standard practice. Numerous analysts have claimed that Bin Laden had in fact been dead for years and that the raid on his alleged compound in Pakistan was little more than a stunt.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380327374526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:16:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380327397907-152</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh: Bin Laden Raid “One Big Lie”</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380327374526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Other questions also persist, such as why the narrative and timeline of the raid has changed multiple times, why the White House initially claimed that “situation room” photos showed Obama watching the raid live when in fact there was a blackout on the live feed, and why neighbors in the immediate area surrounding the compound said with absolute certainty that they had never seen Bin Laden and that they knew of no evidence whatsoever to suggest he lived there. During the rest of the Guardian interview, which is well worth reading in its entirety, Hersh lambastes the corporate press and particularly the New York Times, which he says spends “so much more time carrying water for Obama than I ever thought they would.” Hersh’s solution is to shut down news networks like NBC and ABC and fire 90% of mainstream editors, replacing them with real journalists who are outsiders and not afraid to speak truth to power. “The republic’s in trouble, we lie about everything, lying has become the staple,” concluded Hersh.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380327397907</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:16:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380328500667-153</Id><Title>Faces - Fly in the Ointment</Title><Msg>there is</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1380328500667</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:35:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380328532606-154</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh: Bin Laden Raid “One Big Lie”</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380327374526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This guy is notorious for claiming things.

I love the we need to kill eagles to preserve them - only libs can say that with a straight face. In the name of better/cheaper service: In December 2008, environmental groups and the company returned to court for an appeal of the previous ruling. On March 16, 2009 the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that allowing the Superferry to operate prior to completion of the environmental study was unconstitutional. The company immediately suspended service and laid off its 236 employees. Note Cruise ships in Ha do not do an enviro study. In the name of wind, from SF Gate: A large wind farm in Solano County would be the first renewable energy project in the nation to be issued a permit to kill eagles under a plan released Thursday by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The proposal, outlined in a draft environmental report, is to issue a golden eagle take permit to the Shiloh IV Wind Project, on 3,500 acres in the Montezuma Hills between Rio Vista and Fairfield. The unusual plan would allow the company's 50 wind turbines to kill up to five golden eagles over a five-year period in exchange for a series of measures to protect the big birds, including the retrofitting of 133 nearby power poles to prevent electrocutions. "The bottom line is a permit will help preserve eagles," said Scott Flaherty, the deputy assistant regional director of external affairs for the Fish and Wildlife Service. "I think it really does set a precedent. It shows the service can work with wind energy companies ... and ensure that we conserve eagles and other wildlife."</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1380340176265</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 23:49:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
