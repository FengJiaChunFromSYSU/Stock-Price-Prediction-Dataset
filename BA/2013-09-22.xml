Talking to Wayne is akin to talking to the urinal on the wall in the men's room, except the urinal is a lot smarter, has much more integrity and is immeasurably more truthful. Wayne, regardless of which of his multiple aliases he happens to be using at the moment, has shown himself to be nothing but a chronic liar.

Beria was the longest lived and most influential of Stalin's secret police chiefs, wielding his most substantial influence during and after World War II. He simultaneously administered vast sections of the Soviet state and served as de facto Marshal of the Soviet Union in command of the NKVD field units responsible for anti-partisan operations on the Eastern Front during World War II, as well as for acting as barrier troops and the apprehension of thousands of "turncoats, deserters, cowards and suspected malingerers". Beria administered the vast expansion of the Gulag labor camps and was primarily responsible for overseeing the secret defense institutions known as sharashkas, critical to the war effort. He also played the decisive role in coordinating the Soviet partisans, developing an impressive intelligence and sabotage network behind German lines. He attended the Yalta Conference with Stalin, who introduced him to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt as "our Himmler".[1] After the war, he organized the communist takeover of the countries of Central Europe and Eastern Europe. Beria's uncompromising ruthlessness in his duties and skill at producing results culminated in his success in overseeing the Soviet atomic bomb project. Stalin gave it absolute priority and the project was completed in under five years in no small part due to Soviet espionage against the West organized by Beria's NKVD. Beria was promoted to First Deputy Premier, where he carried out a brief campaign of liberalization.

Beria was promoted to First Deputy Premier, where he carried out a brief campaign of liberalization. He was briefly a part of the ruling "troika" with Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. Beria's overconfidence in his position after Stalin's death led him to misjudge other Politburo members. During the coup d'état led by Nikita Khrushchev and assisted by the military forces of Marshal Georgy Zhukov, Beria was arrested on charges of treason during a meeting in which the full Politburo condemned him. The compliance of the NKVD was ensured by Zhukov's troops, and after interrogation Beria was taken to the basement of the Lubyanka and shot by General Pavel Batitsky.[2]</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1379872529479</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-22 13:55:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379875079576-28</Id><Topic><Title>The duty of a True Patriot....</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379863658199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-22 11:27:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You calling Thomas Paine...one of the great patriots of the Revolution to gain freedom in America a "loon" ?

In the mean time, three of the 15 terrorists in the Kenya attack are from the United States. Obama is simply doing a bang-up job. A year later and no arrests on the Benghazi attack, though any other president would have launched a military attack - with "boots on the ground" - immediately. He uses the NSA to spy on everyone in America - except apparently the Boston bombers, the Naval Yard shooter, Snowden, and Manning. "Inadvertently", instead of spying on Egypt, he spied on all of Washington - just before the elections last year. Terrorism in the United States and everywhere else has increased significantly since the faux-Peace Prize winner came to office. He calls for Transformation of America. Here is a transformative idea, for him, resign. While he may have actually been born in the United States, he certainly does not act it.
