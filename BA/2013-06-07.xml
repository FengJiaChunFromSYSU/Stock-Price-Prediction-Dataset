I want to thank the MMM retiree with over 30 years for expressing his admiration for the workers in Puget Sound that made Boeing a great company pre Phil. The man said that he was at MMM when James McNerney Jr Total Compensation: $10.3 mil worked there and was concerned for Boeing now as his experience with Mr McNerney was less than mediocre, the retiree said Mr McNerney did cut some fat but over all his performance was disappointing. And to the man who listened to my stock market presentation from Triumph at Airway heights in Spokane, I could see your back get straight and your resentment of the two tier , a la Boeing, employee take away program having a negative effect on you. Every Boeing employee who wants to have a aerospace stock in their retirement package should go with Airbus , the stock is up 150% for 5 years compared with Boeing only up 36% . To put it simply 5 years ago investing in boeing would give you 136,000 while investing in Airbus would give you $250,000. As to TSLA the 100 % gain was from May 3 and just count 16 days , that is a great 16 day run. Now ACAD is doing great too up 256% year to date and now up for one year 1137%. Now remember those stocks have had a great run and please follow my basic stock chart reading to know when to get in and out and your welcome for the next batch of 100% gain stocks I thank you from the real workers of boeing Puget Sound prior to James McNerney, Phil and harry , the 3 stooges of the business world .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370580289179</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 00:44:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370581486758-3</Id><Topic><Title>Global Warming</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1370559114075</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:51:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They should also say frostbites will be reduced and the cold and flu seasons of fall and winter go away.

Obonzo says this with a straight face while his administration is violating email guidelines meant to assure transparency, spying on nearly every adult US citizen and using agencies to abuse privacy rights and threatening the press.

I picked up the technique of waiting for stocks to break out of their trading range and then buying (or selling if it goes the other way) from books by Jesse Livermore and Nicolas Darvas and it has worked well for me so far. It is a more conservative system that does leave money on the table but has kept me from some serious losses in 2000 and 2008. Being somewhat risk adverse it works better for me. I am almost done accumulating Boeing since it is starting to get closer to fair value. My guess is that it will exceed that since it is on the Hedge / Mutual Fund radar now but I'll let the speculators play that game.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1370620705848</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 11:58:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370620771103-41</Id><Topic><Title>Moses long BA since 70$. you think me can double the money?</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1370618572596</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 11:22:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>osulin sure you can I got some of mine at $57.00 when nobody would touch it but I saw what it had for the FUTURE that's why I bought more at $70.25$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1370620771103</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 11:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370620893158-42</Id><Topic><Title>Topping?</Title><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1370448330518</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 12:05:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good books!!</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1370620893158</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 12:01:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370621110264-43</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Approve of Eric Holders Performance !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1370620540320</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 11:55:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice try sparty</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1370621110264</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 12:05:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370621479132-44</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Approve of Eric Holders Performance !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1370620540320</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 11:55:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>see Huffington post under "Lindsey Graham Is 'Glad' NSA Collects Verizon Phone Records"</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1370621479132</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 12:11:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370621624584-45</Id><Topic><Title>ACLU now saying Obonzo worse than Bush</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1370575902625</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 23:31:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>censored err low information err lower information err lowest information err spaz</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1370621624584</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 12:13:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370622225256-46</Id><Topic><Title>ACLU now saying Obonzo worse than Bush</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1370575902625</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 23:31:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spazticus, i know how much low information moore-ons/dumbos despise bushhhhhhh, but that's neither here nor there, their basis, is BS, why not drop the bar lower, we can go much, much, lower, worse than clinton, carter, johnson, fdr, wilson.....</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1370622225256</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 12:23:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370623378316-47</Id><Title>new contract</Title><Msg>a $17.3 million award to Boeing (NYSE: BA ) modifying a previously awarded firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract, and hiring Boeing to provide logistics support services for the Navy's C-40A transport aircraft fleet.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1370623378316</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 12:42:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370624313292-48</Id><Topic><Title>Stand up for Liberty &amp; Freedom !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1370613235413</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 09:53:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes indeed--stand up for the rights and liberties of All Americans.

Now for the truth that counts my stock ACAD is up over 19% for the past 5 trade days, it too set a new 52 week high today one of several in the last month. ACAD numbers, 5 trade days ACAD up 19.1%, 1 month up 40%,3 months up 161%, 6 months up 305%, one year up 1161%. Next , my other stock to consider TSLA in May gained 100% in just 16 trade days, and now , it is up 5% today much better than the Boeing gain of 2.2% today, or about twice as good, so no choice for a day trade. Now moving on TSLA up 84% for 1 month,164% for 3 months and year to date up 201%. As I said after the short squeeze get out of TSLA and wait for it to break above the Bollinger line on good volume then read my one sentence how to trade a stock, follow it and you will continue to make money and not lose . Every Boeing worker, who wants a aerospace stock, should be in Airbus up over 159% in 5 years compared to a pathetic,39% in five years. For Boeing stock. Next remember , these Boeing BHT, are not acting in any investors best interest, I post here to give you the truth about Boeing . The facts say it all, I do not use disinformation posed by the BHT. No reason to listen to the BHT- they do not care about your investments if they did they would not be bragging up a lousy company like Boeing, who takes taxpayer money and runs to outsource jobs , get rid of unions sets up two tier pay and retiree plans. Boeing go to china , china pays their workers $4200 per year Boeing pays Carolina worker $53000 per year so that is not the reason Boeing moved to Carolina , the only reason is the CEO, a mediocre at best CEO, who Jack Welch fired, wants to be able to take away all worker rights and then he can really be the dictator he wants to be. If he were a great leader like Steve jobs or Elon Musk he would not have to do that sort of thing , but then his work history is average to be kind !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370634349111</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:45:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370636612883-68</Id><Topic><Title>52 week high today for ACAD up 19% in 5 trade days ,TSLA up 5% today, Boeing not so good, as usual</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370634349111</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:45:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What has acad to do with boeing..why dont you go to gm hwp ibm pfe mrk mcd ko and every listed stock and compare it....oops u were let go from boeing!

So why do you think those two types ( riveter and driling ) will make a 25 percent production flow time when compared to the previous 4 to 5 decades development and use at Boeing and elsewhere ? For example in the 60's - BA used a picture frame- panel method for wing panels using a combination squeeze-vibrate method for headless rivets ( slugs ) built by Gemcor In the late 70's- Boeing used a computer ( floppy disc) driven automated floor panel drilling macine on 747-and also on 767 in the early 80's. The 747 used a track driven and hydraulic lift posts for wing panel riveters - also built by Gemcor - that drilled, inserted- squeezed slugs and then machined the slug flush. So whats new ? better drilling, use of electric morotr cam driven squeezing, etc And since the 70's, also used electromagnetic riveting- basically to opposing coils disharging a flat plate attached to a rivet die and driving the rivet in a single blow. Initially by hand held, later by machine/ computer for 767 and later wing spar assemblies. This system/concept was derived from a NASA method using a coil on a shovel handle- wired to a LARGE capacitor bank - to flatten or remove dents from saturn tank/ dome structures.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1370645398127</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 18:49:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370645509525-86</Id><Topic><Title>I was telling you guys we were entering a Fscist Dictatorship 5 years ago</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1370575063998</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 23:17:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

Michele Bachmann told Fox News host Sean Hannity that we haven’t seen the last of her yet. “Sometimes you can be more effective on the outside than on the inside,” she said, echoing sentiments made by other Tea Party firebrands after being pushed out of office, like Allen West. “I’m not going away, I’m not leaving Washington, I’m not leaving the national scene.” She suggested that her future plans may even include a bid for higher office, and Hannity asked her specifically about another White House run: HANNITY: Last question, think about 2016 maybe be running for president again? BACHMANN: I’m not taking anything off the table, but certainly that is not my number one item that I’m looking at right now either. I’m in the game for the long haul. Unless things change drastically for the congresswoman in the next two years, performing even as well as she did in 2012 seems out of reach, given swirling ethics questions and the fact that some conservative leaders seem to have lost patience for the outspoken Bachmann.

WING PANELS FASTENED BY ELECTROMAGNETIC RIVETING Two heads are formed simultaneously on a headless rivet in only 1/2000th second with electromagnetic riveting equipment recently developed by the Boeing Company's Commercial Airplane Group, Everett, Wash. Advantages of this over conventional riveting are said to include less factory noise, fewer rejects, higher productivity, less operator fatigue and cost reductions in operations where conventional manual riveting has previously been required. According to H Buf--, project manager, EMR puts manual riveting on a par with automatic machine riveting in terms of quality and speed for a substantially smaller investment in equipment. An EMR system consists of two guns, one for each side of a workpiece, that can drive a headless rivet with a single impact. An electrical coil in each gun receives power from a common source and applies up to 30,000 pounds of force to a riveting ram. Since each gun weighs about 75 pounds, they require counterbalancing with an overhead pulley system. In addition, each gun has provisions to preclude independent firing or tiring when it is not perpendicular to a workpiece. Firing occurs when a signal from a master gun discharges a capacitor bank in an electronic control unit, and simultaneously energizes the coils in mating guns. Boeing is using EMR equipment primarily in the assembly of wing panels, which cannot be riveted with expensive automatic riveters due to accessibility problems.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1370653644385</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 21:07:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370653670751-113</Id><Topic><Title>clsn, so I told you I was working another short squeeze like TSLA today I took it gained 35% hows your BA doing ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369857196424</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:53:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so this stock was a long on the 24 and a sell on the 31 and you could have done a short after that but are you making some kind of disinformation about that ? is there a question? what is your point ?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370653670751</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 21:07:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370653904723-114</Id><Topic><Title>MTorres floor drilling system drilling floor panels at 3-4 times faster than before use</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1370638287322</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 16:51:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing is using EMR equipment primarily in the assembly of wing panels, which cannot be riveted with expensive automatic riveters due to accessibility problems. But He---k ( HANK) Sch-----t, engineer in charge of EMR development, believes such equipment would be advantageous in almost any situation where riveting is necessary. Sc---concedes that, while EMR is about twice as fast as automatic machine riveting, the new process is unlikely to replace machines that drill holes feed and set rivets and also shave installed rivets. But he feels that EMR can make older hand riveting methods obsolete when quality is the prime consideration. The quality of a riveted joint is proportional to the amount the rivet expands in the hole to produce an interference fit. The interference is important to fatigue life, and when it can't be controlled, it is necessary to cold work the hole to prevent fatigue cracking. According to S8888with EMR, the interference is excellent to ensure a tight fit all around to prevent leaks with minimal metal fatigue.
