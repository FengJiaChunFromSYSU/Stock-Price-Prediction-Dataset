Beginning with the "shareholder value" talk from Phil Condit and the "leadership team" in Chicago, Boeing went from being a prime aviation firm to just another lackey for the investor class. Making money not airplanes was the new game. Debbie Hopkins was in, Boyd Given and the old finance guard was out. Understandable from a purely profit point of view, but, the focus in Boeing should have always been the product, Boeing no longer procures airplane the 787 is a financial business deal an outsourced failure plane not made by Boeing . Jim Hall, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said I wouldn’t be surprised to see Congressional hearings to ask the FAA exactly what’s being done,” Hall said ”Today this is backed up by two former safety regulators who said the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) process in initially certifying the 787 also deserves examination, The FAA’s own role in certifying the airplane’s systems as safe also needs to be scrutinized, he said. That task, he said, will fall to the NTSB, which is investigating the Dreamliner fire in Boston. The other option, a drastic grounding of the fleet, would have done immense harm to Boeing That option may still come if the plane has systemic engineering faults. In the short term, however, Aboulafia said the review, will soak up time and engineering resources at Boeing as well as at the FAA. That, could slow down the planned 787 ramp up, which is supposed to double output of the plane to 10 per month by year end. “It should, frankly,” Aboulafia said. He questioned the wisdom of delivering 46 of the jets last year. “. “They should have built it with zero defects first.” As soon as problems began Boeing should have halted production and found the problems and fixed them .or scrapped the plane and started over . Former NTSB board member John Goglia, now an air safety consultant, said the FAA needs to prove that the 787 is safe now, and will need to do more than go over paperwork and data. If its review is to be more than a big PR exercise, he said, the agency’s technical staff must go inside the factories of Boeing and its suppliers to see what’s happening there. “We know some of what’s going on is a quality issue,” said Goglia. “They need to take a good look at the manufacturing process, including the inspections required.” “He said he’s had reports from inside Boeing that inspections are not adequate”. I can back that up I have seen inspectors for years not look at a single installation and at the end of the day rubber stamp the O and IR that they certified the job was inspected. When I made mention of this to my supervisor she tried to catch me doing something wrong, instead of checking out the inspector who did no work for years. She never discussed the lack of work by the coworker. The Boeing Q A supervisors do encourage inspectors to not look at the job when done or to let it slide by with all sorts of excuses, like it will be caught on C check by the customer. I always told my supervisor then you use your MRB stamp and buy the job, if not I am going to do my job. They sure did not like that idea and only once oked a job with a hole in the fuselage and that supervisor was transferred out of Renton to Auburn(JAW). . This FAA and NSTB review is a 100% PR and CYA deal. Nothing will be done The 787 has to pinto fireball out then the plane will be grounded if that happens sooner rather than later. I am not hoping for that but I worry about the flying public just like the 3 women in the Pinto got burnt up before Ford fixed the pinto gas tank situation.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358141469258</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 00:31:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358143990648-3</Id><Title>Powell: "GOP has 'a dark vein of intolerance'"</Title><Msg>While continuing to identify as a Republican, former Secretary of State Colin Powell on Sunday criticized the GOP for a series of racist attacks against President Barack Obama. (PHOTOS: Colin Powell over the years) "There's also a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party," Powell said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "What do I mean by that? What I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities." Powell, who endorsed Obama, pointed to a number of statements that were directed at Obama as evidence that there is still racism within the party. "When I see a former governor say that the president is 'shuckin' and jivin'.' That's a racial-era slave term," Powell said, referring to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin using the term to describe Obama's response to the attacks in Libya. Powell also pointed to former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who was an aggressive surrogate for Mitt Romney, for calling Obama "lazy" after the first debate during the campaign. "He didn't say he was slow, he was tired, he didn't do well; he said he was 'lazy,'" Powell said "Now, it may not mean anything to most Americans, but to those of us who are African Americans, the second word is "shiftless," and then there's a third word that goes along with it." Powell also eschewed the "birther movement." "The whole birther movement: Why do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the party?" Powell asked. "I think the party has to take a look at itself." Powell said overall the Republican Party has been moving to the right, creating problems for the GOP. "In recent years, there's been a significant shift to the right, and we have seen what that shift has produced: two losing presidential campaigns," Powell said. "I think what the Republican Party needs to do now is take a very hard look at itself and understand that the country has changed. The country is changing demographically. And if the Republican Party does not change along with that demographic, they're going to be in trouble." Powell said the Republican Party in addition to being the party of lower taxes, has become cast at the party of the rich. He said that Republicans need to take up education, immigration and climate change policy before the next election. "Everybody wants to talk about, 'Who's going to be the candidate?'" Powell said. "You've got to think first about what's the party actually going to represent? If it's just going to represent the far right wing of the political spectrum, I think the party is in difficulty. I'm a moderate, but I'm still a Republican."</Msg><Username>marxb0uncer</Username><Timestamp>1358143990648</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 01:13:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358144198367-4</Id><Topic><Title>Short BA with both hands at 75.16.</Title><Username>rbg5r</Username><Timestamp>1358127214126</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 20:33:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hear hear!!!</Msg><Username>shameless_commie</Username><Timestamp>1358144198367</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 01:16:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358145169553-5</Id><Topic><Title>Short BA with both hands at 75.16.</Title><Username>rbg5r</Username><Timestamp>1358127214126</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 20:33:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GOPigs excel at creating and maintaining paralysis. .</Msg><Username>marxb0uncer</Username><Timestamp>1358145169553</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 01:32:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358145426088-6</Id><Topic><Title>is it gun control so Obama can Run the guns to the Cartels? of course not, its Obama's attempt to</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1358106833331</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 14:53:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope the FBI is watching you.

The union has not authorized a strike, but has been conducting strike training and Goforth has said a strike appears likely. The U.S. government on Friday mandated a wide-ranging review of the design and manufacturing of Boeing's latest passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner, citing concern over a fire and other recent problems but insisting the plane was still safe to fly. Delaney, the Boeing executive, said the company has contingency plans in case the engineers go on strike during the review. "We are the Boeing Company and I have access to significant resources across the entire corporation," he said, noting an engineering team in California.

There is one organization that is considered to be so sacred in Washington D.C. that Obama will not dare utter a single negative word against it. That organization is the Federal Reserve. Even though he has shown that he is unafraid to pick a fight with just about everyone else in Washington, Obama flat out refuses to criticize the Fed and he even reappointed Ben Bernanke for another term as Fed Chairman even though Bernanke has a track record of failure that would make the Chicago Cubs look good. Perhaps Obama is aware of what has happened to other presidents that have chosen to tangle with the Fed. In any event, it has become clear that Obama submits to anything that the Fed says without question, and the controversy over the "trillion dollar coin" is another perfect example of this. For weeks, there has been much speculation in the mainstream media about the possibility that the Obama administration may print up a one trillion dollar coin that it would use to keep paying the bills of the federal government if an agreement to raise the debt ceiling is not reached. But on Saturday the Federal Reserve killed that idea, and we shouldn't be surprised by that because under no circumstances will the Fed ever accept a threat to their monopoly over money creation in the United States. If the Federal Reserve had allowed Obama to print up a debt-free trillion dollar coin, that would have set a very dangerous precedent for the Fed. The American people would have realized that the federal government can actually create debt-free money whenever it wants and that it does not actually have to borrow money from anyone. That is something that the Fed probably would have moved heaven and earth to keep from happening. But now we won't ever know how far the Fed would really be willing to go to keep their monopoly over money creation, because Obama has no plans to challenge this latest ruling from "the real boss" of our financial system</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358163534237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 06:38:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358163799869-13</Id><Topic><Title>A New Class of Boeing Employees</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1358103495994</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 13:58:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're on the "outside" and don't know jack.

He who understands it, earns it … he who doesn’t … pays it." When the Federal Reserve system was initially created back in 1913, the bankers that created it intended for it to be a perpetual debt machine that would extract massive amounts of wealth from the U.S. government (and ultimately from all of us) through the mechanism of compound interest. Each year, hundreds of billions of dollars of interest are transferred into the pockets of the wealthy bankers and foreign nations that own our debt. This is one of the reasons why I preach about the evils of government debt until I am blue in the face. The debt-based Federal Reserve system is a way to systematically steal the wealth of the United States, and it is happening right in front of our eyes, but very few people actually understand it well enough to complain about it. Unfortunately, we are rapidly getting to the point where we have accumulated so much debt that it is threatening to collapse our entire financial system. The following comes from a recent Zero Hedge article... By now most are aware of the various metrics exposing the unsustainability of US debt (which at 103% of GDP, it is well above the Reinhart-Rogoff "viability" threshold of 80%; and where a return to just 5% in blended interest means total debt/GDP would double in under a decade all else equal simply thanks to the "magic" of compounding), although there is one that captures perhaps best of all the sad predicament the US self-funding state (where debt is used to fund nearly half of total US spending) finds itself in. It comes from Zhang Monan, researcher at the China Macroeconomic Research Platform: "The US government is now trying to repay old debt by borrowing more; in 2010, average annual debt creation (including debt refinance) moved above $4 trillion, or almost one-quarter of GDP, compared to the pre-crisis average of 8.7% of GDP." This is a key statistic most forget when they discuss the stock and flow of US debt: because whereas the total US deficit, and thus net debt issuance, is about $1 trillion per year, one has to factor that there is between $3 and $4 trillion in maturities each year, which have to be offset by a matched amount of gross issuance just to keep the stock of debt flat (pre deficit funding). The assumption is that demand for this gross issuance will always exist as old maturities are rolled into new debt, however, this assumption is contingent on one very key variable: interest rates not rising. Do you understand what is being said there? Not only is our debt rising by more than a trillion dollars a year, we also need to roll over trillions of dollars of federal debt each year. If interest rates on that debt start rising, we are going to start feeling the pain very rapidly. As I have mentioned previously, the average rate of interest on U.S. government debt was 6.638 percent back in 2000. If we returned to that level today, we would be paying more than a trillion dollars a year just in interest on the national debt. The main thing keeping interest rates low right now is the fact that the U.S. dollar is the de facto reserve currency of the world. If that ends, interest rates on U.S. debt will skyrocket. The following is from a recent article by Chris Ferreira... The US Dollar is the reserve currency of the world. You need it to buy oil, a vital component of any economy. Since other countries like China cannot print US dollars at their leisure, they have to get it from somewhere. They get it from trade with the US. The US buys products in Asia and the rest of the world with US dollars, and in turn these same dollar surpluses are used to buy oil and US bonds, creating a much needed artificial demand for US dollars. This is also how the enormous US 558$ billion trade deficit in 2011 was financed. The US has been in a trade deficit since the 1980′s and it continues the grow as jobs and manufacturing are being lost to more competitive nations. The trade deficit also accounts for the national debt. The financing of the debt creates artificial demand for US bonds which helps lower the interest rate and coincidentally helps to raise the debt levels even higher.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358165096215</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 07:04:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358165123986-18</Id><Topic><Title>The Federal Reserve Shows Barack Obama Who The Real Boss Is</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358163534237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 06:38:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unfortunately, the rest of the world is starting to move away from the U.S. dollar.

Most Americans have absolutely no idea how very close we are to financial catastrophe.

But the only way those interest rates can remain low is for the U.S. dollar to remain absolutely dominant in international trade. Once the rest of the world rejects the U.S. dollar, the game is over. We are headed for total system meltdown, but neither major political party is going to do a thing about it.

The base was chosen because it was presumed to be beyond the reach of the U.S. courts. And when the prisoners were deliberately excluded from the protections of the Geneva Conventions, in a directive issued by George W. Bush on February 7, 2002, it became a genuinely evil experiment, devoted to torture and other forms of coercion, indefinite detention without charge or trial, and the extraction of false statements from the prisoners that were then dressed up as evidence to justify holding them. That was in spite of the fact that, for the most part, the prisoners knew nothing about al-Qaeda or international terrorism, and were sold to U.S. forces for bounty payments by their Afghan and Pakistani allies or seized as a result of inept U.S. intelligence. Many of the prisoners were living in Pakistan or visiting Pakistan, or were visiting Afghanistan as missionaries, humanitarian-aid workers, refugees, or economic migrants. Others were soldiers, recruited by clerics in their homelands to help the Pashtun Taliban fight an inter-Muslim civil war against Afghanistan’s Northern Alliance comprising the country’s other ethnic components — the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazara, who make up more than half the population. The men may have been sold a lie about the Taliban’s establishing a “pure Islamic state” in Afghanistan, but few of them had even met Osama bin Laden, and only a few dozen of the 779 could genuinely be alleged to have had any involvement with terrorism or to have traveled to Afghanistan to engage in any kind of conflict with the United States prior to the 9/11 attacks. Eleven years later, the prison’s continued existence demonstrates the profound failure of the U.S. establishment to deal with the crimes committed in the name of counterterrorism by the Bush administration. Although torture has largely been replaced by assassination as government policy — in the drone attacks that are such a hallmark of the Obama administration — the cancer of indefinite detention continues, at Guantánamo, to eat away at America’s belief in justice and fairness. One hundred sixty-six men of the 779 held in total since the prison opened are still held, and it is shocking that 86 of them were cleared for release — or otherwise told that the U.S. government did not want to continue holding them without charge or trial for the rest of their lives — at least three years ago, after an interagency Guantanamo Review Task Force, established by Barack Obama, issued a report after a year spent reviewing all the prisoners’ cases. In around half the cases, the men had previously been cleared for release, between 2004 and 2007, by military review boards established by the Bush administration. In two-thirds of the cases, the prisoners are still held because they are Yemenis, and Obama imposed a ban on the release of any cleared Yemenis from Guantánamo after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian man recruited in Yemen, tried and failed to blow up a U.S.-bound plane on Christmas Day 2009. The rest are held largely because of onerous restrictions imposed by Congress, where lawmakers have passed legislation designed to prevent any prisoners from being released, for the most part as a cynical political maneuver. On the 11th anniversary, I call on the president to fulfill the promise to close Guantánamo that he made when he took office in January 2009. The Yemenis, held on the basis of “guilt by nationality,” must be freed, and negotiations must take place between the administration and Congress regarding the passages in the National Defense Authorization Act that prevent the release of prisoners, requiring the secretary of defense to make promises about the men’s future conduct that are impossible to make — namely, that they will not, under any circumstances, be able to pose a threat to the U.S. or its interests. Last Wednesday, when Obama signed the latest National Defense Authorization Act, a $633 billion monster that will fund America’s bloated military-industrial complex for another year, he included a signing statement in which he criticized Congress, noting, “I continue to believe that operating the facility weakens our national security by wasting resources, damaging our relationships with key allies, and strengthening our enemies.” Although he had threatened to veto the bill, as he had threatened last year, he failed to do so in the end, stating from his vacation in Honolulu that he signed the bill into law because of “the need to renew critical defense authorities,” for which “funding was too great to ignore.” He did, however, give notice to Congress that he was not necessarily prepared to accept the restrictions if they violated what he regards as the acceptable reach of presidential power. Specifically, he stated, “My administration will interpret these provisions as consistent with existing and future determinations by the agencies of the executive responsible for detainee transfers. In the event that these statutory restrictions operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles, my administration will implement them in a manner that avoids the constitutional conflict.” In other correspondence in the run-up to the signing, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta wrote to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon on December 11 to argue for “relief from the restrictions” by “highlighting the financial costs” of Guantánamo, where 1,700 troops and civilians work, and where, as the Miami Herald explained, “the Pentagon imports everything from food to fuel for electricity to entertainment for both captives and captors.” It costs around $800,000 a year to hold a prisoner at Guantánamo — meaning that it costs nearly $70 million a year to hold the cleared prisoners alone — whereas the cost of one year’s confinement in a federal maximum security prison is just less than $35,000 a year — in other words, less than 5 percent of the cost per prisoner at Guantánamo. Panetta also noted, “These sections would preclude moving even convicted war criminals serving life sentences to secure facilities in the United States that would also be economically efficient.” The reference, at present, applies to only one prisoner, Ali al-Bahlul, convicted of producing videos for al-Qaeda in a trial by military commission in 2008 at which he was given a life sentence after refusing to mount a defense. Primarily, however, as the Miami Herald explained, Obama took exception to a passage that “forbids the use of federal funds to transfer Guantánamo detainees to U.S. soil for any reason, including a federal criminal trial,” and another that “maintains restrictions on executive branch authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country.” As the article noted, those restrictions “have all but frozen transfers from the base. Only those detainees who die in custody or who get court release orders can leave without a Defense Department waiver and certification to Congress.” With the legitimacy of the military commissions under threat after a conservative judge in the D.C. Circuit Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, quashed the 2008 conviction of Salim Hamdan, a driver for Osama bin Laden, for providing material support to terrorism, because, as he correctly noted, it was not a crime at the time of the supposed offense, the administration may be looking for a way to revive federal court trials for Guantánamo prisoners. Although terror suspects in general are prosecuted in federal court, where material support is a recognized offense, only one Guantánamo prisoner, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian peripherally involved in the 1998 African embassy bombings, made it to the mainland for a federal court trial before the congressional shutters came down. The administration’s intention to prosecute Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other men in federal court in New York, which was announced in November 2009, was abandoned in a humiliating climbdown by Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, when significant opposition was mounted and they caved in to the criticism. Perhaps hinting that officials wanted to look once more at federal court trials, Obama stated that the proposal for federal court trials “substitutes the Congress’s blanket political determination for careful and fact-based determinations, made by counterterrorism and law-enforcement professionals, of when and where to prosecute Guantánamo detainees.” Reiterating his concerns that his power as the president was being unduly impeded, he added, “Removing that tool from the executive branch undermines our national security. Moreover, this provision would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.” While the tug-of-war between Congress and the executive branch continues, there can be no justice for the remaining prisoners in Guantanamo — neither the 86 men cleared but still held, nor the 30 or so scheduled to face trials. For the sake of justice, a solution must be found that can lead to the release of the cleared prisoners, and fair trials, sooner rather than later, for the other men. Moreover, a solution must be found for 46 others, who were recommended for indefinite detention without charge or trial by Obama’s Task Force, on the basis that they were too dangerous to release, but that insufficient evidence exists to put them on trial. That is deeply shocking, but it is also typical of the problems, as it implies a state of danger where none can be proved. Everyone involved in this profoundly shameful story, in the executive branch and Congress, should stop treating Guantánamo as though it is some sort of challenging law-enforcement matter. It is a legal, moral, and ethical abomination, its rationale built on arrogance and vengeance, and sustained through torture and lies. Those who are alleged to constitute a threat should be tried, and everyone else should be released, unless the U.S. government can find the courage to declare that some of them are prisoners of war, as defined by the Geneva Conventions, who can legitimately be held unmolested until the end of hostilities. However, that would require the administration and lawmakers to accept legal challenges regarding the duration of the “war on terror,” which, it seems, they do not want, preferring to continue to shirk their responsibilities for defining what kind of war America is supposed to be involved in, and maintaining an ill-defined global war indefinitely. The men at Guantánamo are victims of this bogus war, as are the 50 or so non-Afghan prisoners at Bagram in Afghanistan, whose release was prevented by Congress for the first time in this year’s NDAA, even though some of them have been held for more than ten years without even the limited rights of the Guantánamo prisoners. That the lives of these prisoners should be sacrificed for endless war through a policy of indefinite detention ought to be a source of undying shame for all Americans. It is time, once more, to demand the closure of Guantánamo, but this time not to give up if elected officials try to silence us with indifference.

Boeing has told me that this review does not affect the production, assembly and delivery of the 787s nor does it ground the 787s currently in service. Boeing did conduct a ferry flight of one 787 to Charleston after being painted in Ft. Worth and had planned to do a first flight of another 787 today (put off to tomorrow probably). Thus Boeing continues with operations as usual and the operators continue to fly the aircraft. today ANA did initiate service between San Jose and Tokyo using the 787. However, this action will delay the efforts of Boeing to certify the aircraft for ETOPS 330. Possible results from the review can include: 1) redesign of components 2) changes in manufacturing processes and improved quality control 3) nothing The last option is unlikely to happen and it is all but certain that there will changes coming. The question is what are the nature of the changes and what affect will it have on production and delivery as well as the program's bottom line which is already in the red? Both Boeing, the DOT and the FAA went to great pains to reiterate during the announcement today that the aircraft is safe and reliable but observers do question that assessment given that the FAA is conducting the review in light of the electrical issues and the battery fire that the in service 787s have experienced to date. I do believe that at the end of the day there will be changes that could add to the cost of production of the 787 and may add delays to the planned ramp up to 10/month. There is no timetable for the conclusion of the review and Michael Huerta did say that the length and any changes that the FAA will require will be dependent on the data that the agency collects and analyzes from Boeing and the suppliers. A source told me that he feel that the investigation will either validate the design or find issues which they will fix and he welcomes the investigation. It is a serious enough issue to look into but he also thinks that the FAA won't find anything that won't require anything more than tweaks or adjustments to quality control and should not be a show stopper. He isn't losing sleep over the investigation. In the meantime the battery fire on ZA183 and the fuel leak on her sister ship the following day has generated such a media frenzy that new outlets are now reporting on issues such as cracked windshields,and oil leaks. These are issues that occur on airplanes all over the world and are more of a nuisance than a public safety issue. The media jumped on every little squawk that occurred since the fire. My feelings is that the media has decided to make newsworthy, simple issues that occur everyday on airplanes around the world simply because they were bored and needed to sell papers. There is simply no need to to repot a cracked wind shield or a simple oil leak for any other reason except to jump on the bandwagon with those how are shrilling that the 787 is an unsafe airplane when in reality it is not. At the end of the day the FAA will make recommendations for manufacturing, quality control, and/or design tweaks to make the electrical system safer and more reliable.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1358189526671</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 13:52:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358189960022-71</Id><Title>How much longer can BA hide the real truth about the 787?</Title><Msg>Because its getting harder and harder to mask all these multiplying breakdowns regarding the safety and faulty operation of the Dreamliner. Less than a week after 30 gallons of fuel spilled from one of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner onto the Logan International Airport tarmac, Japan Air Lines (JAL) reportedly says it has discovered another fuel leak on the same aircraft. The L.A. Times reports while under inspection at Narita International Airport near Tokyo, fuel began to leak from a nozzle on the grounded plane's left wing – the same plane involved in the fuel leak in Boston. Days before, a battery fire broke out in the belly of another Dreamliner plane parked at Logan. JAL also has reported cracks in a cockpit window of one of the airliners. The separate incidents have sparked a safety review of the Boeing 787 by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Financial Times reported Friday. Bottom line - 787 is no longer safe to fly on short flights or long flights. Its unstable, extremely untested and in non-compliance with FAA standards. Look for FAA to take major action later this week due to agency concerns and public out cry for aircraft safety inspection from nose to tail.</Msg><Username>wise4us</Username><Timestamp>1358189960022</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 13:59:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358190502368-72</Id><Topic><Title>From the NYC787 blog</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1358189526671</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 13:52:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hogwash The 787 is headed back to the shop for major overhaul due to multiple fuel leaks along with a long line of serious safety concerns.

Following is a list of the events: 2012 July - A General Electric Co engine on a 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina, breaks during a preflight test. The National Transportation Safety Board rules it a "contained" failure, meaning the broken pieces did not exit through the engine wall. GE orders inspections of the engines. The Federal Aviation Administration stops short of grounding planes for inspections. December 4 - A United Airlines 787 with 184 people aboard is forced to make an emergency landing in New Orleans after experiencing electrical problems. December 5 - U.S. regulators say there is a manufacturing fault in 787 fuel lines and advises operators to make extra inspections to guard against engine failures. December 13 - Qatar Airways grounds one of its three 787s after finding the same electrical problem that affected the December 4 United flight. December 17 - United confirms finding an electrical problem in a second plane in its 787 fleet. 2013 January 7 - A parked 787 operated by Japan Airlines catches fire at Boston Logan International Airport after a battery in an auxiliary power system explodes. January 8 - A second 787 operated by Japan Airlines leaks fuel at Logan, forcing it to cancel its takeoff and return to the gate. The plane departs later. Following a safety inspection, United finds a wiring problem in the same electrical system that caused the January 7 fire in Boston, the Wall Street Journal reports. January 9 - Japan's All Nippon Airways Co cancels a 787 flight scheduled for a domestic trip within Japan due to brake problems. January 11 - A cockpit window on an ANA 787 cracks during a Japanese domestic flight. The plane lands safely with no injuries. A separate ANA 787 springs an oil leak from its left engine, which is discovered after the plane lands safely. The U.S. Department of Transportation says the 787 will undergo a comprehensive review of its critical systems. January 13 - The Japan Airlines 787 that leaked fuel in Boston on January 8 experiences another, separate fuel leak while undergoing checks in Tokyo.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358197582498</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 16:06:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358197602017-95</Id><Topic><Title>I May Have 8 Chillun by 7 different men but I Ain't no Brood Mare</Title><Username>biggovmomma</Username><Timestamp>1358181280734</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 11:34:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YOU know what yo are.

The Japanese yen will no longer support the dollar and will compete with the US dollar for exports. In 2009 the American congress held hearings to expose Toyota's safety hazards. Clearly, Toyota was hurt by this. The Boeing 787, America's dream export plane, could be hurt by Japan's reports of safety risks. Could the BA 787 be a bargaining tool for Japan to even the score for Toyota and get better trade agreements from the US? Really folks, I'm no genius, but I keep asking myself: "Why would Boeing spend 10 years designing and creating a luxury aircraft only to have it turn out to be a dud? My take: the worries over the BA 787's safety will soon disappear, and it will be business as usual with Japan and the US. I look forward to flying to Japan in the Boeing 787!</Msg><Username>maramwp</Username><Timestamp>1358211896147</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 20:04:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358212498959-115</Id><Topic><Title>I may jist take over this here Board</Title><Username>biggovmomma</Username><Timestamp>1358210374658</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 19:39:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now hold on there a minute Aunt Jemima...There are some real American folk with smarts that post up in here.

McNerney and his cockeyed manufacturing plan has destroyed the reputation of this once great and respected company. I don't care what anyone says - not the rubber stamping FAA, not that phony transportation secretary, and not any of you fools who can't wait to get on board, fuel leaks and electrical problems are a dangerous mix. Broken window on a three week old plane ??? Generators mal-functioning after three weeks service ???? -----there are six generators on every 787 !!!! I certainly wish no one any harm, but this "nightmare liner" is looking pretty scary. Why weren't these problems discovered during the thousands of hours of test flights. I suspect right about now McNerney wishes he never heard the word "outsourcing". In an effort to sidestep American engineers and technicians and their relatively high wages (relative to Chinese and Vietnamese peasants wages), the design and manufacturing of the 787 was sourced to the lowest bidders in third world countries 15 years out of the stone age. That might work for cheap trinkets and transistor radios but for 200 foot long cylinders traveling at 30000 ft.and 500mph for 15 hours on end, experience is simply irreplaceable. McNerney is an mba, not an engineer. That explains everything. I hope very much to fly on a 787 some day, but it won't be anytime soon !!! Good luck to all Boeing investors and especially all booked 787 passengers. PS.....Please don't associate me with that fruitcake 'waynedickenson' poster on this board.

Still no school surveillance footage released</Title><Msg>Sandy Hook AR-15 hoax? Still no school surveillance footage released Mike Adams Natural News Jan 14, 2013 Here at Natural News, we have a reputation for asking intelligent questions about things that don’t add up. There are a lot of mysteries out there, and they deserve to be explored and questioned: Why is there still mercury in vaccines? Why did the WTC 7 building implode and fall when no airplane hit it? If the government can create money from nothing, why are we still paying taxes? And today, I’m adding to that list this commonsense question: Why has no surveillance footage been released from the Sandy Hook shooting, showing Adam Lanza blasting away with an AR-15? Here’s why the non-release of this video footage is so interesting: Every time a school shooting takes place, one of the very first things that gets released to the media is the school surveillance footage depicting the gun and the shooter. The purpose of this is to associate the pain and anguish of the massacre to the image of a scary-looking rifle. In mere days after the Columbine shooting in 1998, for example, the media received footage from the massacre and began playing it over and over again, hammering home the images of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold with their guns. The same is true with numerous other school shootings as you’ll see below. But with the Sandy Hook school shooting, no video footage has been released. A reasonable person has to ask the question: WHY? You see, the release of footage of Adam Lanza murdering children with an AR-15 — if such a thing even happened — would strongly support the mainstream media’s call for banning so-called “assault rifles.” It would also: • Amp up the emotional impact of the fear mongering being carried out by the media. • Provide visual support for the gun-grabber’s plea to ban all rifles. • Provide a wealth of images to be used by newspapers and magazines to further demonize the image of rifles. … and yet, for some reason, we see no surveillance footage from Sandy Hook. Why is that? Answer: The AR-15 appears to have been left in his car and never even used in the shooting The real answer to all this — and this reveals the “Big Lie” of the mainstream media — is that the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle was left in Lanza’s car. It was never brought into the school in the first place. As a result, it was not used in the shooting. This was openly admitted in an NBC news report that has since been scrubbed and marginalized. But NaturalNews captured the video and posted it on our own private video network which is immune from censorship: Click here to watch the NBC News video yourself. Here’s a partial transcript of the video: Matt Lauer: Pete Williams, our chief justice correspondent, has got some new information as well, good morning. Pete Williams: Matt, good morning to you. This continues to be a very complex investigation, and there is a lot of contradictory information out there, but there is some new information this morning from a couple of federal officials and state officials. They say now that there were actually four handguns recovered inside the school. Not just two as we were initially told. Four handguns and apparently only handguns that were taken into the school. We knew that Adam Lanza… also had an assault-style, AR-15 style rifle that he had taken to the school that was in the car he drove there, his mother’s car. But we’ve been told by several officials that he left that in the car. Adam Lanza left the AR-15 in the car This simple fact, which was confirmed by “federal officials and state officials” has been completely scrubbed out of the mainstream media, and replaced with the “assault weapon lone gunman” theory that just happens to fit nicely with the citizen disarmament agenda being pushed by anti-American traitors like Dianne Feinstein and Joe Biden.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358215915255</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 21:11:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358215948867-136</Id><Topic><Title>M.

Steve Stockman threatened Monday afternoon that he would file articles of impeachment against President Barack Obama if he institutes gun control measures with an executive order. Stockman warned that such executive orders would be “unconstitutional” and “infringe on our constitutionally-protected right to keep and bear arms.” (RELATED: Levin: If Obama sidesteps Congress on debt ceiling, ‘no choice’ but impeachment) “I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including but not limited to eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even filing articles of impeachment,” Stockman said in a statement. At his press conference Monday, Obama floated the possibility of using executive action to enact policies aimed at reducing gun violence. The freshman congressman, who served one term in Congress in the mid-1990s, further labeled the possibility “an existential threat to this nation” because, he said, the purpose of the Second Amendment is to allow the people to protect themselves from tyranny. (RELATED VIDEO — Walter Williams: People misunderstand the point of the Second Amendment) “Any proposal to abuse executive power and infringe upon gun rights must be repelled with the stiffest legislative force possible,” he added. “Under no circumstances whatsoever may the government take any action that disarms any peaceable person — much less without due process through an executive declaration without a vote of Congress or a ruling of a court.” He concluded by claiming that an executive order would be not just “not just an attack on the Constitution,” but also an “attack on Americans.” “If the president is allowed to suspend constitutional rights on his own personal whims, our free republic has effectively ceased to exist,” he said.
