Al Jazeera will pay about $500 million for Current TV, including the stake held by Gore, 64, according to two people with knowledge of the deal. The network is one of dozens of investments made by the former vice president since he lost the 2000 presidential race by a slim margin. “It’s reeking with irony,” said Jeff Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management, who studies corporate governance. “It seems to be at least a paradox in terms of his positions on sustainability and geopolitics.” -------------------------------------------------- Nobel Prize "Environmentalist" Al Gore accepted $70M of Middle East oil money and then pushed the deal through before 2013 so he wouldn't have to pay "his fair share" of taxes.</Msg><Username>wannabe_mbfield</Username><Timestamp>1357279861128</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 01:11:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357283128553-3</Id><Topic><Title>"Environmentalist" Al Gore $trike$ Oil</Title><Username>wannabe_mbfield</Username><Timestamp>1357279861128</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 01:11:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow I'm surprised, seems like the Dirt Bags taking a page straight out of the Bush Doctrine.

Our proggie friends will almost always resort to emotional arguments based on little or no actual facts at all. You really need not look any further than the tax argument we’re going through right now. First, from the Red Corner … the facts. Second, from the Blue Corner, the emotion. Red Corner: The top 1% of income earners, those who earn more than $385,000 a year, earn about 17% of all personal income, but they pay more than 35% of all personal income taxes. Blue Corner: This just isn’t fair! The rich aren’t paying their fair share. They need to pay their fair share. We need to raise their taxes so they will be paying their fair share. No facts … actually the facts are studiously ignored … just emotion. We need to be fair. Now let’s get to the Proggie Princess, the hollow-eyed hippie from Haight-Ashbury, Nancy Pelosi. She is unhappy that the evil conservative Republicans don’t want to spend endless and unlimited amounts of money expanding the federal government. Here’s her most recent statement on NPR: "There are many members in the Republican caucus who do not believe in government. And bless their hearts, they act upon their beliefs.” “So day to day, we vote here on issues that eliminate government initiatives for clean air, clean water, food safety, public safety, public education, public transportation, public housing, public health, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.” “They don't believe in a public role, and if you don't believe in a public role, then why do you even have to have taxes to pay for it? ... They're anti-government ideologues, and that's what the speaker has to deal with." Now Pelosi makes these areguments on NPR because she knows there’s nobody there in that studio with either the brains nor the inclination to voice a disagreement with her idiotic utterances. In short, it’s all Bolshoi. Considering how much of a role the GOP has played in growing the size of government, I find it hard to believe that any member of Congress is truly anti-government. This is why it is so difficult to carry on a reasonable conversation with so many liberals. They immediately come to the shocking realization that they don’t have the facts to back up their argument, or that the facts are actually not on their side, so they resort to these mindless emotional arguments such as “Republicans don’t believe in government.” If someone suggests that a 50% growth in food stamp recipients over Obama’s first term is a bit much, the libs will scream that you want people to starve to death. If you suggest that once a company has spent $300 million dollars to remove 98% of the pollutants from it’s industrial emissions, that it might be a bit absurd to require them to spend another $400 million to remove another ,08%, the libs will scream that you don’t believe people should be able to breathe clean air. If someone suggests that once a municipality has spent $750 million dollars to make it’s waste water discharges 98.5% pure, It would be an abuse of property owners and water users to double their tax and water bills to make the water 99.5% pure – purer than the water over Yosemite Falls – the proggies will scream that you don’t believe people should have clean water. If you suggest that the private sector can do a better job of delivering health care to the people than the government can, and that regulations that get in the way of the private sector in this regard should be looked at and revised, the libs will start screaming that you don’t believe people should get medical care … they should just get sick and die. Really! How do you carry on a conversation with these people? How in the world can you tell them that the competitive free market might actually do a better job of delivering medical services than a government politically-run bureaucracy when all they do in return is start screaming at you that you just want people to get sick and die? Small-minded liberals are incapable of wrapping their brains around the idea that “limited government” is not the same as “no government.” Even staunch Libertarians such as myself recognize a role for government – a limited role for government and a larger role for individual freedom. Government has a role but it is not your sole provider and it does not exist to merely dictate your behavior. The re-election of Barack Obama only reinforced what I’ve been telling you for years: Democrats are making the most of our pathetic government education system, which has programmed generations of young minds to believe that government is the be-all-end-all. It is these people who will buy Pelosi’s “anti-government” BS hook-line-and-sinker … with some help from the Media Party, of course.

So in the mind of someone who believes this, why would you NOT want more of something great? Hence the massive growth of government that has continued under Dear Ruler. As government grows, you can only assume that it will become more of a burden in your life. American individuals and businesses spend an astounding $1.75 trillion every year on complying with federal regulations. Imagine what impact that kind of money could have in the private marketplace. Consider the growth of these regulations just under Dear Ruler and his love of America’s (government) greatness … Between January 2008 and January 2011, for example, there was a marked growth in the amount of regulation in America — the pace being almost 40% more than the annual rate of increase between 1992 and 2008. Similarly, between 2008 and 2011 the number of people working in federal government regulatory agencies rose by 16% — a total of more than 276,000 people — at a time when private-sector employment was falling. That paints a pretty accurate picture of what is happening in America, doesn’t it?

Because familiarity breeds banality, Greece has become a boring horror. Japan, however, in its second generation of stagnation is fascinating. Once, Japan bestrode the world, jauntily buying Rockefeller Center and Pebble Beach. Now Japanese buy more adult diapers than those for infants. America has its lowest birth rate since at least 1920 — family formation and workforce participation (which hit a 30-year low last year) have declined in tandem. But it has an energy surplus, the government-produced overhang of housing inventory is shrinking and the average age of Americans’ cars is an astonishing 10.8 years. Such promising economic indicators, however, mask the country’s democratic decadence, as explained by the Hudson Institute’s Christopher DeMuth in the Dec. 24 Weekly Standard: Deficit spending once was largely for investments — building infrastructure, winning wars — which benefited future generations, so government borrowing appropriately shared the burden with those generations. Now, however, continuous borrowing burdens future generations in order to finance current consumption. Today’s policy, says DeMuth, erases “the distinction between investing for the future and borrowing from the future.” It is now as clear as it is unsurprising that most Americans will be spared the educational experience of “fiscal cliff”-related tax increases and spending cuts, which would have been a small but instructive taste of the real costs of the entitlement state. Still, December’s maneuverings taught three lessons. First, there will be no significant spending restraint. Democrats — you know: the people respectful of evidence and science — even rejected a more accurate measurement of the cost of living that would slightly slow increases in myriad government benefits. Accuracy will be sacrificed to liberalism’s agenda of government growth. Second, Barack Obama has (as Winston Churchill said of an adversary) “the gift of compressing the largest amount of words into the smallest amount of thought.” His incessant talking swaddles one wee idea — raising taxes on “millionaires and billionaires,” including people earning less than half a million. He has nothing pertinent to say about the steadily worsening fiscal imbalance that will make sluggish growth — less than 3 percent — normal. Third, one December winner was George W. Bush because a large majority of Democrats favored making permanent a large majority of his tax cuts. December’s rancor disguised bipartisan agreement: Both parties flinch from cliff-related tax increases and spending decreases. But neither the increases nor decreases would have tamed the current $1 trillion-plus budget deficit nor made a discernible dent in the 87-times-larger unfunded liabilities of the entitlement state. This state cannot be funded by taxing “the rich.” Or even by higher income taxes on the middle class. Income taxes cannot fund the government liberals want, and they dare not seek the consumption and energy taxes their entitlement architecture requires. Hence, although Republicans are complicit, Democrats are ardent in embracing decadent democracy. This consists not just of infantilism — refusing to will the means for the ends one has willed — but also of willing an immoral means: conscripting the wealth of future generations. As economists Glenn Hubbard and Tim Kane explain in National Affairs quarterly, the U.S. political system “cannot govern the entitlement state” that “exists largely to provide material benefits to individuals.” Piling up unsustainable entitlement promises — particularly, enactment of Medicare in 1965 and the enrichment of Social Security benefits in 1972 — has been improvident for the nation but rational for the political class. The promised expenditures, far in excess of revenue, would come due “beyond the horizon of political consequences.” “Our politicians,” say Hubbard and Kane, “are acting rationally” but “politically rational behavior is now fiscally perverse.” Both parties are responding to powerful electoral incentives to neither raise taxes nor cut spending. Hence, “the clash over raising the debt limit that gripped Washington during the summer of 2011 was just the beginning, not the end, of our fiscal woes.” But the perils of the entitlement state are no longer (in Hubbard’s and Kane’s words) “safely beyond the politicians’ career horizons.” Furthermore, a critical mass of Republicans reject the careerists’ understanding of “politically rational” behavior. These Republicans have a different rationale for being in politics. The media, which often are the last to know things because their wishes father their thoughts, say the tea party impulse is exhausted. Scores of House Republicans and seven first-term Republican senators (Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Pat Toomey, Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, Marco Rubio and Tim Scott) will soon — hello, debt ceiling — prove otherwise.

If you've been following the news you're certainly aware of the mass starvation and the huge number of people dying due to exposure to the elements in Texas, Florida, and the other states lacking a state income tax. Or maybe not. Liberals are constantly telling us we need larger government to take care of the disadvantaged in our society. Yet even in states with small, less expansive governments, people are not starving due to lack of food or dying because they have no place to live. We know that if people in Texas were starving or dying needlessly due to a lack of government funds, the mainstream media would be covering it 24/7; but instead the media just complains about the number of people who aren't insured or other non-direct measures of wellbeing. Texas and the other small government states are proof of what we learned when Republicans reformed welfare under Bill Clinton; if people can get a free ride by having the government steal from their neighbors, they will accept the government money and get by without the bother of work; if people can't get a free ride via inter-citizen theft, then people will work to keep themselves from misery.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1357312869557</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:21:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357313098894-29</Id><Topic><Title>Chris Christie Ruthlessly Takes Down John Boehner Over Sandy Aid</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1357155442398</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:37:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny you left NJ off the list....how come?

"They’ve got to find, in the House, a totally new strategy,” he said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “Everybody’s now talking about, ‘Oh, here comes the debt ceiling.’ I think that’s, frankly, a dead loser. Because in the end, you know it’s gonna happen. The whole national financial system is going to come in to Washington and on television, and say: ‘Oh my God, this will be a gigantic heart attack, the entire economy of the world will collapse. You guys will be held responsible.’ And they’ll cave." "He can't keep thinking the way he's thought the last few months without having a disaster on his hands," said Gingrich of House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Gingrich's comments underscore the division among Republicans over whether to use the necessary debt ceiling increase to extract spending cuts not included in the deal resolving the so-called "fiscal cliff." Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Wednesday that Republicans should be willing to risk a government shutdown in exchange for a routine increase needed to pay the country's existing bills.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357317839795</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 11:43:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357318027797-48</Id><Topic><Title>Fiscal Cliff is a Scam !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354121772845</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 11:56:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stickman.

I have to ask because it doesn't seem to matter who is president as the USA always ends up on top and remains the only super power. For example, remember all the #$%$ that were frightened by peak oil and predicted that the falling dollar would be the end of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency and how that would bring the USA down? Now we discover that the USA has 300 years of oil/gas energy in the ground with far more oil and gas reserves than all the Arab countries ever had or will ever have combined. Do you think it was God who gave us the know how to extract these resources in an inexpensive manner? Was it God that blessed the USA with so much oil and gas that we now actually CAN drill our way to energy independence. Was it God that made people who thought that drill baby drill was a crazy fantasy, now look like imbeciles? In 2012 the USA had also perfected the technology to capture Methane Clathrates too, which will allow the US to access a brand new source of energy containing the equivalent of 1,000+ more years of energy if needed (it won't be needed though). Do you think that was God's doing? We are also able to produce more food than anyone and our GM crops have given us the ability to get yields of 300 bushels of corn per acre for example and the ability to gain high yields even in drought years. Did God do that too? I confess that I can't answer my own question but I thought I'd give you a shot.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1357329539128</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:58:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357330064989-69</Id><Topic><Title>Our decadent democracy</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1357312484166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:14:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking of decadence, school children are fatter than ever.

They have a scientific report providing evidence that farcking can be done safely which would give the USA the ability to safely produce domestic energy and the Governor, Andrew Cuomo tries to hide the report from the public? What the hell kind of public servant is that? His actions hurt the economy and prevent the growth of great paying jobs and economic growth while keeping the USA dependent on Arab oil and gas. Thank God for whistleblowers and leakers. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Today the New York Times reports that Andrew Cuomo has been sitting on a state Health Department assessment that concluded months ago that fracking to produce natural gas is safe. The report was leaked to the Times by someone inside the state bureaucracy who is likely outraged by the governor’s political cowardice over the matter. The Times’ language is revealing: The state’s Health Department found in an analysis it prepared early last year that the much-debated drilling technology known as hydrofracking could be conducted safely in New York, according to a copy obtained by The New York Times from an expert who did not believe it should be kept secret. The analysis and other health assessments have been closely guarded by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his administration [meaning Cuomo has suppressed the report because of its inconvenient truth] as the governor weighs whether to approve fracking. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has long delayed making a decision, unnerved in part by strident opposition on his party’s left. A plan to allow a limited amount of fracking in the state’s Southern Tier along the Pennsylvania border is still seen as the most likely outcome, should the drilling process receive final approval.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1357334382476</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 16:19:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357334412626-82</Id><Topic><Title>Karma can bite you in the buns</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1357333466522</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 16:04:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This was not meant for you david_aames, this was humor for intelligent people.

They are paving new parking lots for add'l employees they plan to hire and doing work at the local airport to house more planes. Roughly they plan to increase production from 32 planes to I think approx 45 planes in the next couple of years and clearly Boeing's issue is not orders but how can we produce more to realize the revenue and get these fuel efficient planes in the hands of our customers. I am also very familar with the Everett facility and they are very focused on increasing production of the dreamliner. Again the issue is not orders(as they have 10 years worth with the current backlog) but it is producing as many as they can to fulfill the demand of these fuel efficient airplanes. I see the growth first hand daily as I drive by Boeing and when a companies main issues are we have high demand for the products and not enough supply that is a great problem to have. I see Boeing as the leader in aviation for many years to come and just to fulfill all orders on the books will keep the commercial aviation group busy for 10 plus years. Plus never forget the nice dividend Boeing pays as you hold there stock. Win all around. Invest in what you see and I see Boeing expanding in my backyard.

I wish I could have done more in life like be a biologist or a palentologist but it never happened the way I wanted it too. Instead I ended up being one of the millions of middle class.

You conveniently left off, "If a man will not work, he shall not eat" (2 Thessalonians 3:10) - which applies no matter what is your economic station in life, rich or poor. Also, "Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver." (2 Corinthians 9:7).

Christie could do the American people a great service by becoming a spokesperson for Weight Watchers, Nutrisystem, or Medifast, and losing the weight and encouraging other Americans to lose weight with him.
