This must be the change we can all believe in - "HOWARD DEAN: The only problem is -- and this is initially going to seem like heresy from a progressive is -- the truth is everybody needs to pay more taxes, not just the rich. And it's a good start. But we're not going to get out of this deficit problem unless we raise taxes across the board, to go back to what Bill Clinton had and his taxes. And if we don't do that, the problem is the pressure is going to be on spending even more."</Msg><Username>panthers_108</Username><Timestamp>1355202024385</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 00:00:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355202406256-2</Id><Topic><Title>A Message To My Fellow Obama Supporters</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1355176145956</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 16:49:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simply stated, the certificate he released should never have had multiple layers if it had been scanned using a computer and converted to .pdf format, unless it had been altered, which it had been altered.

The Act was passed during Clinton, but the libs put teeth in the act forcing banks to make bad loans. Bush brought us out of a bad recession coupled with the 9-11 terrorist attack designed to destroy our economy. How did he do it?...with an $800 billion dollar stimulus bill like Obama supported?

As with the 777 a 100% SPEEA designed and IAM assembled plane if allowed the 787 would have been built on time and on budget at 5 billion dollars . But Boeing Executives under the rule of MD went with the same busniess plan that bankrupted MD"In Hart-Smith's analysis, the seeds of Boeing's outsourcing ideas grew out of the McDonnell aircraft business, which focused on military-airplane programs. On the military side of the business, the U.S. government was the major, often the only, customer and it funded development costs in full. "The military approach didn't require you to risk your own money," Hart-Smith said. "That was the McDonnell Douglas mentality." He blamed that attitude for the major outsourcing on the MD-95 and proposed MD-12 programs, the failure of which led to the decline of Douglas' commercial-airplane business in California. The same ideas were transferred to Boeing with the McDonnell Douglas merger and led directly to the 787 outsourcing strategy, he said. Taken to its extreme conclusion, Hart-Smith said mockingly, the strategy of maximizing return on net assets could lead Boeing to outsource everything except a little Boeing decal to slap on the nose of the finished airplane. Though most of the profits would be outsourced to suppliers along with all the work, and all the company's expertise would wither away phantom field, the nonsense that comes from your user comment is guided by your egregious lack of knowledge in the sphere of true learnedness about Boeing or union activities , not to mention engineering, Boeing and MD.

It needs to be set straight. phantomfield used a article by a analyst , Strauss to claim that Boeing wages were the cause of the 787 program being excessivley costly to build. the only correct item in phantomfield report is the costs, which he does not mention, the Boeing 787 program is 3 years late and over 30 billion so far in exessive costs.. So that alone should tell any reader that the Boeing workforce did not cause that kind of cost over run, it they could they would all be retired and multimillionaires now. So lets read on about the article that Strauss was quoted and make some sense out of phantomfield's planted statment, if you read the entire article then you get to the truth. . "Mr. Strauss estimated that Boeing was recently spending $232 million to build each plane but charged customers, on average, only about half that." Given Wall Street’s concerns, Boeing’s stock has been in limbo for more than three years, trading in a narrow range , der! Boeing has acknowledged that it outsourced too much of the( engineering) work on the plane to suppliers who were willing, collectively, to cover billions of dollars of the development costs. Many parts needed reworking.( IAM) That and other design changes forced the company engineers , after the contractors screwed it up, and had to be redone by the Boeing engineers, located in Everett. next the IAM assemblers had to fix and work with the engineers ., to handle the rework of faulty parts, designed and built by the outsourced companies, and do complete reworkon the first 65 jets. ..."to fix the outsourcing mistakes made by Boeing Executives" . Finally , Boeing was warned about using the MD business plan and ignored the MD bankruptcy business plan,( DC-10 it is not a failure of Boeing workers, it is a failure of contractor workers). And the cause of the cost and late to the market is outsourcing the design and build process, the charges can not go to the contractors as they are independent and only make profit but Boeing eats the loss. This is covered in teh Hart-Smith report by a senior Boeing engineer. Nothing overbudget costs is due the Boeing SPEEA or IAM on the 787, all over budget costs are due excessive rework caused by planning errors on Boeing managment. Remember Boeing outsorced the engineering and the build of the parts so there was no budget for most of the 787 in theory charged to Boeing workers. It only came to them after Boeing managment needed Boeing workers to fix their screwed up business plan.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355271595535</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 19:19:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355272391122-71</Id><Topic><Title>funny Americans want these handouts but this deficit is going to throw the country into</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1355269131575</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 18:38:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's why Republicans will continue to loose.

Strauss, with UBS, did discuss the costs of the 787. However the planted story is not accurate by the Boeing advertisement user who sides with Boeing managment. Mr Strauss goes on to state that the costs , spending 232 million to build each 787 and selling the 787 for about half that amount is due to outsourced engineering and parts making and nothing is mentioned about Boeing workers both union and non union , nor engineers or blue collar workers. The concern of Mr Strauss is that the business plan was flawed , the same point made by Boeing own engineering recomendation. Boeing engineers bid 5 billion to build a 787 like the 777 and about 100 years of past success, if allowed there is little reason to doubt the jobw would have been done on time and budget. The problem is the leadership is attempting to emulate companies that do not require long periods of time to develop specific engineering skills realted to real life building of airplanes or making parts that work. This was what worked until the last Boeing designed and built plane the 777.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355276457928</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 20:40:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355276977843-77</Id><Topic><Title>CSU Researchers Say Sandy Wasn’t Influenced By Global Warming</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355066579229</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 10:22:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I read peer reviewed science. Let me help educate you because your anecdotal beliefs are not supported by science. Abstract of paper: Tropical cyclone accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) has exhibited strikingly large global interannual variability during the past 40‐years. In the pentad since 2006, Northern Hemisphere and global tropical cyclone ACE has decreased dramatically to the lowest levels since the late 1970s. Additionally, the global frequency of tropical cyclones has reached a historical low. Here evidence is presented demonstrating that considerable variability in tropical cyclone ACE is associated with the evolution of the character of observed large‐scale climate mechanisms including the El Niño Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In contrast to record quiet North Pacific tropical cyclone activity in 2010, the North Atlantic basin remained very active by contributing almost one‐third of the overall calendar year global ACE.

A detailed discussion is out of scope here , but I will provide a thumbnail IF any member is interested, they should contact the Governing Documents Committee and request a review with the aim of changing the title to more accurately define the Office Manager and Eliminate the title of ED completely. 1) Most unions do NOT have a position of Executive Director 2) Most non profit corporations do use the term for different reasons 3) The title of ED has been routinely abused for decades at SPEEA whether thru apathy, incompetence, or simply not paying attention to the federal rules. Most of the E-boards over several decades never saw the 990 before or after it was filed. The previous legal staff refused to provide a 990 at my request- it took a letter to the IRS to correct that. For decades, (until about 2004), the ED signed form 990. Per the IRS, unless there was specific authority granted in the Gov Docs, that was a major NO – NO I was instrumental in getting that fiasco changed- resolved , so now it is SPEEA policy that the Pres or Treasurer sign 990. There was major pushback when the issue was brought up- I’ve got the scars and t-shirt ;-PP There are a lot more issues directly related to the ongoing abuse of the title. Most of the current SPEEA board still believes the IRS 990 is simply a form to continue the non profit status of SPEEA. That mantra was started decades ago, and reinforced by Board apathy. However, that form is essentially the same as your 1040 form but for corporations or non profits like unions.
