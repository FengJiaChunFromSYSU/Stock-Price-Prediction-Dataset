For 3 years Boeing stock holders have made only 16%, yap and puncture ! Airbus stockholders have made 162%, making mincemeat of BA. Next month EADS will start to buy back 15% of the EADS stocks to compete with BA stock price manipulation. The Dow Jones Average on a ETF investment is up is up 33% for 3 years . Cessna TXT is good for investment at 24% gain so far this year and and beats the DOW for 3 years at more than 43 per cent return for there investors BTW TXT has produced more than 192000 planes . As an investment do not read the airplane deliveries read the stock price, the return on investment, the customer satisfaction. For the Boeing hacks who refuse to get it, When a bus company ground or Air orders a new bus ground or air, if the bus is breaking down and catching on fire and late to the business by three years the bus company is going to go to another bus maker very simple, this is a not spin zone user comment, so for the 6 Boeing Backs the truth is here

It involved major technological innovations unproven in any airplane. Would the carbon fiber composite survive the rigors of international flying? Could lithium-ion batteries, which are notorious for overheating and causing fires that are difficult to put out, be safely used? No one knew for sure. The 787 also contains multiple new electrical systems, power and distribution panels. The interactions among these novel technologies, introduced simultaneously, also exponentially increased the risk of innovation. The innovation risk implied a greater involvement by Boeing in the development and manufacture of the aircraft. Astonishingly, Boeing opted for lesser involvement, delegating much of the detailed engineering and procurement to sub-contractors. The result? Unexpected problems have kept occurring that have delayed the project and increased its cost.</Msg><Username>hoiinca</Username><Timestamp>1364225786427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:36:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364225983369-26</Id><Topic><Title>LI yui_3_8_1_1_1364221672002_847</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1364222114524</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 10:35:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumbo err spaz err mobro err jihadMO err censored err spaz err conspiracy theory err kookdom personified</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1364225983369</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:39:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364226031068-27</Id><Title>March Cold Records Smashed Throughout Germany…Wind Chill Down To -33°C…”Event Of The Century”!</Title><Msg>Record cold can only mean one thing.

Unlike Boeing’s earlier aircraft, in which Boeing played the traditional role of integrating and assembling different parts and subsystems produced by its suppliers, the 787′s supply chain is based on a tiered structure that would allow Boeing to foster partnerships with around fifty Tier-1 strategic partners. These strategic partners were to serve as “integrators” who assemble different parts and subsystems produced by Tier-2 and Tier-3 suppliers. In due course, Boeing discovered, as Hart-Smith had predicted, that some Tier-1 strategic partners did not have the know-how to develop different sections of the aircraft or the experience to manage their Tier-2 suppliers. To regain control of the development process, Boeing was forced to buy one of the key Tier-1 suppliers (Vought Aircraft Industries) and supply expertise to other suppliers. Boeing also had to pay strategic partners compensation for potential profit losses stemming from the delays in production.

Toyota successfully outsources around 70 percent of its vehicles to a trusted group of partner firms. However key elements of the Toyota outsourcing model were not implemented at Boeing. Toyota maintains tight control over the overall design and engineering of its vehicles and only outsources to suppliers who have proven their ability to deliver with the required timeliness, quality, cost reduction and continuous innovation. As Toyota works closely with its suppliers and responds to supplier concerns with integrity and mutual respect, it has established an impressive level of professional trust and an overriding preoccupation with product quality. By contrast, Boeing adopted the superficial structure of Toyota’s tiered outsourcing model without the values and practices on which it rests. Instead, Boeing relied on poorly designed contractual arrangements, which created perverse incentives to work at the speed of the slowest supplier, by providing penalties for delay but no rewards for timely delivery.</Msg><Username>hoiinca</Username><Timestamp>1364227950128</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 12:12:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364228500178-40</Id><Title>OFFSHORING RISK</Title><Msg>Some degree of outsourcing in other countries—i.e. offshoring—is an inevitable aspect of manufacturing a complex product like an airplane, because some expertise exists only in foreign countries.

Instead of people communicating with people face-to-face, the computer itself was supposed to flag problems in real time. Not surprisingly, the tool failed.

Where then was the C-suite while these risks were being incurred? An interview in 2011 with Philip Condit, who was the richly compensated CEO of Boeing when the initial 787 decisions were being made, is revealing. In 2001, under Condit’s leadership, Boeing moved its headquarters from Seattle to Chicago, a decision continued by Condit’s successor, James McNerney. The ostensible reason for the move was to be neutral among the various divisions of Boeing, which were scattered around the US. In the interview, Condit makes no secret of another factor: as CEO, he didn’t want to be bothered with tiresome “how-do-you-design-an-airplane stuff,” or boring meetings with Boeing’s key customers (airlines) who came to Seattle. After the move, Condit says that he spent much of his time in the Chicago business community, where he “encountered CEOs frequently gathering to nail down civic goals ranging from landing new companies to building world-class parks. ‘I was surprised by how much that happened,’ Condit said. ‘A meeting in which Starbucks, Microsoft, Costco, Boeing and Weyerhaeuser and a bunch of small businesses are all in the same place — rarely happens in Seattle,” he added. ‘It happened all the time in Chicago.’” So while Boeing’s CEO was in Chicago, strategizing about the future of Boeing and discussing civic goals with CEOs from other companies, the managers back in Seattle were making business decisions about tiresome “how-do-you-design-an-airplane stuff” that would determine whether there would be a firm to strategize about. ________________________ Steve Denning’s most</Msg><Username>hoiinca</Username><Timestamp>1364229913531</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 12:45:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364230024932-47</Id><Topic><Title>THANKS BOEING.</Title><Username>hoiinca</Username><Timestamp>1364218472953</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 09:34:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then find some other message board to spam.</Msg><Username>binder_jim</Username><Timestamp>1364230024932</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 12:47:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364230084291-48</Id><Title>LI yui_3_8_1_1_1364229875795_1207</Title><Msg>doesn't matter your id sparty, err sammy, or your #$%$ post coverups. we know you're a hoax purveyor.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1364230084291</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 12:48:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364230628511-49</Id><Title>PROBLEMS</Title><Msg>Brake problems.

Why? Well, put simply, the more elements of the design that are under your control, the more effectively you're able to radically change the design of a product — you give your engineers more degrees of freedom. Similarly, being integrated means you don't have to understand what all the interdependencies are going to be between the components in a product that you haven't created yet (which, obviously, is pretty hard to do). And, as a result of that, you don't need to ask suppliers to contract over interconnects that haven't been created yet, either. Instead, you can put employees together of different disciplines and tell them to solve the problems together. Many of the problems they will encounter would not have been possible to anticipate; but that's ok, because they're not under contract to build a component — they've been employed to solve a problem.

But with the 787, it appears that Boeing tried a very different approach: rather than having the puzzle solved and asking the suppliers to provide a defined puzzle piece, they asked suppliers to create their own blueprints for parts. The puzzle hadn't been properly solved when Boeing asked suppliers for the pieces.

The New Yorker provides some context on this question — and it relates to McDonnell Douglas. While ostensibly Boeing took over McDonnell Douglas, what really happened was more akin to a reverse takeover — McDonnell Douglas took over Boeing. Several of the top positions in the merged Boeing were assigned to executives who had previously worked in St. Louis, where the heritage of McDonnell Aircraft had been one of fighter and attack aircraft for the military. The thing about these Government contracts is that they are paid as development proceeds. This is entirely different — and a lot less risky — than the development model for a traditional commercial airliner, where an aerospace company needs to find all the capital. My hypothesis is that McDonnell's mindset from its defense work — minimizing the amount of capital put at risk during R&amp;D — was applied to the 787. They didn't want to pay full price for the Dreamliner's development, so, they didn't — or at least, that's what they thought. But as Henry Ford warned almost a century earlier: if you need a machine and don't buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don't have it.</Msg><Username>hoiinca</Username><Timestamp>1364233203631</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 13:40:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364233317766-68</Id><Topic><Title>COSTLY</Title><Username>hoiinca</Username><Timestamp>1364226256026</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:44:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There aren't many profits associated with the 787.</Msg><Username>zombiegrunt</Username><Timestamp>1364233317766</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 13:41:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364233608787-69</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty is trying out</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364141305458</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 12:08:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When did I call USS Liberty veterans liars?

To Reagan, Coolidge wasn't silent, but was silenced by New Deal supporters, whose intellectual heirs control much of Washington today. In Coolidge's time, as now, the educated class harbored contempt for the philosophic underpinnings of our republic and for those who would defend them. Alice Roosevelt Longsworth, the daughter of Teddy, accused Coolidge of having been "weaned on a pickle." In language similar to attacks on conservatives today, Pulitzer Prize winner Arthur Schlesinger castigated Coolidge for being too beholden to business. The narrative stuck. In 1995, another Pulitzer Prize winner, Irwin Unger, said Coolidge "slept away most of his five years in office. . . . The watchword of [his] government was do nothing." But "nothing" seemed to work. With the tax cuts in place, luxuries of the rich quickly became middle-class, as affordable cars and radios rolled off the assembly line. Industrial titans (and Coolidge-backers) like Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford made unheard-of fortunes. Real annual per-capita income rose 37%, to $716 from $522. The "Coolidge prosperity," denounced as ephemeral after the 1929 crash, was real for those who experienced it. Coolidge knew this well, telling reporters that "If you can base the economic conditions of the people on their appearance, the way they are dressed, [and] the general appearance of prosperity, I should say it was very good . . . I noticed most of the ladies had on silk dresses and I thought I saw a rather general display of silk stockings." Unlike President Obama, President Coolidge didn't want to "spread the wealth around," but to grow it. He didn't call for "shared sacrifice"—Americans had sacrificed enough during the great war—but for good character. There "is no surer road to destruction than prosperity without character," he said in a speech at the University of Pennsylvania in 1921. And from the White House lawn in 1924 he said, "I want the people of America to be able to work less for the Government and more for themselves. I want them to have the rewards of their own industry. That is the chief meaning of freedom." For Coolidge, then, fiscal matters were a moral question that tested the founding-era premise that free people can govern themselves. He encouraged Americans to "begin to work and save," in good and bad times. Only "our productive capacity," he told Depression-era readers in his autobiography, published in 1929, "is sufficient to maintain us all in a state of prosperity if we give sufficient attention to thrift and industry." That productive capacity, Coolidge knew, was sapped by the spendthrift—he called it "socialistic"—notions of government that sought to be all things to all people. Coolidge, making note of federal farm subsidies and flood insurance, criticized the thinking of "expect[ing] the government in some miraculous way to save us from the consequences of our own acts," in a post-presidential column on Oct. 17, 1930. Americans, he wrote, "want the right to run our own business, fix our own wages and prices, and spend our own money, but if depression and unemployment result we look to government for a remedy." As Coolidge saw things in 1924, "A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent public necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to servitude." Coolidge helped Americans prosper by letting them be free. By CHARLES C.

Earlier, the Department of Homeland Security released hundreds of illegal aliens awaiting deportation because they could not afford to hold them because of cuts mandated by the Sequester, they said. Head Start is to face cuts due to Sequestration. Native American children are being sacrificed to Sequestration according to Slate Magazine. The Marine Corps faces massive reductions in manpower reports the Wall Street Journal. The U.S.S. Harry Truman and its escorts are sitting idle in Norfolk, VA because of the Sequester when they should be on their way to the other side of the world. The TSA is threatening cuts that will push airport security lines out onto the street, while the government had been threatening to cut meat inspections until Congress pushed back. In other words the Administration is holding a gun to the head of almost every single American in its quest to inflict the maximum pain possible on each of us to achieve its political objectives. When has this occurred in our country's history? When has a president orchestrated such a symphony of hardship for party politics? When has a president gone to such lengths for such a small amount of money? The Sequester represents $85 Billion out of a budget of $3.5 Trillion, or just a 2.42% reduction in federal spending. On year on year basis, spending is still increasing by over 2% over last year. The math used by the Administration to generate this pain is simply crazy. But this is the same Administration that decided at the outset to assault conventional energy in order to raise prices so that green energy could compete. I was in some of the meetings where the Green Lobby advocated this, and was stunned at their audacity. So now gasoline is at all time high levels; natural gas is being stymied; coal is in the Most Wanted list and nuclear has been sidelined. We have a Department of Homeland Security that has become one of the largest bureaucracies in the history of our government in the space of 11 years. There is very little accountability and DHS has extraordinary powers to infringe the constitutional rights of our citizenry. Drones, computer monitoring, and wiretaps are all allowed under the Obama Administration's overwhelming control of the mechanisms of state. Just the other day, DHS announced plans to scan even more private e mail traffic. There is a simple word for all of this; tyranny. Tyranny is defined as the arbitrary or unrestrained exercise of power or a despotic abuse of authority. The Obama Administration, through its concentration of power in the White House and its staff; through its extensive use of czars, executive orders, bureaucratic fiat and now simple oppression seems to have stepped over the line with the American People. Congress has proven to be largely impotent in checking this steamroller strategy by the executive branch. The other day another 800 pages of gobbledygook regarding health care regulations was released by the Department of Health and Health &amp; Human Services and Henry Chao, the bureaucrat charged with tying the system together electronically stated about Obamacare, "Let's just make sure that this is not a 3rd World experience." If you recall, the Affordable Care Act was never seen before it was voted upon. It was passed in the dead of night on Christmas Eve and passed only because of the greatest political bribery and blackmail campaign ever seen in a city that has seen it all. Tyranny, anyone? In Robert Woodward's book, "The Price of Politics" the president is described as arrogant and aloof. On the president's decision not to deploy the Truman, Woodward, the ultimate Washington insider, said it exhibited "a kind of madness I haven't seen in a long time." Presidents do not hold military and foreign policy to ransom. Tyrants do. But in Washington for the ruling elite nothing changes. Vice President Biden, on his way back from the installation of Pope Francis, whose hallmark to date has been his empathy for the poor, stopped in Paris for a night and then in London and racked up hotel bills of $585,000 and $485,000 respectively. As an ostensible Catholic, Mr. Biden might have perhaps followed the Pope's example of austerity. After being widely criticized for the cost of his golf outing in Florida recently the President has been lying low, but he was able to shut down tours of the White House as a part of, you guessed it, the Sequester. One might almost think this suited the President just fine. None of those damned plebes running around the place. This crosses traditional political boundaries. It involves the separation of powers; executive privilege, and the rights of the People under the Constitution. It is poor management and is thuggish. It is wrong on every level. This President has done his best to oppress the American People with his sometimes petty, sometimes quite substantive and always arbitrary application of the Sequester. The media has proven their credentials once again by refusing to challenge the Administration. Of course, even if they did they would be mocked by Jay Carney, and one simply cannot afford that if one is to be invited to the right parties. Think about how the Sequester has been applied. Think about how the Department of Homeland Security has become a largely unaccountable national police force and has regularly violated the law of the land. And think about a President whose preferred policy is to use intimidation and the intentional infliction of pain and suffering to achieve his goals. When does petty tyranny become real and oppressive? And how do we as citizens respond?</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1364242401894</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 16:13:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364242682383-106</Id><Title>Boeing test flight with twice as heavy as planned, battery box woof and ouch</Title><Msg>So Boeing is now going to sell the 3 year late 787 sky bus to the sky bus companies(airline companies) with a battery system that has a weight twice what the contract for sale promised! . So that is another deduction in profit to the Boeing shareholder, it is not what the contract for sale specified !Boeing also will be required to negotiate a lower price plane as it is now a less fuel efficient plane then the customer contracted for. So the 787 sky bus , is over 3 years late another delivery penalty, Boeing owes each customer a revenue loss payment there are also ,multiple lemon break downs IE , cracked windshield, brakes not working, false indicator lights this is a scream not a squawk issue and a big woof and ouch to Boeing shareholders .. Airbus is closing in on their improved 787 style plane , If your a bus company and Chevy offered you a bus then did not deliver on time and was 3 years late with a lemon bus like the 787. Then the customers will go to another bus making company like Ford who is also a bus maker (sky bus) It shows int he stock price of both sky bus making companies too. BA stock price is up only 16% in the 3 years the 787 has failed, imagine that !!!! woof and ouch ! While AIrbus shareholders have gained over 160% in the same 3 years it is ripping Boeing shareholders apart.

Depending on what you call welfare, most of those programs were designed to help people who had been kept at a disadvantage. If your family has been thriving for decades or centuries, you have an automatic advantage. If your family was doing ok in another country but you felt you could do better here, you are not at as much of a disadvantage as some. If your family was deliberately kept at a disadvantage for centuries, you don't have as much of a base to build from. Progress is being made, but it can take generations to make gains in education and assets, which it takes in order to help your children more.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1364247720522</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 17:42:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364247963873-124</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing test flight with twice as heavy as planned, battery box woof and ouch</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1364242682383</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 16:18:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>will Boeing put on a fire and smoke display on landing or just fireworks to celebrate their 3 year late 33 billion dollar over cost disaster 787 or just add some more jet fuel to compensate for the twice as heavy battery system now that is travels in a steel case what a joke BA up 16% in 3 years Airbus up 160% in 3 years the same amount of time the 787 is late big woof and ouch for Boeing investors</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1364247963873</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 17:46:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364248086071-125</Id><Title>NTSB COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW.</Title><Msg>I china man ,no understand comprehensive. , what is comprehensive? like comprehensive insurance.? if the plane go in water we will all be cover with medical like car insurance.
