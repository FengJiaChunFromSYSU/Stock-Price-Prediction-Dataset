Would Mr. Nedham be responsible that, if all were to be decided by a vote of the majority, the eight or nine millions who have no property, would not think of usurping over the rights of the one or two millions who have? Property is surely a right of mankind as really as liberty. Perhaps, at first, prejudice, habit, shame or fear, principle or religion, would restrain the poor from attacking the rich, and the idle from usurping on the industrious; but the time would not be long before courage and enterprise would come, and pretexts be invented by degrees, to countenance the majority in dividing all the property among them, or at least, in sharing it equally with its present possessors. Debts would be abolished first; taxes laid heavy on the rich, and not at all on the others; and at last a downright equal division of every thing be demanded, and voted. What would be the consequence of this? The idle, the vicious, the intemperate, would rush into the utmost extravagance of debauchery, sell and spend all their share, and then demand a new division of those who purchased from them. The moment the idea is admitted into society, that property is not as sacred as the laws of God, and that there is not a force of law and public justice to protect it, anarchy and tyranny commence.

Karl highlighted the case of Melinda Vega, worrying about "her $450 a week unemployment check, her lifeline." However, ABC journalists were less concerned about unemployment when it didn't involve possible tax increases.

On Thursday morning McConnell had made a motion for the vote on legislation that would let the president extend the country's borrowing limit on his own. Congress would then have the option to disapprove such hikes, in a fashion similar to one that McConnell first suggested during last year's standoff over the debt ceiling. The minority leader apparently did not think Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) would take him up on his offer, which would have allowed McConnell to portray President Barack Obama's desire for such authority as something even Democrats opposed. Reid objected at first, but told McConnell he thought it might be a good idea. After Senate staff reviewed the proposal, Reid came back to the floor and proposed a straight up-or-down vote on the idea. McConnell was forced to say no."

George Soros comes to mind, and then there's this: Seven of 10 Richest Members of Congress Are Democrats For the second year in a row, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas is the richest member of Congress, with a reported net worth of $305 million — the first time a Washington lawmaker has surpassed the $300 million mark. Roll Call’s annual list of the 50 richest members of Congress reveals that seven of the top 10 are Democrats — and four of the 10 owe their fortunes to wealthy spouses. McCaul, a former federal prosecutor, reported in 2010 that his wife had received assets as gifts from her parents, boosting his net worth from some $73 million to at least $294 million that year. His wife Linda is the daughter of Clear Channel Communications Inc. CEO and founder Lowry Mays. Roll Call determines the minimum net worth of members by subtracting the total minimum value of all liabilities from the total minimum value of all assets. Lawmakers do not have to report the value of personal residences as an asset. The assets and liabilities are listed in broad ranges, making it difficult to calculate a lawmaker’s exact minimum net worth, Roll Call pointed out. Second on the 2012 list of richest members of Congress is Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., up from No. 3 last year with a net worth of $199 million. His wife Teresa Heinz Kerry is the widow of the late Sen. H. John Heinz III of the Heinz ketchup fortune. At No. 3, down one place this year, is Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., at $141 million. Issa is the founder of Directed Electronics Inc., which makes car alarms. Next on the list is Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., at $86 million. He made his fortune as co-founder of Nextel Communications Inc. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.V., is No. 5, with $83 million. He is the great-grandson of Standard Oil Co. founder John D. Rockefeller. He is followed by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., at $79 million. His wife Cynthia Blumenthal is the daughter of New York real estate mogul Peter Malkin. Another Democrat, Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado, is No. 7 with a net worth of $72 million. Much of his wealth comes from Blue Mountain Arts, his family’s greeting card and publishing business. Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, yet another Democrat, is No. 8 at $57 million. He is co-founder of Automatic Data Processing, a payroll processing company. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., No. 9 on the list, owes her fortune to her husband Richard Blum, president and CEO of the private equity firm Blum Capital Partners LP. Her net worth is estimated at $42 million. Rep. Jim Renacci, R-Ohio, is No. 10 with a net worth of $37 million. He has significant investments in fast-food chains, electronics companies, pharmaceutical companies, and oil giants, according to Roll Call. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California is at No. 13, with a net worth of $26 million, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is at No. 37 with $9 million. The “poorest” member on the list is Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., with a net worth of $6.28 million. agent, your talking points come straight out of "Pravda".</Msg><Username>greedyoilbastards</Username><Timestamp>1354897036852</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 11:17:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354897041065-39</Id><Topic><Title>Talking about stupid</Title><Username>tojo472002</Username><Timestamp>1354863460541</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 01:57:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have to flush out the root cause of our financial problem, and that is the democrats.

Krugman never so much as ran a hot dog stand and lives in the academic bubble with zero real world experience. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Professors Paul Krugman and Richard Layard have launched a manifesto - they are trying to get economists to sign up to their version of what went wrong with the world economy and what we should do about it. I can't sign it as I'm not an economist. But even if I were, I wouldn't – because they've made a very bad error in the analysis of the basic cause of the crisis. Leave entirely aside their advice on what should be done now; I'd argue that what went wrong is the perfect proof of why Keynesian demand management of the economy will never work. Here's an extract from Krugman and Layard: The causes. Many policy makers insist that the crisis was caused by irresponsible public borrowing. With very few exceptions – other than Greece – this is false. Instead, the conditions for crisis were created by excessive private sector borrowing and lending, including by over-leveraged banks. The collapse of this bubble led to massive falls in output and thus in tax revenue. So the large government deficits we see today are a consequence of the crisis, not its cause. Think back to what basic Keynesianism demands: fiscal policy, the gap between what the government collects in taxes and what it spends, should be counter-cyclical. When demand is weak, as now, there should be a big deficit to compensate. However, it is also true that when demand is strong, the same theory insists that there should be a large surplus. Nigel Lawson's Public Sector Debt Repayment should be going on. These are two halves of the same theory. If you want a budget deficit in a slump then you must also want a budget surplus in a boom. So, let us look around the world and see whether, in the tail end years of the longest boom of modern times (roughly, 2000 to 2007) governments were running budget surpluses. Spain was, yes, and Ireland too. The UK certainly wasn't, as Brown decided to borrow more to "invest" and the idea that the younger Bush ran a surplus will be greeted with hollow laughter. But even Spain wasn't running a large enough surplus. The deficit/surplus should be symmetrical to some extent. If the slump is going to bring forth 5pc or 10pc of GDP deficits then at the peak of the boom we should be having 5pc or 10pc surpluses. No, this isn't just to pay off the old debt, nor is it to build up borrowing firepower for when we need it. It's integral to the entire theory, that if we are to manage demand then we must suck it out of the economy in the boom just as we pump it in in the slump. But here's the catch – sucking demand out, what Paul Volker called taking the punchbowl away just as the party heats up (although that was about monetary policy), doesn't seem to be possible in any realistic political system. As soon as that surplus starts to pile up, we get the joint cries of we should cut taxes or increase spending. Think about the Left calling for us to abolish child poverty, rebuild all the schools and remedy decades of neglect about social housing. Perhaps these were good things to spend money on. Perhaps they weren't. But Keynesianism demands that in a boom one runs a substantial budget surplus. The bigger the boom, the bigger that surplus should be for reasons purely of demand management. Governments did not run such surpluses when they should have. What caused our current problems was the inherent failure of Keynesian economics. No politician is ever going to do the hard part when necessary: running gargantuan budget surpluses at the peak of a boom. And if an economic theory cannot survive implmentation in the real world, which is to say the collision with politics, then it's not all that useful a theory to use to guide our politics, is it? -The Telegraph-</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1354897687882</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 11:28:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354898269649-41</Id><Title>Dreamliner has the makings of a very unreliable aircraft....</Title><Msg>Gadgets EVERYWHERE.

No evidence has emerged linking the weapons provided by the Qataris during the uprising against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to the attack that killed four Americans at the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in September. But in the months before, the Obama administration clearly was worried about the consequences of its hidden hand in helping arm Libyan militants, concerns that have not previously been reported. The weapons and money from Qatar strengthened militant groups in Libya, allowing them to become a destabilizing force since the fall of the Qaddafi government. The experience in Libya has taken on new urgency as the administration considers whether to play a direct role in arming rebels in Syria, where weapons are flowing in from Qatar and other countries.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1354900809456</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 12:20:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354900985025-60</Id><Topic><Title>Dreamliner has the makings of a very unreliable aircraft....</Title><Username>rogerjames55346</Username><Timestamp>1354898269649</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 11:37:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rogerjames eh- that's rich- looks like you are still peod about your dismissal from BA for your antics in the john over at Renton-----HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1354900985025</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 12:23:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354901014693-61</Id><Title>Obama Photo Ops With Useful Idiots</Title><Msg>I notice O is still in community organizing and campaign modes which is understandable as that is his only skill sets.

The need to correct this seeming injustice is framed not simply in terms of fairness. Higher tax rates on the wealthy, we're told, would help balance the budget, allow for more "investment" in America's future and foster better economic growth for all. In support of this claim, like-minded liberal pundits point out that in the 1950s, when America's economic might was at its zenith, the rich faced tax rates as high as 91% True enough, the top marginal income-tax rate in the 1950s was much higher than today's top rate of 35%—but the share of income paid by the wealthiest Americans has essentially remained flat since then. In 1958, the top 3% of taxpayers earned 14.7% of all adjusted gross income and paid 29.2% of all federal income taxes. In 2010, the top 3% earned 27.2% of adjusted gross income and their share of all federal taxes rose proportionally, to 51%. So if the top marginal tax rate has fallen to 35% from 91%, how in the world has the tax burden on the wealthy remained roughly the same? Two factors are responsible. Lower- and middle-income workers now bear a significantly lighter burden than in the past. And the confiscatory top marginal rates of the 1950s were essentially symbolic—very few actually paid them. In reality the vast majority of top earners faced lower effective rates than they do today. In 1958, an 81% marginal tax rate applied to incomes above $1.08 million, and the 91% rate kicked in at $3.08 million. These figures are in unadjusted 1958 dollars and correspond today to nominal income levels that are at least 10 times higher. That year, according to Internal Revenue Service records, just 236 of the nation's 45.6 million tax filers had any income that was taxed at 81% or higher. (The published IRS data do not reveal how many of these were subject to the 91% rate.) In 1958, approximately 28,600 filers (0.06% of all taxpayers) earned the $93,168 or more needed to face marginal rates as high as 30%. These Americans—genuinely wealthy by the standards of the day—paid 5.9% of all income taxes. And now? In 2010, 3.9 million taxpayers (2.75% of all taxpayers) were subjected to rates that were 33% or higher. These Americans—many of whom would hardly call themselves wealthy—reported an adjusted gross income of $209,000 or higher, and they paid 49.7% of all income taxes. In contrast, the share of taxes paid by the bottom two-thirds of taxpayers has fallen dramatically over the same period. In 1958, these Americans accounted for 41.3% of adjusted gross income and paid 29% of all federal taxes. By 2010, their share of adjusted gross income had fallen to 22.5%. But their share of taxes paid fell far more dramatically—to 6.7%. The 77% decline represents the single biggest difference in the way the tax burden is shared in this country since the late 1950s. The changes came about not so much by movements in rates but by the addition of tax credits for the poor and the elimination of exemptions for the wealthy. In 1958, even the lowest-tier filers, which included everyone making up to $5,000 annually, were subjected to an effective 20% rate. Today, almost half of all tax filers have no income-tax liability whatsoever, and many "taxpayers" actually get a net refund from the government. Those nostalgic for 1950s-era "tax fairness" should bear this in mind. The tax code of the 1950s allowed upper-income Americans to take exemptions and deductions that are unheard of today. Tax shelters were widespread, and not just for the superrich. The working wealthy—including doctors, lawyers, business owners and executives—were versed in the art of creating losses to lower their tax exposure. For instance, a doctor who earned $50,000 through his medical practice could reduce his taxable income to zero with $50,000 in paper losses or depreciation from property he owned through a real-estate investment partnership. Huge numbers of professionals signed up for all kinds of money-losing schemes. Today, a corresponding doctor earning $500,000 can deduct a maximum of $3,000 from his taxable income, no matter how large the loss. Those 1950s gambits lowered tax liabilities but dissuaded individuals from engaging in the more beneficial activities of increasing their incomes and expanding their businesses. As a result, they were a net drag on the economy. When Ronald Reagan finally lowered rates in the 1980s, he did so in exchange for scrapping uneconomical deductions. When business owners stopped trying to figure out how to lose money, the economy boomed. It's hard to determine how much otherwise taxable income disappeared through tax shelters in the 1950s. As a result, direct comparisons between the 1950s and now are difficult. However, it is worth noting that from 1958 to 2010, the taxes paid by the top 3% of earners, as a percentage of total personal income (which can't be reduced by shelters), increased to 3.96% from 2.72%, while the percentage paid by the bottom two-thirds of filers fell to 0.51% in 2010 from 2.7%. This starker division of relative tax burdens can be explained by the inability of upper-income groups to shelter income. It is a testament to the shallow nature of the national economic conversation that higher tax rates can be justified by reference to a fantasy—a 91% marginal rate that hardly any top earners paid. In reality, tax policies that diminish the incentives and capacities of innovators, business owners and investors will not spur economic improvement. Such policies will, however, satisfy the instincts of those who want to "stick it to the rich." Never mind that the rich have already been stuck fairly well.

A new poll from the Washington Post and ABC News shows that 61% of Americans believe that the gap between “how much money wealthy people have” compared with the rest of the population is larger than it’s been historically. Only 31% believe it’s the same. Fully 61% also believe the gap between the wealthy is “much larger” than it’s been historically. Unfortunately, the survey respondents and much of the media are wrong. Inequality is clearly at high and (to many) disturbing levels. Over a 30-year period it’s undoubtedly gone up. But by the latest measures, inequality is actually lower than it was four years ago, and well below its recent highs. While many people cite inequality as a cause for the recession and joblessness, inequality was actually higher during the boom times of 2007 and 2008, when unemployment was under 5%. According to the IRS, people making more than $500,000 accounted for 27% of the nation’s income in 2007. In 2009, the latest year available, their share fell by nearly half, to 14%, due largely to income declines at the top. Those making $200,000 saw a similar decline. In 2007, they accounted for 41% of the nation’s income. By 2009, their share had shrunk to 26% — the same level it was in 2000. As for wealth (total net worth as opposed to annual earnings), the numbers are too outdated. The most reliable stats on wealth come from the Federal Reserve’s Surveys of Consumer Finance. Their latest numbers are for 2007, when the top 1% controlled 33.8% of the nation’s wealth. That is lower than it was in 1998 and 1995. (News reports often state that the top 1% now controls 40% of the wealth, but the Federal Reserve has never published such a number). Many researchers have published estimates for the current wealth of the 1%, but we don’t have concrete data. But in a 2009 paper, two Federal Reserve economists projected that the richest 20% and the bottom 80% experienced “comparably sized drops in mean and median net worth.” That suggests that the distribution either stayed the same or possible declined, since the top lost more wealth in dollar terms. To be sure, the U.S. census has published numbers from its surveys showing that those earning more than $180,000 added “slightly” to their annual incomes in 2009 (though IRS data is generally considered to be more accurate than census surveys). And for all we know, 2011 could be an all-time high for inequality — we just don’t have any numbers. Yet it would be wrong to say that inequality in America is at record highs. We only have to look back four years to see a time when it was higher.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1354909505582</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:45:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354911611910-83</Id><Topic><Title>Facts About the The Myth of ‘Record-High’ Inequality</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1354909505582</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:45:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Without a deal, unemployment compensation will end for more than two million people who've been out of work more than 26 weeks.

Indeed the rich has gotten richer under Obama. At the same time the President has created 23 million paupers living in or below poverty in America. What's wrong with this picture? The unintended consequences of socialism a.k.a stimulus after stimulus... Despite President Obama's message that he is concerned about the poor, his policies greatly benefit the rich and disenfranchises the poor. Many misguided ideas that taking from the rich to benefit the poor is a the way to go - that approch has never produced a favorable outcome in all of history. The one thing almost certain is that the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer. How is that possible one might contemplate. The problem is the errosion of the middle class. This is how it unravells. For example in 2009 Mr. Obama started off with 27 million Americans on food stamps, his policies to spend trillions of dollars go to those big businesses who were too big to fail. Those trillions of dollars were never passed down to the middle class and the revenues the government took in was also dramatically reduced because those same big businesses were given huge tax breaks to stem their losses and they were not required to pay taxes on stimulus dollars. Those same big companies laid off millions of Americans and closed hundreds of factories. This massive layoff obliterated the middle class thus dumping millions of families who were not destined for poverty now into the mire of unemployment and food stamps. Now there are over 43 million families on food subsidies. Now the poor and the middle class are competing for the same food subsidies and limited government resources. There is just not enough to support the 47% of the United States on goverment subsidies. So the President's attempt to save the poor actually resulted in a case where the poor got poorer, and the middle class got poorer - while the rich just doubled their wealth. How is it that the rich doubled their wealth? This is because a smart business does not wait until he is out of cash to close his doors. He is smart if he closes shop when his profit margin drops below the projected level - say his profitablility falls below 7%, his exit strategy suggests that he immediately closes the doors files for bankruptcy and pay off his creditors pennies on the dollar. He still keeps what is left or his personal wealth is not in play here so he comes out on top no matter what. Those who suffer are the employed and smaller businesses that supply bigger businesses Therefore, the idea that government is going to save the poor by sticking it to the rich is that the government don't tell you how insulated the rich makes themselves so that even if you were to raise their taxes and their costs, they basically cash out and everyone else loses. In that sense, President Obama should have taken a class or two in economics instead of running around colleges and rallying for socalled community organizing events. The funny part is that most Americans are so dillusional and buys this line that the rich is to blame, when they don't realize that in America, everyone can be rich if the rich spends their money and keep businesses open. At the same time, everyone is destined for poverty if we seek to rob those who have earned their fair wealth.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1354911964271</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 15:26:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354912088433-86</Id><Topic><Title>Facts About the The Myth of ‘Record-High’ Inequality</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1354909505582</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:45:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pundits keep talking about when we go over the cliff ...looks to me as though we did already.

According to the London-based wealth-analysis group, the figure means the number of millionaires has grown by 28.6 percent. This is equivalent to over a thousand new millionaires per day during Obama’s first three years, according to a press release obtained by The Huffington Post. "It doesn't really fit the campaign rhetoric that one side is against the rich and the other is for," WealthInsight analyst Christopher Rocks said. "The total number of millionaires is growing and will continue to grow whether Obama or [Mitt] Romney is elected." The group defines millionaires -- also referred throughout the report as “high net worth individuals” (HNWIs) -- as individuals with net assets in excess of $1 million, excluding primary residences. According to Business Insider, the super rich have been the fastest to recover following the financial services sector. However, the number of new U.S. millionaires did fall after the market crash. At the end of 2011 there were just over 5.1 million millionaires in the United States -- 165,360 fewer than in 2007. The news outlet predicts that with real estate improvements and the recent rise in stock market, the number of millionaires will be back to pre-recession levels by the end of 2012. “The US wealth sector has recovered strongly since the financial crisis," WealthInsight's Rocks said. "Contrasting with a lot of campaign rhetoric, growth in the HNWI population under President Obama has been rapid, far outpacing growth in the broader economy.”</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1354914218718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 16:03:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354914427753-91</Id><Title>U.S. Adds 1.1 Million Millionaires Under President Obama: Report</Title><Msg>A recent survey from British analyst WealthInsight reports the U.S. has added 1.1 million millionaires since Obama was elected in 2008.

(The President of OSI and the Soros Foundation Network is Aryeh Neier, former Director of the socialist League for Industrial Democracy.)…major agendas can be summarized as follows: * promoting the view that America is institutionally an oppressive nation * promoting the election of leftist political candidates throughout the United States * opposing virtually all post-9/11 national security measures enacted by U.S. government, particularly the Patriot Act * depicting American military actions as unjust, unwarranted, and immoral * promoting open borders, mass immigration, and a watering down of current immigration laws * promoting a dramatic expansion of social welfare programs funded by ever-escalating taxes * promoting social welfare benefits and amnesty for illegal aliens * defending the civil rights and liberties of suspected anti-American terrorists and their abetters * financing the recruitment and training of future activist leaders of the political Left * advocating America's unilateral disarmament and/or a steep reduction in its military spending * opposing the death penalty in all circumstances * promoting socialized medicine in the United States * promoting the tenets of radical environmentalism, whose ultimate goal, as writer Michael Berliner has explained, is "not clean air and clean water, [but] rather ... the demolition of technological/industrial civilization" * bringing American foreign policy under the control of the United Nations * promoting racial and ethnic preferences in academia and the business world alike * promoting taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand * advocating stricter gun-control measures * advocating the legalization of marijuana The Shadow Party was conceived and organized principally by George Soros, Hillary Clinton and Harold McEwan Ickes… "The Shadow Party is the real power driving the Democrat machine. It is a network of radicals dedicated to transforming our constitutional republic into a socialist hive. The leader of these radicals is ... George Soros. He has essentially privatized the Democratic Party, bringing it under his personal control. The Shadow Party is the instrument through which he exerts that control. ... It works by siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions that would have gone to the Democratic Party in normal times, and putting those contributions at the personal disposal of Mr. Soros. He then uses that money to buy influence and loyalty where he sees fit. In 2003, Soros set up a network of privately-owned groups which acts as a shadow or mirror image of the Party. It performs all the functions we would normally expect the real Democratic Party to perform, such as shaping the Party platform, fielding candidates, running campaigns, and so forth. However, it performs these functions under the private supervision of Mr. Soros and his associates. The Shadow Party derives its power from its ability to raise huge sums of money. By controlling the Democrat purse strings, the Shadow Party can make or break any Democrat candidate by deciding whether or not to fund him. During the 2004 election cycle, the Shadow Party raised more than $300 million for Democrat candidates, prompting one of its operatives, MoveOn PAC director Eli Pariser, to declare, “Now it’s our party. We bought it, we own it…”"”</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1354917130833</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 16:52:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354917478450-95</Id><Title>Democrat's Closest Allies - The Communist Party USA</Title><Msg>Ideological twins.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1354917478450</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 16:57:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354918730087-96</Id><Topic><Title>Democrat's Closest Allies - The Communist Party USA</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1354917478450</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 16:57:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jealous eh?</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354918730087</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 17:18:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354921679143-97</Id><Topic><Title>The Legacy of the Republiwhopperpalooza in Tampa</Title><Username>agent0977</Username><Timestamp>1354899737142</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 12:02:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The republiwhopperpalooza in Tampa and the primary debate comedy clown show was an exercise in prevarication not seen since Germany in the 1930's.

One way to help your mind work better when thinking about this is to mentally rename the USG. Renaming results in clearer thinking because it makes allegiances transparent. I like to think of the USG as Federists (rhymes with terrorists), which helps me remember I’m talking about an foreign occupational, hostile, well funded, highly intelligent, malevolent gang of usurpers. Federists occupy the highest offices and control the primary enforcing agencies of the former USG. Federists control of America is maintained first by deception, then bribery and blackmail and finally, as needed, murder. In other words, the control system that has been pulled over our eyes to blind us from the truth, is now in control of the world’s wealthiest and militarily powerful nation on earth. The world, then, is controlled by an unnamed, focused group of powerful, malevolent, super-staters, which, by proxy, occupy and control the highest offices, enforcing agencies and military of the wealthiest and most powerful nation on earth. The world is controlled by the globalists. GLOBALIST’S RESOURCES The globalist maintain their control over the world through control of the worlds media, education, money, military, religions, and energy (including food, water and medicine). The primary source of globalist power comes from pretended money in the form of currency and energy monopolies. All the other controls are derived from these two sources. And, for future reference, these two main sources of power are the globalist’s Achilles heel. Counterfeit currency is a system of pretended money loaned by imitation banks to governments at interest. The interest represents real wealth streamed back to the imitation banks in payment for the counterfeit currency (nothing). The crux of the crime is that nothing of value is loaned in return for interest payments. Using the borrower’s promise to pay as currency, the imitation banks return debt as money. In other words, nothing of value was loaned by the bank in return for interest payments. Hence a system was devised so globalists can issue currency in nearly unlimited quantities, at no cost to the globalist, in return for an ever growing stream of interest payments siphoning off the wealth of the borrowers. The globalists using middle men like the Federists can then ‘loan’ unlimited ( at least in the short term because this banking scam eventually self destructs) currency to the Federists, who use the currency to further the globalists agenda, while the globalist still retain the interest stream now passed off as income tax to the working class of the united States of America. The actual currency (dollar) is worthless, but derives a phony value because people accept the dollar in trade for real goods. Since the currency grows on trees, the quantity can always increase (and of course it does), thereby reducing the supply of goods available causing prices to rise in proportion to the quantity of pretend money in existence. The rising prices are a second form of tax since it now takes more dollars to purchase the same good.

HB5768 declares, “no agency of this state, no political subdivision of this state, no employee of an agency of this state or a political subdivision of this state acting in his or her official capacity, and no member of the Michigan national guard on official state duty shall aid an agency of the armed forces of the United States in any investigation, prosecution, or detention of any person pursuant to section 1021 of the national defense authorization act…” **************It passed 107-0.************ Bill sponsor Rep. Tom McMillin was jubilant after the vote. “My bill opposing NDAA’s indefinite detention, and taking away due process, and prohibiting the Michigan government from participating passed the House today. On to the State Senate,” he said. A large coalition of grassroots activists spanning the political spectrum, including the Tenth Amendment Center, supported the bill and lobbied for its passage. “There has been a lot of debate about the Feinstein amendment recently passed in the U.S. Senate. Will it really protect Americans from indefinite detention? Or is the language too broad? State actions like the one taken in Michigan today protect people no matter what they come up with in D.C.,” Tenth Amendment Center national communications director Mike Maharrey said. “Even if the Feinstein amendment sticks, it still expressly claims congressional power to pass legislation to detain people on U.S. soil. It is the duty of state legislatures to interpose and stop the progress of evil. And what can be more evil than government-sanctioned kidnapping? Don’t let caterwauling in D.C. distract you. Keep pressing your state lawmakers to take action.”</Msg><Username>spartacus778899</Username><Timestamp>1354928660630</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 20:04:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354928905980-110</Id><Topic><Title>How the Matrix was formed and what you can do to fight against it</Title><Username>spartacus778899</Username><Timestamp>1354927960058</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 19:52:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Am I insane?
