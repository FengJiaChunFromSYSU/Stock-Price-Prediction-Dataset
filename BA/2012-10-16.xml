They say it isn’t true. "With regard to the assault on the Catholic Church, let me make it absolutely clear,” Biden said during his debate with Republican vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan on Thursday. “No religious institution -- Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic social services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital -- none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact. That is a fact." The U.S. Conference of Bishops disagreed, and issued a letter on Friday taking issue with Biden’s position. “This is not a fact,” the letter states. “The HHS mandate contains a narrow, four-part exemption for certain ‘religious employers.’ ” The bishops argue the White House offered a proposal in February that essentially would have put the responsibility of providing such drugs and services on the institution’s insurance companies. The offer was essentially rejected, and the issue is being played out in roughly 40 lawsuits, including one filed by the University of Notre Dame, in 12 federal courts across the country. “That exemption was made final in February and does not extend to ‘Catholic social services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital,’ or any other religious charity that offers its services to all, regardless of the faith of those served,” the bishops’ letter continued They also said the proposal does not even “potentially” relieve organizations from the obligation to pay for contraception and to be a “vehicle” to get contraception. The White House did not respond to a request Monday for comment. The group also said the organizations will have to serve as a “vehicle” because they will still be forced to provide their employees with health coverage, and that coverage will still have to include sterilization, contraception and abortifacients. They will have to pay for these things because the premiums that the organizations (and their employees) are required to pay will still be applied, along with other funds, to cover the cost of these drugs and surgeries, the group said."

From the New American Monday, 15 October 2012 16:27 The forecast of the 2012 Presidential Election by Michael Berry and Kenneth Bicker, political science professors at the University of Colorado, that was released in August has been updated with more current economic information, and the result is the same: a Romney win as the economy continues to falter. It takes 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency, and Berry and Bicker are projecting that Governor Mitt Romney will win 330 of the 538 votes up for grabs in November, while President Obama will receive just 208, down from the 213 they predicted in August. It’s the economy. The model developed by the two professors has an uncanny track record, correctly predicting each presidential election since 1980, often with startling accuracy. In their paper originally published in August by the American Political Science Association [APSA] along with 12 other studies, it differed in its predictive “model” by looking at two essential pieces of the economic puzzle: changes in real per capita income — that is, net, after-tax, spendable income — and unemployment rates. But their model doesn't just rely on the national numbers provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has been heavily criticized recently for its inexplicable drop in the unemployment rate while real jobs in the economy aren't even reaching maintenance levels. It relies also on state-by-state analyses of those same factors, which appear to be more reliable. As the professors note: In contrast to these other Electoral College models [published by the APSA], our model includes measures of change in real per capita income, as well as national and state unemployment figures. Accounting for both changes in personal income and unemployment provides a more robust approximation of state economic well-being and, thus, serves to model the impact of retrospective evaluations of the incumbent party's stewardship of the economy… The data incorporated in our model are regularly released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the US Department of Commerce and the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US Department of Labor. This gives us high-quality, predictably available data to use as the feedstock for our model.</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1350385243665</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 07:00:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350386244056-13</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals are the biggest Racists</Title><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1350350159171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 21:15:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is why Rachel Carlson, responsible for the deaths of 10s of millions of Africans by getting DDT stopped in the fight against Malaria, is a hero to people like Obamer and Maher. Obamer's Science Czar John Holdren wrote a book 'Ecoscience' in which he outlines the need for forced abortions and mass sterilization. Here is a quote from one of Holren's mentors. "The feeble-minded, the #$%$, the dull and backward, and the lower-than-average persons in our society are outbreeding the superior ones at the present time. ... Is there anything that can be done to prevent the long-range degeneration of human stock? Unfortunately, at the present time there is little, other than to prevent breeding in persons who present glaring deficiencies clearly dangerous to society and which are known to be of a hereditary nature. Thus we could sterilize or in other ways discourage the mating of the feeble-minded. We could go further and systematically attempt to prune from society, by prohibiting them from breeding, persons suffering from serious inheritable forms of physical defects, such as congenital deafness, dumbness, blindness, or absence of limbs. ... A broad eugenics program would have to be formulated which would aid in the establishment of policies that would encourage able and healthy persons to have several offspring and discourage the unfit from breeding at excessive rates." — Harrison Brown, in The Challenge of Man's Future Planned parenthood has been at the frontline of promoting these ideals in the modern progressive movement and they have been very effective in controlling the AA population.

Recently, he has enraged many of his colleagues in the African-American studies field--especially those campaigning for government reparations for slavery--by insistently reminding them, as he did in a New York Times op-ed last year, that the folks who captured and sold blacks into slavery in the first place were also Africans, working for profit. "People wanted to kill me, man," Gates says of the reaction to that op-ed. "Black people were so angry at me.

The world just isn't like that."" - Henry Louis Gates This is why when an AA woman announces that she has taken the time to #$%$ the candidates by using independent thought tools of reason and logic which results in her choice of Romney, she tarred and feathered by the AA community.

The company listed assets of $459.8 million and debt of $376 million as of Aug. 31 in Chapter 11 documents filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Enlarge image A123 Systems Inc. fell as much as 16 cents, or 70 percent, to 7 cents a share in over-the-counter trading as of 9:43 a.m. Photographer: Jeffrey Sauger/Bloomberg A123 didn’t expect to be on time with an interest payment due yesterday on $143.8 million of notes expiring in 2016, or to make a payment due yesterday on $2.76 million in outstanding 6 percent notes, the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. “The company may not have sufficient cash to fund operations and may need to seek the protections provided under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,” A123 said. The bankruptcy filing may fuel further political debate over government financing of alternative-energy and transportation businesses.

Pathetic!</Title><Msg>Romney will Crush the Coward Obama on this Subject! Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday tried to douse a political firestorm over the deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya, saying she's responsible for the security of American diplomatic outposts. "I take responsibility," Clinton told CNN in an interview while on a visit to Peru. "I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts. The president and the vice president wouldn't be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals. They're the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered decision." But she said an investigation now under way will ultimately determine what happened at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed on September 11. "I take this very personally," Clinton said. "So we're going to get to the bottom of it, and then we're going to do everything we can to work to prevent it from happening again, and then we're going to work to bring whoever did this to us to justice." Clinton: 'I take responsibility' Biden, Ryan debate Benghazi attack Romney: Benghazi was a terrorist attack The attack took place in the eastern Libyan city that was the cradle of that country's 2011 revolution. Obama administration officials initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack. With criticism growing, Vice President Joe Biden said during last week's vice presidential debate that the White House did not know of requests to enhance security at Benghazi, contradicting testimony by State Department employees that requests had been made and rejected. After the debate, the White House said the vice president did not know of the requests because they were handled, as is the practice, by the State Department. Fact Check: Benghazi security "In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion," Clinton said. "And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens." She added, "What I want to avoid is some kind of political gotcha or blame game." "I know that we're very close to an election," Clinton said. "I want to just take a step back here and say from my own experience, we are at our best as Americans when we pull together. I've done that with Democratic presidents and Republican presidents." Her remarks drew a quick response from three Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee, including ranking member John McCain. Clinton's statement of responsibility was "a laudable gesture, especially when the White House is trying to avoid any responsibility whatsoever," the Arizona senator said in a joint broadside with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. However, they added, "The security of Americans serving our nation everywhere in the world is ultimately the job of the commander-in-chief. The buck stops there." Stevens, State Department computer expert Sean Smith and security contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died in the Benghazi assault, which State Department officials now say was the work of dozens of armed men. Clinton also described a desperate scene in the State Department during the hours of the attack, as staff tried to find out what had happened.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350400912419</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:21:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350401271313-21</Id><Topic><Title>Billionaire Koch brother accused of kidnapping</Title><Username>natsu4fun</Username><Timestamp>1350353865915</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:17:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The law is for the little people.

Obama is Cratering!!!!!</Title><Msg>First it was the Rass.. Poll and Now Gallop... what is Obama Scared of, eh? Obama camp attacks Gallup again October 15, 2012 | 6:33 pm 226Comments Joel Gehrke Commentary Writer The Washington Examiner Obama camp attacks Gallup again President Obama’s campaign once again attacked the methodology of Gallup just days after the polling group adjusted their methodology in a way that benefited the president. This time, the criticism came this time from the Obama pollster who mocked the Romney team for debating about the reliability of polls. After Gallup/USA Today released a poll showing Mitt Romney tied with Obama among likely female voters in swing states, Obama pollster Joel Benenson pointed to “deep flaws in Gallup’s likely voter screen” and dismissed the survey as an “extreme outlier.” David Axelrod, Obama’s top campaign strategist, made a similar argument earlier this year. “Gallup is saddled with some methodological problems,” Axelrod tweeted in April, when showed Romney with a five-point lead over the president after trailing throughout March. The difference between Axelrod and Benenson, of course, is that Benenson specifically derided these kinds of comments two weeks ago. “I understand that the Romney campaign feels that they need to talk about the public polls,” he told The Washington Post. “We don’t.” Benenson argued in that interview that black turnout would be just as high this year as it was in 2008. “The notion that this electorate isn’t going to be as diverse as it was is frankly a fantasy,” Benenson said. “That reality may be uncomfortable for the Romney campaign, but this will be an electorate that has been as diverse as the previous four presidential elections.” In light of those remarks, Benenson’s newest criticism of Gallup is a little surprises — and not just because it shows the Obama campaign now feels the need to debate polls. Gallup recently changed their methodology in a way that favored President Obama. “Gallup altered its methodology with a month to go until Election Day,” The Weekly Standard’s Jay Cost observed last week in a discussion of Obama’s surprising leap to a 54 percent job approval rating. “And the result – at least on the job approval question – is a shift in Obama’s favor.”</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350401277525</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:27:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350401719537-23</Id><Title>new theory.....romney is a robot</Title><Msg>this just out...romney may not actually be a human..just a robot programmed by the repub leadership......ROMNEYTRON.....will get the details</Msg><Username>hwardeinhorn</Username><Timestamp>1350401719537</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:35:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350401856386-24</Id><Topic><Title>new theory.....romney is a robot</Title><Username>hwardeinhorn</Username><Timestamp>1350401719537</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:35:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are Such a Nitwit, eh?

Dik's Blue Wall Continuing to Crumble!</Title><Msg>Gov. Mitt Romney has narrowed a 12-point gap with President Barack Obama and now trails the president 50 - 46 percent among Pennsylvania likely voters, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. This compares to a 54 - 42 percent Obama lead in a September 26 survey by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University. In today's survey, men back Romney 54 - 43 percent, compared to a 49 - 48 percent split September 26. Women back Obama 57 - 39 percent, little changed from last month. White voters back Romney 53 - 43 percent while black voters back Obama 97 - 1 percent. White Catholic voters go Republican 56 - 43 percent. Voters with college degrees back the president 54 - 43 percent while voters without degrees are divided with 49 percent for Obama and 47 percent for Romney. Only 7 percent of Pennsylvania likely voters say they might change their mind in the next 21 days. "Gov. Mitt Romney is coming on strong in the Keystone State, especially among white Catholics," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "Pennsylvania voters say Vice President Joseph Biden, a native son and a Catholic, won the debate and is more qualified than U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan to be president. But that doesn't seem to be lifting the top of the ticket." Pennsylvania likely voters say 42 - 37 percent that Pennsylvania-born Vice President Joseph Biden beat U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan in last week's debate. Independent voters say 41 - 35 percent that Biden won. But more than 60 percent of voters say the debate does not affect their presidential vote. Biden is more qualified than Ryan to serve as president, voters say 50 - 42 percent. By a 52 - 45 percent margin, Pennsylvania voters have a favorable opinion of Obama. Romney gets a divided 46 - 44 percent favorability rating.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350406430376</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:53:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350406537710-31</Id><Topic><Title>Desperate Obama Poll Shopping Again...

Aircraft-valuation firm Avitas estimates that all these 787 planes were sold to customers for around $100 million or less. So uni-foul do the math if a 787 that was sold at 100 million( airlines get a huge discount for volume) and cost 400 to 310 million to build what is good about the floodgate of deliveries on planes that make no money in fact cost the shareholder money on each delivery? If they were making money for the shareholder that would be good, but when each plane is losing money? So same problem on the 747 it cost too much by 2 billion over cost plan so the delivery of each 787 and 747 is costing the shareholder money.

Hopefully Eric H. Holder, Jr. has already issued indictments and arrests will soon follow! “Kirby Martensen states he was told by his superiors that he was transferred overseas to Asia so that the Koch company could avoid paying U.S. taxes on some $200,000,000 in profits. Koch, who is David Koch's twin brother, is estimated to be worth $4 billion. He previously made news by reconstructing a replica of an Old West ghost town on the isolated ranch where Martensen and his co-workers were allegedly held. Martensen had a flight booked from Aspen, but was not permitted to travel to the airport, he states, as a local sheriff who worked for the Koch's to "make sure you don't wander off," according to the complaint. He says he was subjected to a several-hour interrogation, fired, held against his will on the property, then forced to fly in a private plane to San Francisco, accompanied by a man he that was armed. Through his privately held companies -- Oxbow Carbon and Huron Carbon -- Bill Koch has given $3 million to the pro-Mitt Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. His more well-known brothers have given substantially more to the effort to elect the Republican presidential candidate.</Msg><Username>clowncramer</Username><Timestamp>1350411157115</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:12:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350411161995-46</Id><Title>boydevan771 thi is not a business advertisement media move on</Title><Msg>PoPosts by "boydevan771" • Is FMCC a sham?

Hamilton likens Boeing's 737 decision to the old McDonnell Douglas mindset. And he blames the "insidious effect" of 787 development problems on Boeing's decision not to come out with an all-new aircraft. Boeing's original plan was to develop the 787, followed by a 737 replacement and then a 777 replacement. However, Hamilton noted, "having insisted on global outsourcing to spread the financial risk, and then fouling up the 787 program so badly, Boeing's entire product development program of leadership has been reduced to being driven by Airbus' A320neo family." With each delivery of the late and over budget 787 and 747 the shareholder actually loses money . Boeing will be bankrupt in five years , with the failure of the 737MAX and the 777X, if the GE-MD mindset is not fixed there is no chance that the two planes will be built on time and within budget</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1350416248211</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:37:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350416512664-64</Id><Topic><Title>Hussein Obama and Van Jones Were Fools on Green Energy...

"BY DANIEL HALPER | OCT 16, 2012 | The Weekly Standard Neera Tanden, a former aide to both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, had this to say about the relationship of the two presidents: Clinton, being Clinton, had plenty of advice in mind and was desperate to impart it. But for the first two years of Obama’s term, the phone calls Clinton kept expecting rarely came. “People say the reason Obama wouldn’t call Clinton is because he doesn’t like him,” observes Tanden. “The truth is, Obama doesn’t call anyone, and he’s not close to almost anyone. It’s stunning that he’s in politics, because he really doesn’t like people. My analogy is that it’s like becoming Bill Gates without liking computers.”</Msg><Username>breck80424</Username><Timestamp>1350432183236</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 20:03:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350435327371-91</Id><Topic><Title>#$%# Jack Welch, and Vote For Obama</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1350435204165</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 20:53:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dik, Sounds Like You and Your Blue Wall are Hurting, eh?</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350435327371</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 20:55:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350435615214-92</Id><Title>Ready, Set, Debate...
