That said, the 2nd Bill of Rights which is the "Right to keep and bear arms" clearly is a right and defined as such. but if you want to buy a gun you better have a picture ID, and in many parts of the US, a whole lot more. Allowing someone to scream fire in a crowded theater when there is none, is not protected by the right of free speech even though it is speech. This limit on the 1st amendment protects free speech for us all much like verifying voters are indeed voters protects the right of voting for us all.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1349243146312</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 01:45:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349248281293-4</Id><Topic><Title>GOP voter laws getting walloped by the courts</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_777</Username><Timestamp>1349224992756</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 20:43:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Care to repeat that in ENGLISH?</Msg><Username>alangonquins_loverboy</Username><Timestamp>1349248281293</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 03:11:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349248476768-5</Id><Topic><Title>Davis Love: Woods and Stricker were worthless.</Title><Username>johnt_baptist</Username><Timestamp>1349103413768</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 10:56:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a political message board and not a golf/sports forum.

(BA) lowered its long-term forecast for global air-cargo market expansion, adding to evidence of a slowdown in the industry. Growth will run at a 5.2 percent annual rate over the next 20 years, Boeing said yesterday in a statement. That’s down from the 5.9 percent rate it forecast in 2010, the last time the Chicago-based planemaker issued its annual projection. “Air-cargo traffic will grow over the long term despite current near-term market weakness and worldwide economic uncertainty,” Boeing said in the statement. “The industry languished following the 2010 recovery posting slight declines in traffic in 2011 and thus far in 2012.” Boeing, the world’s largest maker of jet freighters, issued its forecast a day after the International Air Transport Association said global air-cargo traffic in 2012 would fall 0.4 percent from 2011 levels. That marked a reversal from the trade group’s June projection for growth of 0.3 percent. The world freighter fleet will increase to 3,198 planes by 2031 from 1,738 now, while large freighters will represent 36 percent of the fleet compared with the current 31 percent, Boeing estimated. The forecast reflects global trends in the industry that have changed from two years ago, said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Jefferies &amp; Co. in New York. “The world’s slowing down,” Rubel said in an interview yesterday. “Global economies are not growing as fast. It’s another benchmark that confirms what everybody else has seen or experienced.” Boeing said markets connecting the Asia-Pacific region will continue to lead growth in the air-cargo industry, though it lowered the growth rates for domestic China and intra-Asia traffic to 8 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, from 9.2 percent and 7.9 percent in 2010. Fuel Costs The company said it doesn’t expect fuel costs to move significantly higher than current levels. More efficient planes and infrastructure improvements will also lower the cost of air cargo, the company said. Freight carriers FedEx Corp. (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS) Inc. have struggled with sales growth that has slowed from more than 10 percent in mid-2010 to less than 5 percent in the most recent quarter, and both companies have trimmed full-year profit forecasts. Boeing in July said growth in industry plane deliveries will slow in the next two decades as demand for jumbo jets and freighters declines. The global fleet will expand at less than a fifth of the rate predicted in 2011, Boeing said.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1349266461381</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 08:14:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349269031046-15</Id><Title>How Many Lies Will Obama Tell Tonight?</Title><Msg>Who will he blame for his miserably failed administration.</Msg><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1349269031046</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 08:57:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349269277043-16</Id><Topic><Title>How Many Lies Will Obama Tell Tonight?</Title><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1349269031046</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 08:57:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We know he will never approach the standard set by Paul Ryan at the Repub Convention.

You famously declared, "A democracy requires accountability, and accountability requires transparency." Yet, the very first act of your administration was to violate your transparency pledge to allow full, public viewing of all legislation five days before you signed it. In fact, the White House didn't even post the very first bill you signed -- the 2009 Lilly Ledbetter Act -- until after you signed it. You failed to televise health care negotiations as promised. You cut endless backroom deals protected from public scrutiny. In addition, your administration has routinely evaded disclosure law by meeting with lobbyists off the books at D.C.-area coffee houses and private townhouses, where Secret Service background checks and login routines are abandoned. In August, House GOP investigators unearthed communications at the Department of Energy urging officials to use their personal email accounts instead of government accounts to discuss the massive Solyndra green loan failure -- to protect themselves from subpoenas. And last week, Bloomberg News reported that 19 out of 20 cabinet-level agencies under your administration have failed to follow the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. "During the first year of the administration," the news service found, "cabinet agencies employed exemptions 466,402 times, a 50 percent jump from the last year of the presidency of George W. Bush." Those exemptions remain at levels higher than Bush. How, exactly, can you claim to have run the most transparent administration ever based on your actual record?</Msg><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1349278691174</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 11:38:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349278961469-30</Id><Title>Question for Obama on the Autp Bailout - that won't get asked.</Title><Msg>Your campaign touts the "success" of the government takeover of the auto industry as one of your proudest accomplishments.

Yet, your Treasury Department won't take up GM's recent offer to repurchase 200 million of the roughly 500 million shares the U.S. holds -- because it would incur a $15 billion loss to taxpayers right before the election. GM still owes nearly $30 billion of the $50 billion it received, and its lending arm still owes nearly $15 billion of the more than $17 billion it received. Foreign workers and overseas plants have soaked up billions of American bailout tax dollars. But some 20,000 Delphi non-union workers saw their pensions eroded and health benefits disappear as part of the deal you cut with United Auto Workers. How are Delphi workers, bondholders, car dealers and taxpayers better off now than they were before the Government Motors bailout given the actual record?

In 5 years Boeing will be bankrupt 99% of the profit for Boeing airplanes comes from the 737 at a returen of 5.7% but the 100% cost of the loss id due to the nightmare liner 787 wich accounts for less than 3% of the profits but over 85% of the Boeing company development cost loss in cost to develop. Boeing stock price will never make a shareholder any money, due to the s one collosal failure on the 787 outsourcing business plan,by your employee's in Chicago. While Boeing went from 65 stock price to dollar 70 stock price over several years of dead cat bouncing between mainly 65 to 75 with a two day run of just over 80 once apple stock went from 35 to 700 so it was simple do not own boeing stock or at best your going to lose like this yea to date your stock value from January to October is down 5% compard to the dow jones up 10% year to date In fact because of Boeing a Dow Jones stock is down the Dow jones average is only up 10% year to date, take boeing out of the Dow and the DJ would be up about 12% year to date</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1349285422696</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 13:30:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349286496969-45</Id><Topic><Title>Another large 737 order</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1349276111143</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 10:55:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it's safe to say that the 737 line will be open for some time to come.</Msg><Username>mrstock52</Username><Timestamp>1349286496969</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 13:48:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349286525197-46</Id><Topic><Title>Why is this still a $60/70 stock?</Title><Username>tallicat9300</Username><Timestamp>1349282191852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 12:36:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Waiting at the sidelines for labor contract to settle and next earnings report.</Msg><Username>zosimomaximo</Username><Timestamp>1349286525197</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 13:48:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349287590471-47</Id><Title>Looks like leftist yahoo is going all out to post leftist lies.....SHAMEFUL YAHOO</Title><Msg>No wonder yahoo is faced with all kinds of problems......They have a bunch of idiots running it.</Msg><Username>drwstring</Username><Timestamp>1349287590471</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 14:06:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349288330797-48</Id><Topic><Title>If Obama wins many Boeing employees will be cut</Title><Username>courdeleon02</Username><Timestamp>1349281882076</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 12:31:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The main point is lets unload obama,this is our country you kno....ks</Msg><Username>kingslmon6</Username><Timestamp>1349288330797</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 14:18:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349288428019-49</Id><Topic><Title>How Many Lies Will Obama Tell Tonight?</Title><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1349269031046</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 08:57:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MANY....

The SPEEA union knows if the company wants extra time to set up the other operations or to build parts this is the standard way to avoid any layoff with unemployment compensation. the SPEEA workers are just going to enjoy their time off and go on vacations .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1349291404010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 15:10:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349291463051-53</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Must Now Be Considered For Inclusion On Mount Rushmore</Title><Username>sir_paul_mccartney55</Username><Timestamp>1349224719395</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 20:38:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is no coal on Mt.

In a October 1 New York Times op-ed, columnist David Brooks advised Romney to say that the economy is worse now than it was in 2011: ____________________________________________ The Obama administration, which is either hostile to or aloof from business, has made a thousand tax, regulatory and spending decisions that are biased away from growth and biased toward other priorities. American competitiveness has fallen in each of the past four years, according to the World Economic Forum. Medical device makers, for example, are being chased overseas. The economy in 2012 is worse than the economy in 2011. That's inexcusable.

According to Romney, the company packed workers into crowded dormitories behind barbed wire, while paying them a tiny fraction of American wages. Conditions were so bad that they had suicide nets installed.The nets were installed to avoid the payment of a suicide penalty imposed by the Chinese Government! The clips of Romney describing the Chinese factory appear to be from the same event in which Romney suggests all Obama supporters receive government handouts. In the video, Romney describes life at the factory as harsh: When I was back in my private equity days, we went to China to buy a factory there. It employed about 20,000 people. And they were almost all young women between the ages of about 18 and 22 or 23. And as we were walking through this facility, seeing them work, the number of hours they worked per day, the pittance they earned, living in dormitories with little bathrooms at the end of maybe 10 rooms. And the rooms, they had 12 girls per room, three bunk beds on top of each other. You’ve seen, you’ve seen them? And around this factory was a fence, a huge fence with barbed wire and guard towers. And we said gosh, I can’t believe that you, you know, keep these girls in. These must probably be the kind of jobs Romney wants to give to the 47%!</Msg><Username>gofish1946</Username><Timestamp>1349300947588</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 17:49:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349301156529-83</Id><Topic><Title>US Debt Soars To $16,159,487,013,300.35, +$93 Billion in Deficit Spending for Sept.</Title><Username>ppedroli</Username><Timestamp>1349296205151</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 16:30:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Somebody hijacked Peedroool's account.

In view of the Syrian regime’s recent aggressive acts at NATO’s southeastern border, which are a flagrant breach of international law and a clear and present danger to the security of one of its Allies, the North Atlantic Council met today, within the framework of Article 4 of the Washington Treaty, and discussed the continuous shelling of locations in Turkey adjacent to the Turkish-Syrian border by the Syrian regime forces. The most recent shelling on 3 October 2012, which caused the death of five Turkish citizens and injured many, constitutes a cause of greatest concern for, and is strongly condemned by, all Allies. In the spirit of indivisibility of security and solidarity deriving from the Washington Treaty, the Alliance continues to stand by Turkey and demands the immediate cessation of such aggressive acts against an Ally, and urges the Syrian regime to put an end to flagrant violations of international law. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister, "Syria must be made to account for the incident and there must be a response under international law."

Whatever Happened to Truth? Pat Caddell: Media Have Become An "Enemy Of The American People" In recent remarks to an AIM conference, "ObamaNation: A Day of Truth," former Democratic pollster and analyst Pat Caddell said, "I think we're at the most dangerous time in our political history in terms of the balance of power in the role that the media plays in whether or not we maintain a free democracy." Caddell noted that while First Amendment protections were originally provided to the press so they would protect the liberty and freedom of the public from "organized governmental power," they had clearly relinquished the role of impartial news providers. Nowhere was this more evident than during the tragic death of a U.S. ambassador in Libya that was lied about for nine days, because the press and the administration did not want to admit it was a terrorist attack.

"Mechanical approach to quoting the Bible"? That is an interesting response. Here is the problem, guys. Why are we here? Thomas Paine takes 2700 pages to concoct his version of that purpose based upon his "reasoning". Now, I am not saying that he is dumb by any measure, but we must also understand that humans take the form of Simple to Genius. I can only guess where you place me, but, in the end, only God really knows. And, it really does not matter. Why are we here? And why do we only live some one-half billionth of the supposed existence of the universe? If we are a creation of God, and we have some "thing" that is worthy to be done on this earth, why so short a life? A careful study of the Bible (the whole Bible, despite Chris' apparent implication that Revelation can be ignored) is a sweeping end-to-end account of the creation and purpose of that creation. From the beginning to the end. The Bible is 66 books with about 40 authors (some portions are authors unknown), with its writing spanning 1400 years, and is self-consistent, with a few minor scribal discrepancies. Thousands of ancient copies of the New Testament dating back to 100 AD show that what we have today is what they had back then. The Dead Scrolls show that the Old Testament is just as trustworthy. No other writing of man, religious or otherwise, commands this level of completeness, consistency, and perfection. If we stop for one moment and consider: knowing that God created this unfathomable universe, requiring the authorship of the laws of physics and through equally unfathomable power, would He have simply “plopped” us on this earth without any notion of the reason behind our existence, perhaps to see “what we would do”? Does He not know everything, “by definition”. Thus, with no knowledge gained from a simple-minded exercise to place humans into the earth’s “zoo”, one must conclude that a Being of infinite and perfect power and intelligence is also a Being of perfect purpose. The zoo theory simply does not fit. It is reasonable to believe then that God gave us the Bible to convey what is our purpose and His expectations are for us. And it provides answers from the simple to the complex, with sufficient depth to provide a lifetime of study, you are correct Hooz. Now, why are we here? Solomon, purported to be the wisest of all humans, stated simply, "Fear God and keep His commandments." That theme is repeated throughout. So, why are we here? Hooz, I am sure that you believe that your main purpose, if I may, is to see that Obama is re-elected. He may very well do so, and then what? What will your purpose be then? The entire Bible is dedicated to one thing - to bring man into an eternal relationship with God. And that was made possible only through the sin forgiving act of Jesus’ death on the cross and resurrection. And, as He said, maybe this is what you mean by “mechanical”, “He that believes on the Son is not condemned, but he that believes not is condemned already.” Now, either Jesus was messing with our minds or He was telling us that it is a no-compromise proposition. And the consequences are eternal. The reason we are here is to make a decision to believe in Him and that literally only takes some few moments of one’s life to verbalize that in prayer to God. And, yes, I do make mistakes. However, I do not purposely convey error in my “interpretation” of the Bible. I am glad that I got your attention, though it likely caused some gas.
