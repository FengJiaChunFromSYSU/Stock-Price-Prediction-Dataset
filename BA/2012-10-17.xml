Rather than bring the races, classes, and genders together, he gave us #$%$-versus-them crusade against the “1 percenters” and the job creators who had not “paid their fair share,” accusations of a Republican “war on women,” and the worst racial polarization in modern memory. Statesmanship degenerated into chronic blame-gaming and “Bush did it,” as he piled up over $5 trillion in new debt. Financial sobriety was abandoned in favor of creating new entitlement constituencies, and job creation was deemed far less important than nationalizing the health-care system. And so here we are, three weeks before the election, with a squandered presidency and a president desperately seeking reelection not by defending his record, but by demonizing his predecessor, his opponent — and half of the country. What, then, was Obama’s first term? Jimmy Carter’s ends justifying Richard Nixon’s means.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1350479897141</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:18:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350480294764-41</Id><Topic><Title>A Presidency Squandered</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1350479897141</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:18:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Telling it like it is.

The two tallest sky scrapers were reduced to rubble, thousands died, the stock market fell, the country was plunged into 2.5 wars that are still running. Not a single Republican rep questioned the cover-up, and over time more and more citizens are skeptical about the story they were given. In 2004 nobody made it an election issue.

He’s always been there, surfacing briefly at the Republican National Convention to implausibly claim that he has always believed wife Ann’s job raising their sons “was a lot more important than mine”—as if Romney sincerely believed that for decades he pursued a less important career path. For the most part, however, Mitt the Man had been under wraps until he emerged in full-force at Hofstra University. Just who is he? Mitt the Man gets his way by talking over you and not stopping until you give in so he can make his point. Which he may have forgotten by then, because getting his way was the point. Mitt the Man can go from charming to testy in two seconds flat because while he has tolerated you as a female colleague, he will not allow you to disrespect him and his authoritah! Mitt the Man is not self-aware enough to realize that he can be easily goaded and that you are pushing his buttons. Mitt the Man feels sorry for you as a single parent and your sure-to-be-screwed-up kids. Mitt the Man cannot help but disappoint you because his chivalry is all about saying the right thing as opposed to doing the right thing. It’s fair to say that Mitt the Man did not have a great evening on Tuesday. He bragged about filling positions in his state cabinet by consulting “whole binders full of women,” sounding amazed that so many smart, qualified women existed while also calling to mind the days when men selected their mail-order brides from plastic binders of photos. He talked about how in a Romney administration, employers would be so “anxious” to hire good workers that they might even consider women. He fumbled an otherwise reasonable point about the connection between family structure and poverty (one key reason most anti-poverty advocates support family planning, sex education, access to contraception) by managing to sound like he was blaming single moms for horrific gun violence. Support thought-provoking, quality journalism. Join The New Republic for $3.99/month. (Rhetorical flubs aside, Romney also failed to substantively and accurately address many issues concerning women. The binder story came up only as Romney sought to avoid answering a question about whether women deserve equal pay for equal work. Perhaps he wanted to avoid sounding like his GOP colleague Sen. Scott Brown, who earlier this year called pay equity “job-killing burdens.” Regardless, Romney’s ability to identify and hire qualified women is as irrelevant to the issue of equal pay as his compassion for fellow Mormons is to the impact of gutting anti-poverty programs.) But mostly, Mitt the Man interrupted and ignored the evening’s most prominent woman, moderator Candy Crowley of CNN. In one particularly uncomfortable exchange, Crowley attempted to get Romney to explain his arithmetic for massive-tax-cut + increased-defense-spending + closing-of-unspecified-tax-loopholes + cuts-to-PBS-and-Planned-Parenthood = lowered deficit. “If somehow when you get in [the White House], there isn’t enough tax revenue coming in, if somehow the numbers don’t add up,” asked Crowley, “would you be willing to look again at a 20 percent…” “Well, OF COURSE, they add up,” interrupted a visibly annoyed Romney. “I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years and balanced the budget. I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget. I ran the state of Massachusetts, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.” The dismissive lecture Romney gave Crowley was devastating—but not in the way he intended. He defended his honor as a businessman, but at the cost of reminding undecided women of every man who ever made them feel stupid or who cut them down just to win an argument. A popular theory to explain Romney’s rise in the polls over the past two weeks is that undecided women flocked to him after his performance in the first presidential debate. The Romney campaign certainly seems to think it has a good chance of winning over those voters—the candidate trotted out a new new position on abortion last week, and on Tuesday the campaign released a television ad casting Romney as a moderate on abortion and birth control issues. Romney made special mention of “women living in poverty” on Tuesday evening. And during the debate, Americans for Prosperity even tweeted one of my columns that criticized Obama for relying mostly on male senior advisors. There are still three weeks before Election Day, when we’ll learn the size of the gender gap between the two candidates. But if those undecided women end up pulling the lever for Democrats, the Romney camp will end up wishing Mitt the Man had stayed out of sight.</Msg><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1350490767908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:19:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350490777435-77</Id><Title>When did Rmoney call the attack in Benghazi an act of terrorism?</Title><Msg>Oh, that's right not till long after president Obama did in the Rose garden!

Arguably, Romney's weakest moment was the Libya "gotcha," where Obama and the moderator appeared to expose the Republican as misinformed and flailing. But fact-checkers and the moderator herself have since backed up Romney's point, which will surely be revisited in next week's final debate. The Romney campaign is likely quite pleased with how the evening played out: Voters who tuned in saw that Denver wasn't a fluke, recognized that Romney's for real, and confirmed that they trust him substantially more on the number one issue of this election.

Q: Can you — have you called it a terrorist attack before? Have you said that? MR. CARNEY: I haven’t, but – I mean, people attacked our embassy. It’s an act of terror by definition. Q: Yes, I just hadn’t heard you – MR. CARNEY: It doesn’t have to do with what date it occurred. Q: No, I just hadn’t heard the White House say that this was an act of terrorism or a terrorist attack. MR. CARNEY: I don’t think the fact that we hadn’t is not — as our NCTC Director testified yesterday, a number of different elements appear to have been involved in the attack, including individuals connected to militant groups that are prevalent in eastern Libya, particularly in the Benghazi area. We are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to al Qaeda or al Qaeda’s affiliates, in particular al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Carney's statement above came eight days after President Obama spoke about the attack in the Rose Garden on 9/12. Last night, President Obama claimed he referred to the attack in Benghazi as terrorism during his Rose Garden remarks. Carney's statement above, Romney's rebuttal last night and Obama's own words prove otherwise.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1350494882963</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:28:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350494905800-104</Id><Topic><Title>A.

Part of that fog was reflected in Obama's speech in the Rose Garden on 12 Sept. Not only did he mention "an act of terror", though towards the end of his speech, he also mentioned in nearly the same breath, "And make no mistake, we will work with the Libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people. Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no justification for this type of senseless violence. None." A reasonable person would conclude that Obama wanted to portray (consistent with every other statement coming out of the White House) that the "act of terror" was related to the video that denigrat(ed) the religious beliefs of others." That is clearly a reference to the Mohammad video. To somehow take Obama's nebulous statement and claim that he was specifically claiming that the attack was an act of terrorISM - which was known to be true by the time he stepped out into the garden - is revisionist. He had every intent of skirting or downplaying the concept of a terroist attack and blame it instead on the video, which was patently false.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1350494905800</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:28:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350494926932-105</Id><Title>Mitt Romney: The Lazy Liar</Title><Msg>What's most surprising about Republican distortions is how easily they're disproved ~ J Bernstein</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350494926932</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:28:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350494987569-106</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt the Jerk: a Woman’s View of the Debate</Title><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1350490767908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:19:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which non-radical muslim country are we hated by besides the N.

After all, if the president is a Kenyan socialist intent on destroying the United States, it’s hardly necessary to explain exactly where his policies are going wrong or why. ...But it also shows up in their basic rhetoric. Why put together a critique of Barack Obama’s foreign policy when they can just refer to unspecified disasters and know that anyone watching Fox News will nod in agreement? And thus we get Paul Ryan’s astonishingly substance-free line that “What we are witnessing, as we turn on our television screens these days, is the absolute unraveling of the Obama foreign policy.” ... A minor problem with all of this is that it leaves Republicans ill-equipped to convince anyone of anything unless they’re already within the conservative closed-information feedback loop. Minor, because most voting decisions are more about retrospective evaluations of incumbents than about careful examination of the logic in campaign statements, to the sheer laziness of the critique probably doesn’t matter very much at that point. ....The major problem, however, is that all of this lazy thinking leaves Republicans ill-equipped to govern – as seen in the problems encountered by the Gingrich Congress, the George W. Bush administration and now the Boehner/Ryan House. And that matters a lot.

Obama is correct. Romney lied repeatedly</Title><Msg>The following is a transcript of President Obama's remarks on Sept. 12, 2012, following attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens. OBAMA: Good morning. Every day all across the world, American diplomats and civilians work tirelessly to advance the interests and values of our nation. Often, they are away from their families. Sometimes, they brave great danger. Yesterday, four of these extraordinary Americans were killed in an attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi. Among those killed was our ambassador, Chris Stevens, as well as Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith. We are still notifying the families of the others who were killed. And today, the American people stand united in holding the families of the four Americans in our thoughts and in our prayers. The United States condemns in the strongest terms this outrageous and shocking attack. We're working with the government of Libya to secure our diplomats. I've also directed my administration to increase our security at diplomatic posts around the world. And make no mistake, we will work with the Libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people. Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no justification for this type of senseless violence. None. The world must stand together to unequivocally reject these brutal acts. Already many Libyans have joined us in doing so, and this attack will not break the bonds between the United States and Libya. Libyan security personnel fought back against the attackers alongside Americans. Libyans helped some of our diplomats find safety, and they carried Ambassador Stevens' body to the hospital, where we tragically learned that he had tied. It's especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi because it is a city that he helped to save. At the height of the Libyan revolution Chris led our diplomatic post in Benghazi. With characteristic skill, courage and resolve he built partnerships with Libyan revolutionaries and helped them as they planned to build a new Libya. When the Qaddafi regime came to an end Chris was there to serve as our ambassador to the new Libya, and he worked tirelessly to support this young democracy. And I think both Secretary Clinton and I have relied deeply on his knowledge of the situation on the ground there. He was a role model to all who worked with him and to the young diplomats who aspire to walk in his footsteps. Along with his colleagues, Chris died in a country that is still striving to emerge from the recent experience of war. As (ph) today the loss of these four Americans is fresh, but our memories of them linger on. I have no doubt that their legacy will live on through the work that they did far from our shores and in the hearts of those who loved them back home. Of course, yesterday was already a painful day for our nation as we marked the solemn memory of the 9/11 attacks. We mourn with the families who were lost on that day. I visited the graves of troops who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan at the hallowed grounds of Arlington Cemetery, and had the opportunity to say thank you and visit some of our wounded warriors at Walter Reed. And then last night we learned the news of this attack in Benghazi. As Americans let us never, ever forget that our freedom is only sustained because there are people who are willing to fight for it, to stand up for it, and in some cases lay down their lives for it. Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those, both civilian and military, who represent us around the globe. No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn for more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done. But we also know that the lives these Americans led stand in stark contrast to those of their attackers. These four Americans stood up for freedom and human dignity. They should give every American great pride in the country that they served, and the hope that our flag represents to people around the globe who also yearn to live in freedom and with dignity. We grieve with their families, but let us carry on their memory and let us continue their work in seeking a stronger America and a better world for all of our children. Thank you. May God bless the memory of those we lost, and may God bless the United States of America.

By the time that president Obama gave his speech in the Rose garden concerning the attack on our embassies as being "an act of terror", there was only one other press release by the White House in regards to the demonstarations and attacks, unlike Mittens, the religous-cultist and neo-conned backed windsock, and it does not support your illogical and biased conclusions. When did Romney come out and declare that the attack on Bengahzi was an "act of terror", it wasn't before President Obama's most 'un-nebulous' speech in the Rose Garden, in fact I don't know if Romney ever specifically uttered such a statement until the debates. Most everyone with an ounce of 'smarts' knows that Romeny was wrong to make his press-release late in the night of the demonstartions and attacks, but he also acted un-presidential in doing so without knowing the FACTS! Same as last in the debate. If it's about honesty and credibility, then Romney consistently fails on both accounts. Perhaps it has something to do with the long-standing issues about his personality/being, his cultist-religion, his silver-spooned upbring, or just his plain old-fashioned biases/prejudices rearing their ugly head over and over again due to his genetic make-up.

He exaggerated the decline in permits and ignored the fact total oil production on federal lands and offshore has increased 12 percent during Obama’s term. •On defense spending Obama said Romney “wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs, even though the military’s not asking for them.” The problem is the military did not weigh in. •Romney claimed to support Pell grants while backing the Ryan Budget that makes it harder to qualify for them. •Romney claimed “I’m going to get us to a balanced budget”, arguably the biggest lie in the entire debate. Ryan's budget will not balance until 2040 by CBO estimates. Paul offered a reasonable way to balance the budget in 5 years but it received a total of 7 votes in the senate. •On coal jobs, Romney and Obama were each half-right. •On payroll tax cuts, Obama made the second biggest lie of the debate, claiming to continue $3,600 in middle-class tax cuts. After the debate, a White House spokesman confirmed the president has not yet said if he supports continuing those tax cuts. •Romney made misleading statements on job creation. •Obama overstated findings of a report on Romney's international corporate tax proposal.

Each of those just cited claimed that the attack was "spontaneous", "from a demonstration", "related to Cairo", and "related to the Mohammad video". As I said, "a reasonable person" who actually pays attention to the news would conclude that Obama was either of the "belief" or of the "contempt for the truth" that the attack was due to the video - though no facts ever supported that contention. Even the State Department (professionals, not politicians) denied that they EVER said that the video was at play in Benghazi. Fortunately, Candy Crowley was there to punt for the President to short circuit reveling his patently blatant lies to the American public.

The less worse news , the 767 and the 777 will make money as they were designed and built by SPEEA and IAM workers with much less "cheap out source"- failure. It is the GE-MD Chicago group Managment fail- think. Now the 737 a more Union invested SPEEA and IAM designed and built 737 is the only money maker of substance for the commerical side of Boeing. The 98% of Boeing net revenue on the one plane that makes money , the 737 will change with the 737MAX. the 737 MAX is just another 787 dreamliner failure with the same GE-MD dreamliner group think failure managers in charge. The same problem exsists with the 777X if any shareholder thinks they will see 90 stock price they are dremlinining too. You need to trade daily now to make any money JRCC up as much as 9% today shold short yesterday 10% last week JRCc up 60% simple , just do not hold a stock long term like boeing for the year BA is part of the DOW which is up over 10% for the year while Boeing in 10 months has made you .48 of 1% that did not keep you up with the cost of living a foolish investment . No real plane orders left the 787 is going backwards and the 737 is at the end of its life!</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1350503109719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:45:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350503465832-134</Id><Topic><Title>BA Yahoo Finance charts - all on one screen - for free</Title><Username>kevininthecity72</Username><Timestamp>1350496135209</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:48:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks, I tried this out just now and it is nice.</Msg><Username>frozencustardking</Username><Timestamp>1350503465832</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:51:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350503628602-135</Id><Title>Obama/Biden 3-0 in the debates, same as Detroit against the Yankees</Title><Msg>but the series ain't over until the republican wimps concede</Msg><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1350503628602</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:53:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350503882527-136</Id><Topic><Title>Obama/Biden 3-0 in the debates, same as Detroit against the Yankees</Title><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1350503628602</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:53:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you like watching 4 adults act like 12 year olds.</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1350503882527</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:58:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350504008941-137</Id><Topic><Title>A.

The statement of disrespecting other's religion was directly related to his statement of right and wrong relative to the attack. The "act of terror" comment was not as clearly stated as to context. I suspect that Obama's team has been scouring every word he has spoken looking for an "out" from his obfuscation and apparent deception - like lawyers who pour over patent disclosures for any nuance of "protection". Regardless of that speech the morning after, he and his team delcared that the attack was spontaneous and only related to the video. So, really, does it matter what he "might" have said the next morning, given his erroneous statements thereafter - for several weeks? By the way, Candy Crowley now says the President was wrong and Romney was right: "He (Romney) was right in the main. I just think he picked the wrong word".

According to the CNN debate clock, President Obama spoke at greater length than Mitt Romney during both debates, as did Vice President Biden during his debate with Paul Ryan. In the first debate, Obama spoke for 3 minutes, 14 seconds more than Romney — which means he got 8 percent more talking time than Romney. In last night’s debate, Obama spoke for 4 minutes and 18 seconds longer than Romney, giving him 11 percent more talking time. Obama talked for 52 percent of the time when either man had the floor, while Romney talked for 47 percent. During the vice presidential debate, the gap wasn’t as wide: Biden spoke for 1 minute, 22 seconds more than Ryan. Still, that gave Biden 3 percent more speaking time than Ryan.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1350511311398</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:01:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350511485468-182</Id><Topic><Title>Good Job President Obama !!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350484223570</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 10:30:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't know about that.

A new study from Washington University in St. Louis finds that under Obama, many black Americans feel less free than whites when it comes to political participation. From 2005 to 2011, only 45 percent of blacks said they believed the government would allow them to make a public speech, while 67 percent of whites believed they could, the study found. The study found that while the election of Obama initially boosted feelings of political empowerment among black Americans, those sentiments significantly faded in the years that followed—especially among conservative and religious blacks.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1350512181195</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:16:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350512379887-190</Id><Title>Hi; I'm Not Dick Hertz</Title><Msg>I'm not Gay, a Welfare bum or someone insane enough to be an Obama supporter.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1350512379887</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:19:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350512433255-191</Id><Title>Maybe bulky-blob, imacon, tedlovesmax etc. would like to join The Marines</Title><Msg>to help protect our embassies around the world is 'light-duty, even on the anniversary of the bush43 //911 but then a.

Even GS is up 38% this year to date . So no brains no gains move out of Boeing and make some money. SPEEA strike comming will dump the BA stock price and Chicago land Bosses are more than willing to play hardball with your investment stock price, they are in the mold of GE-MD dreamliner mode, so far 50% of the Boeing Market has gone to Airbus , and China will have the 737 killer on line by 2015 , that will take the last money maker of substance away from Boeing 98% of the profit is the old union made and designed 737 pre the "cheap outsourcing dreamliner fail" nothing going forward but more fail on the cheap outsource 737MAX and the 777X no rreason to stay with a dead cat bounce stock like BA 65 to 75 and repeat for 15 years Too bad it take way too long for that range to move , we are getting close to the 75 and down we go, too many sellers waiting to get out at 75 or more they want out. .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1350531172159</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:32:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350531413197-220</Id><Topic><Title>The night they drove old dixie down</Title><Username>spartaloon</Username><Timestamp>1350528838412</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 22:53:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bread n' roses and some m.c. showed up with the old arrow through head routine... between sets glad i went but still do not know why and laughed and enjoyed the music the night they drove old dixie down</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1350531413197</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:36:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350532469633-221</Id><Topic><Title>The night they drove old dixie down</Title><Username>spartaloon</Username><Timestamp>1350528838412</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 22:53:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hint: the republic stands united states not an oligarchy or a plutocracy the night they drove old dixie down all the bells were ringin' with Obama /Biden in 2012</Msg><Username>spartaloon</Username><Timestamp>1350532469633</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:54:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
