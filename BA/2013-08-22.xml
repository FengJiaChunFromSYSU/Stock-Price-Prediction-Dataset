It’s their modus operandi. They imprison whistleblowers. They try to criminalize journalism.” Greenwald, the man who facilitated Edward Snowden’s NSA leaks writes. “And that’s just their recent behavior with regard to press freedoms: it’s to say nothing of all the invasions, bombings, renderings, torture and secrecy abuses for which that bullying, vengeful duo is responsible over the last decade.” he adds. Greenwald also slams establishment journalists for cowardly submitting to authoritarian tactics: “…The minute anyone refuses to meekly submit to that, or stands up to it, hordes of authoritarians – led by state-loyal journalists – immediately start objecting: how dare you raise your voice to the empire? How dare you not politely curtsey to the Queen and thank the UK government for what they have done.” he writes. “…They believe in subservient journalism, not adversarial journalism. I only believe in the latter.” Greenwald asserts. He backed up those comments in a riveting CNN interview last night: “If you want to start criminalizing (journalism), it means that you’re asking, as a citizen, to be kept ignorant and to allow people in power to conceal what they’re doing behind a wall of secrecy and to have no accountability or transparency,” he said. “Journalism is not a crime and it is not terrorism.”</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377146245278</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 00:37:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377146280485-3</Id><Topic><Title>The Kent Coward will hate this one about subservient Journailsm defending the Empire !!!</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377146245278</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 00:37:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Greenwald added that every single major news organisation in the world has classified information. “Reporting on what governments do in secret is what journalism is about.” he stated. “So if you want to support the idea that states can just go and confiscate from journalists classified information, you should be demanding that your government go physically into newsrooms and seize whatever classified information is there,” he continued. While stating that he had no direct evidence that the US government was involved in the detention of his partner David Miranda at Heathrow airport, Greenwald stated that he was “disturbed” that U.S. officials didn’t intervene. “I don’t have evidence that the U.S. government ordered it,” he said. “But I’m very disturbed that my own government was aware of this foreign country’s intent to detain my partner and did nothing to discourage it or to protect the right of free press guaranteed in the First Amendment of The Constitution, or did anything else to protect the rights that we both have as human beings and that I have as an American and as a journalist.” “Clearly, the U.S. government was perfectly happy to see this happen,” he asserted.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377146280485</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 00:38:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377168982819-4</Id><Title>Air Force: Not Enough Drone Operators for Expanding Fleet</Title><Msg>Air Force: Not Enough Drone Operators for Expanding Fleet RT August 21, 2013 The US Air Force is now facing a shortage in the number of pilots able to operate the military’s quickly expanding drone fleet, according to a new report published by a top Washington, DC, think tank. According to Air Force Colonel Bradley Hoagland, who contributed to a recent report on the Air Force’s drone program prepared by the Brookings Institution, it is quickly hitting a wall in the number of operators for its 159 Predators, 96 Reapers and 23 Global Hawks. Although the US military aimed to train 1,120 ‘traditional’ pilots along with 150 specialized drone pilots in 2012, it proved unable to meet the latter, owing to a lack of RPA (or remotely piloted aircraft) volunteers. A recent report by AFP placed the Air Force’s current drone pilot wing at 1,300, about 8.5 percent of the air corps’ pilots. Still, an increasing number of uses for America’s drone fleet, including recently-revealed plans by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for drones able to operate from naval vessels, have quickly exceeded the Air Force’s ability to train personnel to train and pilot unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). One of the biggest hurdles faced by the Air Force drone program is a high rate of attrition among its pilots, which is three times higher than that of traditional aircraft pilots. Underpinning that rate of personnel loss are low potential for advancement, owing to the drone fleet’s high frequency of CAPs, or combat air patrols. Compared to traditional manned aircraft, it usually takes three to four drones to constitute what the Air Force considers a combat air patrol. Ultimately, drone operators face a punishing rotation, with little time left for additional education and training leading to rank advancement.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377168982819</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 06:56:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377169526435-5</Id><Title>A LIBERAL used to mean Marching for freedom with Martin Luther King !</Title><Msg>Now it means being subservient to a secretive Government, Drone strikes that Kill brown people without a declaration of war, aborting African American children at record rates and believing the constitution is passé...... and THEN telling everyone how kool and Trendy and "Rock Star like" the President and main supporter of all this is....and if you disagree...you MUST be racist !!!!</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377169526435</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 07:05:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377170836244-6</Id><Topic><Title>Sharpton and Obama Silent on Murder of White Baseball Player By Three "Bored" Black Teenagers</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1377102054072</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-21 12:20:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The former head of the Black Panthers was even saying Obama is a Racist.....go figure</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377170836244</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 07:27:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377172103410-7</Id><Topic><Title>GALLUP: Unemployment Spikes to 8.9%...</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1377118226628</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-21 16:50:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Polly want a cracker ?</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377172103410</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 07:48:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377175289974-8</Id><Title>Criminal Bradley Manning wants to now be a woman named Chelsea</Title><Msg>Is it his fantasy to be the Clinton's daughter?

You are incorrect. You now need to go back and collect the facts. One of the boys had tweeted, "90% of white ppl are nasty. #HATE THEM." and "Ayeee I knocced out 5 woods since Zimmerman court!:)" "Woods" is apparently a derisive/divisive/racist term for white people. Look it up in the urban dictionary. The fact that one of the three idiots was non-black does not change the motive. I see three evils here: 1) murder; 2) hating someone for their God given differences; and 3) seeing racism where it does not exist and ignoring it where it does. The Rev. Jackson has now chimed in: he said in a tweet Wednesday that he was "praying for the family of Chris Lane. This senseless violence is frowned upon and the justice system must prevail." If only the Rev. Jackson and the Rev Sharpton had simply only prayed for the Martin family and the nation regarding Trayvon's death as opposed to opining the faux racism of Zimmerman and thus fanning the flames of hatred, then it is very likely that Chris Lane would be alive today. There is blood on Jackson and Sharpton's and the President's hands.

He was a determined opponent of the regime from its first days. Two days after Hitler was installed as Chancellor, as Bonhoeffer delivered a radio address in which he attacked Hitler and warned Germany against slipping into an idolatrous cult of the Führer (leader), who could very well turn out to be Verführer (mis-leader, or seducer), he was cut off the air in the middle of a sentence, though it is unclear whether the newly elected #$%$ regime was responsible.[15] In April, Bonhoeffer raised the first voice for church resistance to Hitler's persecution of Jews, declaring that the church must not simply "bandage the victims under the wheel, but jam the spoke in the wheel itself." [16] In November 1932 (before the #$%$ takeover), there had been an election for presbyters and synodals (church officials) of the German Landeskirche (Protestant established churches). This election was marked by a struggle within the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church between the nationalistic German Christian movement and Young Reformers — a struggle which threatened to explode into schism. Hitler now unconstitutionally imposed new church elections in July 1933. Bonhoeffer put all his efforts into the election, campaigning for the selection of independent, non-#$%$ officials. Despite Bonhoeffer's efforts, in the rigged July election an overwhelming majority of key church positions went to #$%$-supported German Christians.[17] The German Christians won a majority in the general synod of the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church and all its provincial synods except Westphalia, and in synods of all other Protestant church bodies, except for the Lutheran churches of Bavaria, Hanover, and Württemberg. These bodies the non-#$%$ opposition regarded as uncorrupted "intact churches", as opposed to the other so-called "destroyed churches."</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1377180437249</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 10:07:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377180491027-24</Id><Topic><Title>NO MORE DICKWAYNEDICK?</Title><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1377138796286</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-21 22:33:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He must have figured out how to get on airbust message board!!!

Here's a refresher: The White House dismisses such examples as "anecdotal." Jason Furman, chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisors, said, “We are seeing no systematic evidence that the Affordable Care Act is having an adverse impact on job growth or the number of hours employees are working. … [S]ince the ACA became law, nearly 90 percent of the gain in employment has been in full-time positions.” I've already debunked this argument using Gallup's poll of business owners and raw statistics from the former Bureau of Labor Statistics chief; now Reuters adds another relevant data point into the mix: Faltering economic growth at home and abroad and concern that President Barack Obama's signature health care law will drive up business costs are behind the wariness about taking on full-time staff, executives at staffing and payroll firms say. Employers say part-timers offer them flexibility. If the economy picks up, they can quickly offer full-time work. If orders dry up, they know costs are under control. It also helps them to curb costs they might face under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Executives at several staffing firms told Reuters that the law, which requires employers with 50 or more full-time workers to provide healthcare coverage or incur penalties, was a frequently cited factor in requests for part-time workers. A decision to delay the mandate until 2015 has not made much of a difference in hiring decisions, they added. Even more meaningless anecdotes? Meanwhile, UPS has made an Obamacare-induced business decision that will negatively impact at least 15,000 of their employees' families: United Parcel Service Inc. plans to remove thousands of spouses from its medical plan because they are eligible for coverage elsewhere. The Atlanta-based logistics company points to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, as a big reason for the decision, reports Kaiser Health News. The decision comes as many analysts are downplaying the Affordable Care Act's effect on companies such as UPS, noting that the move reflects a long-term trend of shrinking corporate medical benefits, Kaiser Health News reports. But UPS repeatedly cites Obamacare to explain the decision, adding fuel to the debate over whether it erodes traditional employer coverage, Kaiser says. Rising medical costs, “combined with the costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, have made it increasingly difficult to continue providing the same level of health care benefits to our employees at an affordable cost,” UPS said in a memo to employees. "If you like your plan, you can keep your plan." Except when you can't. Explicitly because of this law. Due to the havoc Obamacare is wreaking, some employees may actually start begging their employers not to offer affordable, reliable health coverage. What's driving this bizarre development? Perverse incentives and legislative malpractice, that's what -- via CNBC: Just imagine saying this to your boss: "Don't offer me health insurance benefits." Those apparently bizarre words might actually end up being uttered next year because of a quirk in Obamacare that could financially penalize a number of workers and their families. That quirk means that for some people, it will be more economical to have an employer not offer health insurance subsidies for them and their families—and for the entire family to then instead be able to buy insurance with government subsidies on the Obamacare state health exchanges.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1377183043816</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 10:50:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377183836184-30</Id><Title>"If You Like Your Insurance You can Keep it"......except when you can't</Title><Msg>In their haste to pass their bill, Democrats created a harmful loophole wherein a "covered" employee's family is hung out to dry and ineligible for affordable healthcare either through the private sector or the government. (2) We're now seeing cases where low-wage workers are being offered "affordable" coverage at work, even though those rates are still out of reach for them in reality. Then, because they've been offered government-approved coverage through their employer, those workers are rendered ineligible to receive any government subsidies. Unable to purchase costly insurance through either method, these individuals (and/or their families) will become or stay uninsured, and will be forced to pay the Obamacare tax as a result. It's a terrible catch-22. So if employers accede to the coming requests to drop health coverage, the result will be a glut of people entering the exchanges. This is bad news, three times over. First, many exchanges will not be ready on time and will have data security issues. An avalanche of enrollees will only worsen logistical problems from coast to coast. Second, more people reliant on subsidies equals more money. That money comes from taxpayers and from borrowing. The law's already-unaffordable price tag will soar, adding to even more to long-term deficits. Third, this is a raw deal and a breach of trust for the many workers and families who were promised they could keep their existing healthcare arrangement.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1377183836184</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 11:03:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377183881666-31</Id><Title>The gang's all here</Title><Msg>And the right-fringe hatefest is under way.

Taylor, wrote a scathing letter to the Obama administration about how Obamacare will destroy the 40 hour work week for hardworking Americans. The letter called for the administration to "fix" what was broken and had a strong tone of regret when it came to supporting President Obama and the re-election of pro-Obamacare Democrats. Time is running out: Congress wrote this law; we voted for you. We have a problem; you need to fix it. The unintended consequences of the ACA are severe. Perverse incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios. Now, the AFL-CIO in Nevada has passed a resolution to openly criticize the Obama administration over Obamacare, again stressing the situation needs to be fixed by the very people who created it. The resolution is a result of union concerns being ignored. Signaling a growing rift between some unions and the White House over the Affordable Care Act, the Nevada State AFL-CIO passed a stinging resolution Wednesday that criticized the administration for its handling of their concerns with the health care reform law. The resolution claims the law could end up "destroying" the unions' multi-employer health plans if the administration doesn't come up with a regulatory fix. "[O]ur union members and their families originally offered strong political and moral support for the promise of the Affordable Care Act because it would expand health care coverage for more Americans," the resolution read. But when it came to dealing with the unions' concerns, "the Administration has postured on proposals to address the problem, but no proposal to date will actually solve the problem. Our health plans only get worse."</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1377185072652</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 11:24:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377185348612-36</Id><Topic><Title>The Kent Coward will hate this one about subservient Journailsm defending the Empire !!!</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377146245278</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 00:37:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Kent Raven doesn't have the mental faculties to see the hypocrisy of his left-wing heroes.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1377185348612</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 11:29:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377186181275-37</Id><Topic><Title>Gore likens 'global warming' skeptics to racists, supporters of apartheid, homophobes...</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1377181987907</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 10:33:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How long do you think we can pee in the pool and nobody notice?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1377186181275</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 11:43:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377186496924-38</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans wave white flag, admit shutdown tactic is hopeless</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1377186254301</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 11:44:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whooo boy,,,,,,Chrissy/Hoozdik ......will be answering his own posts until he gets more orders.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1377186496924</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 11:48:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377187285039-39</Id><Topic><Title>GALLUP: Unemployment Spikes to 8.9%...</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1377118226628</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-21 16:50:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And yet Obama claims that he is the one who saved the auto industry.</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1377187285039</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 12:01:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377187671982-40</Id><Topic><Title>Gore likens 'global warming' skeptics to racists, supporters of apartheid, homophobes...</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1377181987907</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 10:33:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How long can some people stare at a naked emperor and still deny he has no clothes?</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1377187671982</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 12:07:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377188043372-41</Id><Topic><Title>Second Amendment saves Iowa Couple</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377124351712</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-21 18:32:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sparty err zombiegrunt err spaz err fascist err bumper err special needs case err severe emotional deprivation err spazcensoredmo</Msg><Username>demsfascists666</Username><Timestamp>1377188043372</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 12:14:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377188471513-42</Id><Topic><Title>GALLUP: Unemployment Spikes to 8.9%...</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1377118226628</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-21 16:50:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ford didn't NEED saving, as I recall...</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1377188471513</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 12:21:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377188593065-43</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans wave white flag, admit shutdown tactic is hopeless</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1377186254301</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 11:44:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The same people who think I'm any other poster are the people who think Obama isn't an American citizen.

A jobs bill comes up, it is filled with positive things for the economy, Republicans filibuster debate, this shields them from having to make floor speeches on why they don't want tax breaks for small businesses... etc. Why? Well, if the economy recovers too strongly before an election, Republicans will lose power. If jobs numbers look too good, people will want to keep the same party. By Republicans blocking all jobs legislation and keeping jobs numbers from improving they believe this is their ticket to power. In other words, if you and other Americans suffer just long enough it will pay off for Republicans. They sacrifice the citizens' jobs with the hopes that they will create more Republican jobs in Congress. Americans want the jobs numbers to improve and are beginning to wise up to the reality that Republicans are blocking jobs measures that citizens are strongly in favor of. Coverage of Republicans tactic of blocking all jobs bills is increasing because the media has begun to realize what is happening. Now, Republicans face a major backlash from the American public as their power grabbing scheme is becoming more visible. They knew years ago that the election would be based on the economy and job creation. So, they held it off. More Americans are realizing that Republicans have worked for several years to undermine the president in every way possible. Americans believe that it requires a complete lack of patriotism to take such actions during a massive economic collapse. They are beginning to ask, "Who in their right mind would block any job creating plan to bring us out of this crisis because they want power?" Well, that answer is simple - they stated their mission two years ago. Here is the Republican leader of the Senate - Mitch McConnell. Now, the 19th jobs bill has been just blocked. Congress's approval rating is at record lows and wiser Americans are beginning to become vocal about getting Republicans out of office. Today that method was repeated for the 19th time in two years. The Bring Jobs Home Act The bill was called the, "Bring Jobs Home Act." It would have provided a 20% tax break for the costs of moving jobs back to the U.S. It removes tax deductions for the business expenses of jobs moving overseas. Simple enough. Stop incentivizing jobs leaving the U.S. Start incentivizing jobs returning to the U.S. Fund it within the bill by taking away deductions for companies shipping jobs overeas. This way, it doesn't add to the deficit. The president can never directly bring the jobs back. However, he and Congress can create the conditions through policy that create job magnetism. This is the most common sense solution on the planet to create the conditions to draw jobs home. Americans now realize that Republicans just voted to protect companies that outsource jobs. Maybe, citizens won't want Republican leadership in Congress anymore given how they have used their time. Note: Four Republicans voted for the law believing it was too good for America to play politics with. 42 Republicans voted to obstruct. Again, I am not talking about a vote on the merits of the law that were blocked. I am talking about filibustering debate. Jobs measures are too important for Republicans to speak about on record. The Payroll Tax Cut Renewal This tax cut reaches 160 million people and stimulates demand by leaving money in consumers hands. Watch the GOP refuse to allow Democrats to propose compromises on the measure. Economists call this one of the most stimulative possible approaches for increasing jobs in the economy. Watch as the Republican speaker leaves the floor refusing to talk about jobs legislation. Total List of Legislation One writer collected all the legislation from 2011 and 2012 that Republicans worked on while blocking jobs bills. On January 27, 2012 Republicans redefined what an "aircraft" is. The author quotes John Boehner's promise, "We're going to have a relentless focus on creating jobs." This promise won Republicans the majority in the house, but what did they do?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1377192030686</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 13:20:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377192081795-48</Id><Topic><Title>Chris Lane Shooting Was a Hate Crime</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1377178798115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 09:39:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a very garbled way that almost makes sense.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1377192081795</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 13:21:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377192199002-49</Id><Topic><Title>Chris Lane Shooting Was a Hate Crime</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1377178798115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 09:39:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Plenty of two parent families don't involve marriage.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1377192199002</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 13:23:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377192775719-50</Id><Title>Nasdaq</Title><Msg>Since BA trades on NYSE some of you may not realize trading on Nasdaq has been halted for quite some time, in unprecedented technical difficulty.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1377192775719</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 13:32:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377193775596-51</Id><Topic><Title>Chris Lane Shooting Was a Hate Crime</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1377178798115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 09:39:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is, but plenty have literally made careers out of it.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1377193775596</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 13:49:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377195979782-52</Id><Title>Tesla started this year at $35 now $153, Boeing started this year at $75 now $105 har har har</Title><Msg>Boeing means cheap,, Boeing airplanes are going away over time, 757, 767,( just a military free meal ) like the dufunct British motorcycle industry.Same reason for Boeing they did build new planes with real money just little tweaks , not update like the 727,747,767,and777and the 777 and the failed firestarter in a box, the plane cant stay on schedule , .

Is a resignation from America's most infamous great-granny-grabber imminent? According to San Diego's NBC Affiliate, yes it is: San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has agreed to resign as part of a deal reached this week with city officials, NBC 7 News has learned. Filner, spotted leaving City Hall with packing boxes Wednesday night, will formally vacate the office following a closed session of City Council Friday, according to several sources. City officials announced just before 7 p.m. Wednesday a proposed solution had been reached in the scandal that has consumed the city of San Diego since it first broke July 10. In the last six weeks, more than a dozen women have come forward with tales of alleged sexual harassment and unwanted sexual advances. Filner has admitted to disrespecting and at times intimidating women, saying that he needed help. He announced he would enter a treatment program for an undisclosed disorder or illness. The Los Angeles Times provides a window into the possible deal Filner struck: At issue in the mediation talks was the possibility of Filner's agreeing to resign in exchange for the City Council agreeing to pay some of his legal fees and potential damages in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Irene McCormack Jackson, his former director of communications. The end of the mediation came late Wednesday afternoon after three days of closed-door negotiations between Filner, his three attorneys, City Atty. Jan Goldsmith and two City Council members. Mediation was overseen by retired federal Judge J. Lawrence Irving, who donated his time. The council will vote on the deal in closed session Friday.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1377198413252</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 15:06:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377198710739-54</Id><Title>Supreme Court Be Damned: DOJ Serves Texas a Lawsuit Over Voter I.D. Law</Title><Msg>The Department of Justice has served up a Texas sized lawsuit over the Lone Star State's voter identification law, something Attorney General Eric Holder has been warning about since it was signed into law in May 2011. The Justice Department said Thursday that it will file a new lawsuit against Texas to try to block the state's voter ID law. “Today’s action marks another step forward in the Justice Department’s continuing effort to protect the voting rights of all eligible Americans,” Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement accompanying the announcement of the lawsuit. "We will not allow the Supreme Court’s recent decision to be interpreted as open season for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights." Supreme Court be damned. The issuing of the lawsuit is bold considering the Supreme Court just struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, resulting in states like Texas being able to make voting decisions at a local level. The court's 5-4 ruling in the case from Alabama frees states and municipalities with a history of racial discrimination from having to clear changes in voting procedures with the federal government. That restriction has applied to nine states and parts of six others, mostly in the South. Three weeks ago, voter integrity group True the Vote issued a statement knowing DOJ was preparing to issue a lawsuit. “We will not sit idly by and allow the most politically charged Department of Justice in US history to set aside the US constitution and attempt to bully the people of Texas", True the Vote President Catherine Engelbrecht said. "We will meet Attorney General Holder in court and we will do whatever we need to do to advance the cause of voters’ rights for all Americans.” “General Holder’s announcement today demonstrates just how radical the DOJ has become. The same department that criminalizes journalism and fails to prosecute IRS agents who violate the rights of American taxpayers is promising to sue states with taxpayer dollars to block laws passed by elected legislators such as voter ID and citizenship verification. “Every American voter deserves to have his or her vote counted - and not diluted by fraud or error. The DOJ just put itself between the voters of Texas and their guaranteed constitutional and civil rights. “True the Vote has watched as Attorney General Eric Holder has repeatedly disregarded the rule of law,” Engelbrecht continued.

Yet this analogy can never stick to Senator Cruz -- a point Lowry emphasizes: One of the left’s deepest prejudices is that its opponents are stupid, and Cruz tramples on it. Chris Hayes of MSNBC actually says he fears Cruz’s brilliance. So should congressional witnesses. At hearings, Cruz has the prosecutorial instincts of a … Harvard-trained lawyer. Watching Attorney General Eric Holder try to fend off Cruz’s questioning on the administration’s drone policy a few months ago was like seeing a mouse cornered by a very large cat. Cruz hasn’t played by the Senate rules that freshmen should initially be seen and not heard. In fact, he joined the upper chamber with all the subtlety of a SWAT team knocking down a drug suspect’s front door. For people who care about such things — almost all of them are senators — this is an unforgivable offense. At another hearing, this one on guns, as Cruz says the highest commitment of senators should be to the Constitution, another senator can be heard muttering that he doesn’t like being lectured. Chairman Pat Leahy (probably the mutterer) eventually cuts him off and informs him he hasn’t been in the Senate very long. Watching irresponsible public servants squirm on the hot seat under Senator Cruz's inquisitorial glare is indeed a sight to behold. This is why, Lowry argues, even if he doesn’t run for (and win) the presidency, he could still be the upper chamber's unapologetic defender of conservatism for decades to come. Put simply, liberals fear him -- and for good reason. But for too long the left has convinced the public that standing up for conservative values is some sort of psychological disorder -- a sign of ignorance and intellectual laziness. Cruz’s rise to prominence disapproves this dubious proposition. This is why, I suspect, they hate him so much.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1377199234777</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 15:20:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377199302211-59</Id><Topic><Title>Second Amendment saves Iowa Couple</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377124351712</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-21 18:32:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too bad we dont know what actually happened- no doubt there are all kinds of circumstances which if known would reduce this sensationalist news presentation to little or nothing.

Both Boeing and Tesla have strong research &amp; development programs, and I'm sure that Tesla has access to millions of venture capital money. Both Boeing and Tesla are great investments; however, investing in Tesla is going way out on the risk curve. At least the 787 Dreamliner is a reality. The driverless car is still a visionary's dream, and you get no cash while you wait and live with volatility. I'm staying with Boeing and plan on getting Tesla in an ETF. At least an ETF will pay dividends while you wait. Maybe this Élan Musk guy is the next Steve Jobs!

Here's why ( from the Guinness Book of World Records ): "Guinness World Records described McCartney as the "most successful composer and recording artist of all time", with 60 gold discs and sales of over 100 million albums and 100 million singles, and as the "most successful songwriter" in United Kingdom chart history.[1] More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song "Yesterday", more than any other song in history. Wings' 1977 release "Mull of Kintyre" is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in March 1999, McCartney has written, or co-written 32 songs that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2013 he has sold over 15.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States. McCartney, Lennon, Harrison and Starr received MBEs in 1965, and in 1997, McCartney was knighted for his services to music."</Msg><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1377207111466</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 17:31:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377207806486-93</Id><Title>Elvis Presley Sold More Records as an Individual Singer than Paul McCartney.</Title><Msg>....so did Michael Jackson, Madonna and Elton John.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1377207806486</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 17:43:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377208063773-94</Id><Topic><Title>Elvis Presley Sold More Records as an Individual Singer than Paul McCartney.</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1377207806486</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 17:43:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't think Elvis will be posting any time soon...</Msg><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1377208063773</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 17:47:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377209287473-95</Id><Topic><Title>Tesla started this year at $35 now $153, Boeing started this year at $75 now $105 har har har</Title><Username>sputercuslouden</Username><Timestamp>1377195979782</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 14:26:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No doubt is is Wayne, Elon's alias was created yesterday, and this one created today. 11 posts in 2 1/2 yours, who else would be that bored today, none from Elon or wayne. disclosure on this assumption, that is unless Elon really did create his account yesterday and was too busy to post today because of the interview that just came out on-line where he admits his stock is overpriced</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1377209287473</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 18:08:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377209821662-96</Id><Topic><Title>Please don't compare apples to oranges.</Title><Username>maramwp</Username><Timestamp>1377205947221</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-22 17:12:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wayne posted that TSLA was not a risky stock, even said it was conservative.

The Memo confirmed every conspiracy freak’s fantasy: that in the late 1990s, the top US Treasury officials secretly conspired with a small cabal of banker big-shots to rip apart financial regulation across the planet. When you see 26.3 percent unemployment in Spain, desperation and hunger in Greece, riots in Indonesia and Detroit in bankruptcy, go back to this End Game memo, the genesis of the blood and tears. The Treasury official playing the bankers’ secret End Game was Larry Summers. Today, Summers is Barack Obama’s leading choice for Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, the world’s central bank. If the confidential memo is authentic, then Summers shouldn’t be serving on the Fed, he should be serving hard time in some dungeon reserved for the criminally insane of the finance world.
