In that time, you could have looked at a lot of my posts to conjure up something to support the "false witness" claim. Yet, nothing. However, I know that you used one or more of your IDs to do the "thumbs down" thing. Come on, you can do better than that. But, I expected nothing because there is nothing and you are complying with my expectations. Get right and get ready. You are on the wrong side of truth.

The story mis exactly the same Tincanguy, Your assessment of SPEEA is based on a false premise. That makes it difficult to understand why Shuper is opposed to its current structure. The confusion can be found in how you characterized what is happening. You stated that Day and Dunn and their small group of malcontents are hell-bent on destroying the substantial power that SPEEA has acquired in the past few years. Later in your statement you give credit to the leaders of the union for being responsible for turning SPEEA into a real union. That is the key to your misunderstanding. It was the members as well as the non-members who made this a union with teeth. Bofferding has never done anything for the union. He has worked for himself. It was those that SPEEA was supposed to represent that made this a real union. Everybody else just jumped on the bandwagon and have taken credit for what the members and non-members did, in opposition to what the leadership recommended we do. It achieved quite the opposite of what the leadership thought we could do. Remember that Bofferding recommended both contracts that the company offered last time. The membership rejected both. Bofferding said we had to accept the offer because a strike would fail. He said there were all the non-members who would not join in a strike. He was wrong. He was way out of touch with the membership because he only cares about himself. Those who voted for Day did so because they wanted Bofferding out. That was the first step. Day was known to oppose Bofferding. Most of those I spoke to on the strike lines had no affection for Bofferding. Those who did surprised me with their naivety. They pointed to his bringing in the big boys as key to our building strength. That isn't what happened. The big boys didn't want to look foolish for ignoring this little band of engineers who were bringing a DOW 30 company to its knees without their assistance. The big boys didn't want to be relegated to a role of being insignificant. They HAD to join in to keep themselves viable. While there are many examples of how Bofferding has manipulated the union and its staff to meet his needs, the real key to his disservice to the membership is that he was surprised by the membership's rebuke of his lackeys in the last vote and felt threatened - as well he should be. Then, rather than consider the needs of the many, and the negotiations soon to take place. he orchestrated the most devisive action he could, solely to eliminate the competition which threatened his dictatorship. Regardless of what you hear, Bofferding is behind the recall. Thr result of these actions is to split the membership. The turnout for the recall vote was larger than the initial vote. While the recall effort was a success it may well prove to be a failure. The vote was close and many of those who opposed the recall have stated their willingness to sign for decertification, should the opportunity present itself. How much more destructive can one be? This doesn't do much more than scratch the surface, but it should give you some basic understanding of what is going on among the active membership and why those who support the basic concept of union representation and strong unions would oppose their own union. Shuper doesn't oppose SPEEA. Shuper opposes the way SPEEA is controlled and manipulated for the benefit of one, in the guise of being good for everyone else. Millions and millions of people have been duped by that argument before and no doubt will be in the future. People are basically sheep. They follow the leader and refuse to acknowledge the shortcomings of those leaders until they discover too late the truth. the same thing happened in 2007 re recall - the reason the same- The board is too wimpy to do anything- they let Goforth run off at the mouth</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1347682945733</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 00:22:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347705691300-3</Id><Title>This board is better without the</Title><Msg>ravings of the Kent Raven............much better..........did he get tired of being the board idiot?</Msg><Username>floydian_slips_11</Username><Timestamp>1347705691300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 06:41:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347715458175-4</Id><Topic><Title>Who is the biggest idiot right-wing messageboard poster</Title><Username>beezelshrub</Username><Timestamp>1212600207000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2008-06-04 13:23:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You guys all forgot about hairy dumba.s He is the unqualified low IQ leader of the pack</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1347715458175</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:24:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347716462122-5</Id><Title>Our incompetent in Chief vs the Military</Title><Msg>The Republican radio address: “Hello, I’m United States Representative and Retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Allen West, from the great state of Florida. This week, the Republican-led House of Representatives continued to focus on jobs — and removing government barriers that make it harder to create jobs, such as the small business tax hike President Obama has proposed that threatens our already struggling economy. The House also took action to address a serious threat to our national security, which is what I’d like to discuss with you today. For all the coverage of Election Day, there’s another date looming — January the 2nd — that has serious consequences for our nation’s security. On that day — if the government does not act — automatic, across-the-board spending cuts will take effect, cuts that would reduce funding for our national defense by as much as 10 percent. I spent 22 years in active duty service in the United States Army and served in several combat zones. I cannot understate the amount of damage these cuts would do to our military. They would essentially hollow out our armed forces. What that means is, we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915, and the smallest tactical fighter force in the history of the modern United States Air Force. Leon Panetta, the Secretary of Defense, has said, and I quote, that â??cuts of this magnitude … would be devastating to defense … programs.’ Now the good news is, the Republican-led House of Representatives has approved a responsible plan to replace these â??devastating’ cuts. The bad news is, the people’s House is the ONLY part of our government that has acted to eliminate this threat to our national security. The Senate, a body controlled by the president’s party, has done nothing. And the president himself has opposed or disregarded every attempt we’ve made to work with him on a solution. President Obama’s failure to lead is inexcusable on its face, but what makes it even more so is the fact that this â??sequester’ was his administration’s idea in the first place. You see, last year, the president wanted to avoid making the tough choices necessary to get our economy moving again and deal with our crushing debt. He didn’t want to deal with the issue again before his re-election campaign, so the White House created this dangerous â??sequester’ as an escape hatch. Dodging his responsibility is how the â??sequester’ came about, so it is no surprise the president is doing the exact same thing now. In May, he threatened to veto legislation passed by the House that would replace his â??sequester’ with responsible spending cuts and reforms. And the president’s Senate did nothing. So the House came back this week and passed a bill I sponsored that requires the president to finally send Congress a legitimate plan to replace his â??sequester.’ Because while the president may not like our ideas, he has a responsibility to put forward his own and to press the Senate allies of his party for action. At the very least, this is an opportunity to find common ground. Yet, before the House even started to debate my bill, the president threatened to veto it. One must simply ask: why? Look at the week we have just been through. Consider the stark, horrific reminders that freedom remains under siege by forces who relish terror and violence over freedom and free expression. Remember how critical it is that the United States projects strength, that we remain vigilant and resolute in the defense of our liberties and way of life. Since the purpose of this address is to respond to President Obama, allow me to say this to him directly, as an elected representative of the people, a career soldier and a concerned citizen: Mr. President: for you — the Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces — to sit idle and do nothing while this dark cloud hangs over our military, it is shameful, it is irresponsible, and it is wrong. It is dead wrong. In your nomination acceptance speech, you stated your goal was to have the strongest military the world has ever known. You have proven this promise to the American people is nothing more than empty rhetoric. All of this as a bargaining chip to raise taxes. For the sake of our country and our future, I hope you will do the right thing, sir, and work with us to eliminate this threat so we can confront the grave threats to freedom around the globe, to us and our allies. It is because of these threats that America must continue to fund its military and support its Armed Forces to the fullest extent. The lives of all Americans depend on it. As do the memories of Ambassador Chris Stevens and the public servants who perished with him this week in the Middle East. Please take a moment this weekend to pray for their loved ones. And for the brave warriors of our Armed Forces, the men and women, my brothers in arms that I served with. Steadfast and Loyal.”</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1347716462122</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:41:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347716527005-6</Id><Topic><Title>This board is better without the</Title><Username>floydian_slips_11</Username><Timestamp>1347705691300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 06:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He shoots, He scores!</Msg><Username>harry_caul</Username><Timestamp>1347716527005</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:42:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347721367539-7</Id><Topic><Title>September week two</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1347668059482</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 20:14:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The last delivery on Friday was a 737 for United Airlines.

This company needs to get rid of the number one employee for failure to produce. The 747-8 , it is 2 billion over budget and 2 years late with 111 planes on order with a profit margin of about 5.7% means this profit center will not break even at 350 million gross per plane to the math I did net is 20 million delivered on time with no rework.Next , , the 787 , 20-30 billion over budget and with the number of planes on order this profit center is never going to break even. The 777X is on hold, this will allow airbus to get those new orders for their improved plane, the 737MAX, no reason to expect on time or on budget. Good stocks make shareholders money or keep pace with the stock market average. Compare Boeing to apple on July 5 2005 apple stock was $36.55 and Friday it closed at $ 691 dollars that is a gain of 1791% that means if you had $100,000 in both BA and AAPL only July 5, 2005 , with your shareholder investment in apple, now you would have $1 million and 790 thousand dollars, But if you are a shareholder in Boeing stock, eing a buy and hold would have made your original $100,000 into just about the same as when you started , that is zip for over 6 years of rish to your money a CD as low as they are is no risk and better return.. There are probably a lot of other worthless Boeing employees who have done nothing for Boeing in the past 6 years but they did not make the shareholder paid wage and benefits that the Boeing CEO McNerney sees. How did the CEO do for nothing , well in 2011 the CEO say a pay jump of 34 percent to over 18 million for nothing to the shareholder in 6 years , except failed promiss of cost and delivery dates that is his job. He needs to be on time and on budget or any shareholder is not smart to stay with Boeing.. BTW Apple pays a much better dividend too! Hint or for day traders BAC is up 71% for the year and each time the fed pump the stock market the banks are insured even with their failure !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347732554495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 14:09:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347735839469-13</Id><Topic><Title>President Obama’s economic policies aren’t working</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1347732107298</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 14:01:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry to inform you but we're not living under Obama's policies almost all of them have been fillibustered by the Senate.

Iraq interrogation incident While serving in Taji, Iraq, West received information from an intelligence specialist about a reported plot to ambush him and his men.[11] The alleged plot reportedly involved Yahya Jhodri Hamoodi, a civilian Iraqi police officer.[11] West, who was not responsible for conducting interrogations in Iraq and had never conducted nor witnessed one, had his men detain Hamoodi.[11] In the process of detaining Mr. Hamoodi, soldiers testified that Hamoodi appeared to reach for his weapon and needed to be subdued.[11] Hamoodi was beaten by four soldiers from the 2/20th Field Artillery Battalion on the head and body.[12] West then fired his pistol near Hamoodi's head,[11] after which Hamoodi provided West with names and information, which Hamoodi later described as "meaningless information induced by fear and pain."[11] At least one of these suspects was arrested as a result, but no plans for attacks or weapons were found.[11] West said "At the time I had to base my decision on the intelligence I received. It's possible that I was wrong about Mr. Hamoodi."[11] West was charged with violating articles 128 (assault) and 134 (general article) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During a hearing held as part of an Article 32 investigation in November 2003, West stated, "I know the method I used was not right, but I wanted to take care of my soldiers."[12] The charges were ultimately referred to an Article 15 proceeding rather than court-martial, at which West was fined $5,000.[11] LTC West accepted the judgment and retired with full benefits in the summer of 2004. Asked if he would act differently under similar circumstances again, West testified, "If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can."[12] At his hearing, West pointed out that there were no further ambushes against American forces in Taji until he was relieved of his leadership post on October 4.[13] After West's retirement he received more than 2,000 letters and e-mails offering him moral support.[11] A letter supporting West was signed by 95 members of Congress and sent to the Secretary of the Army.[11] Moreover, conservative David Horowitz's online publication FrontPage Magazine, named West its 2003 Man of the Year, for "valuing his own troops' lives over the mental well being and self-esteem of an Iraqi terrorist."[6][14] ++++ You mean you would serve under Obuma who if the saudi king had turned around- Abuma would have kissed his bum instead of his hand ??</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1347745218981</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:40:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347753786357-23</Id><Topic><Title>libdem IQ</Title><Username>harrydokes</Username><Timestamp>1347716578559</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:42:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please never accuse another of not having a very good brain until you completely master the following apparently mysterious words: their they're there. s/ Sammy</Msg><Username>sammy.shakedown</Username><Timestamp>1347753786357</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 20:03:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>15</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347754190537-24</Id><Topic><Title>This board is better without the</Title><Username>floydian_slips_11</Username><Timestamp>1347705691300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 06:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It looks like Chrissy lost his original i.d. that he was so proud of .
