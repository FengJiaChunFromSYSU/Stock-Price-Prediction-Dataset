CBX your argument does not work , by your standards then Airbus is as conservative and yet stock price is up over 50% year to date while Boeing is at to 39% CBX, for 3 years Boeing is bettered by Airbus up 160% to Boeings stock price increase of 63% both are doing the same thing they build large body airplanes primarily, the difference is, generally Airbus planes are newer, work better, are safer, fly better and sell great. for most of the last decade Airbus has been number one and Boeing number two so by your standard of selection that is no way to select Boeing . Your conservative approach should clearly be for airbus pull up a ytd or 3 year or five year chart Airbus is the best stock to own. you own the wrong stock. As to tesla you simply missed , you are not a tslaaire you missed. You have not excuse your just in the wrong stock.</Msg><Username>gsylvia16</Username><Timestamp>1377493594878</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 01:06:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377494146555-3</Id><Topic><Title>Tesla Is Outselling Porsche, Volvo, and Land Rover in California</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1377473855005</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-25 19:37:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spartacus9991 you are showing very poor insight, maybe since you have followed him on Boeing for over 10 years your still dreaming then . you should move to tsla and post Boeing news LOL , see if any tesla investors want to buy Boeing stock your arguments have not sold any boeing shares I would opinion, you can't stay on topic maybe you need some sort of therapy to be able to stay on topic . the discussion is Tesla is out selling Porsche and Vovlo and another car company in California and you have so far been unable to stay with the discussion. maybe that is why you retired from Md your boss decided it was time for you to retire. I can understand Mr Spartacus99991 I asked you to prepare a jet engine performance study and you never got to it , you wanted to discuss how someone should move to TSLA or maybe someone is sucking someone's other part, . you boss probably gave you many chances to get with it but you failed and were retired.</Msg><Username>gsylvia16</Username><Timestamp>1377494146555</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 01:15:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377494760030-4</Id><Topic><Title>Self doubt, is tesla a better stock than boeing year to date and over time 3 years CBX?</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1377461100189</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-25 16:05:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cbx tesla is on schedule, on budget, makes excellent products highly rated and selling as fast as they are made. that is a low risk company to own stock, Boeing makes a 747-8 that does not sell and a 787 that has huge issues that is a high risk company to own stock in . Airbus in 10 of the past 11 years has been the number one airplane company and this year it is a neck and neck race, not decided as yet. On stock value airbus betters Boeing year to date over 50% gain for airbus and 39% for Boeing. CBX, for 3 years Airbus really beat Boeing 160% gain to 63% gain so while Boeing might be number one plane orders and deliveries to date, it is not the one to own. Stock price is indicative of the markets approval of the company and right now and for 5 past years Airbus has a higher approval than Boeing the stock price determines the value of a company. CBX you can claim that you think Boeing is best but your wrong the stock price determines which company is better ! A story is not going to work it is a fantasy statement a stock price is reality .</Msg><Username>gsylvia16</Username><Timestamp>1377494760030</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 01:26:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377494941683-5</Id><Topic><Title>Tesla Is Outselling Porsche, Volvo, and Land Rover in California</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1377473855005</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-08-25 19:37:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds like how Wayne (Dell, Fred, &amp; Sylvia) left Boeing.

Wyeroski is a former FAA Safety Inspector. The FAA still has the Boeing Dreamliner 787 grounded. There are $200 billion in back orders on Boeing’s books for the airliner. Sequestration has now been put into effect reducing the FAA’s work force. Yet Boeing wants their airliner back in the sky. Who is to blame for all the problems effecting the Boeing 787? Is it Boeing management, that outsourced 70% of the aircraft development? How about the FAA, that spent 200,000 man hours certifying the 787!? As a former FAA Inspector I have seen first hand how the agency covers up problems and keeps them from the American people. The FAA failed in certifying the aircraft. Administrator Huerta and DOT Secretary LaHood do not have any idea what to do. When the 787 flies again, how can FAA allow the airliner to fly long distance flights over water? So the question remains…WHO IS TO BLAME ? In my opinion, it is fraud, waste, abuse and criminal activity in the FAA. The corruption and inept management that is in the FAA, has finally caught up with this agency. The FAA has failed the American people and it is time to clean out the agency and find people that will do the job, if that is possible, with the culture that now infects Washington DC. The NTSB is at odds with the FAA since the two agencies often differ as to the cause of aircraft accidents. The FAA has an excellent misleading public relations department that have been known to hide facts and give the appearance that all is well. I believe the Department of Transportation needs to close down the FAA Headquarters at 800 Independence Avenue. That would be a good start in reducing the $600 million dollar “so called” Sequestration short fall!</Msg><Username>gsylvia16</Username><Timestamp>1377495728704</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 01:42:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377496124304-8</Id><Topic><Title>FAA Inspector opinion on the 787 Richard Wyeroski</Title><Username>gsylvia16</Username><Timestamp>1377495728704</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 01:42:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sylvia, hasn't your friend Wayne (Elon) taught you not to post old news.

It is based upon shareholder value that is based on one thing stock price. Spartacus9991 since your mind wanders off topic , here is some factual information for you to know. that is off topic . I know your main message is that your are a Boeing storyteller. As a retired MD and defacto, Boeing pensioner you have a vested, literally, interest in Boeing stock price. Spartacus9991 , so anything you say is as they say in a court would be considered not admissible , your tainted with retirement bias. Airbus is the better company compared to Boeing , stock price, not number of panes ordered or made in a year determines what the stock buying community thinks about Airbus and Boeing .For example both the 747-8 and the 787 make zero money and both factually lose money so that number 1 producer status is known for what it is by the stock buying public as worthless. Airbus is better Boeing by over 50% gain in share price gain to 39% for the year to date and Airbus betters Boeing for 3 years by 160% in share price gain to 63% and it continues for 5 years , spartacus99991 your story telling is getting real pathetic , and the topic Spartacus99991 is Tesla stock is better than Boeing not who is number 1 sorry spartacus99991 you are living in denial . Remember spartacus9991,When you have the facts on your side you argue facts, when you have the stock price on your side you argue the stock price , when you have neither you pound the table and call names.

Syrian opposition sources close to Saudi Arabia said Prince Bandar offered to buy up to $15 billion of Russian weapons as well as ensuring that Gulf gas would not threaten Russia's position as a main gas supplier to Europe. In return, Saudi Arabia wanted Moscow to ease its strong support of Assad and agree not to block any future Security Council Resolution on Syria, they said. A Gulf source familiar with the matter confirmed that Prince Bandar offered to buy large quantities of arms from Russia, but that no cash amount was specified in the talks.

Wall Street Journal UN Pushes Back at US Calls to Abort Syria Inspection Mission Wall Street Journal 3 minutes ago ...BEIRUT—United Nations weapons inspectors arrived at one of the sites of last week’s presumed chemical weapons attacks outside Damascus, spurning U.S. calls for the team to stop their mission as American officials said they are inching closer to a decision for a military strike. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon rebuffed the U.S. request to withdraw the inspectors and “stood firm on principle,” according to a person familiar with the matter, ordering his team to continue their work establishing whether chemical weapons or toxins were responsible for the estimated hundreds of deaths of Syrian civilians. Earlier Monday, the U.N. chemical weapons team came under fire from unidentified snipers as they examined the site of the suspected attack at Mouadhamiya, a few miles southwest of Damascus. The team retreated but returned later in the afternoon. Mr. Ban said the team visited two hospitals, interviewed survivors and doctors, and collect samples. At the same time, U.S. officials were reaching a definitive conclusion that chemical weapons had been used by the Syrian government in military assaults last Wednesday. “Our confidence is growing that this was in fact an episode involving the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,” a senior U.S. official said, the strongest remarks to date on the use of the banned weapons. Secretary of State John Kerry was due to deliver a statement on Syria’s crisis at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, the State Department said. Although President Barack Obama remains undecided on military action, the U.S. request for the U.N. team to withdraw echoed its moves before it attacked Iraq i...</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1377539783500</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 13:56:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377539969193-52</Id><Topic><Title>Why are we still in the Middle East?

I assess risk to Boeing as high , while you look at Boeing as low risk due to it being a Dow jones stock and slow moving in price. The tipping point for me was when the then CEO,FRANK SHRONTZ told Airbus he would cut the price of the then new 747-400 to below cost to "bury" airbus. I sold all my Boeing then at if I recall about 97 dollars per share and started to think about leaving Boeing as a company. Prior to then he was ok with airplane programs , but he missed you do not bury a subsidized Airbus with cutting prices below cost, you simple make Boeing weaker. the correct move was to lobby Washington for help to even the playing field and hold your prices until Washington gets it.

There is no logic to Assad using chemical weapons, inviting the United States to honor the chemical weapon "red line". What is curious about Obama's approach towards all of these "Arab Spring" movements is the immediacy of action for Egypt (remove Mubarak, install Morsi) and Libya (remove Gaddafi) and the hesitancy of action for Syria. In the case of Egypt and Libya, perhaps a few hundred to a couple thousand lives had been lost. In Syria, it is now up to 100K lives lost. In the case of Egypt, Mubarak was friendly with the west and Israel. In the case of Libya, Gaddafi was being managed. Obama's stated fear in Libya was that there was going to be a massacre in Benghazi. Remember that? Too bad we didn't know what would happen a year later in Benghazi. Now, what has happened to the rebel movement in Syria while Obama has been "dithering"? They have morphed from the oppressed people to now being under the control of radical Islamic elements. Are you seeing the pattern? Obama has done everything he possible can to further the cause of radical Islam. In the case of Syria, he had to wait until a suitable radical Islamic movement could replace a radical Islamic government before doing anything - regardless of the human cost. After all, they are one of the "57 States".

As inane as your posts are, they truly highlight the likely futility that is by posting here, akin to spitting in the wind. By the way, the Bible says nothing about "desecrating the Good Book" since it does not refer to itself as the "good book" (assuming that that is what you meant). It does, however, define itself to be the Word of God, declaring that nothing is more powerful, effective, and incapable of being made void.

In Louisiana, Holder's latest project is attacking and trying to block a school choice program supported by Republican Governor Bobby Jindal. The Justice Department is trying to stop a school vouchers program in Louisiana that attempts to help families send their children to independent schools instead of under-performing public schools. The agency wants to stop the program, led by Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, in any school district that remains under a desegregation court order. In papers filed in U.S. District Court in New Orleans, the agency said Louisiana distributed vouchers in 2012-13 to roughly 570 public school students in districts that are still under such orders and that "many of those vouchers impeded the desegregation process." The federal government argues that allowing students to attend independent schools under the voucher system could create a racial imbalance in public school systems protected by desegregation orders. Ironically, President Obama has been out campaigning about college and yet refuses to acknowledge failing public schools do nothing to help children reach a goal of higher education. Governor Jindal has been an advocate for parents who want to be able to send their children to schools that can provide a better education and a brighter future.</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1377545923406</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 15:38:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377546312638-85</Id><Topic><Title>tick tick tick re syria</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1377540831324</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 14:13:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>my bet is cruise missiles to military targets, airfields, commo centers, air defense My bet on time is friday after about 3 pm eastern time</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1377546312638</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 15:45:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377546409858-86</Id><Topic><Title>Eric Holder Trying to Stop Bobby Jindal's School Choice Program in Louisiana</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1377545923406</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 15:38:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>try and stay FOCUSED the hole world is watching Syria and their WWI era chem weapons, theology, and kingdoms when Soschi 2014 and Hillary 2016 is at stake -the ba, bisbee angler/midnight rambler off by 12</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1377546409858</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 15:46:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377546805438-87</Id><Topic><Title>tick tick tick re syria</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1377540831324</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 14:13:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>should be command centers same as not in japan 1945 = more collateral damage imho emperor hirito will be unable to attend the upcoming Disneyland opening in Tokyo as he was vaporized back in 1945 me and general MAC and they say Walt was an anti-semite, but his feelings about the #$%$ were less understood until Disneyland Damascus</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1377546805438</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 15:53:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377547022910-88</Id><Title>Boeing, Boeing, Boeing!</Title><Msg>200 dudes!

Just after the law was passed in 2010, fully 74 percent of moderate and conservative Democrats supported the federal law making changes to the health-care system. But just 46 percent express support in the new poll, down 11 points in the past year. Liberal Democrats, by contrast, have continued to support the law at very high levels – 78 percent in the latest survey. Among the public at large, 42 percent support and 49 percent oppose the law, retreating from an even split at 47 percent apiece last July.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1377557048636</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 18:44:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377557282418-113</Id><Title>debt ceiling</Title><Msg>LEW told us today the debt ceiling must be raised for congress by Oct.

Former Florida Congressman Allen West weighed in on the issue on his Facebook page today, stating that Obama and Holder are embracing Marxist policies directly from Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto: In years past, Democrats like George Wallace and Lester Maddox stood outside the school doors blocking entry for blacks to get quality and equal education. Now, progressive socialists masquerading as Democrats (Obama and Holder) stand inside and block the access of black children, denying them the opportunities of this great country, the American dream. One of the first edicts of Obama in 2009 was to cancel the DC school voucher program, yet his own progeny attend elite Sidwell Friends, while other black children were denied. Now Obama and Holder are embracing Marx’s tenth tenet from his Communist Manifesto, forcing our young children into failing public schools.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1377557319359</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 18:48:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377557533201-116</Id><Topic><Title>Allen West: ‘Obama and Holder are Embracing Marx’s Tenth Tenet from his Communist Manifesto’</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1377557319359</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 18:48:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Allen West is a know-nothing and a war criminal.

Bob Bowman</Title><Msg>“The most unbelievable of all the wild conspiracy theories is the one our government has told us” Julie Wilson August 26, 2013 A highly admired American patriot, advocate of the 9/11 truth movement and dear friend of Alex Jones, Dr. Robert M. Bowman passed away last Thursday in his Florida home. Dr. Bowman’s career spanned nearly five decades including his service as the former director of the Advanced Space Programs Development (also known as Star Wars) for the U.S. Air Force during the Ford and Carter administrations. He also served as Lt. Col. for the Air Force completing a remarkable 101 combat missions. Academically brilliant, he obtained Ph.D.’s in aeronautics and nuclear engineering from the California Institute of Technology. An honorary piece by Veterans Today describes Bowman’s shock of the US military’s “insistence on pursuing a purely offensive space weapon capacity – whose only purpose was to launch a sneak attack on Russia and prevail in a nuclear war that would kill tens or even hundreds of millions of people.” The report says the program was designing space weapons, “including ‘artificial meteorites’ to be dropped on enemy targets, and an energy weapon that could cause whole cities to go up in flames – because it was planning to strike first.” “During the 1980s and 1990s, he did everything he could to expose the big lie that ‘Star Wars’ was a defensive project, and to work for a sensible, fiscally-responsible, genuinely defensive military posture,” reported Veterans Today. Back in April of 2011, Dr. Bowman appeared on the Alex Jones Show and discussed his views on the correlation between the economic collapse of America and the pursuit of endless wars. Dr. Bowman accurately described the reasoning behind America’s wars as a way to “secure and maintain an empire for ..</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377563842156</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 20:37:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377563947487-163</Id><Topic><Title>Remembering 9/11 Truth Scholar Colonel (and Professor).

He expressed the need to no longer have “puppet dictators around the world” that the government supports with troops and weaponry. He strongly called for a “constitutional foreign and military policy.” Dr. Bowman said, “by bringing our troops home, we can enormously enhance our national security, and at the same time reduce the defense budget by 80%.” Bowman’s experience as a fighter pilot made him extremely skeptical of the government’s 9/11 narrative. Based on his experience, Bowman “knew that every time a commercial plane goes significantly off-course, a military fighter plane shows up next to it within about ten minutes. The fighter pilot rocks its wings as a signal to ‘follow me’ and get back.” He wondered how four allegedly hijacked planes flew through America’s skies for nearly two hours without being harassed by US air defenses. As a member of Scholars for 9/11 Truth, Dr. Bob Bowman gave an amazing speech at the 2006 American Scholars Symposium in Los Angeles, in which he exposed the fraud of 9/11, questioning the true motives for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. “Throughout the speech he discusses the ignorance surrounding the events of 9/11 and its aftermath including the details of the NORAD cover-up surrounding intercept procedures that were not properly executed on that day,” reported Infowars.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1377563947487</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 20:39:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377564370110-164</Id><Topic><Title>Senator: Food Stamps Are Just Like Slavery</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1377557370268</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 18:49:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes..the amount of time I served in Uniform is indeed 6 times the amount of time you served...no need to be beat yourself to death with spite over that....but judging by that shocking Facebook photo of a bulbous and rotund Chris Genna...

Jesus, who you often like to quote, made a point that you should pay more astute attention. He was speaking one day to his disciples regarding their sharing the message of salvation and preaching God's word and that effort being rejected by the locals. He compared the condemnation of that rejection to the punishment rained down on Sodom and Gomorrah: "If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town." (Matthews 10:14-15). You may think that issues regarding race, gay marriage, and poverty are those which you might like to attribute some worth to Jesus message to mankind. Other than poverty making one of dozens of different "conscience" statements, your other concerns didn't make the list. However, the one issue and sin which garners the greatest condemnation is rejection of His provision of salvation and forgiveness. Even to stating that such rejection is worse than the sins - whatever they all may have been - of Sodom and Gomorrah.
