The word Islam actually means peace in Arabic, which might imply pacifism. The Qur’an also instructs the believers to “strike off the heads” (Surah 8, verse 12) of the unbelievers, which isn’t very neighborly.Judaism emphasizes justice and humanity, inspiring Jews to become advocates of the oppressed in every society where they have influence. The Jewish scriptures (the Old Testament to some of us) also encourage a certain decisiveness in dealing with God’s enemies. In one notable example, God commands King Saul to deal with a tribe who offended him several generations back: “Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.“ Saul is then cursed for failing to exercise the requisite brutality. Let that be a lesson to you. And a potent lesson it remains, enough to inspire violent Jewish souls today who would advocate hanging Arab children. Christians have some juicy material to work with too. First, they have access to the whole panoply of Old Testament gore when it suits them. More importantly, when it comes to violence Christians have the problem of their two Jesus’. When Christians want to get righteous about other religions’ violent streaks, they’ll talk about the Hippie Jesus of the Gospels; the guy who’s always turning cheeks and blessing his enemies. They seldom mention the other Jesus. The Lord knows what happened to that peaceful, passive guy. When he returns he’s planning a very different sort of visit. According to the New Testament, the next time you see Jesus you should run like hell...... 5/1/2013 Chris Ladd</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367415715240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:41:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367416566582-20</Id><Topic><Title>Which religion is the most violent?</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367415715240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:41:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mobros, no doubt about it ahkmed 20 years from now, I will be in Heaven --bye !!This was written by a woman born in Egypt as a Muslim. Make sure you read the paragraph (in red)towards the end. Joys of Muslim Women By Nonie Darwish In the Muslim faith a Muslim man can marry a child as young as 1 year old and have sexual intimacy with this child. Consummating the marriage by 9. The dowry is given to the family in exchange for the woman (who becomes his slave) and for the purchase of the private parts of the woman, to use her as a toy. Even though a woman is abused she can not obtain a divorce. To prove rape, the woman must have (4) male witnesses. Often after a woman has been raped, she is returned to her family and the family must return the dowry. The family has the right to execute her (an honor killing) to restore the honor of the family. Husbands can beat their wives 'at will' and he does not have to say why he has beaten her. The husband is permitted to have (4 wives) and a temporary wife for an hour (prostitute) at his discretion. The Shariah Muslim law controls the private as well as the public life of the woman. In the West World ( America and Britain ) Muslim men are starting to demand Shariah Law so the wife can not obtain a divorce and he can have full and complete control of her. It is amazing and alarming how many of our sisters and daughters attending American Universities and British Universities are now marrying Muslim men and submitting themselves and their children unsuspectingly to the Shariah law. By passing this on, enlightened American and British women may avoid becoming a slave under Shariah Law. Ripping the West in Two. Author and lecturer Nonie Darwish says the goal of radical Islamists is to impose Shariah law on the world, ripping Western law and liberty in two. She recently authored the book, Cruel and Usual Punishment: The Terrifying Global Implications of Islamic Law.Darwish was born in Cairo and spent her childhood i</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367416566582</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:56:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367416724984-21</Id><Topic><Title>Which religion is the most violent?</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367415715240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:41:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not a hard question to answer.

In 2010, 2011 and 2012 DHS ordered 148,314,825, 108,664,054 and 103,178,200 rounds of ammo respectively. In March 2013 they issued an open purchase order for 1.6 billion rounds. I am ready to listen to a sensible explanation for why 1.6 billion rounds of ammo, which is enough to shoot every man woman and child in the US 5 times, is needed now when 120 million rounds was enough in other years. There are roughly 230,000 DHS employees and if every one of them has a weapon the math equates to 7,000 rounds per DHS agent. The FBI only has 36,000 employees. I was unaware of these numbers until I did some research. Let's look at budget impact. The three year trend from above equates to $40,000,000.00/year spent on ammo. What is the rationale for now spending $533,000,000.00 on ammo while the public is still unable to tour "The People's House"? If I were in Congress not only would I want to know why DHS needs 1.6 billion bullets but I want to know why the US needs 230,000 people in the DHS to begin with especially when we do such a lousy job securing the borders?</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367417777300</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 10:16:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367418152167-25</Id><Topic><Title>Chief Engineer on 787 Says that the plane is perfectly safe....</Title><Username>av_week_reader</Username><Timestamp>1367156487405</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 09:41:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So the debate is where to have the fire?</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1367418152167</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 10:22:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367418651402-26</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans embrace conspiracy theory that DHS is buying up ammo</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367363748419</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 19:15:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You apparently are uninformed.

Over the past two weeks, I have sent four letters requesting that this Administration make information available about how lawyers – who already have security clearances and are representing Benghazi whistleblowers – can be cleared to fully hear their clients’ stories. I have yet to receive any response from the Obama Administration. Even if the President really doesn’t know anything about someone wanting to come forward, his position should be that whistleblowers deserve protection and that anyone who has different information about Benghazi is free to come forward to Congress. The President’s unwillingness to commit himself to protecting whistleblowers only aids those in his Administration who are intimidating them. Stonewalling over a cover-up? This is standard procedure for the Obama administration. President Obama has no interest in protecting whistleblowers, he's interested in punishing them for daring to to tell the truth about his failures.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1367419119127</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 10:38:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367419206169-28</Id><Topic><Title>Which religion is the most violent?</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367415715240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:41:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is common that people do not understand the so-called "violence" of the Old Testament. The folks that were "slaughtered" by Joshua, and Kings Saul and David were already condemned by God for their sins - like sorcery, homosexuality, divination, worshiping idols, blasphemy, necromancy, etc. He could have easily "spoken the Word" and they would all be dead - immediately. Instead, He made the Israelites do it. The question is why? Imagine that you were the jailer or the prosecutor or the judge or the soldier carrying out the laws and punishment for bad behavior. After a while you would "get it" - that such behavior is something not to do. Lots of blood? Yes. Good object lesson? None better. God was calling forth a "holy" nation that formed the lineage of Jesus and salvation. They needed to understand, like never had been done in the past, just how much God hates sin. But to be clear, the blood shedding was done under the direct orders of God for specific folks and for specific reasons. When Saul, for example, took it upon himself to "punish" the Gibeonites for deceiving Joshua into not killing them, the whole nation of Israel was punished for three years with a severe draught. Other belief systems propagate a rule of personal revenge and personal "jihad" (holy war) and that is prohibited in the Bible - not condoned, as the writer of this article erroneously asserts. -BB</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1367419206169</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 10:40:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367419212387-29</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans embrace conspiracy theory that DHS is buying up ammo</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367363748419</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 19:15:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Conspiracy FANTASY, Spart.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1367419212387</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 10:40:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367419397727-30</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans embrace conspiracy theory that DHS is buying up ammo</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367363748419</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 19:15:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of the guns I turned in ayt the recent Seattle buy-back was a semiautomatic pistol I putchased at a Washington Arms Collectors gun show in Puyallup.

Fully 42 percent (!) of Americans don't even realize that Obamacare is the law of the land. Wishful thinking, or ignorance? I'll go with door number two, which in this case probably doesn't have too many conservatives behind it. Jim Geraghty snarks, "How do we know the media is downplaying the problems in implementing Obamacare? When 40 percent of Americans are unaware that the law is in place." Nevertheless, approval of the president's top legislative "accomplishment" has plunged to its second-lowest point in three years. Politico reports: “Obamacare’s popularity has plunged steadily since November, according to monthly polling … by the Kaiser Family Foundation. … statistically tied with its lowest level of support since it passed in March 2010. … The poll … found that just 35 percent of Americans view Obamacare ‘very’ or ‘somewhat’ favorably, down 8 points since Election Day. Only once since the law passed has support run lower … 34 percent … in October 2011. … The poll found that with just a few months until the key coverage expansion provisions go into effect, more than 40 percent of Americans don’t know it’s on the books. About half of that group believes it’s been repealed by Congress or overturned by the Supreme Court, and the rest aren’t sure.”</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1367419557888</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 10:45:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367419932206-34</Id><Topic><Title>Which religion is the most violent?</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367415715240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:41:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he is YOU, huh hooz, i mean zosima</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367419932206</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 10:52:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367420706435-35</Id><Topic><Title>Which religion is the most violent?</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367415715240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:41:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sparty jumps from one side of the fence to the other to pimp his threads... my apologies to BB if he's not sparty pimping his own response why is it always in the aftermath of m uslim terrorist attacks, you're attacking christianity, using the bible and/or wars out of context to attack christianity?</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367420706435</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 11:05:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367420812989-36</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans embrace conspiracy theory that DHS is buying up ammo</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367363748419</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 19:15:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Salon journalists are making up stories and are devoid of facts in this report.

I'm also trying to buy a Sig Sauer 40 cal simi auto hand gun and it has been on back order since January and I suspect it will take about 1 year to get filled. I could get a gun like a Glock if I wanted to own one but the quality stuff seems to be in short supply. Someone is buying all this stuff up however the model I am getting, the P226 Equinox, is not commonly bought by government agencies so it can't be explained by that. My guess is that people are worried about gun control so they are buying as many guns as they can while they still can.

Stick, easy to say. Provide an example of a person or persons that, as real Christians, not in name only or "self declared", that have or has slaughtered millions. This is a difficult question to answer. First, you would have to know what it actually means to be a Christian. Start with that, then you can narrow down the so-called "slaughter" perp list. To help, there was a young fellow, named Steven, who became the first Christian martyr, and his martyrdom was supervised by the Apostle Paul - before Paul's conversion and salvation. Saul, Paul's original name, was a Jewish zealot and Roman citizen, seeking to rid the world of Christianity, by killing. Yes, indeed, Paul did do a lot of repentance (only Jesus can do the actual "atonement") - after his conversion. It is what happens after conversion that matters, whether or not there is a change of heart. Not perfection, but seeking to please God. Paul went on to write half of the New Testament. Is every life so dramatically changed? In the eyes of God, yes. In our eyes, imperfect, riddled with sin ourselves, it is less apparent. The reason is that, without that conversion, there is only one road that a person travels, that is the "wide road", the "broad way", that leads to destruction. The Lord sees either “saved” or “not saved”, so that conversion is profound, not nuanced.

An 11.5-percent annual drop in Pentagon spending resulted in slower growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) during the first quarter of 2013 than economists expected. So did the dozen years of war, with all the deaths, destruction, and expense they entailed, have the perverse silver lining of being good for the economy? Most mainstream economists -- who, like cynics, know the price of everything and the value of nothing -- would answer in the affirmative. .... Based on my almost three decades on Capitol Hill, most of them involved in defense budgeting, I can say authoritatively that military spending evokes an almost mystical reverence among many members of Congress. A $325-billion defense program like the F-35, however technically flawed, typically engenders less floor debate than relatively miniscule domestic programs such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. While politicians are notoriously prone to interpret data through the lens of ideology, the guns versus butter debate shows their cognitive dissonance at its most vivid. Republicans have made debt and deficit the centerpiece of their economic agenda, and their disdain for government spending makes for blistering GOP floor speeches. Their sole nostrum for recovery from the Great Recession has been austerity in the form of cutting government spending. But to paraphrase Nixon, when the subject is Pentagon spending, "they are all Keynesians now," and the GOP-led House has passed bills to exempt defense from sequestration.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367425152247</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:19:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367425164270-69</Id><Topic><Title>Which religion is the most violent?</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367415715240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:41:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can cite 1/2 dozen scholars that say Hitler was not a believer of Christianity if you want to have a real discussion instead of being a simpleton.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367425164270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:19:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367425197804-70</Id><Topic><Title>Chief Engineer on 787 Says that the plane is perfectly safe....</Title><Username>av_week_reader</Username><Timestamp>1367156487405</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 09:41:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't get it. 6 negatives no approval to my post.

Among Democrats, actually cutting defense, as opposed to theoretically being in favor of cutting it, is a difficult lift. And the idea that stagnating GDP might reflect defense cuts is now giving many of them second thoughts. Like all politicians, they are worried about jobs. Military spending may at one time have been a genuine job creator when weapons were compatible with converted civilian production lines, but the days of Rosie the Riveter are long gone. Most weapons projects now require relatively little touch labor. Instead, a disproportionate share is siphoned into high-cost R&amp;D (from which the civilian economy benefits little), exorbitant management expenditures, high overhead, and out-and-out padding, including money that flows back into political campaigns. A dollar appropriated for highway construction, health care, or education will likely create more jobs than a dollar for Pentagon weapons procurement. A University of Massachusetts study claims that several alternative projects would produce anywhere from 35 percent to 138 percent more jobs than spending the same amount on DOD. During the decade of the 2000s, DOD budgets, including funds spent on the war, doubled in our nation's longest sustained post-World War II defense increase. Yet during the same decade, jobs were created at the slowest rate since the Hoover administration. If defense helped the economy, it is not evident. And just the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan added over $1.4 trillion to deficits, according to the Congressional Research Service. Whether the wars were "worth it" or merely stirred up a hornet's nest abroad is a policy discussion for another time; what is clear is that whether you are a Keynesian or a deficit hawk, war and associated military spending are no economic panacea.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367425285232</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:21:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367425359247-74</Id><Topic><Title>Which religion is the most violent?</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367415715240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:41:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please deal in the present, not several centuries ago.

The three people were connected to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, the surviving bomb suspect, at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where Tsarnaev was a student. They allegedly helped him after the bombing, a different source told the Globe. “Additional details will be provided when they become available,” police said in a statement. No news conference was scheduled. Up until this point, the Boston attacks carried out by brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have been classified as "lone wolf attacks." President Obama expressed confidence that U.S. intelligence was functioning at a level sufficient to prevent large terrorist attacks, but warned of the difficulty agencies might have in tracking and preventing lone wolf attacks like the one in Boston earlier this month.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1367426675956</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:44:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367426915752-79</Id><Topic><Title>War is Good for the Economy !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367425152247</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:19:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not so good for the people coming back from Afganistan with blown off arms and legs tho</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367426915752</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:48:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367427174839-80</Id><Topic><Title>War is Good for the Economy !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367425152247</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:19:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dem mobro made disasters will stop at nothing, huh ahkmed</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367427174839</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:52:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367427452109-81</Id><Title>Ted Cruz 2016?</Title><Msg>After Ted Cruz got elected to the United States Senate last November I had a suspicion that we’d inevitably see a story like this in the not-too-distant future. Turns out I was right; I just didn’t expect to read it so soon (via NRO’s Robert Costa): Freshman senator Ted Cruz is considering a presidential run, according to his friends and confidants. Cruz won’t talk about it publicly, and even privately he’s cagey about revealing too much of his thought process or intentions. But his interest is undeniable. “If you don’t think this is real, then you’re not paying attention,” says a Republican insider. “Cruz already has grassroots on his side, and in this climate, that’s all he may need.” “There’s not a lot of hesitation there,” adds a Cruz donor who has known the Texan for decades. “He’s fearless.” Cruz, for his part, now joins a long list of conservative and Tea Party types mulling president runs in 2016. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Bobby Jindal -- just to name three -- seem to be at the top of the list. However, if Cruz does officially enter the race, he could shake up the primaries in new and exciting ways, not least because he’d almost certainly be considered the most conservative candidate vying for the nomination. From the NRO article: That ideological purity and Cruz’s presidential maneuvers make aides close to other Republican contenders nervous. The backroom Republican consensus is that a Cruz insurgency would hardly be a quixotic publicity stunt. He’d outflank almost all of the other candidates on the right, and his debating skills, which once won him national awards, would be formidable. It doesn’t hurt that much of the media already hates him with a passion. It’s probably a good rule of thumb to remember that the more the media hates you, the more conservatives will support you. Costa, meanwhile, also notes that in many respects Cruz would be a “Barry Goldwater type” -- that is, a candidate who would challenge and shake-up “the establishment” -- and therefore hopefully usher in a new, 21st century conservative political awakening. But because of his close-knit ties to political financiers such as Peter Thiel, for example -- and, as noted above, his exceptional debating and speaking skills -- he’d be a formidable contender. So while it’s only 2013, and the prospect of a Ted Cruz presidential run is perhaps years away, it should not be taken lightly. This guy might run.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1367427452109</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:57:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367427928381-82</Id><Topic><Title>War is Good for the Economy !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367425152247</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:19:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spazticus, have you considered dumbos have grown the annual cost of government more'n the TOTAL cost of the war in Iraq, almost as much as the the war in Iraq AND Afhanistan. no escaping the terror and despair here at home either, suicide just past auto accidents as the primary cause of non disease related death. 20 million people who want and/or need jobs but can't find em. barack's giving back though, his domestic energy moratorium keeps the world price high for the benefit of his saudi and elite/marxist benefactors</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367427928381</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:05:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367428096930-83</Id><Title>‘Obamacare’ Poll Finds 42% of Americans Unaware It’s Law</Title><Msg>A new poll finds that many Americans are confused about the health care overhaul legislation commonly called “Obamacare.” The Kaiser Family Foundation released results of a non-partisan study today finding more than 40 percent did not even know the law was in place. “Four in ten Americans (42%) are unaware that the ACA [Affordable Care Act] is still the law of the land,” the report says, “including 12 percent who believe the law has been repealed by Congress, 7 percent who believe it has been overturned by the Supreme Court and 23 percent who say they don’t know enough to say what the status of the law is.” The survey showed public opinion on Obamacare is at its second-lowest rating in the past two years. Less than half – 40 35 percent – of adults viewed the ACA favorably, whereas 35 40 percent said they viewed it unfavorably. Another 24 percent said they did not know or refused to answer. Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, one of the original crafters of the bill, earlier this month predicted a chaotic implementation process for the Affordable Care Act. “I just see a huge train wreck coming down,” Baucus, D-Mont., said. The president today defended his health care plan against that claim. “I think that any time you’re implementing something big, there is going to be people who are nervous and anxious about is it going to get done until it’s actually done,” he told reporters. He went on to say those who would have trouble with implementation were the roughly 48 million Americans who are uninsured to begin with, a minority of the population. “For the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, this thing’s already happened, and their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better, more secure than it was before,” President Obama said. “Full stop. That’s it. Now they don’t have to worry about anything else.” Recognizing one confusing aspect of the law, the Department of Health and Human Services today made applying to enter the insurance market through the Affordable Care Act a little easier. HHS today released new applications for individuals and adults looking to get health insurance. Officials cut the forms down from 21 pages to seven pages for a family and three pages for an individual.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1367428096930</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:08:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367428443731-84</Id><Topic><Title>War is Good for the Economy !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367425152247</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:19:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well lookie here, bumper-brains having a conversation with HIMSELF.

Concurrently he also announced that the just released April ADP was a huge miss to expectations of 150K, printing at just 119K, or a 31K miss. This was the 5th month in a row of declines excluding the small bounce in February data. It also means that the combined miss to expectations including March (original estimate +200K) and April (estimate 150K) is precisely 100K. This excludes whatever revisions ADP will do to the April number following the even bigger looming NFP miss. Manufacturing jobs? -10,000. Oh yes, anyone looking for seasonally unadjusted ADP data, good luck - keep on looking. In short: yet another atrocious economic data point which however may need the support of the equally horrible sub-49 Mfg ISM due out shortly to take out 1600 in the S&amp;P. Aside for the tiny bounce in February, this would be the 5th consecutive drop in the ADP number starting with the November 276K surge, driven purely by the QE4EVA euphoria.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367431621138</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:07:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367431737558-103</Id><Topic><Title>Which religion is the most violent?</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367415715240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:41:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes it does matter moron.

The usual hawks are pushing for immediate and elaborate military intervention—without always being specific. On ABC's This Week, Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), the chair of the House intelligence committee, said the red line "cannot be a dotted line" and "some action needs to be taken." On CBS's Face the Nation, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) maintained "there's a growing consensus in the US Senate that the United States should get involved." And several Democrats have echoed the call for doing something in response to the latest reports on chemical weapons. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the chair of the Senate intelligence committee, said "action must be taken." House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said, "I myself think that we have tolerated for too long all of the assaults on the Syrian people made by its own government. I think we have to take it to the next step." Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), He called for an international force that would locate and secure chemical weapons in Syria. "There are a number of caches of these chemical weapons," he said. "They cannot fail into the hands of the jihadists." He repeated his proposal for establishing a no-fly zone and providing arms to the rebels, who already have been receiving weapons from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. But real neocons, it seems, do not get squishy when the question is US troops on Syrian soil. After Obama's press conference, a publicist for the American Center for Democracy shot out a press release touting the group's director, Rachel Ehrenfeld, and her proposals for action in Syria. She has three simple steps for the United States: bypass the United Nations and impose a no-fly zone in Syria; stop giving arms to rebels associated with Al Qaeda; and deploy US troops within Syria to secure chemical-weapons facilities.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367438368849</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367438490812-128</Id><Topic><Title>Close Gitmo</Title><Username>agent0977</Username><Timestamp>1367436520143</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:28:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367438490812</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 16:01:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367438985798-129</Id><Topic><Title>Was Jesus a Socialist?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367435515471</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:11:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>better to be a liberalnazi than a feminine floydian !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367438985798</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 16:09:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367439076784-130</Id><Topic><Title>Happy May Day to Genna, Hooz, Zosima, Paul Revere........</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367432788782</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:26:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>@ "However, that's all just one person!

To take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the Constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs not contemplated by its creators." Thomas Jefferson backed up Madison by declaring, "Congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically enumerated." " The government of the United States is a definite government, confined to specified objects. It is not like state governments, whose powers are more general. Charity is no part of the legislative duty of the government." -- James Madison, speech in the House of Representatives, January 10, 1794 "The majority, oppressing an individual, is guilty of a crime, abuses its strength, and by acting on the law of the strongest breaks up the foundations of society." -- Thomas Jefferson In a famous incident in 1854, President Franklin Pierce was pilloried for vetoing an extremely popular bill intended to help mentally ill. The act was championed by the renowned 19th century social reformer Dorothea Dix. In the face of heavy criticism, Pierce countered: "I cannot find any authority in the Constitution for the public charity." To approve such spending, argued Pierce, "would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the Constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the Union of these States is founded." "The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it." --John Stuart Mill In 1794, when Congress appropriated $15,000 for relief of French refugees who fled from insurrection in San Domingo to Baltimore and Philadelphia, James Madison stood on the floor of the House to object saying, "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents." -- James Madison, 4 Annals of congress 179 (1794) "If Congress can determine what constitutes the general welfare and can appropriate money for its advancement, where is the limitation to carrying into execution whatever can be effected by money?" -- South Carolina Senator William Draden 1828 "I would have government defend the life and property of all citizens equally; protect all willing exchange; suppress and penalize all fraud, all misrepresentation, all violence, all predatory practices; invoke a common justice under law; and keep the records incidental to these functions. Even this is a bigger assignment than governments, generally, have proven capable of. Let governments do these things and do them well. Leave all else to men in free and creative effort." Leonard E. Read "Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute." -- Representative Robert Goodloe Harper, Address, June 18, 1798 (Harper was the Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means) "To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers, have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it." -- Thomas Jefferson, letter to Joseph Milligan, April 6, 1816 If 'Thou shalt not covet' and 'Thou shalt not steal' were not commandments of Heaven, they must be made inviolable precepts in every society before it can be civilized or made free." -- John Adams, A Defense of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America, 1787</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367439939324</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 16:25:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367440583502-132</Id><Title>Is Heaven one big gay bathhouse and was Jesus for sodomy?</Title><Msg>Angels always appeared as men in scripture right, so what was going on in Heaven?

In an interview with WMAL's Chris Plante, Victoria Toensing contended that the Obama State Department's actions violate both civil and criminal law. At issue is her client's current inability to freely discuss his or her knowledge of the case with Toensing, which she called an imperative step in the process. Some of the pertinent information this individual wishes to divulge was gleaned during classified briefings, and therefore cannot legally be imparted to anyone below a certain security clearance level. Toensing, who served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Reagan administration, has held numerous high-level clearances throughout her career, but isn't being "given the time of day" now that she's requesting one on this matter. Receiving such a clearance is central to her ability to zealously represent her client, she said; the venerable Washington attorney is seeking to shield her client against any legal ramifications that may arise from "going public." Toensing wouldn't comment on the identity of the person she's representing, beyond the fact that he or she is a career State Department employee based on the East Coast. The key is what her client knows: Toensing disclosed that her client has pertinent information on all three time periods investigators consider relevant to the attacks: the months that led up to September 11, when pleas by the ambassador and his staff for enhanced security in Benghazi were mostly rejected by senior officers at the State Department; the eight-hour time frame in which the attacks unfolded; and the eight-day period that followed the attacks, when Obama administration officials falsely described them as the result of a spontaneous protest over a video. She also confirmed that a Special Ops whistle-blower who spoke anonymously to Fox News earlier this week is not her client. That official -- who reportedly lives on the West Coast -- alleges that the US government could have deployed at least two different "asset" groups to intervene in Benghazi prior to the second wave of the attack, during which terrorists claimed two more American lives:</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367442443487</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 17:07:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367442829600-137</Id><Topic><Title>Lawyer for Benghazi Whistle-blower: Obama Administration Obstructing Justice</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367442443487</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 17:07:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UPDATE II - Wow.

There are those who argue that legalizing it would diminish traditional marriage. And those advocating for gay marriage have long stated that the issue will not harm traditional marriage. Ms. Gessen’s comments on the subject seem to contradict the pro-gay-marriage party lines. Gessen shared her views on the subject and very specifically stated; •“Gay marriage is a lie.” •“Fighting for gay marriage generally involves lying about what we’re going to do with marriage when we get there.” •“It’s a no-brainer that the institution of marriage should not exist.” (This statement is met with very loud applause.) As mentioned above, Gessen also talked about redefining the traditional family. This may have something to do with the fact that she has “three children with five parents”: “I don’t see why they (her children) shouldn’t have five parents legally. I don’t see why we should choose two of those parents and make them a sanctioned couple.”</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367455119008</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 20:38:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367455366757-160</Id><Topic><Title>It's funny to Watch Zosima trying to defend Communism.....</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1367338721035</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 12:18:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's almost as funny as watching hooz trying to use the Bible to defend the Democrats advocacy for communism.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367455366757</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 20:42:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367455749885-161</Id><Topic><Title>Crazy Thought of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367447759734</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 18:35:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are you so obsessed with Levon?</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1367455749885</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 20:49:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367455900690-162</Id><Topic><Title>AP - Iraq War vet armed with (AR-15) rifle thwarts gas station break-in, police say</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367449613252</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 19:06:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why does a story about a veteran defending himself with an AR-15 cause you to jump up and down while gnashing your tooth?</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1367455900690</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 20:51:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367456452088-163</Id><Topic><Title>Ted Cruz will never be president</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367454429514</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 20:27:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And I told you he was an empty suit Chicago Way thug who would crash in his job approval ratings when people learned the truth about him. lol</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1367456452088</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 21:00:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367457011330-164</Id><Topic><Title>Alex Jones takes break from Boston Marathon bombing conspiracies to go on transphobic rant</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367453875799</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 20:17:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let me guess.....You get your Anti Liberty agenda from the Southern Poverty Law Center ...that's it isint it ?

I don’t think so. Yes Benghazi is important. Yes, Fast and Furious is important. However, it appears that for the first time we have a man in the White House that we cannot really say is even from this country and apparently there is some serious felonies taking place in attempts to cover up what should be the biggest story covered in America and that is to expose a usurper to the office of President of the United States. In case you are still thinking this doesn’t matter, might I suggest you consider how this would impact things, versus impeachment for Benghazi or Fast and Furious? Understand that this would potentially nullify every law he has signed, every executive order he has given, and every Supreme Court appointment he has made. While many are saying that Benghazi is bigger than Watergate, and it most definitely is, the Obama eligibility issue is bigger than all Obama’s scandals, in my opinion, because of the tentacles around things that it affects.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1367466136155</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 23:42:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
