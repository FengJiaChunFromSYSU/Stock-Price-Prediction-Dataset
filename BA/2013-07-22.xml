A fire that started in the ceiling of a Swissair Boeing MD-11 on Sept. 2, 1998, caused the pilots to lose control. All 229 people aboard died when the plane plunged into the ocean near Halifax, Nova Scotia. It took only 16 minutes from the time the crew detected the fire until the plane became uncontrollable, according to an FAA advisory. There have been at least seven fatal accidents worldwide after fires started in hidden areas, according to the advisory. If the lithium battery-fed fire that scorched a parked and empty Boeing Co. (BA) Dreamliner jet in London had occurred over the ocean, hours from an airport, the result could have been catastrophic. The July 12 blaze on the Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise 787 was in a difficult-to-reach space and couldn’t be put out by the plane’s fire extinguishers, according to U.K. regulators. Only one-third of airliners with such hidden fires can be expected to land safely, an earlier U.K. study concluded! Since 2009, there have been 26 instances of lithium-based batteries overheating or catching fire aboard U.S. carriers, according to a log kept by the FAA. The FAA issued a safety alert to airlines in 2010 after a United Parcel Service Inc. Boeing 747 carrying a shipment of lithium batteries caught fire and crashed in Dubai. The United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority is scheduled to issue a report on that accident on July 24. Lithium-manganese-dioxide batteries, like those that power the Honeywell beacons, can be so volatile and difficult to extinguish that the FAA banned their shipment as cargo on passenger planes in 2004.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1374470125545</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 01:15:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374470335387-4</Id><Topic><Title>Geroge Zimmerman got a Fair Trial</Title><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1374354781046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 17:13:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All good points, Hooz; maybe the worst you can say about Trayvon's reaction is he should have had a little anger management coaching.

The flight deck overhead fire had penetrated the Oxygen system. Fire was like a blow torch fwd into the cockpit and aft into the cabin. the rows of seat behind the flight deck had the seat material melting (starts melting around 575 degrees) It should give an idea of conditions, the worst nightmare. An example of the seriousness of fires on airplanes. The most serious condition and it demands the absolute most attention.</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1374472303005</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 01:51:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374473732947-7</Id><Topic><Title>Geroge Zimmerman got a Fair Trial</Title><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1374354781046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 17:13:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There's following, and there's stalking. One is legal and one isn't. If Martin had been a woman, Zimmerman's actions would probably have been perceived as stalking. Not that men don't get stalked, but the public takes it more seriously when it happens to a woman. And, if a woman had thumped Zimmerman in the head with a brick, or popped him with a firearm from her handbag, Zimmerman wouldn't have been acquitted even if the woman ended up dead. I still say the jury came to the correct conclusion, but it doesn't mean Zimmerman wasn't over the line.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1374473732947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 02:15:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374474214749-8</Id><Title>Boeing earnings july 24th Q 2 ?</Title><Msg>Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is expected to report Q2 earnings on July 24.

Trayvon was describing him to her. She said, "Well, you better run, Trayvon," and then she pointed out that Trayvon wasn't "that way," meaning he's not gay. And then she reminded everybody that Trayvon's little brother was at the house where he was staying and didn't want that predator following them home with the little baby there. So it wasn't racism, It was homophobia. Trayvon Martin was homophobic, as admitted to by Rachel Jeantel. So Trayvon gave him an a kicking because he thought Zimmerman was a gay perv. This explains a lot in a weird Charles Bronson Shakespearean way.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1374474539477</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 02:28:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374476068441-10</Id><Topic><Title>Geroge Zimmerman got a Fair Trial</Title><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1374354781046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 17:13:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Though I recognize that our lead Bible-thumper is convinced he is already in he !!" No. That is the opposite of what I said. I was giving him the benefit of the doubt. Re-read the post. I said, "if he were a Christian ..." I never said he was not. I do not know and you do not know. The subject trigger about his faith was from Jeantel's discussion of her praying for him and her encouraging him to pray. My point was that sometimes the Lord takes Christians "home" (that is heaven) when their behavior brings shame to the name of the Lord. That is the meaning and warning of 1 Corinthans 5:5. And Trayvon's behavior was shameful, as he testified about himself through his salacious and graphic Tweets as well as cell phone text messages regarding his school behavior, his drug use, his being kicked out of his mom's house, his seeking to obtain an illegal weapon, his insensitivity to someone being beat up, etc. He indicted himself. It is not a gigantic leap of logic to presume, based upon his other salacious and recurring violent behavior that he started the altercation with Zimmerman. And apparently, that is also what the jury thought. I see the tragedy; I just don't see his being a Poster Child for anything other than bad behavior.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1374476068441</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 02:54:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374484314360-11</Id><Topic><Title>CLASSIC Obama Quote: "We Refused to Let Detroit Go Bankrupt"</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374465169302</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 23:52:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Kent Raven doesn't like that.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1374484314360</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 05:11:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374485659071-12</Id><Title>BA Partner Company Ready to Double in Value</Title><Msg>Concurrent (CCUR) next month is set to report their fiscal 2013 annual results and if their 4Q is a repeat of the 3Q, CCUR's GAAP EPS for the year will be $0.33 vs. a loss of ($0.34) in fiscal 2012, along with a non-GAAP EPS profit of $0.52. Major consolidation is taking place in the pay-TV industry and CCUR is one of the largest technology vendors serving the industry. Time Warner Cable (TWC) - America's #2 cable TV operator - relies on CCUR's technology for video on demand (VOD), start-over, look-back, CDN video solutions, multi-screen video delivery, and more! CCUR just signed a huge CDN/multi-screen deal with Virgin Media, the largest cable TV operator in the UK, and revenues from Virgin will begin to show up for the first time in CCUR's earnings for the 4Q in next month's 10-K! CCUR's top two publicly traded competitors are SEAC and HLIT. Both hit new 52-week highs last week. SEAC is now trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.85 and HLIT has an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.09. Their average enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.47 would value CCUR today at $13.17 per share. CCUR has had resistance between $8 and $8.45, but as soon as CCUR breaks through this it should explode to a minimum of $13. CCUR currently pays an industry leading dividend yield of 6.2%! CCUR's potential non-GAAP EPS for the year of $0.52 will exceed SEAC's current trailing non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 as well as HLIT's current trailing non-GAAP EPS of $0.21! CCUR deserves to be trading well above SEAC's current share price of $12.32 and for more than double HLIT's current share price of $6.99. CCUR has almost no downside here at $7.78! CCUR also has a "real time" computer processor technology division and BA is one of their major clients!</Msg><Username>tmojut5843</Username><Timestamp>1374485659071</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 05:34:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
