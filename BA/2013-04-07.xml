D. Heyes Natural News April 7, 2013 It is a concept that seems basic – almost rudimentary – even for a child, but apparently one leading left-wing gun-banning congresswomen didn’t seem to realize during recent televised proceedings that gun magazines can be reloaded. Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado has been a leading congressional sponsor of a federal ban on high-capacity magazines for years, even calling it one of her top priorities. With that said, you would assume, then, that this esteemed member of the House would at least have a base of knowledge about how such devices work – right? Well, if you assumed that you’d be wrong. Ignorance may be bliss but not when it comes to gun rights At an April 2 forum on gun control that was hosted by The Denver Post, “the senior congresswoman from Denver appeared to not understand how guns work,” the paper said. When she was asked how a ban on magazines holding more than 15 bullets would be an effective deterrent to gun violence, this is what the brainiac said: “I will tell you these are ammunition, they’re bullets, so the people who have those know they’re going to shoot them, so if you ban them in the future, the number of these high capacity magazines is going to decrease dramatically over time because the bullets will have been shot and there won’t be any more available.” These shiny brass-and-lead things, see, are bullets, and, you know, once you shoot ‘em, well, then, um, you know, they’re gone and with them, um, the clip thingies too. What is she babbling about? She doesn’t know - and that’s the problem. Per the Post: What she didn’t appear to understand is that a magazine can be reloaded with more bullets.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365340784266</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 09:19:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365341047622-6</Id><Topic><Title>87% believe the 1969 'manned' lunar wasn;t a hoax...</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1365283824918</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 17:30:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Prove your normal...You can't</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365341047622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 09:24:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365341483337-7</Id><Title>Biden calls for N.W.O.

No, war is not peace. George Carlin used to riff about oxymorons like “jumbo shrimp,” “genuine imitation,” “political science” and “military intelligence.” But humor is of the gallows sort when we consider the absurdity and tragedy of the world’s most important peace prize honoring the world’s top war maker. This week, a challenge has begun with the launch of a petition urging the Norwegian Nobel Committee to revoke Obama’s Peace Prize. By midnight of the first day, nearly 10,000 people had signed. The online petition simply tells the Nobel committee: “I urge you to rescind the Nobel Peace Prize that was awarded to Barack Obama.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365379617772</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:06:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365379784730-82</Id><Topic><Title>Colorado gun control lawmaker doesn’t realize magazines can be reloaded</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365340784266</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 09:19:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fronteir Justice coupled with Natrual law (IE: the time immerial freedom to defend ones hearth and home)....Go ahead...make my day !</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365379784730</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:09:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365380497579-83</Id><Topic><Title>Colorado gun control lawmaker doesn’t realize magazines can be reloaded</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365340784266</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 09:19:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm just frustrated with your lying and your attitude that you are qualified to know what I want or need for my safety.

I already know it is far less than the number of people killed with hammers and also lower than the number of people killed with bare hands and feet. Stop being ignorant. Just because you think assault weapons are a huge problem doesn't meam they are and you have no facts to back it up. I'm still waiting for a semi intelligent answer (actually any answer) for how banning assault rifles and banning high capacity clips would have prevented Sandy Hook or James Holmes. Explain how a background check would have stopped James Holmes when the police already knew he was a high risk for mass murder. Unless you can do that you are spreading progressive ideological garbage. You've had months to address these questions and you have nothing. When you are the one being evasive and unable to answer straight forward questions why am I the problem? 10 times as many people die from cell phone use in a car than die from assault rifles. Do you think the solution is to limit everyone's user minutes (smaller magazine analogy) or should we just ban cell phones completely (assault rifle analogy)? I know we should do background checks on all cell phone users who drive cars. Following your logic thus far, limiting cell phone usage minutes, banning phones and doing background checks is the solution to cell phone deaths in cars.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1365380497579</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:21:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365381818419-84</Id><Topic><Title>Colorado gun control lawmaker doesn’t realize magazines can be reloaded</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365340784266</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 09:19:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>@ "There have been too many murders using #$%$ault weapons and/or large capactiy magazines.
