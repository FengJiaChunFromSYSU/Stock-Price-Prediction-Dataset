From the beginning, President Obama, Secretary of State Hillary of Clinton, UN Ambassador Susan Rice and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney all told the American people the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were a result of a protest over a YouTube video raging out of control. As we've known for months and revisited Wednesday through testimony from whistleblower Greg Hicks, there was no protest. The video claim is completely fabricated. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack and was reported as such to Hillary Clinton at 2 a.m. Reports of a protest outside of the consulate were never issued from Libya to Washington because there wasn't one. Regardless, the White House, not the intelligence community, came up with falsified talking points. According to ABC News, they were changed 12 times. ABC News has obtained 12 different versions of the talking points that show they were extensively edited as they evolved from the drafts first written entirely by the CIA to the final version distributed to Congress and to U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice before she appeared on five talk shows the Sunday after that attack. White House emails reviewed by ABC News suggest the edits were made with extensive input from the State Department. The edits included requests from the State Department that references to the Al Qaeda-affiliated group Ansar al-Sharia be deleted as well references to CIA warnings about terrorist threats in Benghazi in the months preceding the attack. FLASHBACK: That would appear to directly contradict what White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said about the talking points in November. “Those talking points originated from the intelligence community. They reflect the IC’s best assessments of what they thought had happened,” Carney told reporters at the White House press briefing on November 28, 2012. “The White House and the State Department have made clear that the single adjustment that was made to those talking points by either of those two institutions were changing the word ‘consulate’ to ‘diplomatic facility’ because ‘consulate’ was inaccurate.”</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1368192008748</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 09:20:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368192016330-22</Id><Topic><Title>Congresswoman: Obama gave the stand down order</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368184121473</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 07:08:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>all he wanted was a little MORE personal time to watch the boob tube and get some sleep, he had a big day campaigning fund raising in las vegas next day scrambling people to save his people in benghazi woulda messed up the schedule</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1368192016330</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 09:20:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368192291682-23</Id><Topic><Title>Why did Obama and Hillary Lie?</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1368134323559</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 17:18:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let me outline just what a moron you are: - Sparty is a guy named John Whitworth who lives in Michigan. - Chris Genna lives in Washington.

The first one being "demoralization". It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation. Why that many years? Because this is the minimum number of years required to educate one generation of students in the country of your enemy exposed to the ideology of [their] enemy. In other words, Marxism-Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generation of American students without being challenged or counterbalanced by the basic values of Americanism; American patriotism.... The result? The result you can see ... the people who graduated in the 60's, dropouts or half-baked intellectuals, are now occupying the positions of power in the government, civil service, business, mass media, and educational systems. You are stuck with them. You can't get through to them. They are contaminated. They are programmed to think and react to certain stimuli in a certain pattern [alluding to Pavlov].

You strike me as a person who wouldn't want the USA to be self sufficient and independent of foreign oil. Washington, D.C. - infoZine - The BBC reports in "UN's Del Ponte Says Evidence Syria Rebels 'Used Sarin'" that Carla Del Ponte, a member of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, stated that the investigation has so far found that nerve gas appeared to be "used by the opponents, by the rebels. And we have no indication at all that the government, the authority of the Syrian government, had used chemical weapons." Francis Boyle is a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law and most recently author of Destroying Libya and World Order. He said today: "I have worked personally with Carla Del Ponte.

Organizations were singled out because they included the words "tea party" or "patriot" in their applications for tax-exempt status, said Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups. In some cases, groups were asked for their list of donors, which violates IRS policy in most cases, she said. "That was wrong. That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. That's not how we go about selecting cases for further review," Lerner said at a conference sponsored by the American Bar Association. "The IRS would like to apologize for that," she added.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368202570921</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:16:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368203038950-72</Id><Topic><Title>IRS Apologizes For Inappropriately Targeting Conservative Political Groups In 2012 Election</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1368202570921</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:16:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is this another one of the Republicans poor me I`m a victim whines?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368203038950</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:23:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368203201384-73</Id><Topic><Title>why do Dems believe and give Obama admin a walk on all his admin. lies</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1368197537813</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 10:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you even know what you`re talking about there greg?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1368203201384</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:26:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368203264468-74</Id><Title>10% correction just around the corner: BA: 50DMA=$86.53 next??

He was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1911. He was also active in setting up the American Civil Liberties Union. As a candidate for President of the U. S. , Norman Thomas said, in a 1944 epoch speech: "The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But, under the name of "liberalism," they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation, without knowing how it happened." He went on to say: "I no longer need to run as a Presidential candidate for the Socialist Party.

The Kochs, notorious for funneling millions into Prop 32, union-busting in Wisconsin and dirty energy policies, would inevitably turn these esteemed newspapers into an anti-worker and anti-union propaganda machine. Union workers are fighting back against the Kochs and their effort to take over the LA Times. On Tuesday, workers and supporters will hit the streets for a “No Koch Hate” rally outside Oaktree Capital Management (which significant ownership in the LA Times parent company and figures prominently in the decision to sell the newspaper).

Fiske, in a 58-page report released in 1994, also concluded that Foster had committed suicide.[12] Theories of a cover-up still persisted, some of which were promulgated by the Arkansas Project.

But, here is how I look at it and what I mean by "the Lord is in control". Stepping back for a moment, He is the Creator. Everything across the immense span of this universe was created by Him. All knowing, all powerful, etc. And, based upon my readings of the Bible, His Word, He is not the author of sin or confusion, but He allows it because Man chooses those paths – in concert with his own “free will”. When we talk about "paths", we are talking about seeking Him and His love (in faith) or running away from Him and seeking one's own way. So, how does "control" fit in? It is not direct in this day and age, simply put. In order to allow man to choose, he has to have free will. If God stepped in every time to stop man's bad behavior, all of it, I suspect He would simply throw up His hands and say, "forget it!" (Obviously, my take and opinion.) We all know that the actions of those that do evil (such as Tsarnaev) are unfairly affecting those that try to not do evil (such as yourself). A student of the Bible will realize that God has manifested Himself in varying but concurrently consistent ways: directly, i.e., “face-to-face”, with Adam and Eve; semi-direct with Noah, Abraham, and Moses (via a “disembodied voice”), indirect via the prophets (during the reign of the Kings), completely non-direct today (post-Jesus) but through prayer, and finally “face-to-face” again during the post-tribulation thousand year reign of Jesus on earth. My take on all this is that the Lord will have demonstrated that it does not matter, in the end, how He manifests Himself to us, we are in control of our sin. As to He being “in control” I was referring to “world events”. The United States must become irrelevant, incompetent, or evil for Biblical prophecies of the end times to come to fruition. That is very clear in Daniel 8 and 9 and Revelation. Are we on that path is the question.
