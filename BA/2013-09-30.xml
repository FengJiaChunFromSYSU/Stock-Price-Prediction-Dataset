This isn't the first time the A320 has been plagued by landing gear problems. Just a few years ago, another A320 suffered a failure of its nose landing gear and had to make an emergency landing with the wheels of the nose landing gear locked 90 degrees to the direction of flight, resulting in a shower of sparks and fire upon landing.</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1380531057254</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 04:50:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380533330987-3</Id><Title>Short Interest Moves up 34% In Boeing Vierzig_nachten read the latest problem , enjoy !</Title><Msg>Boeing This Chicago-based aerospace and defense company saw short interest rise more than 34 percent in early September to more than 9.38 million shares.

BA for 3 years is up the least of my stocks ACAD is up 2903% I told you about that when you made your IGZ call remember that was when my ACAD was up 60% in a few days it is up another 323% since then, or do I need to post it here, IGZ, your call spartaucs99991, is not a real stock it did not make 144% it is a symbol used to check out the software on the stock market. 2. my TSLA is up 834% now the company has been publically traded about 3 years so far so that is my entry to today per CNN money stock chart 3 Airbus in 3 years is up 157% 4. Boeing in 3 years is a laggard 71% and most 57% of that gain was based only on the stock buy back to protect the stock because of the failure of the Boeing 787 each day airbus gets closer to launch of their lightweight plane . the battle is theirs to win now, if the plane is a dependable flyer then the 787 is as done as the comet, especially when one crashes this plane has been so close to a crash so many times no passengers will feel safe enough to fly on one soon .</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380536254073</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 06:17:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380538604853-6</Id><Topic><Title>The president is being a bit slippery on the costs of coverage, in particular. slippery = liar</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1380504051739</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 21:20:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama isn't slippery...His criminality is out in the open..The media carries his water and the most powerful interests in the world protect him.

The crew worked the relevant checklists without resolving the issue and therefore performed a low approach to runway 16L tracking between runway and parallel taxiway to have the aircraft inspected from the ground. The crew subsequently prepared for an emergency landing with the right hand main gear remaining retracted due to the right main gear doors not opening. The aircraft landed on runway 16L about 50 minutes after aborting the first approach and 25 minutes after the low approach, the aircraft came to a stop on the runway. The aircraft was evacuated via slides. No injuries are being reported.

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations evinces a design to reduce them under Absolute Despotism, it is their Right; it is their Duty, to throw off such arrangements, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of the members of this Profession; and such is now the necessity that constrains them to alter their former Financial Arrangements. The history of the present system is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct effect the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over the Medical Profession. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. The Tyranny began during the Second World War, when the Government gave tax subsidies to Employers who offered Health Insurance Benefits, thus penalizing and disenfranchising individuals. The Government created and subsidized the Health Maintenance Organizations---Entities designed to ration Health Care by Capitation; These incentives set Patient against Physician, thus destroying the Sacred Trust between patient and physician. The Government, in 1965, going far beyond its Powers as set out in the Constitution, decreed that the Poor and The Elderly should receive Health Care Benefits funded by the Taxpayer. Thus came into existence Medicaid and Medicare, massive Entitlements that are bankrupting the Federal and many State Governments. Alarmed by the rising Health Care prices that it had engendered, the Government set out to restrain fees to Physicians. These Price Controls increased Health Care Spending, as Volume of Services increased, and Quality decreased. No other Profession in the United States is denied the ability to raise fees to cover increasing costs of doing Business. The Government enacted the fraudulently named 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act' (HIPAA), orcing physicians, medical offices and hospitals to spend billions to comply with its provisions, with no positive effect on either Portability or Accountability, and many negative ones, especially on privacy. The Government passed the Sustainable Growth Rate formula which lowers Medicare Physician Payment when total spending and volume increase, assuring a downward spiral in Payments. The Government and HMOs now limit fees to Physicians by "Payment for Performance," based on "Practice Guidelines." Beyond insulting our Ethic, this destroys our Professional Autonomy. Our Leaders compel ongoing Maintenance of Certification that costs us time and money and does not improve patient care in the Least. A Temporary Democrat Congress and President have conspired to completely take over all aspects of the Health Care System, with all patient encounters feeding into a National Database. The so-called Affordable Care Act forces citizens to buy expensive “insurance,” subsidizes some, massively expands the Bureaucracy, and Empowers the corrupt Internal Revenue Service to oversee Private Health Care. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A System whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a Free Profession. We, therefore, the undersigned Physicians of the United States of America, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name of our Patients solemnly publish and declare, that we will withdraw our participation in all above-described Third Party Payment Systems.

Days later, Chamberlain signed a peace agreement that, though reviled in retrospect, was his best choice at the time. Photo by Fox Photos/Getty Images,Fox Photos Seventy-five years ago, on Sept. 30, 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain signed the Munich Pact, handing portions of Czechoslovakia to Adolf Hitler's Germany. Chamberlain returned to Britain to popular acclaim, declaring that he had secured "peace for our time." Today the prime minister is generally portrayed as a foolish man who was wrong to try to "appease" Hitler—a cautionary tale for any leader silly enough to prefer negotiation to confrontation. But among historians, that view changed in the late 1950s, when the British government began making Chamberlain-era records available to researchers. "The result of this was the discovery of all sorts of factors that narrowed the options of the British government in general and narrowed the options of Neville Chamberlain in particular," explains David Dutton, a British historian who wrote a recent biography of the prime minister. "The evidence was so overwhelming," he says, that many historians came to believe that Chamberlain "couldn't do anything other than what he did" at Munich. Over time, Dutton says, "the weight of the historiography began to shift to a much more sympathetic appreciation" of Chamberlain.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1380559313991</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 12:41:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380559370274-76</Id><Topic><Title>Neville Chamberlain Was Right</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1380559313991</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 12:41:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>First, a look at the military situation. Most historians agree that the British army was not ready for war with Germany in September 1938. If war had broken out over the Czechoslovak crisis, Britain would only have been able to send two divisions to the continent—and ill-equipped divisions, at that. Between 1919 and March 1932, Britain had based its military planning on a “10-year rule,” which assumed Britain would face no major war in the next decade. Rearmament only began in 1934—and only on a limited basis. The British army, as it existed in September 1938, was simply not intended for continental warfare. Nor was the rearmament of the Navy or the Royal Air Force complete. British naval rearmament had recommenced in 1936 as part of a five-year program. And although Hitler’s Luftwaffe had repeatedly doubled in size in the late 1930s, it wasn't until April 1938 that the British government decided that its air force could purchase as many aircraft as could be produced. All of this factored into what Chamberlain was hearing from his top military advisers. In March 1938 the British military chiefs of staff produced a report that concluded that Britain could not possibly stop Germany from taking Czechoslovakia. In general, British generals believed the military and the nation were not ready for war. On Sept. 20, 1938, then-Col.Hastings Ismay, secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defense, sent a note to Thomas Inskip, the minister for the coordination of defense, and Sir Horace Wilson, a civil servant. Time was on Britain’s side, Ismay argued, writing that delaying the outbreak of war would give the Royal Air Force time to acquire airplanes that could counter the Luftwaffe, which he considered the only chance for defeating Hitler. British strategists, including Ismay, believed their country could win a long war (so long as they had time to prepare for it). This was a common belief, and doubtless factored into Chamberlain's calculations. Historians disagree whether the British military's position relative to Germany was objectively better in 1939 than it was in 1938. The British military systematically overestimated German strength and underestimated its own in the lead-up to the Czechoslovak crisis, then shifted to a more optimistic tone in the months between Munich and the outbreak of war. Whatever the situation on the ground, it's clear that the British military’s confidence in its abilities was far higher in 1939 than it was during the Munich crisis, especially because of the development of radar and the deployment of new fighter planes. In 1939, the military believed it was ready. In 1938, it didn't. Chamberlain’s diplomatic options were narrow as well. In World War I, Britain's declaration of war had automatically brought Canada, Australia, and New Zealand into the fight. But the constitutional status of those Commonwealth countries had changed in the interwar period. According to the British archives, it was far from clear that Chamberlain could count on the backing of these countries if war broke out with Germany over Czechoslovakia. "There was really a feeling that the odds were against the potential of Britain being able to prevail facing Germany and potentially Italy and Japan, and with very few potential allies," Dutton says. Soviet Russia was seen as a potential enemy to be feared, not a potential ally. America's neutrality laws made it unlikely that even a willing president could bring the United States into the fight. There is also plenty of evidence in the archives that the British government had near-total disdain for the stability and fighting abilities of France, its only likely major-power ally. The average duration of a Third Republic government in the 1930s was nine months. When war did break out, Chamberlain's doubts about France's staying power proved prescient. Nor was the British public ready for war in September 1938. "It's easy to forget that this is only 20 years after the end of the last war," Dutton notes. British politicians knew that the electorate would never again willingly make sacrifices like the ones it had made in World War I. The Somme and Passchendaele had left scars that still stung, and few, if any, British leaders were prepared to ask their people to fight those battles again. Many people saw the work of the Luftwaffe in the Spanish Civil War and feared that aerial bombardment would ensure that a second war would be more devastating that the first. Any strategy that claimed to offer an alternative to sending large armies to Europe therefore found supporters on every level of British society. "There was a feeling that any sensible politician would explore every avenue to avoid war before accepting war was inevitable," Dutton says. If Britain were to go to war with Hitler's Germany, most people didn't want to do so over Czechoslovakia. "People spoke of Czechoslovakia as an artificial creation," Dutton says. "The perception by the ’30s was there was a problem, it was soluble by negotiation, and we ought to try. It was not the sort of thing that would unite the country [as] an issue to go to war over." Nor is the modern view of Hitler reflective of how the #$%$ dictator was seen in the late 1930s. Blitzkrieg and concentration camps were not yet part of the public imagination. The British had already been dealing with one fascist, Benito Mussolini, for years before Hitler took power, and top British diplomats and military thinkers saw Hitler the way they saw Mussolini—more bravado than substance. Moreover, many Europeans thought German complaints about the settlement of World War I were legitimate. We now see Hitler's actions during the early and mid-1930s as part of an implacable march toward war. That was not the case at the time. German rearmament and the reoccupation of the Rhineland seemed inevitable, because keeping a big country like Germany disarmed for decades was unrealistic. Hitler's merging of Austria and Germany seemed to be what many Austrians wanted. Even the demands for chunks of Czechoslovakia were seen, at the time, as not necessarily unreasonable—after all, many Germans lived in those areas. So, when Chamberlain returned from Munich with the news that he had negotiated a peace agreement, cheering crowds filled the streets and the press rejoiced. To Chamberlain's credit, his views changed as Hitler's intentions became clearer. When Hitler took Prague and the Czech heartland in March 1939—his first invasion of an area that was obviously without deep German roots—Chamberlain said he feared it might represent an "attempt to dominate the world by force." He doubled the size of the Territorial Army (Britain's version of the National Guard) and, on April 20, launched peacetime conscription for the first time in Britain's history. Then, on Sept. 3, some 11 months after Munich, he took his country to war. Historians often find themselves moving against popular opinion. In the case of Chamberlain, though, the gap between public perception and the historical record serves a political purpose. The story we're told about Munich is one about the futility and foolishness of searching for peace. In American political debates, the words “appeasement” and “Munich” are used to bludgeon those who argue against war. But every war is not World War II, and every dictator is not Hitler. Should we really fault Chamberlain for postponing a potentially disastrous fight that his military advisers cautioned against, his allies weren't ready for, and his people didn't support? "People should try to put themselves into the position of the head of the British government in the 1930s," Dutton says. "Would they have taken the apparently huge risk of a war [that] might mean Armageddon for a cause that nobody was really convinced in?" Chamberlain's story is of a man who fought for peace as long as possible, and went to war only when it was the last available option. It's not such a bad epitaph.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1380559370274</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 12:42:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380559512407-77</Id><Topic><Title>Short Interest Moves up 34% In Boeing Vierzig_nachten read the latest problem , enjoy !</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380533330987</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 05:28:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump this for vierzig_nachton, Boeing stock is down today 1.18% but my stock TSLA is up 1.19% , that's now up 470% year to date, and my ACAD is up 2.44%, that is now 495% year to date, and airbus is up now to 60% year to date while vierzig_nachton your Boeing stock is down again today now at 55% year to date.

The SFP in 2013 is the first one that doesn't include the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity which is the estimate of Earth's warming response to a doubling of CO2. The IPCC footnote in the SFP clearly states that scientists could not agree on the ECS so they didn't include it in the summary. This is huge issue because for all models being used by the IPCC to predict future warming, ECS is the most critical factor. If the models overstated ECS by a factor of 100%, as some newer studies that did not meet the deadline to be included in IPCC AR5 indicate, then future warming will be roughly 1/2 of what the models predict. Another key issue the activist journalists ignore is the non-warming of the Lower Troposphere which is built into all the models. The physics requires that the LT warm faster than the planet surface if CO2 is the true culprit. The two satellite programs that have been monitoring this LT warming since 1979 RSS/MSU and UAH/NSSTC show no scientifically significant warming for 17 and 16 years respectively in the LT. In 1988 James Hansen tried to frighten congress with only 10 years of upward trend from those same satellites but now magically 17 years of additional data that is not in agree ment with the first 10 years is being ignored.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380559595333</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 12:46:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380559827284-79</Id><Topic><Title>Top MIT scientist: Newest UN climate report is ‘hilariously’ flawed'</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1380550017978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 10:06:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lindzen is one of the 95% or didn't you know that?

Norwegian Air's GoldCare maintenance contract has served only to deepen Boeing's PR troubles by giving the company direct responsibility for sorting problem out. Norwegian Air's formal request on Saturday for Boeing to take charge of fixing the plane throws a spotlight a huge facet of the 787's performance: reliability. And it shows how quickly a plane that cannot fly can hit a carrier's bottom line. The carrier said it had to rent AIRBUS planes and cancel tickets when it could not use its 787s, and the company's stock has fallen 6 percent since a peak earlier this month, hit by a string of 787 problems and concerns about its broader business.

The grounded Boeing 787 planes have prompted Norwegian Air to voice its dissatisfaction with the aircraft. "The aircraft's reliability is simply not acceptable," Norwegian Air spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said on Saturday. "Our passengers cannot live with this kind of performance." . The airline demanded Boeing fix the state-of-the-art jet, saying it needs repairs after less than 30 days in service. The first two Dreamliners, delivered in recent weeks and part of a planned fleet of eight, broke down more than half a dozen times in September, forcing Norwegian Air to lease back-up AIRBUS planes on short notice or cancel flights Norwegian Air grounded its 787s several times, citing problems with brakes, hydraulic pumps and power.

Bretherton, an atmospheric researcher at the University of Washington, said Lindzen is "feeding upon an audience that wants to hear a certain message, and wants to hear it put forth by people with enough scientific reputation that it can be sustained for a while, even if it’s wrong science. I don’t think it’s intellectually honest at all." Kerry A. Emanuel, another M.I.T. scientist, said of Lindzen's views "Even if there were no political implications, it just seems deeply unprofessional and irresponsible to look at this and say, ‘We’re sure it’s not a problem.’ It’s a special kind of risk, because it’s a risk to the collective civilization." A 1996 New York Times article included the comments of several other experts. Jerry Mahlman, director of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, did not accept Lindzen's assessment of the science, and said that Lindzen had "sacrificed his luminosity by taking a stand that most of us feel is scientifically unsound."</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1380562648164</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 13:37:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380562692267-98</Id><Topic><Title>Short Interest Moves up 34% In Boeing Vierzig_nachten read the latest problem , enjoy !</Title><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380533330987</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 05:28:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess vierzig_nachton is too busy working for Boeing today to answer ? vierzig_nachton,said he is rich and yet works for Boeing wow sounds like father to me " he is also rich and discussed things with his close personal friend paul allen, LOL , here is VN bragging that he is rich ha ha o vierzig_nachten • Sep 28, 2013 6:54 AM ..."

When the president considered sitting down with the four congressional leaders in the White House ahead of the deadline to avert a government shutdown, Reid privately urged Obama to call off the meeting, according to several people familiar with the situation. Reid believed that it would amount to nothing more than a photo-op that would give the false impression that a serious negotiation was occurring, even warning he wouldn’t attend such a session. Obama scrapped it.</Msg><Username>ireadhistory2</Username><Timestamp>1380567272056</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 14:54:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380567392082-114</Id><Topic><Title>New Disease: Ted Cruz Syndrome</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380542321819</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 07:58:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...now looked upom more gegatively than the death panels?</Msg><Username>sdietrich</Username><Timestamp>1380567392082</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 14:56:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380567438016-115</Id><Title>LIVE - Ready for a major breakout!</Title><Msg>Buy and hold...</Msg><Username>martin.cohen88</Username><Timestamp>1380567438016</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 14:57:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380567472573-116</Id><Title>Woodward: If Obama Won't Negotiate, Any Resulting Crisis is "On His Head</Title><Msg>Will veteran journalist Bob Woodward end up back in the Obama administration's doghouse? If he keeps disrupting the narrative, he just might. On MSNBC this morning, Woodward expressed bafflement over the president's refusal to even engage in discussions with the GOP, noting that history tends to mark major events through the prism of presidencies: "If there is a downturn or a collapse or whatever could happen here that’s bad, it’s going to be on [Obama's] head. The history books are going to say, we had an economic calamity in the Presidency of Barack Obama. Speaker Boehner, indeed, is playing a role on this. Go back to the Great Depression in the 1930s. I’ll bet no one can name who was the speaker of the House at the time. Henry Thomas Rainey. He’s not in the history book. It’s on the President’s head. He’s got to lead. He’s got to talk. And the absence of discussion here, I think, is baffling element.”</Msg><Username>ireadhistory2</Username><Timestamp>1380567472573</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 14:57:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380568078128-117</Id><Title>Are Democrats to Dumb their Own Money?</Title><Msg>......and need Washington bureaucrats to spend it for them.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1380568078128</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 15:07:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380568128064-118</Id><Topic><Title>Woodward: If Obama Won't Negotiate, Any Resulting Crisis is "On His Head</Title><Username>ireadhistory2</Username><Timestamp>1380567472573</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 14:57:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Half of printed history is fish tales and propaganda no amount of spin will change the fact that Republicans root for America to fail for their own personnel gain.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1380568128064</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 15:08:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380568248179-119</Id><Topic><Title>Are Democrats to Dumb their Own Money?</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1380568078128</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 15:07:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That to is missing another o and should be too but the other o is being save in case someone call ibtard asshles.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1380568248179</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 15:10:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380568302391-120</Id><Topic><Title>Any pilots here?</Title><Username>narfmasta1</Username><Timestamp>1380555903963</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 11:45:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NSA knew everything and nothing.

Lemming "suicide" is a frequently used metaphor in reference to people who go along unquestioningly with popular opinion, with potentially dangerous or fatal consequences. The behavior of lemmings is much the same as that of many other rodents which have periodic population booms and then disperse in all directions, seeking the food and shelter their natural habitats cannot provide. The Norway lemming and brown lemming are two of the few vertebrates which reproduce so quickly, their population fluctuations are chaotic, rather than following linear growth to a carrying capacity or regular oscillations. It is unknown why lemming populations fluctuate with such great variance roughly EVERY FOUR YEARS, before plummeting to near extinction. In the case GOP lemmings, they are using this government shutdown ruse over Obamacare to fleece their easily duped repupucliconned fascist followers into giving to their fund-raising campaigns.</Msg><Username>republicanfascists</Username><Timestamp>1380584822199</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 19:47:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380585500521-187</Id><Title>So why pick on medical devices?</Title><Msg>Here's what the tax-and the bid to repeal it-is all about: House Republicans are just trying to stop Obamacare because it's just too expensive. The government's broke. How can we afford it? The only honest answer is: No one knows what the new health law will cost-or save the government. Much depends on how consumers, hospitals, health care providers, insurers and others respond to the incentives and penalties included in the law. But the best guess from the Congressional Budget Office in a report requested by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, is that the law will save the government roughly $109 billion through 2022. In round numbers, the math goes like this: Expanding coverage will cost about $1.7 trillion over 10 years-including subsidies for low income households, expanded Medicare coverage and tax credit for employers. That will be offset by $506 billion in penalties from companies and individuals who don't sign up, along with other savings over same decade. The law will also save the government some $711 billion in overall health care spending, mostly savings on Medicare. And a list of other taxes, fees and revenue raisers will bring in another $569 billion over 10 years, the CBO figures. One of those revenue raisers is the $29 billion in estimated taxes on medical devices-or about $2.9 billion a year. The 2.3 percent tax, which the government began collecting in January, covers devices like pacemakers and CT scanners. (Consumer devices like wheelchairs, eyeglasses or hearing aids aren't taxed; equipment sold outside the U.S. is also excluded.). So why pick on medical devices? Because if the health care law works as it's supposed to, sales of medical devices will get an added boost from the tens of millions of new patients covered by health insurance, all of whom will need care from providers and hospitals that will have to buy more devices. If the law generates more profit for the medical device industry, the thinking goes, it can to help pay for the law. The added revenue boost is expected to help the $130-billion-a-year industry grow by high single digits as the law kicks in, according to a report from research firm IHS. Among the six biggest companies in the Fortune 500, five had profit margins of roughly 15 percent or higher. So the White House figures that if the new law helps generate 15 cents in profits for every dollar spent on new devices, the industry can afford to spend 2.3 cents to help underwrite expanded coverage. That makes sense. So why is this such a big issue? Because the industry employs about 400,000 people-many of whom work and vote in Democratic congressional districts. Between them, the top five device makers are based in states with eight Senate Democrats, including Baxter International (BAX) (Illinois), Medtronic (MDT) (Minnesota), Stryker (SYK) (Michigan), Becton Dickenson (BDX) (New Jersey) and Boston Scientific (BSX) (Massachusetts). AdvaMed, the industry's largest trade group, has also argued that not all device makers generate Fortune 500-sized profits, and that the tax will hurt job creation, reduce investment in new medical devices and raise health care costs because some device makers will just pass along the tax cost. Just in case those arguments didn't work, device makers have spent more than $150 million since 2008 lobbying to overturn the tax.</Msg><Username>republicanfascists</Username><Timestamp>1380585500521</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 19:58:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380585978148-188</Id><Topic><Title>Why are Democrats Calling the TEA Party Names and Insulting Them.....</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1380577247525</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 17:40:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lower taxes for whom?

The 24-year-old has been the top sales associate for the last three years and works between 29 and 35 hours a week. But over the past few months, she said, she has watched as friends working in stores around her have their hours and benefits slashed – and she's worried that she will be next. Forever 21, the clothing store, told staff last month in a memo leaked to the press that it planned to cut hours and reclassify some full-time workers as part- time. The move, which the company denied had anything to do with President Barack Obama's health reforms, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), will nevertheless help it avoid a mandate under the legislation requiring companies with 50 or more employees to offer those working 30 hours a week or more health insurance. Earlier this month, Seaworld, which operates 11 entertainment parks across the US, capped hours for part time workers at 28, down from 32, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Other retailers, such as Trader Joe's and Home Depot have said they will no longer provide medical coverage for part-time employees, and will shift them instead to the public healthcare exchanges which open Tuesday, 1 October. Some employers have said their health costs will rise as a result of various provisions of the ACA, which takes full effect in 2015, when larger companies have to provide health benefits to full time workers or pay a $2,000 per-person fine. The trend has caused fears among low-paid workers living on the breadline that they will be hit twice – by having their hours and thus earnings cut and by having to pay more for healthcare. Based on what she said is happening in the stores around her, Samuels is concerned she too will have her hours cut and with it her eligibility for company healthcare under the ACA. "It's a really scary situation," said Samuels, who earns $9.25 an hour and is trying to reduce a student loan debt of close to $50,000. She currently receives subsidised healthcare through her university, but it runs out next year, when she had hoped her employer healthcare would kick in. Democrats couldn’t care less about you and your job. Their aim is socialized medicine and the people be damned.</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1380590522535</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 21:22:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380590742576-211</Id><Topic><Title>Obama on Raising the Debt Limit</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1380548470911</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 09:41:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right.....the rules are the house has to approve a budget.

A gamble that almost no one expects to end up going the republican way. The bet is that, to avoid a government shutdown, Democrats and President Obama would agree to gut funding for his signature domestic program, the nation’s healthcare law. Even Republicans in the Senate have acknowledged that is not going to happen. Two recent polls by the Pew Research organization, taken together, demonstrate what is really the driving force. A poll released Sept. 16, and conducted jointly with USA Today, found middling disapproval nationally for Obamacare. But even those who disapproved of it narrowly wanted their elected officials to make it work rather than make it fail — by, say, stripping its funding in the way the House bill would. But among Republicans and Republican-leaning Americans who ally themselves with the tea party movement, opposition to the healthcare program was nearly universal, with 94% opposing it. Most of them — 89% — said they disapproved very strongly, a figure of uncommon vehemence. Of the tea party-aligned healthcare opponents, about two-thirds wanted elected officials to force it to fail. (The numbers were less emphatic among non-tea party Republicans; Democrats remained forcefully supportive of Obamacare.) A poll released five days earlier showed some of the political repercussions of anything other than a scorched-earth approach to politics in the Capitol on issues like healthcare. The results illustrated that, even as the tea party-associated Republicans have become sort of outliers, they drive the party’s agenda because of their emphatic views on Obamacare and the idea of compromise. “The healthcare law, to tea party Republicans, is just the emblem of everything that concerns them about Barack Obama,” said Michael Dimock, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. “The issue almost can’t be separated from Obama. To dislike the bill is to dislike Obama, and vice versa.”</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1380592613582</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 21:56:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380593331828-220</Id><Title>FLASHBACK: Government has shut down 17 times since 1976...</Title><Msg>In seven days, the federal government runs out of money. While the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution Friday that keeps the government funded through Dec. 15, the measure also defunded President Obama's signature health care law — which means it has virtually no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate. If a budget resolution doesn't hit President Obama's desk before Oct. 1, that's a big problem: The government will be forced to close its doors. With that prospect looming, here are eight things you should know about the possible shutdown: It won't be the first time Since a new budgeting process was put into place in 1976, the U.S. government has shut down 17 times. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan each dealt with six shutdowns during their terms in office, lasting anywhere from one day to 2 1/2 weeks. The last actual shutdown came in 1996 — though the government came close during budget negotiations in 2011. The last shutdown lasted three weeks The three-week shutdown that lasted from Dec. 16, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, ranks as the longest in U.S. history. As a result, about 284,000 federal workers were furloughed, and around 475,000 essential employees went without a paycheck, although they were eventually reimbursed. They weren't the only ones inconvenienced. Some benefits for military veterans were delayed, and cleanup at more than 600 toxic waste sites was stopped. The government also shut down for six days in mid-November 1995, initially resulting in the furlough of 800,000 federal employees. The Congressional Research Service reported the shutdowns cost taxpayers a combined $1.4 billion. Only the "essentials" Only federal employees deemed "essential" would continue to come to work during a shutdown. Employees who qualify as essential include those involved in national security, protecting life and property and providing benefit payments. That means members of the military, border control agents, air traffic controllers, the FBI and the TSA are among those who would remain on duty. The president and members of Congress are also exempt from furlough and must decide which of their respective staff members to keep around during a shutdown. The checks are in the mail Even in the event of a shutdown, Social Security beneficiaries will still find their checks in their mailboxes and doctors and hospitals will receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. However, if the government does not resolve the budget situation by Nov. 1, those entitlement program payments could be delayed by up to two weeks. Even in a shutdown, the Postal Service delivers One reason Americans will get their entitlement checks: A government shutdown would not hit the operations of the U.S. Postal Service. Government agencies that the Treasury Department does not directly fund, like USPS, would be relatively unaffected in the short term by a shutdown . Some postal employees would very likely face furlough, but it wouldn't be enough to completely close down the agency. National parks and museums? Forget it Have plans to visit a national park or go sightseeing in the nation's capital? You might want to cancel them. During the Clinton-era shutdowns, 368 national parks closed, resulting in the loss of 7 million visitors. In Washington, D.C., the public would be unable to visit the monuments and museums that millions of tourists flock to every year. The Capitol building would remain open, though. Visa and passport delays Those hoping to enter or leave the country during a shutdown would most likely experience some difficulty. The government was unable to process around 200,000 pending passport applications and a daily average of 30,000 visa and passport applications by foreigners during the 1995-96 shutdowns. This would result not only in a headache for would-be travelers but a loss in millions for the airline and tourism industries. Who would be blamed for a shutdown? Generally speaking, no one comes out looking good if the government shuts down. A conducted Sept. 19-22 shows 39 percent of Americans would blame Republicans if a shutdown were to occur, compared with 36 percent who would fault the Obama administration and 17 percent who would hold both sides responsible. According to a Pew poll from a comparable period during the 2011 budget battle, the public spread the blame around nearly identically.</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1380593331828</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 22:08:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380593482451-221</Id><Topic><Title>Carter had six shutdowns with a Dem congress</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1380589247229</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-09-30 21:00:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here's my source showing me to be accurate.
