BA? That is your opinion then? hum let’s see for the week BA is down from Monday to Friday it lost 2.21%, for the year to date BA is down 2.82%, so on a long term horizon for Boeing this military cutback has been a warning for months not just this week then right so that is not a significant input for this week, for a long term hold stock apple is for that last week , a five day change is a gain of 1.59% and a year to date gain of 70.69%. Now for a real day trade stock I go with banks as they are the main benefactor of the QE4, like insurance on your trade, so for the week Bank of America (BAC) is up 8.52% and for the year to date BAC is up 71.76% so apple pays a better dividend than Boeing too , end of the comparison! So if a Boeing employee is in Boeing even for the matching fund the first thing a Boeing employee should do is rotate out of the share value fund once he or she gets the 50% matching or discounted BA stock and move it to the Boeing retirement fund that has actually made money year to date. Once you have your matching then go with the retirement fund that is making more than a loss of 2.82% year to date like BA stock has done for the outside shareholders. And maramwp, you really think Boeing , it is a good stock? did you understand that over 6 years ago BA was a stock valued at 65 dollars in the six years it never went above the very low 80 range price in dollars and stayed there for only a few days and never approached that above 80 price range in the last 6 years ? you really need to do your research on Boeing stock movement and pricing pattern. Boeing stock price has stayed between mainly 65 and 75 most of the time at day trade at 70 to 72, to use you two dollar example, that is less than 3%, and as I pointed out to you , the stock is down for the year, It is down for the week, compare to a long term buy and hold stock like apple, it was a 35 dollar stock when the top Boeing employee took his job, and now it is a 691 dollar stock that is one thousand seven hundred ninety one percent gain not a lost in those 6 years like Boeing and even for the week apple and apple has not done bad if you want to day trade it as far as going in and out and it makes twice the amount Boeing does as a day trade. but most of you Boeing pumps like to talk about long term so at 1 year,2 years 3 years and all the way to 15 years apple has beat Boeing by a wide margin never lost a year in fifteen years So your point is this, Boeing is stuck in a narrow trade range and we agree and it makes nothing for the risk it is a terrible stock to own. If you want to day trade you have to pick stocks that are currently moving, example now try Bank of America symbol is BAC it is up over 71% for the year to date, but to use your claim of day or week trading BA , here is what I did, for the last two Thursdays I purchased BAC and sold the next day making 8% and this last Thursday I did the same thing between the Thursday and shortly after the open on Friday that is 16% in two week Boeing has not made 16% from an average middle price of 70 dollars to a top price of 80 dollars for many yeas, maramwp, did you understand, that is only 14% for years from an average price to the all time hihg over the past 6 years for Boeing ,not a very good return if you could time it , if you got in at a average price and out at a high price , not like a great day trade stock like BAC in two trades in two week time period for BAC, so NO Boeing is a bad stock because there is way too much cost to develop the 747-8 and the 787 way above the projected original costs and that is due to poor top line management decisions on outsourcing</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347769439088</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 00:23:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347778431049-2</Id><Topic><Title>Traders of this stock...</Title><Username>foursquaresdiamond</Username><Timestamp>1346977915842</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 20:31:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hi, Dell, We still don't believe your #$%$ So, Bye, Bye!</Msg><Username>custerisus</Username><Timestamp>1347778431049</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 02:53:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347792934652-3</Id><Topic><Title>This board is better without the</Title><Username>floydian_slips_11</Username><Timestamp>1347705691300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 06:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>However, he does provide the "lunatic fringe perspective" on current events and topical matters, which is very entertaining to say the least.</Msg><Username>alangonquin11</Username><Timestamp>1347792934652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 06:55:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347814694206-4</Id><Title>GE engines</Title><Msg>On Saturday, the NYC787 blog provided information on the GE engine failure (now we know it has been failures, not just one). While most of the engines have been inspected, the info revealed that the problem requires frequent inspection to detect the cracks before they become a problem. And there does not seem to be an answer to why the cracks are happening. One article I read said that GE is changing the coating on the shaft and hinting that the problem was the previous coating. But that arguement does not appear to hold up. The cracks have shown up on both 747 GE engines (-2) and 787 GE engines (-1). And they appear in the same place on the shafts. Since engines are chosen by the customer and not Boeing, they can elect to switch to the Rolls Royce Trent engine but ths can throw a wrench into the delivery schedule. In any case, this is a huge problem for GE and BA should seek damages from them for any loss of revenue. But more importantly, GE needs to reveal the actual problem (ie shaft design, type of metal used in the shaft, etc) and what they will do to fix the problem.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1347814694206</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:58:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347814982191-5</Id><Topic><Title>Clintons speech actually hurt Obama</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1347742799253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:59:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're absolutely right!

Unlike stress fractures, which grow gradually over time, the crack detected in the GEnx engine occurred much more quickly in the steel shaft’s microscopic crystals, Wildey said. It began where threads were cut into the shaft, making it weaker than the rest of the part, he said. The GEnx is the only option on the 747-8, the latest variant of Boeing’s iconic hump-backed jumbo jet. McNerney joined General Electric in 1982. There, he held top executive positions including president and CEO of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Lighting; president of GE Asia-Pacific; president and CEO of GE Electrical Distribution and Control; executive vice president of GE Capital, one of the world's largest financial service companies; and president of GE Information Services. McNerney competed with Bob Nardelli and Jeff Immelt to succeed the retiring Jack Welch as chairman and CEO of General Electric. When Immelt won the three-way succession race, McNerney left GE (as was Welch's plan); McNerney was hired vy Boeing in On June 30, 2005. So the top Boeing employee has failed at both GE engines and at Boeing this is why the stock price since the top employee of Boeing was 65 dollars when he hired in and only $71.28 some 7 years later and has only once gone above 80 dollars for the briefest of times . On June 30 , 2005 Apple stock was priced at $36.81 Friday is was 691 that is a gain of 1777% or 100k then is 1,777,000 Friday. Boeing then to now is less than 10% for 7 years that is actually only 9.6%. for the week Boeing is down 2.21% and year to date Boeing is down 2.82% Apple is up 1.59% for the week after a big run up the previous weeks on the new phone coming out on time and on budget. And for the year apple is up 70.69% in each year apple for the last 15 years has beat Boeing each and every year by a huge margin. Any shareholder should know that the top employee gave himself a 30% compensation raise and made 18 million dollars while your share value has done nothing for 7 years.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347846283489</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 21:44:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347847379685-28</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing shareholders " there is some kind of serious problem with the GenX engine on the 787&amp; 747-8</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347846283489</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 21:44:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>24/7 just bashing Boeing.</Msg><Username>zosimomaximo</Username><Timestamp>1347847379685</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 22:02:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347848534991-29</Id><Title>Don't you notice?</Title><Msg>O can't do the job!</Msg><Username>sheepshearer48</Username><Timestamp>1347848534991</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 22:22:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347851388728-30</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing shareholders " there is some kind of serious problem with the GenX engine on the 787&amp; 747-8</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347846283489</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 21:44:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ezosimomaximo, you said more” bashing”, yet the Yahoo message boards exist for an easy-to-use interface that helps you find the information that matters to shareholders. The information on the GE engine failure is well documented and the FAA and the NSTB is the latest news, they just made a ruling that is news that has the potential to negatively affect the Boeing stock price in a bad way depending upon how Boeing handles the problem as well as for GE stock price. . This engine failure is very significant and unusual, it can delay deliveries and cost the shareholder money , if the customer has to do a inspection then the vendor and Boeing are liable for lost revenue, they pay the customer for failure to deliver a airplane that works as contracted, if the plane crashes then the whole airplane line can be grounded worldwide this is very significant if a worse case situation occurs That then further can affect ability to meet deliveries on the 747-8 and the 787 , that is very important to Boeing shareholders and is not a good deal for any shareholder, it is an additional risk to the shareholder. That is not bashing! Ezosimomaximo, that is a report from the Headlines on the side of the Boeing message board 6th headline down, easy to read , have you actually done any research on Boeing, if so why are you in a stock that is down 2.82 % for the year? Eh ! So ezosimomaximo, the facts about BA stock price in 7 years from 65 to 71 is a fact, not a bash, and compared to apple stock price 35 to 691 is not a bash it is a fact, or the excessive Boeing EEO pay for failure to move BA stock from 35 dollars to 691 like apple actually apple, when Steve jobs only took 1 dollar in pay and let the stock price increase like the shareholder increase determine his pay those are comparisons, facts not bashing. So ezosimomaximo the truth about Boeing failure to increase share price over 7 years and being late and over budget by 2 billion and 2 years on the 747-8 and 20-30 billion and 4 years late on the 787 is a fact and the stock price of Boeing shows the result, that is not bashing unless you consider any truthful reason not to own Boeing stock a bash, so do you think no matter what Boeing should be owned by shareholders who make 1777 percent less than if they were in apple for the past 7 years and who make less dividend in Boeing compared with the much better apple dividend, eh. Ezosumonmaximo why are you falsely claiming this is a basher comment in reporting the latest news on the FAA and NTSB ruling on the GE engines that power the 747 and the 787Why are you a basher of any user who tells the truth about Boeing stock price compared to a better stock eh! What is your agenda eh! Do you like the top employee of Boeing making a 30% pay raise and 18 million compared to the top employee of apple last year making a dollar and gaining huge money for the apple investors eh!</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347851388728</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 23:09:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347851695877-31</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing stock price goes down while the stock market goes up ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1347656942743</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:09:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The 2 #$%$ and 20 #$%$ over run is history; thats why stock is so low; going forward they will make money selling 747 and 787 - ton of money looking at backlog</Msg><Username>rajoilprasad</Username><Timestamp>1347851695877</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 23:14:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347853247203-32</Id><Topic><Title>Our incompetent in Chief vs the Military</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1347716462122</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:41:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well 1 of tose commies is in the white house</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1347853247203</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 23:40:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
