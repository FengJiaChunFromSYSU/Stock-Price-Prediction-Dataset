In fact, we may have more to fear from spies acting out of patriotic zeal than those acting out of power lust or economic interest: Zealots are more likely to eschew restraints that might compromise their righteous cause. For the sake of argument, we may assume that from President Obama on down, government officials sincerely believe that gathering Americans’ telephone and Internet data is vital to the people’s security. Does that make government spying okay? No, it doesn’t. “Government is not reason, it is not eloquence — it is force. Like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master; never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.” Although often attributed to George Washington, that famous quotation was probably was not uttered by him. Nevertheless, its value lies in what it says, not in who said it. At best, government represents a risk to the people it rules. Even under a tightly written constitution and popular vigilance — both of which are easier to imagine than to achieve — government officials will always have the incentive and opportunity to push the limits and loosen the constraints. But if their purpose is to protect us, why worry? It doesn’t take much imagination to answer to this question. A purported cure can be worse than the disease. Who would accept the placement of a surveillance camera in every home as a way of preventing crime? By the same token, gathering data on everyone without probable cause in order to locate possible terrorists should be abhorrent to people who prize their freedom and privacy. Since we’re assuming pure motives, we’ll ignore the specter of deliberate abuse. In our hypothetical case, no one would use the information in a way not intended to promote the general welfare.

The IRS scandal has demonstrated two things: one indisputable, one arguable: 1) That the government can be corrupt and abuse its power and authority to violate the Constitution and statutes of the United States to target folks for their political beliefs. 2) That individual government employees can, by direction or by blind loyalties based upon their own beliefs, seek to undermine individuals and their Constitutionally protected freedoms. Now, what do we have in place to protect the American people from the explicit or implicit direction from the White House to force, coerce, or cajole NSA employees to undermine the American public? The IRS has been corrupted by the Obama Administration. What is keeping them from doing the same to the NSA?

It is precisely the reason we have 3 branches of Federal government, none of them more powerful than the others. It is the responsibility of the Judicial and Congressional branches to rein in the Executive branch if it is misbehaving. The Judicial branch more than any other protects the rights of individuals. This controversy will probably end up being ruled upon by the Supreme court. The expectation of privacy must be protected. If the Federal government is to expect Top Secret clearances to be respected, and they should expect that, then we all should have certain expectations of privacy.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1372397102205</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 01:25:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372397646156-4</Id><Topic><Title>Shuper, re "leave no one behind"</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1372377272047</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 19:54:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simple - IF there was nothing to hide, nothing ' wrong" re security and availability of support to ben gh a zi, then there would be nothing to hide- and no reason to provide a false scenario. although words like ' stand down" or do nothing or ' mission is to protect elsewhere ( tripoli) can be parsed and argued ad nauseaum, the overriding issue IMO is that decision(s) were made or NOT made based on political rather than military or moral or humanitarian reasons.

You said, "If the Federal government is to expect Top Secret clearances to be respected, and they should expect that, then we all should have certain expectations of privacy." But that is not the arrangement made when a person signs the agreement to be briefed. There are no "quid pro quo" stipulations. Compliance or penalty is the prescription. Snowden violated his agreement, which he signed. He will be prosecuted - if Obama musters the cajones to get him (a prospect that is unlikely). I do not agree with what Snowden has done. And he has made the virtue of his intentions all the more questionable by his own statements and those for whom he is seeking comfort. He is a traitor - although the country does need to understand what Obama is up to.

A U.S. Army force in Mogadishu, consisting primarily of U.S. Army Rangers from Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment; C Squadron, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D), better known as "Delta Force"; as well as Air Force Combat Controllers and Pararescuemen and helicopters from 1st Battalion, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, attempted to seize two of Aidid's high-echelon lieutenants during a meeting in the city. Shortly after the assault began, Somali militia and armed civilian fighters managed to shoot down two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The subsequent rescue operation to secure and recover the crews of both helicopters drew the raid, intended to last no more than an hour, into an overnight standoff in the city. The battle resulted in 18 deaths, 80 wounded, and one helicopter pilot captured among the U.S. raid party and rescue forces. One Pakistani soldier and one Malaysian soldier were killed as part of the rescue forces. American sources estimate between 1,500 and 3,000 Somali casualties, including civilians; SNA forces claim only 315 casualties, with 812 wounded. Exactly what lesson did we teach "them" with this operation? Maybe WE learned something (not for the first time), which is that sending inadequate forces into Bengazi was reluctantly recognised as a futile gesture. They would have been way too little, way too late, and waaaaay too exposed. As to a coverup, why ascribe malicious motivations where simple human fallabilty is a completely adequate explanation? Many people believe what they believe because, evidence and reason be damned, that's what they WANT to believe and nothing will ever convince them otherwise.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1372398235830</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 01:43:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372399292540-7</Id><Title>With all the recent development, BA deserves multiple upgrade</Title><Msg>52week TP should be raised by at least $15.</Msg><Username>spwangsu</Username><Timestamp>1372399292540</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 02:01:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372399573366-8</Id><Topic><Title>Motives Aside, the NSA Should Not Spy on Us</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1372392088116</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 00:01:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This sort of thing is no less dangerous when the President is a Republican (George W and Richard M are two of the worst examples). Funny you didn't note this, probably due to your obsessive and irrational hatred of Obama. As to the IRS "scandal" the whole thing is rightwing BS, ginned up because all RWNJs so much WANT it to be true. The IRS was trying to do an impossible task; distinguish tax-exempt social welfare groups from taxable political groups, with 49% political activity allowed for the tax-exempt SW groups. Can you honestly say the IRS had any rational way of applying this standard to ~1.5 million tax-exempt organizations. Gee, maybe if they might have a reasonable chance of finding fraud if they looked for political buzzwords in the group's name. Turns out they did this without regard for left or right as has now been clearly shown FOR THE RECORD. The whole problem is allowing tax exempt status for groups that engage in ANY political activity, and I specifically would include ALL religious organizations that push political agendas.

Yeah, I thought so...." Probably no more or less than yourself. But you might be reminded of two important things (in case you have already forgotten): 1) The IRS has apologized publicly for doing this "targeting" against Conservative groups and 2) An IRS official has pleaded the 5th relative to this scandal. Based upon the truth, it doesn't sound too much like a RWNJ conspiracy, now does it? My dislike for Obama is not irrational - though you may think so - it is based upon what Obama has been doing (or not doing) since he came to office. The only glimmer of hope is that he is a true "lame duck" and cannot do any more harm over the next three years. Let him go on as many $100 million vacations as he desires - the more he goes away, the better off is the nation.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1372401995212</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 02:46:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372410961569-10</Id><Topic><Title>Hoozedik and The evolution of Sex Organs</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1372353839083</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:23:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't rover just the wittiest?</Msg><Username>lucid_luke</Username><Timestamp>1372410961569</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 05:16:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372411175981-11</Id><Topic><Title>Shuper, re "leave no one behind"</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1372377272047</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 19:54:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You really don't have an understanding of the situation.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1372411175981</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 05:19:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372411265531-12</Id><Topic><Title>Shuper, re "leave no one behind"</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1372377272047</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 19:54:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Kent Raven using an alias to try and make a point and win an argument that he has lost.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1372411265531</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 05:21:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372411461453-13</Id><Topic><Title>Motives Aside, the NSA Should Not Spy on Us</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1372392088116</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 00:01:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another Kent Raven alias in a failed attempt to assist the Kent Raven with another argument that he has lost.

That's called thievery when individuals or NGOs do it.......but Democrats think they can make it honorable by making it legal. They once thought the same thing about slavery.

The heart of our problem can be seen as a tragedy of the commons. That’s a set of circumstances when something is commonly owned and individuals acting rationally in their own self-interest produce a set of results that’s inimical to everyone’s long-term interest. Let’s look at an example of the tragedy of the commons phenomenon and then apply it to our national problem. Imagine there are 100 cattlemen all having an equal right to graze their herds on 1,000 acres of commonly owned grassland. The rational self-interested response of each cattleman is to have the largest herd that he can afford. Each cattleman pursing similar self-interests will produce results not in any of the cattlemen’s long-term interest -- overgrazing, soil erosion and destruction of the land’s usefulness. Even if they all recognize the dangers, does it pay for any one cattleman to cut the size of his herd? The short answer is no because he would bear the cost of having a smaller herd while the other cattlemen gain at his expense. In the long term, they all lose because the land will be overgrazed and made useless. We can think of the federal budget as a commons to which each of our 535 congressmen and the president have access. Like the cattlemen, each congressman and the president want to get as much out of the federal budget as possible for their constituents. Political success depends upon “bringing home the bacon.” Spending is popular, but taxes to finance the spending are not. The tendency is for spending to rise and its financing to be concealed through borrowing and inflation. Does it pay for an individual congressman to say, “This spending is unconstitutional and ruining our nation, and I’ll have no part of it; I will refuse a $500 million federal grant to my congressional district”? The answer is no because he would gain little or nothing, plus the federal budget wouldn’t be reduced by $500 million. Other congressmen would benefit by having $500 million more for their districts. What about the constituents of a principled congressman? If their congressman refuses unconstitutional spending, it doesn’t mean that they pay lower federal income taxes. All that it means is constituents of some other congressmen get the money while the nation spirals toward financial ruin, and they wouldn’t be spared from that ruin because their congressman refused to participate in unconstitutional spending. What we’re witnessing in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and other parts of Europe is a direct result of their massive spending to accommodate the welfare state. A greater number of people are living off government welfare programs than are paying taxes. Government debt in Greece is 160 percent of gross domestic product. The other percentages of GDP are 120 in Italy, 104 in Ireland and 106 in Portugal. As a result of this debt and the improbability of their ever paying it, their credit ratings either have reached or are close to reaching junk bond status. Here’s the question for us: Is the U.S. moving in a direction toward or away from the troubled EU nations? It turns out that our national debt, which was 35 percent of GDP during the 1970s, is now 106 percent of GDP, a level not seen since World War II’s 122 percent. That debt, plus our more than $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities, has led Standard &amp; Poor's to downgrade our credit rating from AAA to AA+, and the agency is keeping the outlook at “negative” as a result of its having little confidence that Congress will take on the politically sensitive job of tackling the same type of entitlement that has turned Europe into a basket case. I am all too afraid that Benjamin Franklin correctly saw our nation’s destiny when he said, “When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.” Walter E.

The incredible quiz asked students to affirm that the earth is not billions of years old, that dinosaurs and people lived at the same time, and that fossils were caused by a global flood. The quiz ended by asking, "Next time someone says that the earth is billions or millions of years old, what can you say?" The correct answer: "Were you there?" In fact, the quiz was authentic and had been administered by a private Christian school in South Carolina. While the quiz is plainly contradicted by universally accepted scientific research, religious schools are well within their First Amendment rights to indoctrinate students in this manner. But a look back at the recently concluded school year provides a stark reminder that it's not only private schools promoting religious beliefs and bad science to students: Creationism abounds in public schools as well.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372433406680</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 11:30:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372433879505-53</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Black People Look at White People as Though they were All Once Slave Owners?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1372422908386</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 08:35:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You do know that many, and I do mean many, slave owners were Black.

The strategy was first adopted under future Republican President Richard Nixon and Republican Senator Barry Goldwater[6][7] in the late 1960s.[8] The strategy was successful in many regards. It contributed to the electoral realignment of Southern states to the Republican Party, but at the expense of losing more than 90 percent of black voters to the Democratic Party. As the twentieth century came to a close, the Republican Party began trying to appeal again to black voters, though with little success.[8] In 1980, Republican candidate Ronald Reagan's proclaiming "I believe in states' rights" at his first Southern campaign stop was cited as evidence that the Republican Party was building upon the Southern strategy again.[5][12] Reagan launched his campaign at the Neshoba County Fair[13] near Philadelphia, Mississippi, the county where the three civil rights workers were murdered during 1964's Freedom Summer.[14][15][16]</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372437661325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 12:41:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372437702437-81</Id><Topic><Title>Never Forget Democrats Fought a War to Keep Slavery Legal and......</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1372425175594</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 09:12:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As sparty would say, "It's true!

Well , no matter what happens, Airbus has took a page from the failure on the Boeing 787, Airbus has set aside 15% of their outstanding stock, to buyback their own shares should there be a problem. If your a experienced t stock investor you already know , most likely; since Airbus cherry picked the best Boeing 787 suppliers, after they were proven to work and learned from the 787 failure that the A350 will be delivered on time and will work the first time. But , should there be any problems like, then just like the Boeing stock buyback and manipulated Boeing stock price during the 787 grounding for 4 months, Airbus will be ready if needed, to deploy the stock market manipulation of buying back 15% of their stock.. Attention, stock investors this is your guarantee on Airbus stock price , In other words you cant loose with Airbus any more than Boeing the only difference is Airbus learned from the 787 failure and you would already be up or padded 114% above Boeing over the last 2.5 years going into the first six month of this year which is a tie on stock price gain.

During ww2, when england was being bombed by the germans, the brits using ' colossus' ( computer ) had broken the egnima code system used by germany- ( and also japan ) . Churchil KNEW that Coventry was to be a major target in a few days. That civilians were sure to be killed, etc. The argubaly political/moral choice was to hopefully quietly make arrangement to get people to get out ot the target areas and take shelter, etc. BUT the ' military' choice ( long range ) was to not take a chance that such knowledge MIGHT be exposed if such warning ever leaked out- thus closing off the ' tapping' of german battle-bombing orders. He said nothing, made no provisions for other than the standard air raid warnings when bombers appeared, etc. - which in hindsight was the 'right' military decision, but a ' wrong' political and moral decision. MY point is HE did make a decision. Eisenhowe had a similar problem with D-Day- but was fully prepared to stand up and say " oops- It was my decsion ' if it failed. To date - ObUma has displayed NO such character or responsibilty for any decision on any subject- military or civilian, He makes Tefon Bill Clinton look like 20 grit sandpaper..</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1372439149911</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 13:05:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372439191021-92</Id><Topic><Title>Christians lived with dinosaurs</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1372433406680</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 11:30:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was an anti-Christian hit piece that appeared on the ACLU website.

Thus, "Creationism" comes in different interpretations. If we start off with the premise that a Creator can create all things, He can also do it fast or slow (in relative terms). Several times the Bible asserts that "a day with the Lord is as a thousand years." That was a metaphor. Replace "thousand" with "billion". He is timeless; therefore He is not held to the same concept of time as we know it. Some Bible scholars point out that the creation of man was accomplished at a point in the 14 billion year existence of the universe that demonstrated the truth of the "heavens declare the glory of God" (Psalm 19:1). Wait a few billion more years to insert man and, with the slow down of the expansion of the universe, the truth of the "big bang" and the statements of Genesis 1 would be impossible to correlate. What must be true about Creation is that man was created in His image and did not, could not have evolved. Otherwise, the truth of Romans 5:12, "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned", would not have been true. Any "Christian" that believes that man evolved is simply uninformed and ignorant of the truths of what the Bible says about man and his sinful state. Christians that dogmatically hold to the notion of the earth only being 6000 years old are holding to the "six 24 hour day" interpretation of Genesis 1 and 2; the 6000 years having been estimated by the genealogy of the Old Testament; and that ignores the alternate interpretation of "eras" which is supported by the original Hebrew. The Lord knows how much information could be handled by the early believers when the Bible was being authored by Moses. Imagine how much would need to be written about the creation of the world and the universe had the Lord given equal time as was done for the description of the Tabernacle (several chapters).

As cosmic rays bombard the Earth's surface, some of those rays will strike the nucleus of a female's egg in the very first few seconds of pregnancy altering its development in a small way.

Writing for the court, Justice Clarence Thomas explained: “A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated.” In Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, No. 12-398, the Court ruled that manipulating a gene to create a synthetic version, however, makes it eligible for patent protection. The genes at the heart of the case were BRCA1 and BRCA2, which have been linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. The actress Angelina Jolie recently helped elevate the profile of BRCA1, a gene that she carried that was behind her decision to have a protective mastectomy. While Myriad did isolate a useful gene, the act of isolating it from "surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention," explained Justice Clarence Thomas. The decision marks a departure from the findings of the Federal Circuit, which ruled twice that DNA sequences are in fact patentable. Over the past three decades, U.S. patents have been granted to more than 4000 human genes. Before the ruling, the biotechnology industry predicted that a decision against Myriad would put in jeopardy billions of dollars in investment. Still, the company's president and CEO Peter Meldrum remains optimistic. In a statement, he explains that the company believes "the Court appropriately upheld our claims on cDNA, and underscored the patent eligibility of our method claims, ensuring strong intellectual property protection for our BRACAnalysis test moving forward." Conversely, ACLU proclaimed in a statement: "VICTORY! Supreme Court Decides: Our Genes Belong to Us, Not Companies." The ACLU claimed that arrangement was a hurdle making difficult the investigation of human genes.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1372451283773</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:28:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372451304271-124</Id><Topic><Title>How does Evolution explain Gayness?</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1372440974476</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 13:36:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I suggest you have a few more drinks and come back and post when you have something that makes sense to say.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1372451304271</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:28:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372451792091-125</Id><Topic><Title>How does Evolution explain Gayness?</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1372440974476</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 13:36:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why should I behave differently than you, doof?</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1372451792091</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:36:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372451910879-126</Id><Topic><Title>The Tragedy of the Commons and Our Nation’s Future</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1372433208547</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 11:26:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Case in point: Congress approved that Tank project in Lima, OH even though the Pentagon didn't even want it.

The conservative activist lashed out at Latinos during an appearance on the Clay and Marty Show last week, saying Hispanics don’t understand core principles of U.S. government philosophy and have too many kids out of wedlock. She recommended that the GOP abandon efforts to win the Latino vote, saying it is a waste of time because of fundamental ideological differences. “I don’t they have Republican inclinations at all,” Schlafly said. “They’re running an illegitimacy rate that’s just about the same as blacks are.” Schlafly then offered this analysis of Latin American politics: The plain fact is, they [Hispanics] come from a country where they have no experience with limited government and the types of rights we have in the bill of rights. They don’t understand that at all, you can’t even talk to them about what the Republican principle is. The United States helped topple several Latin American democracies and financed military dictatorships throughout the region during the Cold War. It’s not the first time the Eagle Forum founder has used airtime to bash Latinos. “The people that Republicans ought to reach out to are white voters,” Schlafly said lat month during an appearance on conservative radio show Focus Today, in which she said “there is not any evidence at all that these Hispanics coming in from Mexico will vote Republican.” Former President George W. Bush -- who speaks some Spanish, supports immigration reform and does not rant against Hispanics during interviews with the media -- won 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004. Many in the Republican Party have tried to reach out to the Latino community, particularly by taking a softer line on the immigration issue, after GOP contender Mitt Romney’s poor performance against President Barack Obama in November’s election. Romney fielded only 27 percent of the growing Latino vote, compared to Obama’s 71 percent -- the worst performance since Bob Dole’s failed run against Bill Clinton in 1996. But other figures within the conservative movement like Schlafly continue to publicly bash Hispanics, undermining the GOP’s efforts.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372457668011</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 18:14:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>15</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372457756972-144</Id><Topic><Title>What if Gayness is Just a Choice?</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1372455242625</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 17:34:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What if believing in the tea party ideals was just a choice, instead of being a mental disorder, which it is.</Msg><Username>oldbuck56</Username><Timestamp>1372457756972</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 18:15:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372459413700-145</Id><Topic><Title>What if Gayness is Just a Choice?</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1372455242625</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 17:34:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'd guess it's because they like #$%$ fools like you off.</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1372459413700</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 18:43:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372461234309-146</Id><Topic><Title>Phyllis Schlafly is doing her part to keep the Republican Party white</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372457668011</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 18:14:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apparently, Schlafly has not yet reached her age of enlightenment.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1372461234309</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 19:13:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372461624229-147</Id><Title>I'm glad to ssee</Title><Msg>the new effort to elevate the level of discourse here.

Chris Christie (R) after Christie's appointee to the U.S. Senate voted for the immigration bill. Coulter tweeted Thursday that Christie is "dead to me" after Sen. Jeff Chiesa (R-N.J.) voted in favor of the comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate, the Star-Ledger reported. The comment about Christie was part of a series of tweets by Coulter attacking Republicans who voted in favor of the bill, which received bipartisan support. Christie appointed Chiesa to the Senate earlier this month following the death of Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D). Chiesa is scheduled to serve until a Oct. 16 special election to fill the remaining 15 months of Lautenberg's term. Right after attacking Christie, Coulter listed Republican senators who she wanted to see targeted in Republican primaries when they run for reelection because they voted for the bill. Among those listed were Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.). Coulter received support on Twitter for her attack on Christie; one tweet from an account belonging to @RedKnightNJ attacked Christie for naming Chiesa to the Senate without checking on the immigration bill first. When he was named to the Senate, Chiesa largely deflected questions on immigration policy, talking briefly about border security and saying he needed to study the issues. Christie said at the time that he expected Chiesa to act on his own and not seek advice from him on Senate votes. Christie reiterated earlier this week that Chiesa acts independently from him. Coulter, who backed Christie in the past, has been distancing herself from the New Jersey governor recently. Earlier this year, she told a weight joke at the Conservative Political Action Conference when discussing the decision by CPAC officials not to invite Christie to speak. Chiesa announced his support for the immigration bill on Thursday, saying that "it is the right thing to do." Chiesa has been a longtime member of Christie's inner circle, dating back to when the two worked at the same Cranford law firm in the 1990s. Chiesa served under Christie when the governor was New Jersey's U.S. attorney for seven years. Christie tapped Chiesa as his chief counsel in the governor's office and as New Jersey's attorney general before appointing him to the U.S. Senate. Christie's spokesman said the governor's office did not have a comment on Coulter's tweet.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372462682798</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 19:38:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372463832529-150</Id><Topic><Title>Fascist Occupier Issues New Decree</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372250001019</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:33:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A year to create jobs?? boy you phd economists and econometrics guys sure got it together being able to calculate just how long it takes to get jobs and hiring going!! boy wish I could do that- why I bet you know almost as much as the censored guy eh</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1372463832529</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 19:57:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372464039787-151</Id><Topic><Title>Fascist Occupier Issues New Decree</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1372250001019</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:33:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>right- those Swedes and Bohunks would never think about the fact that the wind doesnt blow all the time- thats just too much of an intellectual leap for them.

Trying to support your bias? BTW, cnn money can be off when looking at 3 year numbers. It only compares the week ending price when computing 3 year percentages. If it's a week that had a big movement than the resulting figures are not true 3 year numbers. More exact figures can be obtained from the yahoo finance page by just inputting the exact dates one wants to compare. It's very simple to type in "06/28/2013" as the beginning date and calculate an exact number.</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1372465821906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 20:30:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372471567368-158</Id><Topic><Title>What if Gayness is Just a Choice?</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1372455242625</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 17:34:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A truly idiotic question.

There is very small increase in sea ice when it melts and it is impossible for the sea ice melt in summers to cause water levels to rise to the upper reaches of the Himalayas. Even if Greenland melted which it didn't when temperatures were 14 degreesF higher than today, there would only be 20 feet of sea level rise. That doesn't even make it to the base of the Himalayas. lol</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372476333068</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 23:25:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
