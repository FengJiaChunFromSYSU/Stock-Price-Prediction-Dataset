The blackouts and other energy disruptions of Hurricane Sandy were just a foretaste, the report says. Every corner of the country’s energy infrastructure — oil wells, hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants — will be stressed in coming years by more intense storms, rising seas, higher temperatures and more frequent droughts. The effects are already being felt, the report says. Power plants are shutting down or reducing output because of a shortage of cooling water. Barges carrying coal and oil are being delayed by low water levels in major waterways. Floods and storm surges are inundating ports, refineries, pipelines and rail yards. Powerful windstorms and raging wildfires are felling transformers and transmission lines. “We don’t have a robust energy system, and the costs are significant,” said Jonathan Pershing, the deputy assistant secretary of energy for climate change policy and technology, who oversaw production of the report. “The cost today is measured in the billions. Over the coming decades, it will be in the trillions. You can’t just put your head in the sand anymore.” The study notes that 2012 was the hottest year on record in the contiguous United States, and last July was the hottest month in the United States since record keeping began in 1895. The high temperatures were accompanied by record-setting drought, which parched much of the Southwest and greatly reduced water available for cooling fossil fuel plants and producing hydroelectric power. A study found that roughly 60 percent of operating coal plants are in areas with potential water shortages driven by climate change.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1373535447600</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 05:37:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373535564119-16</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Change Will Cause More Energy Breakdowns, U.S. Warns</Title><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1373535447600</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 05:37:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>(cont'd) Rising heat in the West will drive a steep increase in demand for air conditioning, which has already forced blackouts and brownouts in some places. The Energy Department’s Argonne National Laboratory found that air conditioning demand in the West will require 34 gigawatts of new electricity generating capacity by 2050, equivalent to the construction of 100 power plants. The cost to consumers will exceed $40 billion, the lab said. Mr. Pershing, who joined the Department of Energy this year after serving for several years as the State Department’s deputy special envoy for climate change, said much of the climate disruption was already baked into the system from 150 years of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He said that the nation must continue efforts to reduce climate-altering emissions, but that the impact of those efforts would not be felt for years. In the meantime, Mr. Pershing said, cities, states and the federal government must take steps to adapt and improve their resiliency in the face of more wicked weather. President Obama referred to these vulnerabilities in his speech on climate change at Georgetown University on June 25. He said Hurricane Sandy, which devastated the Northeast in October, had provided a wake-up call, if one was needed after the run of climate-related disasters in recent years. “New York City is fortifying its 520 miles of coastline as an insurance policy against more frequent and costly storms,” Mr. Obama said. “And what we’ve learned from Hurricane Sandy and other disasters is that we’ve got to build smarter, more resilient infrastructure that can protect our homes and businesses, and withstand more powerful storms. That means stronger sea walls, natural barriers, hardened power grids, hardened water systems, hardened fuel supplies.” (cont'd)</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1373535564119</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 05:39:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373535613708-17</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Change Will Cause More Energy Breakdowns, U.S. Warns</Title><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1373535447600</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 05:37:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>(cont'd) After Sandy, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York commissioned a study of how to protect the city against storms. The report called for nearly $20 billion in investments to enhance resilience, roughly equivalent to the costs of responding to the hurricane. The study said that unless the city took precautions, the next storm of similar magnitude could cost the city $90 billion. The new Department of Energy report does not provide any firm estimates of expected costs and provides no specific recommendations for immediate action, much of which would be the responsibility of the companies that produce and transport all forms of energy. But the authors do suggest a series of steps to reduce vulnerability. Power plants and oil drillers should use less water and recycle what they use. Electricity providers should harden their transmission grids and build emergency backup systems. Operators of hydroelectric dams should improve turbine efficiency. And residential and commercial energy users should find ways to reduce demand.</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1373535613708</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 05:40:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373539622428-18</Id><Title>107 today</Title><Msg>As dell contemplates suicide.....</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1373539622428</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 06:47:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373541424835-19</Id><Topic><Title>Obamas "Insider Threat Program" resembles #$%$ Gestapo</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373516755574</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 00:25:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Creates a Stazi atmosphere.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373541424835</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 07:17:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373541554280-20</Id><Topic><Title>Conspiracy theorists: Dzhokhar was framed!</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373498464254</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 19:21:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hoozdik rarely offers anything to support his points.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373541554280</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 07:19:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373541715970-21</Id><Topic><Title>The eagles nest</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373426373795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:19:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ahhh...we are back to metaphor.

This included spending quite a bit of money, arranging meetings between the NAACP and local leaders, and providing police escorts for protesters. Someone needs to ask Obama why the federal government was doing this. A story that should have never made national headlines now threatens to unleash a firestorm of racial fury unlike anything we have seen since the Rodney King verdict. One young man, a neighborhood watch captain, shot and killed another young man. This kind of thing happens in American cities every single night. George Zimmerman says that he did it in self-defense. He should be allowed to have his day in court and that should be the end of the matter. But instead, this thing has been hyped into a massive national spectacle and it is being used to divide us along racial lines. And it appears that we have clear evidence that the Obama administration was involved in doing the hyping. The documents that Judicial Watch was able to obtain contain some absolutely startling information. Apparently the role of the Obama administration in these protests was quite substantial…</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373544768798</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 08:12:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373547446550-24</Id><Topic><Title>The Pot Calling the Kettle Black</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1373485901675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 15:51:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While you agree with me that Snowden is no traitor, I do not share your sentiment that the TSA is a kind of Gestapo.

At that time, Germany and the Allied nations committed to close collaboration in the collection, exchange and protection of intelligence in a supplementary agreement to the NATO Status of Forces Agreement. The agreement came about through secret negotiations and was strictly confidential. In 1968, the Western Allies returned responsibility for surveillance officially to Germany, but through an international, legally binding secret supplementary accord maintained the right to continue to conduct their own monitoring measures to protect their forces. At the same time, Article 10 of the German constitution was restricted so profoundly that “there is no longer a fundamental right to the inviolability of postal and telecommunications secrecy.” “It was the biggest bluff of 1968,” said Foschepoth. “The Status of Forces Agreement, Management Agreements and secret accords survived [German] reunification, and are in force to this day.” Chancellor Konrad Adenauer (Christian Democratic Union, CDU) and Willy Brandt (Social Democratic Party, SPD) accepted the special rights of the Western intelligence agencies because they aspired to German sovereignty. Likewise with Helmut Kohl (CDU), who did not want to endanger German reunification. Both the Schröder-Fischer (SPD-Green) and Merkel (CDU) governments have not touched the existing regulations. “They are all sitting in the same boat, because they benefit from US information.”</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1373557292041</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 11:41:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373557370971-54</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty Board Fascist, err Moderator</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373555074326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 11:04:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's YOU, bumper.

have taken precautionary steps for the possibility of mass protests or even civil unrest if George Zimmerman is acquitted in the killing of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin, particularly in African-American neighborhoods where passions run strongest over the case. For months, officials in Sanford and South Florida have been working with pastors, youth coaches, community activists and summer camp counselors to stress a non-violent approach if Zimmerman walks free. At the same time, police say they have quietly been making plans for dealing with any potential emotional flare-ups that could quickly turn into storefront-smashing, car-burning riots.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1373565646466</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 14:00:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373566056869-76</Id><Title>Texas Weighs Ban on Women</Title><Msg>AUSTIN (The Borowitz Report)—Republican lawmakers in the Texas State Senate are proposing a precedent-setting new bill that would make it illegal for women to live in the state. Senator Harland Dorrinson, one of the many pro-life lawmakers backing the woman ban, crafted his bill after witnessing Senator Wendy Davis’s filibuster an anti-abortion bill last month. “That was our moment to say, ‘Enough is enough,’ ” he said. “This comes down to a choice between life and women, and we choose life.” Senator Dorrinson said his bill would call for a twenty-foot woman-proof fence to be constructed along the borders of the state. “Women are great at talking, but not at climbing,” he observed. But another G.O.P. state senator, Cal Jamson, believes that the total ban on women goes “too far” and is proposing a less draconian bill that would allow some women to remain in the state as guest workers. “Texas needs women to cook, clean, and cheerlead,” he said. “If they show that they can do those things and stay out of politics, there could be a pathway to citizenship.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373566056869</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 14:07:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373566292926-77</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty Board Fascist, err Moderator</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373555074326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 11:04:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But you don't see!

Rand Paul is standing by his social media director and co-author Jack Hunter, the guy known as “Southern Avenger” who now dismisses his neo-Confederate past as a youthful indiscretion, even though he’s 39 and was still defending secession as recently as four years ago. In a fascinating and contentious interview with the Huffington Post’s Howard Fineman, Paul argues that Hunter has recanted his most noxious views and, anyway, the guy is “incredibly talented.” Asked about Hunter’s habit, as a disk jockey, of dressing up in a Confederate flag ski mask, Paul played the exasperated, fun-loving libertarian. “It was a shock radio job. He was doing wet T-shirt contests. But can a guy not have a youth and stuff? People try to say I smoked pot one time, and I wasn’t fit for office.” (Of course Paul was in college during his Aqua Buddha days; Hunter is 39.) But it was when Paul took on Hunter’s hateful writing about Abraham Lincoln, including the odious essay “John Wilkes Booth Was Right,” defending Lincoln’s assassination, that he gave us a picture of his troubling views of Lincoln, which display the toned-down influence of neo-Confederates. He starts off well enough. “I’m not a fan of secession,” Paul told Fineman. “I think the things he said about John Wilkes Booth are absolutely stupid. I think Lincoln was one of our greatest presidents.” But then Paul presents a view of Lincoln that’s actually only a few degrees removed from the neo-Confederate revisionist history of our 16thpresident as a tyrannical hypocrite who was also a racist. Here’s what he said: Do I think Lincoln was wrong is taking away the freedom of the press and the right of habeas corpus? Yeah. There were great people who were for emancipation. Lincoln came to his greatness. One Republican congressman described it as ‘on borrowed plumage.’ I love the description, because there were some great fighters [for emancipation] and Lincoln had to be pushed. But I’m not an enemy of Lincoln, like some who think he was an awful person.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373569481655</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:04:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373569689826-87</Id><Topic><Title>The eagles nest</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373426373795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:19:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I want everyone to know how insane you are, Loon" How right you are...</Msg><Username>pristine_calamity</Username><Timestamp>1373569689826</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:08:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373569789444-88</Id><Topic><Title>Rand Paul Mangles Lincoln</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373569481655</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:04:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK, fair enough. That’s trademark Rand Paul, who’s trying to cast himself as the reasonable middle between states’ rights secessionists and the totalitarian Obama state: so he’s “not an enemy of Lincoln.” But the phrase “borrowed plumage” got my attention. It turns out Paul had made similar but more expansive remarks about Lincoln at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in April. There he praised the book “Forced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln’s White Dream,” by Lerone Bennett Jr. Bennett happens to be the former executive editor of Ebony magazine, an African-American who became obsessed with proving that Lincoln was not the Great Emancipator but a white supremacist. Here’s what Paul told reporters that day: There’s a great book on Lincoln called “Forced into Glory” by Lerone Bennett. It’s a good book and there’s a great passage in there by a reconstruction Republican … who says that Lincoln shouldn’t be allowed to ride into glory on the borrowed plumage, from somebody else#$%$, from their glorious ride. I think there’s some truth to that … He wasn’t a god, he was a politician. He came into his glory because of some people who were greater than he was … the abolitionists who pushed him kicking and screaming toward emancipation. Now, let me say I think it’s great that Paul is now a fan of abolitionists. But there are a few problems with his story. It wasn’t a Republican congressman but Polish count Adam Gurowski who accused Lincoln of riding into glory on “borrowed plumage.” (The exact quote is “History will not allow one to wear borrowed plumage.”) Gurowski was an admirer of radical Republicans whose tough federal approach to Southern reconstruction the libertarian Paul cannot possibly endorse, so I would wager he doesn’t understand it.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373569789444</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:09:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373570038467-89</Id><Topic><Title>The eagles nest</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373426373795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:19:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" So has most of this board" Goes to show how messed up your perception is.</Msg><Username>pristine_calamity</Username><Timestamp>1373570038467</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:13:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373571783597-90</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty Board Fascist, err Moderator</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373555074326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 11:04:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Imagine that....... 10 million TX pussimales all coming out at the same time...</Msg><Username>monster_scrotum</Username><Timestamp>1373571783597</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:43:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373572359276-91</Id><Title>Can 107 hold ?</Title><Msg>Sure hope so....

I wonder if the NSA secretly spies on the Canadian Government as well.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1373578217697</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 17:30:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373578422829-102</Id><Topic><Title>Obama administration at least partially responsible for turning the George Zimmerman trial into racially charged spectacle</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373544768798</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 08:12:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I put all the fault on Obama for making this a national issue about race.

Dionne, Jr. WASHINGTON—If you want to alleviate worries about the economic impact of immigration reform, increase the minimum wage. If you want to reassure communities that bear the highest costs from large-scale immigration, revisit a proposal from 2006 by a senator named Hillary Clinton to help state and local governments cover some of the expense of providing health care and education to undocumented workers. What do these suggestions have in common? They address legitimate concerns while issuing a challenge to Republicans who believe they can block reform and still win future elections—as long as they expand their support among the white working class. The catch for the GOP is that it doesn’t seem eager to do anything concrete to earn the loyalty of such voters, many of whom stayed home in 2012 rather than vote for Mitt Romney. Battling for a higher minimum wage would test the Republicans’ newfound love for the salt of the earth. Are they willing to embrace an idea endorsed by seven in 10 Americans? Or do they retreat to Romney’s rhetoric privileging “job creators” over workers? Advertisement Raising the minimum wage would also respond to a claim being put forward by opponents of immigration reform. “The last thing low-skilled native and immigrant workers already here should have to deal with is wage-depressing competition from newly arriving workers,” wrote William Kristol and Rich Lowry in a joint editorial this week signaling an enhanced level of opposition on the right to the Senate immigration bill. It’s heartwarming to know that the editors of the Weekly Standard and National Review are now worried about depressed wages. In truth, granting immigrants who are here illegally basic labor rights would have a positive effect on wages for all workers. But if Kristol and Lowry are really worried about low-paid workers, let their next literary collaboration be an endorsement of a $9 or $10 hourly minimum wage. Clinton’s 2006 proposal likewise has the virtue of giving a substantive reply to questions regularly voiced by immigration foes. The fiscal benefits of immigration reform to the federal government have been documented by the Congressional Budget Office, which estimated it would reduce the deficit by nearly $850 billion over two decades. But states and localities face additional public costs for schools and health care when they need to provide services for many immigrants who arrived illegally. The result can be higher property and sales taxes that hit working-class Americans hardest. It makes sense for the federal government to share some of reform’s fiscal bounty with governments lower down the chain. Such assistance would be a better use of the $46 billion the Senate added to the bill to further militarize our southern border. The minimum wage and fiscal relief link to a larger imperative: With so many Republicans deciding that obstructing immigration reform is worth the political risks with Latino voters, this can no longer be seen a normal legislative fight. Indeed, given the inclinations of House Republicans, there are no “normal” legislative fights anymore. Kristol and Lowry gave the game away: “In any case, House Republicans should make sure not to allow a conference with the Senate bill.” In other words, down with the traditional ways of reaching compromise. Just say no, and no, and no again. President Obama should see nattering negative nabobism as an invitation: Immigration reform now has to be dealt with as part of a concerted effort to create an economy that grows because it’s more just—and is more just because it’s growing. Low- and middle-income workers took the biggest hit in the Great Recession, as a report released this week by the National Employment Law Project showed. Real median hourly wages fell overall by 2.8 percent between 2009 and 2012, but by 5 percent or more in half of the top 10 low-wage occupations. Immigration reform is easier to kill if it is disconnected from the concerns of such wage earners. It’s easier to pass if it is seen as a necessary step toward an inclusive economy where the rights of native-born workers are strengthened because the rights of immigrants are protected—and where the real wages of average workers are rising again. As for Republicans who want to stake their future on the working class, by all means let’s welcome a healthy competition. Let these voters ask the GOP: What will you do to raise our pay? And, by the way, new tax cuts for the rich are not an answer to the question.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373581742175</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 18:29:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373583355735-107</Id><Topic><Title>Zim Headed for the Pokey</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1373577912855</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 17:25:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dont quite get you comparing Zimmerman and Chicago "gun violence".

Leaking classified documents doesn’t always lead to prosecution, on the contrary, sometimes it leads to advancement of personal agendas: “Does the rule of law demand that leaks of highly classified information be prosecuted? If so, John Brennan and many other current and former national-security officials had better be given orange jumpsuits. They weren't even leaking to alert Americans to behavior that they found immoral. Often times, the U.S. national security establishment leaks to exploit a political advantage.” The reason that the United States government is so adamant about getting their hands on Snowden is because, as Chris Hedges pointed out in “Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt” while discussing popular uprisings when referencing Victor Sebestyen’s book “Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire” in which he was chronicling the events leading up to the collapse of East Germany, the dissolution of the Stasi, and the fall of the Berlin Wall: "This was the turning point, when the people knew that the regime lacked the will or the strength to maintain power." The U.S. government cannot allow Snowden to live happily ever after. If they do, then a precedent will be set and it will be their undoing. As Snowden pointed out in his July 1st statement, the U.S. government is after him for doing an unauthorized release of classified documents because: “In the end the Obama administration is not afraid of whistleblowers like me, Bradley Manning or Thomas Drake. We are stateless, imprisoned, or powerless. No, the Obama administration is afraid of you. It is afraid of an informed, angry public demanding the constitutional government it was promised — and it should be."</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373583904405</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 19:05:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373584113384-109</Id><Title>I am happy BA hit an record high ever, yes, but</Title><Msg>Do I think they deserve too no.

We have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income in this country since the 1920's. Right now, the wealthiest 400 Americans own more wealth than the entire bottom-half of the country, and the six heirs to the great Wal-Mart fortune own more wealth than the bottom 30 percent of Americans. The top 1 percent of Americans own 40 percent of the entire nation's wealth, while the bottom 60 percent owns less than 2 percent, and the bottom 40 percent of all Americans own just .3 percent of the nation's wealth. Since 1979, after-tax income for the top 1% of Americans is up 281%, while it's only up 16% and 25% for the bottom-fifth and middle-fifth of Americans respectively. And, according to the Economic Policy Institute, CEO pay spiked 725 percent between 1978 and 2011, while worker pay rose just 5.7 percent during the same time. It's clear that income inequality is a major problem in America, and that something needs to be done right now to fix it. That's where Koch comes in. The conservative mogul who is worth over $43 billion says that eliminating the minimum wage is a solution to America's poverty woes. On Wednesday, the Charles Koch Foundation launched a $200,000 media blitz in Wichita, Kansas, Koch's home state, saying that the minimum wage is THE major obstacle to economic growth in America. There is no credible information or data that backs up Koch's claims that the minimum wage impedes economic growth, and that doing away with it would solve any of our problems. In fact, the data says otherwise. In a letter released by the Chicago Federal Reserve, Economists Daniel Aaronson and Eric French show that raising the federal minimum wage by $1.75 to $9 an hour would increase household spending by around $48 billion the next year, and everybody knows that economies are driven by demand, also known as consumer spending. The fact is that doing away with the minimum wage will do absolutely nothing to reduce the extraordinary levels of poverty and income inequality in this country. So what will? First, contrary to what Republicans in Washington love to argue, we need to strengthen and expand social safety net programs, not do away with them. Americans who are living on the edge need some bootstraps to pull themselves up by. Programs like Medicaid and food stamps are essential because they provide those bootstraps and help them get back on their feet. Next, we must invest more into education, so young people can succeed when they enter the workplace. Right now, the United States ranks 17th in the world among developed countries when it comes to overall education, and 25th in math and science. That sucks. We also need to take on the loopholes that make our tax system favor the rich, and roll back the Reagan tax cuts. America's wealthiest citizens must pay their fair share, and do their part to support the American economy, rather than just living off the backs of the working class. We also need to take an axe to all the corporate loopholes in our tax code, put there by lobbyists and corporate shills in Congress. To make this work, this nation's trade policies have to change. No more so-called free trade deals like NAFTA, CAFTA, SHAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement. Giant transnational corporations should not have the right or the power to move our jobs overseas, and it's insane that our tax code is encouraging them to do that. Finally, any company whose business model depends on screwing their workers with pay that is so low that those workers qualify for food stamps and Medicaid should be put out of business. If we just set the minimum wage to what it was in 1968, $10.25 in today's dollars, we begin the process rebuilding our middle-class. Charles Koch inherited much of his money from his daddy, Fred. He's never known what it's like to run a household budget on the minimum wage. Taking wage policy advice from Charles Koch is like taking advice on how to run a neighborhood watch program from George Zimmerman. When it comes to the Koch brothers lecturing us about how the working poor should be paid, we all need to take Nancy Reagan's advice and "just say no."</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373584183022</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 19:09:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373584664810-111</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden: Hero, Knave or Fool?</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373392716386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>chycho(the-dot-that-MUST-not-be-named)commercial(the-word-that-MUST-not-be-abbreviated)</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373584664810</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 19:17:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373587722215-112</Id><Topic><Title>I am happy BA hit an record high ever, yes, but</Title><Username>geopolitical_macromania</Username><Timestamp>1373584113384</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 19:08:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I too am very uneasy about the health of this recovery.</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1373587722215</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 20:08:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373588692876-113</Id><Title>Quote of the Month at Bilderberg meeting by Henry Kissinger</Title><Msg>The following is an actual quote taken from a Tape Recording on what New World Order Icon, Henry Kissinger said at Bilderberg “"Today Americans would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful!

The activist captured the outrage and disbelief felt by thousands of others, both in Texas and beyond, in two minutes of blindingly honest speech. Moments after launching into her indictment of the Texas legislative process (“a farce”) and the political fates of lawmakers who use women’s bodies as collateral in a culture war (“women and their allies are coming for you”), Slamen was hauled off by Texas state troopers and escorted out of the Capitol, still shouting to make her voice heard. Salon caught up with Slamen to find out what came before and after her searing testimony, and what she thinks is in store for reproductive rights in her home state. You mention in the first few seconds of your speech that you had brought prepared remarks with you, but decided instead to speak off the cuff. What happened during the committee hearing to change your mind? I wasn’t prepared for the endless stream of people standing up to call women murderers and promiscuous, selfish killers. How is that in line with Senate decorum and appropriate testimony? I think it was around 6 o’clock [on Monday] that a woman stood up to talk about how her and her husband had spent most of their savings on in vitro fertilization treatments and that, after five or six tries, had finally gotten pregnant. But at 20 weeks, this couple found out that their baby had a rare form of spina bifida and would likely only have a 5 percent chance of survival. This woman recounted that, as soon as she learned she was pregnant, she had promised to love and protect her baby. And, in order to keep that promise, she had to have a medically necessary abortion. After painfully recounting how she had to terminate this wanted pregnancy, a woman sitting next to her said, “I know two people who have adopted children with spina bifida.” And not a word was said. Not one person on that committee of 20 had time to say, “Let’s not direct our comments to others providing testimony.” After that, I dropped the cognitive dissonance required to participate in the legislative process in Texas. I got on my iPhone and began researching each senator on the committee and began to jot facts down — reasons why they were wholly unfit to offer the bill, shame women or act as physicians. It was my intent, at that point, to give them a judgment. A job performance review. An honest roundup of what this panel had been and who they really were. As inspiring as the video is, it’s also quite traumatic to watch you being led out of the chamber that way. What happened next? I’ll never forget the feeling — that clear feeling of hands on me. That’s when I knew I had the cops on me. When they brought me outside the chamber, they started taking me to a dead end hallway in the Capitol, which is when I got worried. I’ve been in protests before and thought, “OK, I am about to get my activist beating right now.” Amazingly, at that point, three or four people rounded the corner with cameras and refused to leave my side. I told the troopers that I would not go anywhere with them, I said, “I will not be alone with you.” Though it seemed like they were intent on charging me, one trooper, to his credit, said, “We’re going to get her bag. She’s going to leave.” He went inside to grab my bag and escorted me out. When I walked outside, I was completely humbled to find hundreds of people waiting to walk beside me, cheering me on. Part of what was so catalyzing about your testimony was how you captured the anger many other people are feeling in response to the proliferation of these laws. But then I am also reminded of Rick Perry’s comments about “mob rule” in the Senate chamber, and how some people just don’t see room for this kind of focused outrage in the political process. What would you say to that? Women are socialized to be quiet. We are socialized not to be political and to keep our opinions to ourselves. We are socialized to ask for things — to wait for things. I and some other activists had even been talking that day about organizations insisting that demonstrators could not in any way be aggressive, that someone in an orange shirt [a symbol of being part of the reproductive rights contingent at the Capitol] doing something like that could ruin the whole thing. That’s ridiculous. It’s civil disobedience and it’s civil disobedience for a reason. Texas is a beautiful place. A diverse place. A place I’ll love for the rest of my life — but it’s an oppressive place. People, I think, with the ability and privilege to wait on the next election can say, “We’ll just keep quiet and wait.” But I think that we can’t wait. We have to stop them. [...] What’s it going to take? Women dying like they did before Roe vs. Wade? So the House voted on Wednesday to approve the measure and now it’s heading to the Senate, where it’s expected to pass. Like you said in your testimony, tens of thousands have been galvanized by this process. What do you think is in store for Texas — and what’s in store for other states pushing similar measures across the country? I have two shades of response: The fighter in me wants to say that we realize that there is no way to stop this other than doing what we did — mass civil disobedience. But the practiced organizer in me says it’ll pass. People will wait for the Texas Democratic Party and in the meantime, really tough stuff will happen. Because replacing [state Rep.] Jodie Laubenberg (R-Parker) and voting out [state Sen.] Glenn Hegar (R-Katy) is not going to change what’s wrong in Texas — and the country. So I think that without massive civil disobedience the law will pass, and have some of the worst effects we’ve seen since before Roe. What happens next? I know that you mentioned in your testimony that you’re moving to New York, but I feel like calls of “Sarah Slamen for governor!” are already materializing. Are you going to continue your activism up north? In New York, my next target is [New York City Police Commissioner] Ray Kelly. It’s this police state that keeps us quiet. Those troopers [that removed me from the chamber] swore to uphold the Constitution, and [state Sen.] Jane Nelson (R-Lewisville) can motion for them to take me away — even though I didn’t break the law — but they have guns and they get to tell me what to do. So in New York I think I want to focus on women’s prison reform, surveillance and police issues. Because [in New York], they’ll accept the Medicaid expansion, they’ve gotten rid of the death penalty. That means I can relax on some of those issues — and focus on other stuff that needs attending to.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373590591108</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 20:56:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373591421040-116</Id><Topic><Title>About time for a 2 for 1 stock split !</Title><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1373575792007</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 16:49:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stock splits are not in vogue they have proven to hurt in the long run so don't count on that happening!</Msg><Username>yourgonnalosebigbucks</Username><Timestamp>1373591421040</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 21:10:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373593494972-117</Id><Topic><Title>“It’s this police state that keeps us quiet”</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373590591108</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 20:56:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It'll even be more quiet on the day of judgment.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1373593494972</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 21:44:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373601359885-118</Id><Topic><Title>“It’s this police state that keeps us quiet”</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373590591108</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 20:56:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It will be very quiet on the Day of Judgement for many people that Hoozdik voted for</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373601359885</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 23:55:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
