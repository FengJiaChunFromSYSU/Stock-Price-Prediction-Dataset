For now, Congress has asked the FAA to write regulations on civil operation of small unmanned aircraft systems in the national airspace and submit them by 2015. “Once enabled, commercial UAS markets will develop. There are many potential ways for a company to generate revenue from UAS applications, whether from new markets or more efficient applications in established markets. Based upon the expected regulatory environment, FAA predicts roughly 10,000 active commercial UASs in five years,” states the FAA Aerospace Forecast for Fiscal Years 2012-2032. Phil Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at the Teal Group, which monitors the aerospace industry says when rules are written, law enforcement will be first in line, followed by civilian applications. According to an FAA document, which references the Teal Group, it is estimated $94 billion will be spent over the course of 10 years for Unmanned Aircraft Systems.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364299226237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 08:00:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364301160324-9</Id><Topic><Title>This board has fallen on hard times.</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364255702050</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 19:55:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thats because I havent posted much in the last week...leaderless and rudderless...without my scintellating and penetrating insights this board is foundering on a sea of Nihilism and socialism ...Dont you worry Raven...I'll be back</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364301160324</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 08:32:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364303201286-10</Id><Topic><Title>This board has fallen on hard times.</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364255702050</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 19:55:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From one radical leftist to the other.."come the revolution" Chrissy, and the hooz...two nuts in a pod.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1364303201286</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 09:06:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364304662846-11</Id><Topic><Title>This board has fallen on hard times.</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364255702050</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 19:55:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I knew I could count on you, loon.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364304662846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 09:31:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364304809263-12</Id><Topic><Title>Wounded Iraq Vet Prepares to Die, Saying He's 'Ready to Go'</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1364269244977</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 23:40:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jawohl, Obersturmbanfuhrer.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364304809263</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 09:33:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364305025637-13</Id><Topic><Title>Wounded Iraq Vet Prepares to Die, Saying He's 'Ready to Go'</Title><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1364269244977</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 23:40:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ahkmed, err sparty, gets off USING injury and death for his jihad</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1364305025637</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 09:37:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364305547034-14</Id><Topic><Title>This is our President?</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1364238212417</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 15:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How many "-ists" could you have tacked on that description if you had given it some real thought?</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364305547034</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 09:45:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364305646247-15</Id><Topic><Title>This is our President?</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1364238212417</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 15:03:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You call him that.

The Environmental Protection Agency has propped refineries raising the U.S. ethanol mandate to over 14 billion gallons, compared with 13.2 billion gallons in 2012. "There is a potential real stinker of an issue developing for US refiners on meeting obligations related to the US government's renewable fuels standard (RFS) that could materially impact earnings for many of the companies. The price of renewable fuel credits, known as Renewable Identification Number (RINs), has skyrocketed from under US$0.01/gal for ethanol in late 2012 to over US$1.00/gal this week, significantly increasing the cost of RFS compliance for the US refiners so far in 2013." Macquarie wrote in a recent note to investors. ___________________________________________ The EPA is doing real harm to the public as cellulose based Ethanol hits American consumers two ways with no benefit to air quality or CO2 mitigation. Ethanol subsidies are driving up refining costs which will increase price at the pump and it incentivizes farmers to use food as fuel which causes increases in all food pricing as corn is used as feed and filler too. While there is a slight reduction in CO2 emissions if you look at only emissions per gallon burned, it doesn't account for the increased CO2 emissions of land use change and the waste of fresh water needed for Ethanol crops. It also doesn't include the transportation emissions nor does it factor in the reduction in MPG that Ethanol causes. When all CO2 contributions for gas and ethanol are factored in there is no pollution or CO2 reduction advantage in using ethanol and there are only economic disadvantages.</Msg><Username>hooschtick_hertz</Username><Timestamp>1364314314001</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 12:11:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364315215262-33</Id><Topic><Title>This board has fallen on hard times.</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364255702050</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 19:55:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where oh where would we be without Spartakook?</Msg><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1364315215262</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 12:26:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364315351845-34</Id><Title>From Bloomberg</Title><Msg>A class action accusing Boeing Co.

However, seems like the have serious electrical fire problem with this plane even with the batteries working fine: Seattle Times November 9, 2010 A serious in-flight fire in the electrical-equipment bay of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight-test plane forced an emergency landing Tuesday in Laredo, Texas. All 30 to 40 people aboard were safely evacuated on slides. The fire affected the cockpit controls and the jet lost its primary flight displays and its auto-throttle, according to a person familiar with the incident. The pilot lost some use of the flight and engine controls, which on the Dreamliner are electrically activated, the source said. The smoke in the back of the cabin of Dreamliner No. 2, where a team of technicians sat at computer workstations monitoring the flight data, was first detected on approach to the Laredo airport after six hours of flying. Flames were seen in the rear electrical/electronics bay, which is underneath the passenger cabin, said two people who were informed of the details. "If this had happened at 25,000 feet, we might be talking about something much more serious," said a person close to the situation.</Msg><Username>sizemick09</Username><Timestamp>1364322437454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:27:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364323540655-43</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is the Devil</Title><Username>otto_pilot_blow_me</Username><Timestamp>1363811539445</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:32:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's take a wild guess here: Gregjanetomcheckn is a Fox News viewer.</Msg><Username>jumbojetskl</Username><Timestamp>1364323540655</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:45:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364323609515-44</Id><Title>Lawsuit</Title><Msg>lies, lies , lies, planes on fires.....Boeing Co. won a U.S. appeals court ruling affirming the dismissal of an investor lawsuit accusing company officials of making misleading public statements about the readiness of its 787 “Dreamliner” aircraft.</Msg><Username>bigbirdisaneagle</Username><Timestamp>1364323609515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:46:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364324001970-45</Id><Topic><Title>5 experimental 787 aircraft flew for 2 years no battery problems</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1363807695147</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 15:28:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you saying Boeing never changed a battery in 2 years of flight testing but all of a sudden once the aircraft is in service airlines were changing batteries like skivi shorts?? This issue didn't just materialize in 100,000 miles of commercial flight time. I'm betting big this has been a known issue at Boeing. I've worked on other flight test programs and there is a negative information filter. The FAA works for Boeing...not the other way around. I think the NTSB should pull the battery change records from the flight cert tests. I'm not getting on a 787 until the root cause is determined and resolved. The flight cert should have been pulled for this aircraft instead of an airworthiness directive being issued. The fat lady has not sung on this issue. Boeing puts a more robust unproven lithium battery that won't catch fire then encloses this battery in a fire proof box....that gives me all the confidence in the world.</Msg><Username>wearesoscrewed</Username><Timestamp>1364324001970</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:53:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364324241273-46</Id><Topic><Title>NTSB COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW.</Title><Username>meinfdia</Username><Timestamp>1364248086071</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 17:48:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lies, lies , lies, planes on fires, ticket to heaven, buy life insurance before boarding......787</Msg><Username>bigbirdisaneagle</Username><Timestamp>1364324241273</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:57:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364324685549-47</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is the Devil</Title><Username>otto_pilot_blow_me</Username><Timestamp>1363811539445</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:32:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hogwash.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1364324685549</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 15:04:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364325353006-48</Id><Topic><Title>5 experimental 787 aircraft flew for 2 years no battery problems</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1363807695147</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 15:28:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>United Airlines had to replace multiple batteries on its fleet of six Dreamliners. United has only been flying the Dreamliner since early November, so aviation safety experts say it's a red flag that more than one battery would already be having trouble. Japan's All Nippon Airways issued a statement: "We had 10 cases of battery replacement due to technical issues in 2012. None of the 10 cases were considered a safety issue with no reporting requirements to the government, and no flights were cancelled or delayed. This frequency is the same level as 777 or other types of aircraft in recent years, and we do not see this number outstandingly high." ANA said half the replaced batteries showed an unusually low charge, which could be important because when lithium ion batteries drain too low, recharging can create a fire risk.</Msg><Username>wearesoscrewed</Username><Timestamp>1364325353006</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 15:15:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364326975826-49</Id><Topic><Title>Ever Wondered Why Blacks and White Liberals hate......</Title><Username>hope4whitepeople</Username><Timestamp>1364250888804</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 18:34:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dr. Ben Carson was just interviewed on Fox.

Sell when there is irrational buying When the mass media is espousing the virtues of an investment, when people who know less than nothing about investing are dumping money in to the market, it is probably time to be a seller.

At this point, volume will often be much higher than normal and it will seem as though the stock can do nothing wrong.</Msg><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1364351658170</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 22:34:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364352586467-71</Id><Topic><Title>!Boeing Management is good at getting concessions and taxpayer breaks</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1356930845280</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 00:14:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing 787 faces new risk: limits on extended range:</Msg><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1364352586467</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 22:49:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364353295095-72</Id><Title>Sell</Title><Msg>New risk . limited range.</Msg><Username>meinfdia</Username><Timestamp>1364353295095</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 23:01:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364353630247-73</Id><Title>sell</Title><Msg>sell when there is irrational buying</Msg><Username>meinfdia</Username><Timestamp>1364353630247</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 23:07:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
