The low delivery rate from South Carolina has to be of some concern to Boeing as they have had high expectations that Charleston would be a significant revenue generator once they've started production. Again the Charleston facility is not to blame as 787s that were allocated to the Charleston facility were going to Air India, China Southern, and Hainan. Carriers that have had issue with taking 787s over the past year. It does seem that the log jam of deliveries to these carriers might be easing as they each have taken 1 787 in August but none from Charleston. We may have to add Qatar Airways to the list of carriers taking their time with deliveries from South Carolina. Reports are they've been very picky during the inspections of the aircraft which in turn has caused delays to deliveries. Qatar currently has one aircraft ready for customer test flight(s) and two in final assembly all at Charleston. The bottom line is that Boeing needs to make deliveries from Charleston and not just one or two in September but a significant number like 4 to 5.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1377961353362</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-31 11:02:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377963463592-10</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1377963197842</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-31 11:33:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All part of the liberal elite's war on Tebot.</Msg><Username>orly_taint</Username><Timestamp>1377963463592</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-31 11:37:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377966374536-11</Id><Title>Pelosi and pal Assad 4/4/07</Title><Msg>Back in 07 Assad was a good guy because he was an enemy of the evil Bush. Bush's statement rings so true. Cuts from NBC 4/4 07 article: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday for talks criticized by the White House as undermining American efforts to isolate the hard-line Arab country. Pelosi said Assad assured her of his willingness to engage in peace talks with Israel, and that she and other members of her congressional delegation raised their concern about militants crossing from Syria into Iraq, as well the Israeli soldiers kidnapped by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Palestinian group Hamas. “We were very pleased with the assurances we received from the president that he was ready to resume the peace process. He’s ready to engage in negotiations for peace with Israel,” Pelosi said. Bush voices criticism Bush has said Pelosi’s trip signals that the Assad government is part of the international mainstream when it is not. “A lot of people have gone to see President Assad ... and yet we haven’t seen action. He hasn’t responded,” he told reporters soon after she arrived in Damascus on Tuesday. “Sending delegations doesn’t work. It’s simply been counterproductive.”</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1377966374536</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-31 12:26:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377967621690-12</Id><Topic><Title>Putin is beotch slapping Obonzo who has become an international embarrassment</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1377965175115</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-31 12:06:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The key words in that post: "The USA elected" him.
