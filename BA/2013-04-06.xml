I earned an A in organic chemistry as well as calculus in college. I am a chemist by profession. It is chemistry alone that proves the holocaust is a scam. For example, persons who die from cyanide poisoning offer tell tales signs. Their skin turns a bright red as if severely sunburned. When so called survivors ( of the holocaust) were asked to describe the bodies of gassing victims they saw, they said the bodies were blue, green, black, or yellow. Never red. They were guessing because they never saw a gassing victim, as there were no gassing victims. You wonder why promoters are so fearful of debating a chemist, now you know why.</Msg><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1365221192698</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 00:06:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365231092292-2</Id><Title>Airbus return for 5 years is 114% Boeing return on investment for 5 years is 4% dead cat bounce red flag</Title><Msg>Airbus stock return for 5 years is 114%Boeing stock return for 5 years is a pathetic 4% Reg Flag alert for the Boeing Hack team that posts hate and worthless dog an pony information that has nothing to do with making a good return on your investment dollar.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365231092292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 02:51:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365231222111-3</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus challenges foulmoutharbor with first-quarter order boost</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365103022746</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 15:17:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Red flag alert the battery may get red and catch on fire the root cause like TMI has been contained, that is all be happy no worry smile drink the Boeing cool aide</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365231222111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 02:53:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365231323506-4</Id><Topic><Title>Red Flag alert Boeing is a laggard stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365194780135</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 16:46:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lets wait for the book by the Boeing Hacks, it will contain worthless information that has nothing to do with return on investment</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365231323506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 02:55:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365241450406-5</Id><Topic><Title>16 of the NRA’s frightening police-state “solutions” for our schools</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1365201566901</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 18:39:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound like a liberal #$%$........</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1365241450406</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 05:44:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365241620173-6</Id><Topic><Title>Barry Plans to Wheel Granny Off A Cliff</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1365193348790</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 16:22:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chrissy, Why do you hate anybody that doesn't share your lunatic fringe marxist dogma?

NPR reports: “Every month, 14 million Americans get a disability check from the government.” “In Hale County, Alabama, nearly 1 in 4 working-age adults is on disability.” As of December 2012, 47 million Americans were on food stamps. The USDA assesses the annual cost of the program at $71.8 billion. Separate from food stamps, and apparently not including other members of a household where at least one person is receiving government payments, we have 4.3 million Americans on welfare. Medicaid, the government medical-care program for the poor, lists 50.1 million people enrolled in 2011. If you include Americans who were on Medicaid for at least one month in that year, the number swells to 70.4 million. As a result of Obamacare, the US Dept. of Health and Human Services predicts 20 million new people will be added to Medicaid in 2019. Forbes Magazine states the annual cost of healthcare in the US is $2 trillion. And yet, concealed from the public, this money is used to wreak incredible destruction on the people. In 2001, a landmark article in the LA Times, written by Linda Marsa, reported that 100,000 Americans are killed by FDA-approved pharmaceutical drugs every year, and 2.1 million more people are hospitalized as a result of adverse reactions to the medical drugs. In all, there are 22 million significant adverse reactions each year in the US. The Times article was based, in part, on a July 26, 2000, review by Dr. Barbara Starfield, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association: “Is US health really the best in the world?”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365250940586</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 08:22:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365251182890-10</Id><Topic><Title>Its fact now Obama has been living in the Down Low.

We have gold,” Hoover said, “because we cannot trust government.” More recently, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, has advocated abolishing the Fed’s system of fiat currency (money that derives its value from government regulation) to return to dollars backed by gold. In 2009, WND quoted Paul as saying, “Throughout its nearly 100-year history, the Federal Reserve has presided over the near-complete destruction of the United States dollar.” He added, “Since 1913 the dollar has lost over 95 percent of its purchasing power, aided and abetted by the Federal Reserve’s loose monetary policy.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365252060949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 08:41:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365252529277-13</Id><Topic><Title>The Best and Brightest</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1365210710639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 21:11:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rebuplians just have to watch you socialists self destruct.

And that he did a remarkable job in slowing, stopping, and reversing the spiral. Individuals had to resort to every option they could during that terrible time of mass layoffs, firings and self employment disappearing. It is fortunate that in this country there are a lot of safety nets during times of crisis. We have unemployment insurance, disability insurance, social security, medicaid, medicare, many and various charities for social support. Despite that, many people who were previously self sufficient have had to rely on relatives for some or all support. Can you imagine what this country would have been like in 2009 or 2010 if this social structure had not been in place. Many of these programs are in place because of a huge economic crisis starting in 1929. Fortunately we learn from the past. It is no individual's fault that the economy crashed. It was a scenario that had been in the making for years. We all contributed to it.

According to a White House statement, the Obama administration believes the current rules allow some wealthy individuals “to accumulate many millions of dollars in these accounts, substantially more than is needed to fund reasonable levels of retirement saving.” “The budget would limit an individual’s total balance across tax-preferred accounts to an amount sufficient to finance an annuity of not more than $205,000 per year in retirement, or about $3 million in 2013,” the statement said. “This proposal would raise $9 billion over 10 years.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365265549923</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 12:25:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365266058545-32</Id><Topic><Title>More of greg's lying</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1365257470979</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 10:11:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ali, since you refer to him by the familiar Barry, you must be one of his past lovers.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1365266058545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 12:34:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365266651835-33</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Budget to Cap Retirement Accounts at $3 Million</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365265549923</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 12:25:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you suggesting the Founding Fathers would recognize the common sense vision of a person to have the freedom to save whatever they wanted in whatever account they wanted ?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365266651835</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 12:44:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365266706325-34</Id><Topic><Title>April Fool, Hooz</Title><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1364839726190</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:08:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The existence of web sites also is not facts.

Good job. Are you looking at MTG yet? They will be riding the wave of the housing market rebound. A settlement with the old Countrywide, is likely to result in a huge addition to the bottom line as reserves will be freed up. FNMA is set to raise fees twice this summer, and that will drive business to MTG. In addition, the Obama admin is making life easy for troubled borrowers to get back on the tracks, and get their mortgages out of the default territory. Everything looking good for MTG. Avoid RDN and GNW.

The unspoken message is that normal people such as us should never dare to question the official propaganda being put out by “official sources”. But what if those “official sources” are wrong? What if those “official sources” have a specific agenda that they are trying to promote? Has it become a crime to ask questions? Has it become a crime to think for ourselves? The other day, Public Policy Polling did an opinion poll about “conspiracy theories”. Just by reading the questions they asked, it is obvious that the goal was to make those that believe in those theories to look foolish. When they released the results of the poll, they stated that some of the “conspiracy theories” could only be found in “the darker corners of the internet” – as if there was something unsavory or evil about them. But is it really “crazy” to believe that sometimes bad people do bad things? A conspiracy is just “a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful”. So do conspiracies ever happen? Of course they happen. They have happened for as long as humanity has existed. But in this day and age, we are just supposed to assume that all of our politicians and all of the big corporations that dominate our society are just sweet and wonderful and would never want to do us any harm whatsoever.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365305450002</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 23:30:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365305586306-134</Id><Title>uh huh,uh huh ....I understand</Title><Msg>some otter talk... should the preisdent of the united states of america order the n. korean to be obliterted meouw meouw defintely listneing to 6/10/73 supposedly Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers you like</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1365305586306</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 23:33:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365306186097-135</Id><Topic><Title>uh huh,uh huh ....I understand</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1365305586306</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 23:33:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hard to do when you play golf 6 days a week.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1365306186097</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 23:43:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365306380965-136</Id><Topic><Title>87% believe the 1969 'manned' lunar wasn;t a hoax...</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1365283824918</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 17:30:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please sit down, first, before I break the bad news: "normal people such as us" You are not normal. Get professional help. Print a bunch of your posts and take them to the initial meeting with the therapist. Explain that you have been doing this for several years (at least). Beg for some form of volume discount. Make sure the therapist has several years before they retire. Then go. You can make something of your life.</Msg><Username>jumbojetskl</Username><Timestamp>1365306380965</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 23:46:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
