The lack of oversight of these potentially hazardous activities greatly concerns me, especially because of the scarcity of manpower to respond to emergencies, pollution issues or other rapid response needs. I am equally concerned about the many businesses that rely on our public lands. Concessionaires that operate facilities within our public parks and other federal lands have been locked out by the shutdown. So have river and trail guides who rely on public lands and waterways to make a living. Small businesses cannot afford to be cut off from their main—in some cases sole—source of income. This disparity greatly disturbs me, as does the ongoing environmental risk to sensitive outdoor areas. I urgently request the immediate cessation of mining, drilling and other extractive activities on our federal public lands until we end the shutdown and cease the lockout of federal employees and visitors. Disparities are not, of course, something that matters to the Republicans who have dumped the shutdown on us. Indeed, they seek to increase disparity everywhere they can.

"I have received reports from our agents in every single sector from San Diego to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas that they are receiving these orders." "They are not being relieved in place, they are simply being told that someone else is being dispatched, but none of us have seen that occur," he explained. "We are simply being ordered to stand down and stop tracking and trying to apprehend the criminals.” He discussed the importance of agents being relieved in place when tracking an individual or group. "Border Patrol senior leadership says the stand downs are a means of addressing budgetary shortfalls and making sure agents aren’t working longer shifts," Moran said. "The Border Patrol has a larger budget than ever, but the agents on the ground have not seen the benefits of an increased budget. The increased budget has not trickled down to the men and women with their boots on the ground."</Msg><Username>samspadesr</Username><Timestamp>1380889915850</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 08:31:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380890431664-27</Id><Topic><Title>What more proof do you need that the TP/GOP is crazy than this......</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380842981500</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-03 19:29:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>republicans have offered up legislation to fund all of it, with the exception of commiecare. i don't want commiecare...me and my doctor get along better without barack and his dumb party getting in our way. i don't wanna pay MORE for healthcare...my employer shoulders most of the costs, though my out of pocket expenses have already increased by a couple thousand with increased deductible (which makes it little more than a catastrophic plan).</Msg><Username>samspadesr</Username><Timestamp>1380890431664</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 08:40:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380890852391-28</Id><Topic><Title>Why Has Socialism and Communism Become so Attractive to Democrats?</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380826416338</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-03 14:53:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dont you get tired of pumping your abortion lie at us???

Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier confirms shots were fired in at least two locations during the chase. Authorities will want to know what was going through the minds of the officers who opened fire. Miller says once the car crashed into the barriers outside the White House, training instincts would kick in for officers and Secret Service agents. Because the White House and Capitol building are sensitive locations, their training and reactions would be heightened. They would have to assume it was a terror attack and consider the possibility that it might be a car bomb. Afterwards, police described what happened as an isolated event and said they saw no indications of terrorism.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1380893147269</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 09:25:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380893229254-35</Id><Topic><Title>Why Has Socialism and Communism Become so Attractive to Democrats?</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380826416338</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-03 14:53:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well there it is !

The Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) of the House sent guidance to members of Congress this week, based on a directive from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), that says they must choose plans from the "gold" level of insurance coverage, not "bronze" or "silver" plans. "Platinum" is the only higher level of coverage under the exchanges. "For plan year 2014, Members of Congress and designated congressional staff will choose from 112 options in the Gold Metal tier on the DC SHOP," CAO said in a fact sheet that was emailed to Congress. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) called attention to this requirement in a House floor speech Thursday, in which he said the policy shows more favoritism toward members of Congress and their staff. "We all … have to go and get the gold policy. Not the bronze, not the silver, the gold policy from the exchange. That's the only one we can get," he said. "You see, bronze and silver's only good enough for everyone else in the country. For members of Congress and members of the Senate and their staff, it's gold or nothing." The fact sheet also says that the only way for members of Congress to get subsidies for their insurance plan is by using the Washington, D.C., health insurance exchange, or SHOP. "All Members of Congress, including representatives of U.S. Territories, and their designated staff will be required to purchase health insurance via the DC SHOP in order to receive a Government contribution," it says. "The DC SHOP offers health plan options with in-network access to medical providers across the nation and overseas." Harris said allowing members to be subsidized for only buying gold-level coverage is probably why many members don't want to eliminate the subsidy for Congress, something Republicans have been pushing. "That's why this fight has been for a clean CR. No one wants to remove that exemption," he said.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1380900421400</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 11:27:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380900634020-62</Id><Topic><Title>I'm tired of this here Republiken guvmit shutdown</Title><Username>biggovmomma</Username><Timestamp>1380891825125</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 09:03:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, an oxymoron.

Only 8 percent feel “the people are in charge of the government.” That's a sad commentary on how powerful and out of control both Parties have worked to make the Federal government become.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1380901127774</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 11:38:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380901807025-69</Id><Title>Does it Really Matter Who Shut Down the Government as long as it stays Shutdown</Title><Msg>Give both parties credit......we are finally saving money and starting to live withing our means.

It's disgusting'...</Title><Msg>The games politicians play: Barack Obama is having a lot of fun using the government shutdown to squeeze the public in imaginative ways. The point of the shutdown game is to see who can squeeze hardest, make the most pious speech and listen for the applause. It’s a variation on the grade-school ritual of “you show me yours, and I’ll show you mine.” President Obama is not a bad poker player, but the man with all the chips always starts with the advantage (and he gets all the aces). He has closed Washington down as tight as he dares, emphasizing the trivial and the petty in making life as inconvenient as he can for the greatest number. It’s all in a noble cause, of course. Access to most of the memorials is limited, and often in curious ways. The Lincoln Memorial is easy to reach, with the streets around it remaining open. But the Martin Luther King Memorial is made difficult to reach, relegating it, you might say, to the back of the bus. Not very nice. The Park Service appears to be closing streets on mere whim and caprice. The rangers even closed the parking lot at Mount Vernon, where the plantation home of George Washington is a favorite tourist destination. That was after they barred the new World War II Memorial on the Mall to veterans of World War II. But the government does not own Mount Vernon; it is privately owned by the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association. The ladies bought it years ago to preserve it as a national memorial. The feds closed access to the parking lots this week, even though the lots are jointly owned with the Mount Vernon ladies. The rangers are from the government, and they’re only here to help. “It’s a cheap way to deal with the situation,” an angry Park Service ranger in Washington says of the harassment. “We’ve been told to make life as difficult for people as we can. It’s disgusting.”</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1380904685830</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 12:38:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380905328415-78</Id><Topic><Title>What more proof do you need that the TP/GOP is crazy than this......</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380842981500</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-03 19:29:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And the Teahadist Party's approval ratings are hovering at about 10%.

But after doing a little research, Matthews eventually realized how much the law could help him. And on Tuesday, his local Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) provider confirmed that he would be able to buy a far better plan than his current policy while saving at least $13,000 per year through Arkansas’ Obamacare marketplace. Matthews was self-employed between 1997 and 2010, meaning he had to purchase his own plan on the individual market. He chose a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan for himself and his wife that charged a $250 per month premium and had a $2,000 deductible. But the price of that policy kept rising even as it covered fewer of his costs, eventually devolving into his current rate of $1,069 per month with a $10,000 deductible. At this point, it doesn’t even cover his medication or doctors’ visits — particularly concerning considering he had to have two stents placed in his heart in 2006. “I am unable to now, I’m 61, and we do have assets saved up. But still, to come up with that $1,069 per month….” he said, trailing off. “I went to Blue Cross Blue Shield, and they don’t even sell that plan anymore, but I could not change it to anything else. So I was locked in with it.” That all changed once Obamacare’s state-level marketplaces opened to the public on Tuesday. Matthews knew that, at his income level, the law would help him pay for insurance. But even he might not have expected just how good of a deal he could get: his new coverage will cost him absolutely nothing in monthly premiums after factoring in federal subsidies, and has a deductible of $750. “Which is a lot different from $10,000,” he pointed out, laughing. The mmid-level “Silver” policy that he picked out also offers a significantly better benefits package. “It’s a lot better plan,” Matthews said. His old plan was considered to be “Bronze” and had much higher co-pays. Under Obamacare, when Matthews visits a doctor, it will no longer cost him around $150. It will cost $8.So what would Matthews tell other Americans who are skeptical about Obamacare? “I would tell them to learn more about it before they start talking bad about it,” he noted. “Be more informed, get more information, take your time and study and not just go by just what you hear on one side or the other. Actually check the facts on it.” “I still am a very strong Republican, but this… I’m so happy that this came along,” he continued. “Our home is paid for, vehicle’s paid for, this is our expense that we have. We have more expense on medical care than everything else put together, so this is going to be a great help for us.”</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1380911673753</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 14:34:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380911731045-91</Id><Topic><Title>congress healthcare subsidy</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1380900775369</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 11:32:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you haven't said squat - is that a proposal or the law ?</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1380911731045</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 14:35:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380912244858-92</Id><Topic><Title>congress healthcare subsidy</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1380900775369</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 11:32:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's because it a subsidy and not an exmption from Obamacare as the repugs have been calling it for such a long time.

This final rule amends FEHB Program regulations to comply with Section 1312 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Public Law 111-152 (the Affordable Care Act or the Act). The final rule includes the following modifications from OPM’s proposed rule (RIN3206-AM85): · OPM has clarified that Members of Congress and designated congressional staff must enroll in an appropriate Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) as determined by the Director in order to receive a Government contribution. · References to annuitants purchasing coverage on the Exchange have been deleted. · OPM has provided a one month extension for staff designations for the 2014 plan year. · Additional non-substantive edits have been made to improve clarity.... goes on During the comment period for the proposed rule, OPM received nearly 60,000 comments from the public. Responses to those comments are summarized below. For a more complete discussion of these and other topics, please refer to the final rule.

Nothing in the final rule or the law prevents a Member of Congress or designated congressional staff from declining a Government contribution for him or herself by choosing a different option for their health insurance coverage. Because a Government contribution is, in essence, an employer contribution, the final rule clarifies that Members of Congress and designated congressional staff must enroll in an appropriate SHOP as determined by the Director in order to receive a Government contribution. Given the location of Congress in the District of Columbia, OPM has determined that the DC SHOP, known as the known as the DC Health Link Small Business Market administered by the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority, is the appropriate SHOP from which Members of Congress and designated congressional staff will purchase health insurance in order to receive a Government contribution . . . more but if you dispute it- first read it !!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1380912352432</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 14:45:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380912622664-95</Id><Topic><Title>A Republican Who Came To Love Obamacare After Realizing It Will Save Him $13,000</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1380911673753</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 14:34:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post.

Unlike the health plans for which OPM contracts pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8902, 8903 and 8903a, OPM does not administer the terms of the health benefits plans offered on an Exchange. Consequently, while plans with such coverage may be offered on an Exchange, OPM can and will take appropriate administrative steps to ensure that the cost of any such coverage purchased by a Member of Congress or a congressional staffer from a designed SHOP is accounted for and paid by the individual rather than from a government contribution, consistent with the general prohibition on Federal funds being used for this purpose. Effective and termination dates Current FEHB health plan enrollment for Members of Congress and congressional staff employed by the official office of a Member of Congress will terminate at midnight on December 31, 2013. An additional 31 days of coverage is included after the termination date at no cost to the enrollee. Members of Congress and designated congressional staff who chose to purchase health insurance via the appropriate SHOP as determined by the Director may do so with an effective date of January 1, 2014. An open enrollment period for Members of Congress and designated staff will coincide with the traditional FEHB open season.

Another Myth. Of all the misconceptions surrounding the new health reform law known as Obamacare—and there are many—one of the newest and most infuriating is the idea that Congress made itself “exempt” from a law that puts onerous new burdens on many other Americans. That contention is totally false. In fact, members of Congress, along with their personal staffers, are required to participate in Obamacare, which is a more stringent requirement than employees of many big companies face. The confusion is understandable [ because so many of them are low information or low IQ] Here’s what really happened. When the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, it included a passage that said: “The only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff … are (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act).” In plain English, that means that at the end of this year, members of Congress and their personal staffs will no longer be eligible for the federal health care plan, and they’ll have to purchase insurance through an exchange instead. That requirement was initially proposed by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), who opposed the law, as a kind of dare back in 2009, when legislators were still debating what would go in the bill. It caught on as a populist measure and made it into the final law. Up until now, members of Congress, like all federal employees, have been able to select insurance from a government plan that’s similar to a lot of big-company plans, with one exception: It offers a lot more choices. In fact, the government plan, which has been in place for years, is remarkably similar to the exchanges established by the ACA. The government, on average, pays about 75% of the premiums for members of Congress and other federal workers, while workers pay the other 25%. That’s comparable to what big firms kick in for coverage, says Paul Fronstin of the Employee Benefits Research Institute. With members of Congress and their staffs being forced to buy insurance on the exchanges beginning in 2014, the real question regarding Congress is how the government can continue to offer some sort of health care benefit for those federal employees, the way most big employers do, since it can no longer cover a portion of the premium. Few, if any, Congressional staffers would qualify for the low-income subsidies. That means their net insurance costs would rise considerably if they were forced to buy from an exchange with no support at all from their employer. The basic idea is to make Congressional employees whole by giving them a new benefit that’s more or less equal to what they’ll be losing when they can no longer participate in the government’s health care offerings. The Office of Personnel Management, which is the government’s HR department, finally decided this summer that the government will give Congressional employees a tax-free subsidy roughly equivalent to the value of the benefit they’ve been getting until now. That will help offset the unsubsidized cost of insurance bought through an exchange. This rule led the conservative Heritage Foundation to declare that the OPM exceeded its authority by offering subsidies for a health plan it doesn’t administer, resulting in a “special Obamacare deal to Congress.” Cruz apparently picked up on that, and another Obamacare myth was born. It’s hardly surprising that ordinary people might suspect Congress of exempting itself from its own law, given their recent antics of late and record-low approval ratings. Plus, there’s rampant misunderstanding of what Obamacare actually requires. The most basic rule is that all Americans, with only a few exceptions, must have health insurance, or pay a penalty. People who already have insurance, through an employer or any other source, already comply with the law. Consumers without insurance can get it any way they choose. The exchanges were set up as a way to pool insurance and, in theory, offer lower rates to people who can’t get it through an employer. Plus, applying through an exchange is the only way to get federal subsidies for people whose income falls below certain thresholds. There’s no requirement for anybody to buy insurance through an exchange, but it’s likely to be the best deal for many consumers, because of the subsidies. Congressional employees are an exception. As for President Obama, the law doesn’t require him or any other federal employees to do anything different, so they’ll continue to get the same insurance options the same way they’ve been getting them.</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1380914072704</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 15:14:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380914322337-100</Id><Topic><Title>A Republican Who Came To Love Obamacare After Realizing It Will Save Him $13,000</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1380911673753</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 14:34:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>of course there will be more truth...

As the government shutdown that began Tuesday moves into its first weekend, outrage and derisive jokes have given way to a depressed acceptance. This is what political life in 2013 has become. This is the inevitable result when most of the essential jobs in Washington involve the manufacture of partisan talking points. Still, the first days of Shutdown October have taught us some things about politics. So here are thoughts, partly inspired by candid off-the-record interviews with key Republicans, to tide you through the coming days. The Art of War: Everyone saw this one coming — that the House Republicans would march into battle waving their “No Obamacare Ever” banners and meet fierce resistance from the White House. What stuns many Republicans is that the war was launched with no backup plan, no strategy, no sense of “then what?” Two weeks before the government shutdown, the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page warned of the folly of the Republican House threatening “to crash their Zeros into the aircraft carrier of Obamacare.” As the Journal editorial writers, whom no one would accuse of excessive sympathy for Obama, put it, “Kamikaze missions rarely turn out well, least of all for the pilots.” Searching for the Good News: House Speaker John Boehner may never have planned it like this, but the inadvertent effect of the government shutdown could be to reacquaint the GOP refuseniks with something resembling political reality. The logic, which I heard from prominent GOP strategists, is that since the Republican House felt compelled to go over the cliff on a budgetary issue, it is far safer to do it on funding the government than on raising the debt ceiling when the government runs out of borrowing power on Oct. 17. Yes, the government shutdown is embarrassing. (The latest cover of the British newsmagazine the Economist has the headline, “No way to run a country.”) But the nation can endure a temporary halt in many government functions, even vital ones like cancer research. In contrast, not raising the federal debt ceiling would send the U.S. government into default — and, beyond the international humiliation, that would mean higher borrowing costs for the Treasury for decades to come. Sooner or later, the most noncompromising faction of the House Republicans will begin to realize that winning a majority of Fox News viewers is different from winning a majority of the nation’s voters. By supporting this outburst of conservative intensity on the government shutdown, Boehner may have given himself room to work with the Democrats to make sure than the debt ceiling is raised in time. Misunderstanding the GOP Revolution: The standard interpretation of the 2010 Republican takeover of the House was that frustration with Obama over the economy and health care brought in a wave of exceptionally conservative tea party legislators. But the mistake was to focus on the right-wing ideology of these new House Republicans rather than to highlight their outsider disdain for legislating. It is easy to hold very conservative views on the budget and taxation without disdaining all compromise on all matters at all times. The crux of Boehner’s problem with the right flank of House Republicans is their collective failure to understand that (cue the Rolling Stones) you can’t always get what you want. Primary Colors: Many House Republicans understand that a government shutdown and a possible default on the national debt is bad for business, bad for jobs and bad for profits. But these main-street Republicans also live in mortal terror that any flicker of compromise will prompt a full-funded tea party challenge in the 2014 primaries. But what if a few tea party zealots faced 2014 primary opposition from GOP centrists? That is a topic, according to GOP insiders, that is being quietly discussed in Washington among Republican Super PACs and other major funders. The first signs of this trend have already emerged. According to the Detroit News, two House Republicans from Michigan, Reps. Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio, have drawn potentially well-funded 2014 primary foes from the business community. Amash, in particular, is a libertarian firebrand — and his opponent, Brian Ellis, enters the race with enthusiastic backing from the Grand Rapids financial community. There is, of course, no guarantee that the Michigan challengers will be able to prevail in low-turnout primaries than often reward ideological intensity over prudent moderation. But just the existence of these candidates suggests that there may suddenly be political cross-pressures on the just-say-no wing of House Republicans. The Limits of Self-Interest: Few novelists are as popular among the tea party crowd as Ayn Rand, that passionate apostle of enlightened selfishness. But there is a downside to applying her free-market principles (everyone acting in their own self-interest creates a robust economy) to congressional politics. A House member from a safe GOP district can easily decide that his or her political future depends on not stirring up charges that they are Republicans in Name Only, a moral failing that brings with it the dread acronym RINO. But if too many Republicans follow that me-first credo, the GOP’s image is marred with swing voters. And that is what is happening nationally right now as the topic has shifted from the glitches with the rollout of Obamacare (a potentially fruitful GOP issue) to the extremism of the government shutdown (not the Republican Party’s finest moment). Why Can’t They Run the Government Like a Business? That’s long been a favorite political trope, especially for Republicans. But the truth is that no business would put up with anything like the current scorched-earth battle between the CEO (Barack Obama) and a rump faction of the board of directors (the Republican House). And the shutdown is only the latest example of the never-in-the-private-sector constrains on the federal government. Imagine a business that is unable to carry out long-term planning; that has been forced to arbitrarily slash every spending category regardless of priority; and that, even if it resumes operations this month, may have to endure another irrational shutdown before the end of the year. The problem is not with the federal workforce or with the idea of a public sector operating outside the profit motive. Rather, the impasse between the president and Congress has created impossible working conditions with no end in sight. So the next time a veteran’s pension check arrives in the right bank account, a doctor’s bill gets paid by Medicare or an FBI agent cracks a case, pause for a moment to reflect on what has just occurred. Things still work in government even if political blood feuds make it impossible for it to be run like a business. In the great 1939 Ernst Lubitsch comedy “Ninotchka,” Greta Garbo plays a Soviet commissar visiting Paris. Discussing the purges, Garbo says, “There are going to be fewer but better Russians.” Unless John Boehner and Company manage to take the House back from the brink in the coming days, it may be necessary to update Garbo’s line to fit the GOP quest for ideology purity: “There are going to be fewer but better Republicans.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380917679716</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 16:14:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380917812599-107</Id><Topic><Title>POINT/COUNTERPOINT: Boehner vs Boehner</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380911889624</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 14:38:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That was from The Onion, so at times there are partial truths. :-)</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380917812599</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 16:16:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380917938664-108</Id><Topic><Title>What more proof do you need that the TP/GOP is crazy than this......</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380842981500</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-03 19:29:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And they'll find a way to lower that number. :-)</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380917938664</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 16:18:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380920038713-109</Id><Topic><Title>What more proof do you need that the TP/GOP is crazy than this......</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380842981500</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-03 19:29:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>shuting down a WWII memorial that will not cost any more if it were open is a travesty</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380920038713</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 16:53:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380921802878-110</Id><Topic><Title>Park Ranger told by Obama Admin..Make it as difficult as possible for them</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380920452332</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 17:00:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is the IRS getting involved?

Mike Johanns (R-NE) told reporters on Thursday. “And now I’m starting to see that people are mad because they feel like they’ve been duped.” Johanns stopped short of “pointing fingers” at Republicans. Not so for Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), who took to the floor Friday to chastise Republicans directly. “I would say to my Republican colleagues in the House, and to some in this chamber, it’s time for a reality check: Defunding Obamacare did not work as a strategy, so let’s work together to find common ground.” On Wednesday, she pointed out, “We’ve already seen exhibit A of why it wasn’t a winning strategy. Because the government shut down yesterday and the Obamacare exchanges opened and continued anyway.” Ayotte was elected as part of the Tea Party sweep in 2010, and campaigned on her aversion to Obamacare. She even co-sponsored a repeal bill soon after she took office. Johanns, meanwhile, recently called on Obama to “permanently delay Obamacare for all.” Of course, there was never any question that a shutdown would have little impact on Obamacare’s implementation. The law is not tied to annual spending bills, and so was not affected by Congress’ failure to avert the shutdown. The Department of Health and Human Services made clear last week that Obamacare implementation would continue as planned, even as other employees were furloughed. According to multiple reports, just 30 Republicans are driving the party’s hardline stance on the shutdown. At least 21 House Republicans suggested they would support a clean continuing resolution to fund the government again if House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) brought it to the floor.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380926617843</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 18:43:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380926782934-117</Id><Title>Top Harvard doctors: Supporting Obamacare ‘makes moral and medical sense’</Title><Msg>Leading physicians at Harvard University appealed Friday for US health care professionals to speak out against the government shutdown by contacting their elected leaders. The shutdown began October 1 and has sent some 800,000 federal workers home without pay. It was driven by a resurgence of Republican opposition to President Barack Obama’s health care reform plan that lawmakers passed in 2010. “We must lead by example,” said the piece in the New England Journal of Medicine, written by the magazine’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Drazen and executive editor Gregory Curfman. The journal itself does not take a position on the reform package, known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare, and aimed at offering cheaper health insurance to tens of millions of uninsured Americans. However, as doctors practicing in a northeastern state that has had a similar program in place for years, “we strongly support it,” they said. “Before reform in Massachusetts, we saw too many patients who were devastated by a freak accident or an unexpected diagnosis of cancer; we saved bodies and bankrupted lives. “Now, when fate strikes a cruel blow to citizens of Massachusetts, we can fix their bodies and preserve their lives,” the authors added. “To us, supporting the ACA makes moral and medical sense.” Approving drugs and devices, conducting surveillance for emerging infectious diseases and researching biology and treatment are among the “important services” provided by the government health sector, Drazen and Curfman said. “Make your views known to your representatives in Congress,” they wrote. “Your voice will become part of the wave that eventually spurs the House of Representatives to act.” The New England Journal of Medicine says it has the “largest paid circulation among medical journals,” with 200,000 paying subscribers and a weekly worldwide readership of more than 600,000. The shutdown has sent home 40,000 employees of the Department of Health and Human Services, or about half the staff of the government’s umbrella agency that includes the National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The shutdown has stopped preparations for the upcoming flu season by the CDC, treatment of new patients in clinical trials at the NIH and food safety inspections and import monitoring by the FDA.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380926782934</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 18:46:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380926899697-118</Id><Title>Tea Party Leaders Announce Support For Deal In Exchange For Malia Obama</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON—As the federal government shutdown stretches into its fourth day, 20 members of the Republican’s Tea Party faction announced this morning they would be willing to support a clean budget resolution bill in exchange for the president’s firstborn daughter, Malia Obama. While members of the Republican Party’s far-right wing have heretofore been resistant to any sort of deal with the White House over the issue of Obamacare, the Tea Party caucus authored and released a short, tersely worded statement this morning in which they agreed to a swift negotiation of an unstipulated spending bill if the president were to deliver “the firstling.” “The girl. Bring us the girl,” said Congressman Steve King (R-IA) as he stood beside fellow Tea Party leaders during this morning’s press conference on the steps of the Capitol. “The bill may pass, but the firstborn shall be ours.” “Heed our bidding,” added an unblinking Phil Gingrey (R-GA). “And thy wish shall be granted.” According to Washington insiders, the deal would reportedly feature a continuing resolution to fund government operations through November 15 without any modifications to the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, including implementation of the individual mandate and the much-maligned tax on medical devices, while Malia Obama would legally fall under the protectorship of the Tea Party caucus. White House officials have declined to comment. According to Congressional aides, if the White House agrees to deliver Malia, as well as a pint of Michelle Obama’s blood, a ram’s horn, and a shard of obsidian to the basement of the Cannon House Office Building by this evening, a House vote on the bill could take place as early as Saturday. “Obamacare may be a scourge, but lo, our eyes are cast upon matters of greater import,” explained Tea Party Republican Justin Amash of Michigan’s third district. “Preparations must be made. The hour is nigh.” While some political analysts argued the surprise announcement suggests a weakening in resolve of the faction, opening the door for further movement on their stance, several Republican staffers have already indicated that the caucus will not negotiate on their declared terms and that any attempts to substitute Sasha for Malia will be fruitless. “It must be Malia,” stated Mick Mulvaney (R-SC). “First of birth. First of blood. First of the reckoning.” Experts added that in addition to limiting the damage of the current government shutdown, the deal could also avoid a protracted and dangerous battle over raising the nation’s debt ceiling in the coming weeks if members of the Tea Party determine Malia has fulfilled the prophecy. “The Tea Party has spoken,” said Georgetown professor of political science Richard Drape. “The deal has been wrought. All bear witness to the fruits of the Great Compromise, for it is with us.” At press time, a teary-eyed Michelle Obama was informing Malia that she will always love her.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380926899697</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 18:48:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380927392305-119</Id><Topic><Title>Top Harvard doctors: Supporting Obamacare ‘makes moral and medical sense’</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380926782934</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 18:46:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Neurosurgeon Ben Carson disagrees.

On the other side of the coin and what the shut down is really about. The costs are unknown once Americans were told its going to save us, years later 1.8B plus and tax, but even that is a guess.

Most glaringly, The Cato Institute‘s director of health policy studies Michael Cannon introduces Henderson with the lie that “Obamacare Increases Man’s Premiums 300%,” then backs it up with another lie that actually turns out to reveal that Republicans screwed poor Chad. That headline is a self-evident lie, revealed in the Washington Post article that Cannon artfully cherry-picks. WaPo’s Sarah Kliff reveals that Chad Henderson hasn’t had health insurance for over 14 years, which means he had no health insurance premium to quadruple. That makes Cannon’s headline a complete and total lie, and Cannon never gets around to revealing Chad’s pre-Obamacare status one way or the other. What he does do is deliver a completely different claim than his headline makes, but an equally dishonest one, comparing the $175 premium that Chad got from his Obamacare enrollment with this: Compare that to what Chad could have paid if he bought one of the pre-Obamacare plans still available until December 31. The cheapest such plan for someone meeting Chad’s profile is just $44.72 – as little #$%$ percent of his annual income and about one-quarter of his Obamacare premium. The plan that Cannon selected for Chad was Wellpoint’s SmartSense Plus 10,000 POS plan, and if you think you know what the POS stands for, you’re not far off. That plan has two separate deductibles of $10,000.00 each, and out-of-pocket maximums totaling $10,500.00, for a grand total of $30,500.00 in out of pocket expenses. Obamacare’s Bronze plans, by contrast, have an annual out-of-pocket maximum of $6,350. The plan that Cannon picked for Chad also doesn’t cover things that Obamacare does, and that premium he quoted comes with a catch. They can charge him more, or deny him coverage altogether, based on his medical history, and even if he gets this POS policy, it limits coverage for preexisting conditions. Chad’s Obamacare policy has none of those flaws, nor will any insurance plan come January 1.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380931095109</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 19:58:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380931160487-125</Id><Topic><Title>Shock and Awful: Conservatives Already Lying About Obamacare Enrollee Chad Henderson</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380931095109</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 19:58:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But Cannon’s other big lie, a lie of omission, exposes the human cost of Republican derangement toward Obamacare (emphasis mine): Kliff reports that after a three-hour ordeal, Chad bought an Obamacare plan that cost him $175 per month – pretty steep, considering he makes less than $11,500 per year. His Obamacare premium comes to least 18 percent of his income. And no, Chad is not eligible for subsidies. Since he’s quoting Sarah Kliff’s article, he surely knows why Chad isn’t eligible for subsidies, yet chooses not to reveal this: Henderson is a part-time worker at a day-care center. He did not qualify for tax credits to purchase health coverage because his income is below the poverty line. Since Georgia is not expanding the Medicaid program, that meant Henderson was essentially responsible for his entire premium. That’s right, if it weren’t for Governor Nathan Deal (R-GA), Chad would be eligible for Medicaid, but since Georgia’s Medicaid eligibility requirement is $8,520 per year or less. and Gov. Deal refused the Obamacare Medicaid expansion that would have covered everyone up to $15,281.00 for individuals, Chad has to pay the whole nut.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380931160487</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 19:59:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380931215598-126</Id><Topic><Title>Shock and Awful: Conservatives Already Lying About Obamacare Enrollee Chad Henderson</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380931095109</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 19:58:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here’s what Deal told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “No, I do not have any intentions of expanding Medicaid,” Deal said. “I think that is something our state cannot afford. And even though the federal government promises to pay 100 percent for the first three years and 90 percent thereafter, I think it is probably unrealistic to expect that promise to be fulfilled in the long term, simply because of the financial status that the federal government is in.” If the conservative Republican anti-Obamacare crusade is so right and just, then there should be no reason for a director at a leading think tank to lie like this.

While the Affordable Care Act does not amend 5 U.S.C. 8901, the effect of the ``notwithstanding'' clause of section 1312 is to limit the ability of Members of Congress and congressional staff to purchase health benefits plans for which OPM may contract under chapter 89. Section 1312 specifies that ``the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available'' are those that are either ``created under'' the ACA, or ``offered through an Exchange established under'' the Act. The health benefits plans for which OPM can contract under chapter 89 are not ``created under'' the ACA, nor are they offered through the Exchanges. Therefore, Members of Congress and congressional staff who are employed by the official office of a Member of Congress may no longer purchase the health benefits plans for which OPM contracts under chapter 89. As part of their service, they are limited to purchasing plans from Exchanges.
