I was calling BS on the official story from day 1 regarding, September 11th 2001. He just couldn't believe people within the US gov't could be such cold blooded murderers. He had sailed the seven seas, seen lots of things he wasn't proud of, didn't want to talk about. It wasn't until many years later he read some fiction novel that made him think that maybe the government wasn't being on the up and up after all. The book was an expose` on the rogue side of the government that assassinates anyone they feel like. Couple years ago he fell ill. You couldn't get him to go to VA hospital even though a couple of his close friends told him that it was okay. Why? He didn't trust his own government. His younger sister died of cancer. The sister who worked for the gov't who worked on guided weapon systems. Maybe it is all coincidence but he died of bone cancer. But he didn't die in the VA hospital because he was afraid they might speed up the process, and I don't blame him. I think it's harder for the older folks to wrap their heads around this tragedy because they idolized their government that they served even when they knew better.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373458209979</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 08:10:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373458311923-17</Id><Topic><Title>The eagles nest</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373426373795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:19:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are all kinds of chemicals in our food, designed to dumb the mass's down.

Lincoln was wrong to attack the south......there is nothing in the constitution that says states can't secede. So, you anti- American communists think "United" is Geographical like Alaska and Hawaii?.......or is it ideological. If it's the latter, you believe it's proper to use force to keep states from changing their views. That's a road to tyranny and and totalitarianism the founding fathers were intent on preventing us going down. The ideology that united the the colonies was liberty. Ever since the Democrat Party was formed they have fought against liberty, individual freedom and property rights. It fought a war to keep slavery legal, formed the KKK and opposed civil rights. No surprise it wants to force Americans to turn over 25% of everything they earn to a wasteful and corrupt Federal bureaucracy. Americans have little need for a Federal government today. The one we have is way too powerful, abusive and ignores the constitution. If the only thing that unites us is tyrannical force or threat of force and the kind of anti-liberty totalitarian government Genna advocates we are indeed a sad nation - almost as sad a nation as Genna is an American. The closer a government is to the people it serves, the more accountable it will be. Local and State governments are run far more responsibly than is the Federal government.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1373460720746</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 08:52:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373462463172-19</Id><Title>Question regarding auto pilot and auto speed control.</Title><Msg>Will auto throttle (speed control) operate when auto-pilot is disconnected on the 777?</Msg><Username>laylow1991</Username><Timestamp>1373462463172</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 09:21:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373463707712-20</Id><Topic><Title>mir_roguns must think five figures...</Title><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1373407698145</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 18:08:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And Barack Obama has a twitter account.

When the accrued expenses of the government's entitlement programs are counted, it becomes clear that to collect enough tax revenue just to avoid going deeper into debt would require over $8 trillion in tax collections annually. That is the total of the average annual accrued liabilities of just the two largest entitlement programs, plus the annual cash deficit. Nothing like that $8 trillion amount is available for the IRS to target. According to the most recent tax data, all individuals filing tax returns in America and earning more than $66,193 per year have a total adjusted gross income of $5.1 trillion. In 2006, when corporate taxable income peaked before the recession, all corporations in the U.S. had total income for tax purposes of $1.6 trillion. That comes to $6.7 trillion available to tax from these individuals and corporations under existing tax laws. In short, if the government confiscated the entire adjusted gross income of these American taxpayers, plus all of the corporate taxable income in the year before the recession, it wouldn't be nearly enough to fund the over $8 trillion per year in the growth of U.S. liabilities. Some public officials and pundits claim we can dig our way out through tax increases on upper-income earners, or even all taxpayers. In reality, that would amount to bailing out the Pacific Ocean with a teaspoon. Only by addressing these unsustainable spending commitments can the nation's debt and deficit problems be solved. Neither the public nor policy makers will be able to fully understand and deal with these issues unless the government publishes financial statements that present the government's largest financial liabilities in accordance with well-established norms in the private sector. When the new Congress convenes in January, making the numbers clear—and establishing policies that finally address them before it is too late—should be a top order of business.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373468455819</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 11:00:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373470247784-29</Id><Topic><Title>Trickle Down Theory' and 'Tax Cuts for the Rich</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1373393180398</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 14:06:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You`re joking right? only thing that trickled were many jobs and money offshore.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1373470247784</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 11:30:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373470339046-30</Id><Topic><Title>White House Schedule</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363270937569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 10:22:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>another day in the life of our imperial puppet / master of ceremony and division... 9:00 AM The Vice President delivers remarks at the opening session of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue 9:30 AM The President and the Vice President receive the Presidential Daily Briefing 10:15 AM The President meets with senior advisors 11:00 AM The President meets with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; The Vice President also attends 12:45 PM Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney 2:00 PM The President awards the 2012 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal; The First Lady also attends 4:00 PM The President meets with Secretary of State Kerry; The Vice President also attends</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373470339046</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 11:32:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373470473605-31</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty Multi ID Disinformation Peddler and Board Moderator/Fascist</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1371820329598</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 09:12:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sparty won't update white house schedule thread on topic page...here is AGAIN, under sparty msg board fascist thread.... another day in the life of our imperial puppet / master of ceremony and division... 9:00 AM The Vice President delivers remarks at the opening session of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue 9:30 AM The President and the Vice President receive the Presidential Daily Briefing 10:15 AM The President meets with senior advisors 11:00 AM The President meets with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; The Vice President also attends 12:45 PM Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney 2:00 PM The President awards the 2012 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal; The First Lady also attends 4:00 PM The President meets with Secretary of State Kerry; The Vice President also attends</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373470473605</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 11:34:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373470958695-32</Id><Title>Airline Joke</Title><Msg>So this flight is preparing for departure and the passengers are all seated waiting for the pilots.

They were spending Social Security funds long before Reagan came on the scene. Democrats and to a slightly lesser degree Republican politicians have a way of calling something what it ain't to disguise what it is. They like to call government spending investing. By their definition spending the actual money and replacing it with government IOUs is investing. You might want to clue your wife in on this great investment scheme.....but get the name of a good bankruptcy attorney just in case.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1373475018243</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 12:50:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373475349657-44</Id><Topic><Title>So, Now That Liberals Have Proven that Trickle-down Economics Doesn't Work</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1373392037565</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:47:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure it does.....it trickles down to restaurant owners, chefs, waiters, bar tenders, bait shops, taxi drivers, etc, etc, etc.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1373475349657</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 12:55:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373475456886-45</Id><Topic><Title>The Unfunded Liabilities of Social Security and Medicare</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1373400820536</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 16:13:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reagan's rampant criminality paved the way for Bush's.

According to the documents JW received, a little-known DOJ unit called the Community Relations Service deployed to Sanford, FL, to organize and manage rallies against Zimmerman. Among JW’s findings: March 25 – 27, 2012, CRS spent $674.14 upon being “deployed to Sanford, FL to work marches, demonstrations, and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.” March 25 – 28, 2012, CRS spent $1,142.84 “in Sanford, FL to work marches, demonstrations, and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.” March 30 – April 1, 2012, CRS spent $892.55 in Sanford, FL “to provide support for protest deployment in Florida.” March 30 – April 1, 2012, CRS spent an additional $751.60 in Sanford, FL “to provide technical assistance to the City of Sanford, event organizers, and law enforcement agencies for the march and rally on March 31.” April 3 – 12, 2012, CRS spent $1,307.40 in Sanford, FL “to provide technical assistance, conciliation, and onsite mediation during demonstrations planned in Sanford.” April 11-12, 2012, CRS spent $552.35 in Sanford, FL “to provide technical assistance for the preparation of possible marches and rallies related to the fatal shooting of a 17 year old African American male.” – expenses for employees to travel, eat, sleep? JW says the documents it obtained reveal that CRS is not engaging in its stated mission of conducting “impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution,” but instead engaged on the side of the anti-Zimmerman protesters.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1373478257455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 13:44:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373478326678-61</Id><Topic><Title>I know a black guy who called me White Trash.

Yet Washington’s only response has been sequestration budget reductions that are cutting funds for housing—the best cure for homelessness—for more than 100,000, the majority of whom are families with children, mentally and physically disabled people and veterans. That is a substantial number of the approximately 635,000 homeless people in the United States, a figure compiled by the National Alliance to End Homelessness. That estimate is more than the population of Washington, D.C., Seattle, Denver or Miami. A disproportionate number—almost 50 percent—are African-Americans, who make up about 13 percent of the general population. In Los Angeles County, widely considered America’s homeless capital, the number of homeless increased by 16 percent to more than 58,000 in the past year. “When we have so many people struggling, we need every resource,” said Va Lecia Adams Kellum. She is executive director of St. Joseph Center, which provides assistance to about 6,000 poor, including homeless, in the Venice area of Los Angeles, not far from the beach. “We do not have adequate housing. We do not have enough housing stock.” Advertisement I had visited Kellum and two of her colleagues after reading the report on the increase of homelessness. I’m a resident of the so-called homeless capital and the report confirmed what I see every day. In the mornings, my wife Nancy and I walk along Westwood Boulevard toward the UCLA campus, through one of Los Angeles’ more affluent neighborhoods, past restaurants and expensive food markets. In doorways, alleys, on bus stop benches and seated on the sidewalk we pass homeless men and women in a state of poverty, looking confused or even deranged. That’s nothing compared to Skid Row, a kind of homeless ghetto in downtown Los Angeles. We drove through it the other night, taking a shortcut from a freeway gridlocked by Dodger baseball traffic. Men and women were packed on the sidewalks, a terrible sight in one of America’s richest cities. With shelters filled, they’d be there for the night unless they were arrested for some minor offense. That would take them to the county jail, a couple of miles to the north, a grim facility best known for its twin towers, eight- and nine-story structures that house the mentally ill awaiting trial or who have committed a crime. With 2,200 such inmates, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca calls it the nation’s largest mental hospital. A few weeks ago, James Coley and Robert Warfield, caseworkers for assistance organization Integrated Recovery Network, took me through the place. On the top floors, men pounded the locked doors and shouted. Some, drugged, lay senseless on their bunks or in a corner of their cells. On lower floors, it was quieter, although overcrowding had packed the day rooms of cellblocks with bunks. Coley and Warfield interviewed inmates to see whether they were interested in the recovery network’s approach—settling them in housing, linking them up with counseling and drug rehabilitation and, hopefully, jobs. It’s an intensive strategy, requiring great patience by Coley, Warfield and their colleagues. The same sort of personal outreach is practiced by the community teams of St. Joseph Center as they prowl the streets, parks and beaches of Venice, befriending the most distressed and long-term homeless, bringing physicians and psychologists to them, persuading them to visit the organization’s facility for food and a shower. Eventually, some would be placed in housing. It takes a lot of effort. But St. Joseph and the Integrated Recovery Network have statistics showing that finding housing for the homeless can end their downward spiral. That’s why it was so discouraging to hear St. Joseph’s Kellum tell of how the sequester cuts are devastating federal housing funds. It is also infuriating to see how the sequester has slipped from the notice of the attention-challenged news media. I hadn’t heard of the housing cuts until she told me, and I doubt if very many other people had either. This isn’t the only government policy that is exacerbating homelessness. Michael Arnold, executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, said the foreclosure crisis has been especially damaging. He noted that banks are buying foreclosed homes, raising rents and flipping houses for profit. “We have a lot of empty foreclosed homes because people can’t afford them,” he said. The continuing high level of unemployment makes things worse. “If people had jobs and made a living wage, they could afford housing,” Arnold said. Housing isn’t a cure-all. The causes of homelessness are complex and go back more than half a century when well-intentioned reformers in Washington and state capitals, appalled at “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” mental institutions, closed them. They were to be replaced by community care centers, where the mentally ill could be treated near home. But few of such centers were ever built. As the 1970s began, the mentally ill drifted from the hospitals to the streets, the beginning of what we see today in cities big and small and in the suburbs. These are shattered people, too often beset by the twin curses of mental illness and substance addiction, their families long gone. Some are incurable. But a great many can turn their lives around if given a chance. That chance begins with housing of their own and accessible medical care and counseling—opportunities that Washington seems determined to deny them.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373480988124</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 14:29:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373481279900-79</Id><Title>x-47B milestone</Title><Msg>History was made Wednesday as an unmanned aircraft landed on an aircraft carrier for the first time.

"I wish I had more time to look at this new bill before I had to ask questions about it or debate it," he added. The bill then passed the state House Judiciary Committee in a 10-5 party-line vote. The stealth maneuver came after North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) threatened to veto a similar Senate bill on Wednesday morning.

A growing number of American workers are confronting a frustrating predicament on payday: to get their wages, they must first pay a fee. For these largely hourly workers, paper paychecks and even direct deposit have been replaced by prepaid cards issued by their employers. Employees can use these cards, which work like debit cards, at an A.T.M. to withdraw their pay. But in the overwhelming majority of cases, using the card involves a fee. And those fees can quickly add up: one provider, for example, charges $1.75 to make a withdrawal from most A.T.M.’s, $2.95 for a paper statement and $6 to replace a card. Some users even have to pay $7 inactivity fees for not using their cards. These fees can take such a big bite out of paychecks that some employees end up making less than the minimum wage once the charges are taken into account, according to interviews with consumer lawyers, employees, and state and federal regulators. Devonte Yates, 21, who earns $7.25 an hour working a drive-through station at a McDonald’s in Milwaukee, says he spends $40 to $50 a month on fees associated with his JPMorgan Chase payroll card. “It’s pretty bad,” he said. “There’s a fee for literally everything you do.”</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1373485342210</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 15:42:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373485901675-87</Id><Title>The Pot Calling the Kettle Black</Title><Msg>Senator Menendez declared that any country granting (the honest US Patriot) Edward Snowden asylum would face economic sanctions from the US.

Maybe it was to hide that the NSA messed up by not protecting Ambassador Stevens in Libya. or maybe the NSA acts so secretly that it gave a blank check to run guns to Drug lords in Mexico. Or was it because Snowden could not stand the way the US back stabs our allies. In my opinion its none of the above.

Their sole concern seems to be the date when the Social Security retirement and survivors trust fund will run out of its paper assets. This mistaken emphasis misses the fundamental point about Social Security's problems: There is no cash in the Social Security trust fund, and there never has been any. The Social Security trust fund is merely an accounting device filled with IOUs that future taxpayers must repay. Far too soon, payroll taxes will be insufficient to pay all of the promised benefits. Unless Congress promptly takes action, taxpayers will have to pump hundreds of billions of additional tax dollars into Social Security to pay the promised benefits. How the Trust Fund Operates.Workers pay their Social Security taxes through their employers. Each employer periodically sends a lump sum payment to the U.S. Treasury that includes all of the income taxes and Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes paid by both the employer and its employees. The Treasury both receives the payroll taxes (and income taxes that higher-income retirees pay on their Social Security benefits) and pays monthly benefits on behalf of the Social Security Administration (SSA). The money stays in the Treasury's hands until it is either paid out as Social Security benefits or otherwise spent by the government. In fact, no money ever goes into the trust fund. Instead, the trust fund balance is the result of two accounting entries by the Treasury. First, the Treasury estimates how much of the aggregate tax receipts are Social Security taxes and "credits" the Social Security trust fund with that amount. Then the Treasury "subtracts" the total amount paid in monthly Social Security benefits from the trust fund balance. No money actually changes hands; these are strictly accounting entries. Any "money" remaining in the trust fund is converted into special-issue Treasury bonds, which are really nothing more than IOUs. In addition, the Treasury pays interest on the trust fund's balance by crediting the trust fund with additional IOUs. These are also strictly accounting entries, and again no money changes hands. After crediting the trust fund with the proper amount in IOUs, the government spends the extra Social Security tax collections just like any other tax revenue--to finance anything from aircraft carriers to education research.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1373493665563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 18:01:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373493816069-107</Id><Topic><Title>DOJ organizes demonstrations against Zimmerman</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1373476520789</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 13:15:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody is doing more than Obonzo to damage race relations.

Since then, Senate Republicans have filibustered almost everything, betting that voters will blame Democrats for the dysfunction in Congress as much as they blame the GOP. So far the bet is paying off because the press has failed to call out the GOP – which is now preventing votes on the President’s choices for three D.C. Circuit Court nominees, the Labor Department and the EPA, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and the National Labor Relations Board. (The GOP has blocked all labor board nominees, some to whom the President gave recess appointments, but he’s now asking approval for all.) The GOP has already violated hundreds of years of Senate precedent by filibustering the nomination of a Cabinet secretary, Chuck Hagel for Secretary of Defense, and using the filibuster to delay John Brennan’s nomination as CIA Director. Harry Reid may now be able to summon 51 votes to abolish the filibuster, at least for cabinet officials and other high-level policy makers. But that shouldn’t be considered a victory. It’s a sad commentary on where we’ve come to. Advertisement When I was in the cabinet I worked closely with several great Republican senators, such as Mark Hatfield of Oregon and Nancy K#$%$ebaum of Kansas, who were willing to compromise, and who cared more about preserving the institutions of government than getting their way. Even Orren Hatch and John McCain in those days were more concerned about the institutional integrity of the U.S. government than about any particular policy difference they may have had with the other side. But the new breed – Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Sam Brownback, Jeff Sessions, David Vitter, to name a few – don’t give a rat’s #$%$ about how or whether our government functions. In fact, they give every indication that they’d rather it didn’t. I can’t help wondering why is it that Republicans who do want our governing institutions and processes to remain strong don’t stand up to the fanatics? What happened to Hatch and McCain, or to Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, and Lindsay Graham? Are they so frightened of losing to a fanatic in the next primary that they’ve been silenced into submission? Why don’t former Republican senators who lost to the fanatics, such as Indiana’s Richard Lugar, speak up? As has been noted many times in history, it is not so much the viciousness or carelessness of the bad people but the silence of the good people that brings societies to the brink, or beyond.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373497913269</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 19:11:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373497947152-129</Id><Topic><Title>The eagles nest</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373426373795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:19:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hypocrisy is the Kent raven's middle name.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1373497947152</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 19:12:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373498210794-130</Id><Title>why are fotune 500 companies making so much money</Title><Msg>auto, airlines, medical, tech, oil, you name it.

As bomb suspect appears in court, backers rally to his defense and suspect the U.S. government is the real culprit Alex Seitz-Wald Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will make his first appearance in federal court today since being arrested for, along with his brother, setting off bombs at Boston Marathon and leading police on a massive manhunt. But many of the people on hand to witness the heavily armed convoy that took Tsarnaev from prison to court today were not eager to see justice done to the suspect. Some were adherents to conspiracy theories, pushed by conspiracy broadcaster Alex Jones, and others who think Tsarnaev is a patsy to cover up the fact that the real mastermind of the bombings was the U.S. government. The Boston Globe reports: Some of the supporters started chanting — “Justice for Dzhokhar” and “Give him his freedom back” — as the motorcade took Tsarnaev into the Joseph Moakley courthouse where he is scheduled to be arraigned on 30 federal charges, 17 of which could bring the death penalty. [...] Karina Figueroa, 35, a New York City resident, said she believes that Tsarnaev is wrongly accused. “I’ve seen a lot of videos showing inconsistencies,” she said in an interview with the Globe. “They are framing him, I believe. I want him to be exonerated.” A second Tsarnaev supporter, Duke Latouf of Las Vegas, said he believes the attack was not an act of Islamic terrorism, but part of a plan by government to impose martial law on Americans. “I believe this is a false flag for martial law,’’ said Latouf, who said he flew in from Las Vegas to be on hand when Tsarnaev appears in court. “I think they were Hollywood-style bombs.’’ One man who happened to be passing the courthouse at the time turned to the supporters and said, “You are disgusting. You’re disgusting. Don’t you know people died?” When you spend a lot of time thinking about conspiracy theories, as I have, you can’t help but appreciate their ingenuity and narrative flourish on some level. These are stories, after all, and they have to be compelling or else no one would believe them. But the Boston marathon bombing conspiracy is one of the laziest, most ridiculous and implausible narratives of any kind I’ve ever encountered, conspiracy theory or not.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373498464254</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 19:21:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373498550646-133</Id><Topic><Title>The eagles nest</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373426373795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:19:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The hypocrisy was using metaphor but taking me literally, Loon.

The half-term Alaska governor tells fanboy Sean Hannity she’s “considering” challenging Sen. Mark Begich. If only By Joan Walsh It’s rare that progressives and Tea Partyers agree on anything, but the news that Sarah Palin is “considering” running against Alaska Sen. Mark Begich in 2014 has all of us reciting the same prayer: Oh dear God please make this happen! “I’ve considered it because people have requested me considering it,” she told Fox’s Sean Hannity Tuesday. “But I’m still waiting to see what the lineup will be and hoping that … there will be some new blood, new energy, not just kind of picking from the same old politicians in the state.” The last time Palin found new blood in Alaska, you’ll recall, she backed the disastrous far-right Tea Party upstart Joe Miller against incumbent GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski in 2010, and Miller won the primary – only to lose the general after Murkowski ran a historic write-in campaign, and Miller ran a historically bad one. A poll commissioned by the Tea Party Leadership Fund, which is hoping for a Palin run, found she is essentially tied atop the GOP primary field with the current front-runner, Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell, edging him narrowly 32-30, with 24 percent for Miller, who’s running again. Miller loses to Treadwell overwhelmingly in a head to head matchup. However, Begich would seem to have less to fear from a Palin run. In February Public Policy Polling found that the Democratic incumbent has a healthy lead over Palin in a hypothetical matchup, 54 to 38 percent; he’s only leading Treadwell by 8 percent. Still, Palin, clearly the weaker candidate, enjoys entertaining the notion that she’ll challenge Treadwell. Palin remains a national Tea Party darling, but she is damaged goods in her home state. When John McCain tapped her as his running mate in 2008, she had an 80 percent approval rating in Alaska; by early 2013 it was down to 34 percent. “I have a sense that today she would have a very hard time getting elected here,” Margaret Stock, a University of Alaska Anchorage political science professor, told the New York Times last year. Mainstream Republicans, understandably, don’t seem to take the notion of a Palin run all that seriously. After all, she hinted at a 2012 presidential run well into 2011, though it became increasingly clear she was enjoying making the big money speaking, which her potential candidacy enabled. Republican strategist Brian Walsh tweeted: “Personally, I’ll believe it when I see it. She does a good job keeping her name out there on one thing or another though.” Still, even though Palin’s a weaker candidate against Begich than Treadwell is, that kind of calculation hasn’t stopped her before. In 2010, she endorsed the little-known Miller and he won the primary, only to implode after his campaign security guards handcuffed and detained a reporter at a public event, while Miller himself let loose on unpopular issues like privatizing Social Security and Medicare, abolishing Medicaid and the Department of Education, and opposing abortion even in cases of rape and incest (which, come to think of it, is now part of the GOP mainstream). Besides, if a Palin run forced Miller out of the race, or marginalized him enough to let her pick up his support, she could conceivably beat Treadwell – their combined support is 58 percent to his 30 percent. So if Palin sees any upside for herself in running against Treadwell, I’m sure she’ll do it. She’s happy to hurt the GOP; she’s already declared that she’s willing to leave the Republican Party, and maybe start a “Freedom Party,” and she reiterated that to Hannity: It’s certainly not my first choice. The Republican Party is the Party of Lincoln and Reagan, and the planks in the platform are right for this country. I stand strong on those planks. I just wish that more of our leadership, the movers and shakers within the Party, would stand strong on those planks with the rest of us…It tempts one to believe that if they in the Party abandon us, we have no other choice. On the other hand, running and losing, whether to Treadwell or Begich, would hurt the Palin brand, and it’s hard to imagine that Gov. Half Term would have the discipline for a Senate run. She clearly prefers taking potshots at President Obama from the perch of her Facebook page, or facing adoring crowds at the NRA and CPAC, or worshipful interviews by her Fox friends, to the give and take of political debate. When Hannity pressed her about what might make her run, Palin replied: Well, I think any American with a heart for service has to always have in the back of their mind that they would do anything, everything that they could, to help the cause, even if perhaps if it’s something that doesn’t look necessarily appealing or necessarily fitting in with a conventional plan. … I would do whatever I could to help, and if that was part of that help, then it would have to be considered. What a selfless public servant.

It has become morally acceptable for those in lofty circles to enrich themselves while turning their backs on the rest of us Even more damning, the power elites now feel ethically free to slash America’s tattered safety net, leaving more holes than net for the workaday majority of Americans who’ve been knocked down by the ongoing economic disaster created by these very elites. North Carolina is the latest state to flaunt its shame-resistant political leadership, which now consists of corporate-funded tea party extremists who loathe the very idea of a safety net. These North Carolina lawmakers and lobbyists have been gutting everything from their public schools to health care. Now, they’ve turned on their own citizens who are out of work. In a state with the fifth-highest jobless rate in the country and with no recovery in sight, the right-wing governor and legislature recently whacked unemployment benefits and cut the number of weeks people can receive this essential aid to 19 weeks. The national standard is 26. That official minginess automatically disqualified the state from getting $700 million a year for long-term jobless payments from the federal government. Yet, Governor Pat McCrory issued a cockamamie, Kafkaesque claim that the gut job ensures that “our citizens’ unemployment safety net is secure,” while providing “an economic climate that allows job creators to start hiring again.” Yeah, we’ll all hold our breath until those “job creators” get going. If ignorance is bliss, McCrory must be ecstatic.

The story didn't exactly break out of the ideological press. Chris Hayes ran with it on MSNBC,* Salon ran with it, and James Kirchick, who broke the 2008 story of Ron Paul's old newsletters, informed Daily Beast readers of the new wrinkle. The biggest paper in Paul's state ran a story that quoted not one but two political science professors who agreed that Paul had a problem. Jennifer Rubin did the most reporting, telling readers of the conflagration between her and Paul Chief of Staff Doug Stafford. I reminded him that the office itself so far has put out a single unresponsive statement that it doesn’t tolerate discrimination. I then asked a series of questions (Who hired Hunter? Was his background known at the time? Was Sen. Paul aware of his statements? Now that he is, does Sen. Paul agree with the comments? If not, which does he disagree with? Will he remain employed?). Again Stafford was unresponsive, replying: “Senator Paul’s staffers work for his beliefs not the other way around. You can tell what he believes from 4 years if speeches, writings and votes.” That's a version of what I quoted yesterday, when Ron Paul was challenged over his donations from white supremacists. "I don't endorse anything that he endorses or what anybody endorses," said Paul the elder. "They come to me to endorse freedom and the Constitution and limited government." It's a kind of Gordian Knot approach to the great game of gaffes. If you argue that your associations don't matter, then people know what you'll say when they ask about your new scandalous association. Reporters who covered 2011 primary debates sometimes saw Hunter in Ron Paul's spin rooms. The idea that the Pauls didn't know he was a Lincoln-hater is ludicrous, and the fact that no reporter dug it up to now is largely a tribute to the laziness of reporters. I've been in touch with Hunter since the story broke, largely to see if my theory was wrong and he was packing his things. He's not—he's been pointing me to the same defenses of his punditry that he's been flagging on his Twitter account. The latest is from Fox Business host Andrew Napolitano, who's often also pilloried for his criticism of Abraham Lincoln. Everything that was “broken” in the “news” story in the Free Beacon has been public information for a long time. It was not hidden. And it was not news. Some of it was youthful hyperbole, and all of it was sliced and diced out of context. What’s news? Egypt is in chaos and President Obama continues to fund the military there as it slaughters protestors. There are new calls from both sides of the aisle to reconsider foreign aid. Americans are rallying against their own government spying on them. Left and right are coming together to say “enough” and soundly reject the idea of arming the al Qaeda affiliated rebels in Syria In other words, the neocon world view, which assaulted our civil liberties in a way that would make Lincoln blush and brought us 12 years and two trillion dollars’ worth of useless wars, is crumbling. And it isn’t just crumbling on its own. It has a sledgehammer being taken to it every day by Senator Rand Paul. And that's why Paul will brush this off. It may re-emerge as a story in December 2015, just as the hoary newsletters story was "broken" again by the New York Times in December 2011. The lesson Paulworld took from the "associations" scandals of 2008 and 2012 is that there's no real long-term damage from such scandals; Paul ended up winning all of Iowa's gettable delegates in the county caucuses, and his allies took over the state party. And "politician claims he didn't write racist jokes that appeared under his name" is a better story than "politician continues to employ guy that hates Lincoln." I don't want to be too pat, though. In one of the 2007 columns cited by Goodman, Hunter made a jocular case for keeping out immigrants who'd change American culture. "That Americans, white or otherwise, don’t want Spanish-speaking people dominating their airwaves, neighborhoods, or country is no more racist than Mexico’s lack of interest in Seinfeld,” he wrote. “A non-white majority America would simply cease to be America for reasons that are as numerous as they are obvious – whether we are supposed to mention them or not." That's not how Rand Paul talks. In a much-covered immigration speech earlier this year, Paul spoke Spanish and talked about how he "lived, worked, played and grew up alongside Latinos," quoting at length from Latino poets. How can we not embrace such passion? How can we not want that culture to merge with and infuse the American spirit? They are not called the romance languages for no reason. As we move forward on immigration reform, I for one will work to find a solution that both adheres to the rule of law and makes room for compassion. The contradiction is obvious, but Paul doesn't think it matters—Hunter is on his team now, and Hunter's critics have an ulterior motive to discredit the Paul movement. UPDATE: This is a pretty clever move by Kentucky Democrats. Kentucky Democratic Chairman Dan Logsdon is calling on U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell to condemn "the Southern Avenger," a staffer for fellow Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul. Any condemnation would probably be outsourced to Jesse Benton, McConnell's 2014 campaign manager. What were Benton's two jobs before that? Why, campaign manager for Ron Paul 2012 and for Rand Paul 2010, both roles in which he occasionally worked with Jack Hunter.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373505506007</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 21:18:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373506328833-161</Id><Title>Burrrrrrppppp how' the mediocre class faring tonight?</Title><Msg>yup......the usual losers spewing their propaganda and showing off their vast ignorance for the whole world to see. .</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1373506328833</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 21:32:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373506953972-162</Id><Topic><Title>Judge in the Zimmerman Trial Just handed handed the Defense reason for Appeal</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1373501313330</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 20:08:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Zimmerman shot a pot smoking punk who was suspended from school.

Boeing moved its corporate headquarters from Seattle to Chicago, Illinois, in 2001. For the last 5 years, a review stock price on CNN Money stock chart , the truth. Boeing has been beat by a make work company Airbus, founded in 1970, and over the past 5 years while the 787 has failed on the,” outsourcing business model," based upon the bankrupt MD” failure, Boeing stock price has been battered by Airbus in stock price gain . the facts Airbus has made 185% gain for Airbus shareholders , while Boeing shareholders are up a third that amount, 59% for Boeing in 5 years . ! EADSY is a ADR based on Deutsche Bank Trust of America, located in the USA . It can be used every day to show a direct dollar conversion between the better Airbus comparison to Boeing. , To trade Airbus, which has a very liquid, average volume of 3 million per day , trade EAD.PA , on the Paris stock exchange just contact , your stockbroker. But why. TSLA is up almost 300% in one year so a 100k investment is now a gain of 300K in one year and you can move on to the next big thing, don’t get suckered into the noise of Boeing barkers , people who attempt to get you to invest into Boeing or think they are doing good in Boeing, that is not a big money maker stock, it is second place to Airbus . Boeing dividends are essentially the same BA 1.09% to Airbus 1.0% per year. Boeing has only a 1.3 % short base so it is not a short and these barkers pretend that people are short that is a liar statement no one is short Boeing most investors are not in it Disney is up 120% better than BA over 5 years . So a BA stock price near the last high at 107 stock price is a figment of a sales mans bark, just an approach to putting you in a comparable bad stock. Look to better stocks like TSLA, SCTY, or Disney 120% better over 5 years</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1373512481964</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 23:14:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373514778973-165</Id><Topic><Title>The Pot Calling the Kettle Black</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1373485901675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 15:51:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I heard the argument made that by Snowden having revealed to the public how the NSA operates that somehow helps terrorists Baloney!!!!!!!!!
