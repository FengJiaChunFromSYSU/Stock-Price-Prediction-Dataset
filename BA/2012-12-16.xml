The man is a fraud. phantomfield, your comment about the engineer and his buddies having anything or something to do with faulty installation of a fuel line connector and lockwire is false. . Engineers will design fuel lines and connectors and 60% of the 787 design was not done by Boeing. . Seldom does an engineer get out of his chair in his office and walk to the airplane, or in the case of a jet engine observe or in any way become involved in the install process. , The defective airplanes part of your comment is really about two issues realated to workmanship at the factory floor. First , the lockwire was missing or not per BAC specifications and the o-ring was missing or two installed in the fuel fitting or a o ring was pinched or the wrong o ring was installed. The other issue is the location on the plane for the install was not per the blueprint tolerance location.phantomfield, the fuel line run is attached to the jet engine by a flex line to a hard line, like a car, boat or motorcycle only better parts are used and lockwire, like a race car or bike. If the O and IR install procedure did requrie a" in process", inspection at the time of torque then the inspector did not do his job. If the" in process" work has been streamlined(deleated) by Boeing Mangment then the inspection has been deleated to an after the install rubber stamp procedure. . Like cheap ooutsourcing the 787 design and parts making on this is a mistake. Once the fuel line has been connected, the inspector can not see inside the connector, .. If the o ring does not protrude beyond the connector, then without a functional test and review the problem would not be found . The ground run up and the test flight is another chance to kcatch a probolem only if it appears during the relatively short functional test. . The lockwire inspection was a failure on both the installer, the factory jet engine inspector and the flight ttest inspector, and a cam will be in those three workers files. Boeing will reinstate the " in process" visual inspection of the correct fuel connector o ring and "inprocess" lockwire inspection. This sithe problem with the cheap 787 so many process were eliminated to save money and the result is 3 years late and 30 billion on all that cheap outsourcing. The CEO of Boeing took both a sleeping pill and a laxitive and woke up and decided that adding meeting and power point rangers was the solution to this problem and that is where the Boeing company is now .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355634391751</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 00:06:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355634632848-2</Id><Title>The problem with Boeing</Title><Msg>It has to do with managers that are worried about their jobs.

That was the same year Boeing posted its first full-year loss as Airbus stole market share. Boeing's $US16.3 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas triggered the integration of management at the two companies with Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit, a former aerodynamics engineer, retaining the top job. McDonnell Douglas CEO Harry Stonecipher, formerly of General Motors, GE and Sundstrand, became president of the merged aerospace giant. After a brief retirement, Stonecipher later returned to Boeing as CEO. Some critics view the merger as the point at which BCA began to favor a corporate culture that prized near-term profits over long-term engineering dominance. "Back in the early 2000s there was effectively a battle for Boeing's soul," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president at aviation consultancy Teal Group. He and others also single out Stonecipher as the face of Boeing's shifting priorities. "He was symptomatic of the McDonnell Douglas philosophy," Aboulafia said. . "There were the legacy commercial guys who once a decade invested very heavily in the company's future by creating a new jet. And then there were the newcomers," Aboulafia said. "Effectively, it was dominated by a lot of the McDonnell Douglas people who were a little more concerned with their own wealth," he added. "And they absolutely did not want to make a big investment." But when it came time to build the 787, Boeing turned away from its stable of engineers and mechanics to embrace a complex web of suppliers. For the first time in its history, Boeing would outsource the wing design and manufacturing. "That, I think the smart people there knew, was an incredibly risky way of doing it, ," Aboulafia said.

The rest of this article deals with the relationship between gun control and genocide in some detail. It's very enlightening. The author cites many sources, and also shows: * Government officials are the world's largest mass murderers. * How we can prevent genocide in America -- and how it almost happened HERE to 125,000 Americans in 1941-42. * The government is NOT all-powerful: All law enforcement (including military) in the US is only 1.1% of the population. * Several cases where armed citizens have prevented genocide (Afghanistan is one example). * The Chicago Police Department report: from 1965 to 1992, there were 21,204 gun murders -- Nine (9) were from bullets that might have come from a military-type weapon!

From 1975 to 1977,one million educated people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million... Guns in the hands of HONEST citizens saves lives and property and yes, gun-control laws adversely affect only the law-abiding citizens. Take note my fellow Americans, before it's too late! The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, please remind them of this history lesson. with guns, we are 'citizens'. Without them, we are 'subjects'. During WW II the Japanese decided not to invade America because they knew most Americans were ARMED! SWITZERLAND ISSUES EVERY HOUSEHOLD A GUN!

Your loss is terrible, words can't really describe it. Well a few words about gun control and some of the players in the debate. Pres. BO several hours into the event. Spoke a prepared statement and in it said it wasn't the time to talk about causes. Its one of the few things he has said that was correct. Although through out his speech he managed to subtly work in anti gun laws. He also had those places in his prepared text that said pause here and act like you are crying. Keep in mind he is a narcissist and they don't cry for others, they cry for themselves. I wonder did BO cry for the mothers, fathers, brothers sisters of the dead in the Mexican drug massacres? where the dead numbered in the many Hundreds and innocent victims? Did he? Don't forget he and his admin furnished the guns to those murderers Through operation "fast and furious". And don't forget that BO and administration is hiding the data to investigate and hiding the guilty through "executive privilege". About gun control. You have heard that guns don't kill people, people kill people. Its true, although at times it may not satisfy the victims family. This person that did the shooting at Sandy Hook, he didn't just happen to find a gun and run out and use it. The facts are not all in, but its clear that he did quite a bit of planning aforehand. Did he have a propane bottle with him? It seems that I heard that. Maybe not. The one in the theater in Co. did have one. Didn't use it. One of these days one of these incidents will occur where it is used and the news will be all over it, soon enough it will catch on. The propane bottle use could potentially be more horrific then the guns. So whats wrong here that is causing these gun incidents? There are a number of things and gun ownership is not necessarily one of them. Take the Movies of the day, the violence each movie more extreme than the next. The Interactive videos that teaches how to kill everyone. By the time they are done with high school, kids are pretty desensitized to shooting at people. The movie industry is on the defensive from day one on the current shooting. Well its not just the movies. Take a look at the schools, what they teach, the values, the examples. Sandy Hook looks like it would rate pretty high. Take a look at the abortion actions, partial birth abortion, what value of life message does that send. Striking teachers, does that have an effect on young minds? The point is teaching civics in the schools. Teaching kids the need for civics. Under the NEA and its affiliates there isn't any of that going on. Some responsible commentators say the NEA is the single largest corrupting influence in our school system. Most religion here in the US is a teacher of compassion and responsibility, NEA and similar following don't want any of that. Kids need the good examples, ones that tell them that those troubled kids need responsible help. If you see something say something. Take a look at the locker rooms. There will be found a large cause of the shooting problems. There will be the couches that teach the bully kids to out the weaker or troubled kids. Yes this is a large cause of the troubled ones reacting violently. This is where the seeds are planted for the planning, the thinking about making thing right. And lastly many of the incidents have occurred in the last couple of years. Lets see unemployment, family members laid off. kids out schools no jobs. BO didn't touch the unemployment issues until it was time to run for reelection. Yes the extra stress to society and its effects can be laid on BO's doorstep.

More specifically, it’s a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Now, before you make this decision, you must keep in mind that not every little detail in order to ensure passenger safety has been thought out. But that’s okay. Don’t worry. These problems are normal for a jet program that’s just entering service. If a few people have to fear for their lives during an emergency landing, so be it. That’s par for the course. So, would you like to board the Boeing 787 Dreamliner? There have only been two major issues so far, one emergency landing with United Airlines and now a grounding with Qatar Airways. Both incidents related to the electrical generator. But who needs a fully operational electrical generator while flying? If you’re looking at this situation from a moral and safety standpoint, it’s atrocious. Everything on the 787 Dreamliner should have been tested 100 times over before taking passengers.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355688476174</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 15:07:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355689963687-66</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing CEO claim's of 787 defects and emergency landings is par for Boeing now with GE style leadership</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1355688476174</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 15:07:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is so many issues being covered up and popping up it will take a crash to have this POS grounded.</Msg><Username>art.constantine</Username><Timestamp>1355689963687</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 15:32:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355690100364-67</Id><Topic><Title>And So This Is Christmas...</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1355687416419</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 14:50:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Move to North Korea, you sound like you'd fit right in.</Msg><Username>alangonquin11</Username><Timestamp>1355690100364</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 15:35:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355690208240-68</Id><Topic><Title>Some 787s Grounded</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1355618533339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 19:42:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think a fire @ 40,000 feet sounds exciting.

Whoever said that the founding fathers didn't think that all citizens should have guns is living in their own little world. The following quotes by the authors of the Second Amendment, their contemporaries, various state and federal courts, and others should be useful in the debate over whether that amendment protects a right of individuals or only the military. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- READ CAREFULLY -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "The whole of the Bill (of Rights) is a declaration of the right of the people at large or considered as individuals.... It establishes some rights of the individual as unalienable and which consequently, no majority has a right to deprive them of." (Albert Gallatin of the New York Historical Society, October 7, 1789) "The right of the people to keep and bear arms has been recognized by the General Government; but the best security of that right after all is, the military spirit, that taste for martial exercises, which has always distinguished the free citizens of these States....Such men form the best barrier to the liberties of America" - (Gazette of the United States, October 14, 1789.) "No Free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms." (Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, 1 T. Jefferson Papers, 334,[C.J.Boyd, Ed., 1950]) ****"The right of the people to keep and bear...arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country..." (James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 [June 8, 1789]) *** ***"A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves...and include all men capable of bearing arms." (Richard Henry Lee, Additional Letters from the Federal Farmer (1788) at 169)*** "What, Sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty.... Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins." (Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate over the Second Amendment [ I Annals of Congress at 750 {August 17, 1789}]) Emphasis added...IE: The militia IS the people nad therefore it follows tha the Militia (WE THE PEOPLE) and their right to bear arms SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. To argue otherwise...is to argue against the founding fathers, the framers of the constitution and ,,,dare I say it...is UnAmerican.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1355702515396</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 19:01:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355703040287-94</Id><Title>Mass Shootings: Maybe What We Need Is a Better Mental-Health Policy</Title><Msg>From Mother Jones Editor's note, December 14: This story on the prevalence of previously identified mental-health problems among mass shooters has new relevance in light of the Newtown tragedy.

For several years prior, Loughner had displayed signs of serious mental illness, including outbursts during his high school classes and complaints about voices in his head. Nevertheless, he was able to stroll into a Sportsmen's Warehouse in Tucson and purchase a weapon and ammunition legally.

After another young man unleashed horror inside a Colorado movie theater this July, we set out to track mass shootings in the United States over the last 30 years. We identified and analyzed 61 of them—24 in the last seven years alone. No less than 80 percent of the perpetrators in these 61 cases obtained their weapons legally. Acute paranoia, delusions, and depression were rampant among them, with at least 35 of the killers committing suicide on or near the scene. (Seven others died in police shootouts they had little hope of surviving, regarded by some experts as "suicide by cop.") And according to additional research we completed recently, at least 38 of them displayed signs of mental health problems prior to the killings. (That data is now included in the interactive map linked above.) Loughner was medicated and underwent psychiatric examinations at a secure federal facility in Missouri for more than a year and was diagnosed with schizophrenia; by this August he was deemed competent to agree to a guilty plea, the terms of which bar him from any appeal or parole. Could he or any of the others have been stopped in advance? It's an exceptionally challenging question, one whose answer must take into account civil liberties, medical ethics, the proliferation of millions of guns in the United States, and our nation's politically charged patchwork of ever-loosening gun laws.

Mass murderer Jared Loughner was sentenced on November 8 to multiple life terms in prison. It's difficult to read an account of the court proceedings in Tucson without getting a lump in your throat. The man who shot 19 people at a shopping center in January 2011—gravely wounding former US congresswoman Gabby Giffords, and killing six including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl—faced potent testimony from some of his victims. "You may have put a bullet through her head, but you haven’t put a dent in her spirit and her commitment to make the world a better place," said Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, as his still-recovering wife gazed directly at Loughner from her seat across the courtroom. Loughner's mental illness was a powerful undercurrent in the proceedings. "You tried to create for all of us a world as dark and evil as your own," Kelly said. "But know this and remember it always: You failed." He continued: "Your decision to commit cold-blooded mass murder also begs of us to look in the mirror...We are a people who can watch a young man like you spiral into murderous rampage without choosing to intervene before it is too late." (Kelly then excoriated Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and other political leaders for cravenly ignoring gun control: "As a nation, we have repeatedly passed up the opportunity to address this issue. After Columbine, after Virginia Tech, after Tucson, and after Aurora, we have done nothing." It's well worth reading his entire statement.)

I'm not saying that will happen -- no mass shooting has ever brought it about so far. I'm just saying it COULD. Why not have a limit on magazine capacity, for example? Since so many 'Muricans are waking up to govt. abuses, you will have no shortage of backup to cover you while you reload, and if a mass murderer had to reload, a first responder might have time to bring him down.

Non-English speaking voters may use an interpreter. The interpreters are permitted by law to interpret for the individual voting; however, they are forbidden from influencing their vote in any way. Another source who also wishes to remain anonymous has seen Democrat interpreters show the non-English speaking Somalis how to vote the Democrat slate that they were handed outside. According to this second source, there are Republican Somali interpreters available. The logical follow-up question is whether a non-English speaking person is an American citizen. Although Republican leadership in Ohio passed a voting reform law, it was repealed by the legislature itself after the Democrats threatened a referendum. According to the Ohio Secretary of State’s web site, someone wanting to vote early in Ohio must supply one of the following in writing on the absentee ballot form, whether voting early by mail or in person: an Ohio driver’s license number; the last four digits of the social security number; or a copy of a current and valid photo identification, military identification, or a current — within the last 12 months — utility bill, including cell phone bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows the person’s name and address in addition to the voter registration acknowledgement. The voter is not required to show the driver’s license or social security card, but must merely write it on the absentee ballot request form. While the individual would be required to show a utility bill, bank statement or other printed document if he or she chooses that option, this is in lieu of writing the driver’s license or social security number. Therefore, the information cannot be checked against the Bureau of Motor Vehicles or other state databases. Essentially, a person is asked to check a box stating that they are a citizen, and the poll worker is to trust that they are the person who is listed on the item being shown or the information being written. In other words, someone can be an illegal resident of the state of Ohio and the United States, get an apartment, turn on the heat, bring in the Columbia Gas bill, register to vote by the deadline, and vote by showing that same bill. There is then no verification that this individual is a citizen of the United States. Matt McClellan, the press secretary for Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, explained, “There is a process to challenge a voter’s eligibility. The point in time for a challenge to be brought ended mid October. A poll worker could challenge a voter if they had questions as to whether or not a voter was registered or eligible to vote.” However, if the poll worker does not raise the issue at the time the voting occurs, that person’s vote will otherwise be counted on election day along with everyone else’s vote. McClellan was not aware of any reports of irregularities at the Morse Road voting place in Franklin County. Two phone calls and a text message to the Public Information Office at the Franklin County Board of Elections were not returned. According to the Somali Community Association of Ohio’s web site, over 45,000 Somalis live in Ohio.

I'm not concerned here about the "ROOT CAUSE" of the murder. Murder has been around since Cain and Abel. I am concerned here about how to stopa murder from becoming 26 murders. If we can ban silencers and automatic weapons, we can ban large-capacity magazines. I don't care how many cottage industrues we put out of business. We won't get them all on Day 1, but we'll get to most of them eventually. Desk jockey? There was no need for that. But as I said to Sparty, have at it. The more unreasonable you come off, the more folks will go for the alternative. I have a lot of money invested in firearms, I want to keep mine. To do so, I'll agree to some reasonable regulation.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1355714605385</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:23:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355715081282-119</Id><Title>Hillary's concussion</Title><Msg>sez suffered a concussion after fainting.

Sheds Crocodile Tears, Prepares Ground For Assault On 2nd Amendment</Title><Msg>"President Barack Obama assured the grieving, shell-shocked Newtown community on Sunday that "you are not alone" and vowed sternly to wield "whatever power this office holds" in a quest to prevent future mass shootings. "We can't tolerate this anymore," Obama said from behind a podium on the stage of a Newton High School auditorium, as adults wept, or hugged, or sat quietly, many hugging small children. "These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change." "In the coming weeks, I'll use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens -- from law enforcement, to mental health professionals, to parents, and educators -- in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this, because what choice do we have?"he said. The speech, broadcast nationwide, offered the bold suggestion that Obama might engage lawmakers on the subject of gun control -- a topic that has not been among his top priorities during his presidency. "We can't accept events like this as routine. Are we really prepared to say that we're powerless in the face of such carnage?" Obama said. That the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year, after year, after year is somehow the price of our freedom?" Liberals: sooo predictable . Y.T.

You provide no evidence that you have given any serious thought to this issue. Your response is emotional nonsense and reminds me of a vigilante ready to apply his "let's hang'em high" mentality to the first gun owners you find. You will never stop a murder from becoming 26 murders because you lack of interest or ability to identify the ROOT CAUSE. Your as dangerous as a doctor that can't diagnose a disease but is determined to give treatment anyway. Your display of self-righteous arrogance and your projection of others as being unreasonable when you're full vigilante mode speaks to your self-delusion. It is precisely because you aren't interested in the ROOT CAUSE of murder that your "feelings" should be dismissed as you can only aid and abet future murder as you will only gum up the process of finding real and measurable solutions.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1355716745046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:59:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355717143558-123</Id><Title>it started with ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC all losing viewship and making cuts even Jay Leno, you know the night time</Title><Msg>tv show where Obama made fun of Sara Palins mentally disabled child, even Jay joined in.

Where do you get the idea that regulation isn't already reasonable and why do you think that in order to keep your guns there needs to be more regulation? These are conflicting ideas and only make sense if you feel that you are a threat to society.
