So whether it's Airbus, Boeing, Tesla or whoever's stock and what it's currently trading at, I could care less. It doesn't affect me. How's that Boeing job working for me? Exceptionally well, thank you very much. I'm not even old enough to retire, but I have done so well money-wise at Boeing that I already have way more money than I need for retirement. Standards ...

Too bad most people do not understand a mutual fund has a cycle too, single stock or many stocks each has a pattern. Yep when I was working at Boeing, I recall having so much money I had like 6 paychecks sitting on my counter top one time, when I was young and while I was on mandatory 12 hour days in one stretch of more that 2 years straight while on the 747 line I had no time to cash them in the pre direct deposit times when I worked for Boeing. I retired because I did not need any more money and wanted more free time . 12 hour days are really 13.5 hour days with lunch and 4 -15 minute breaks and . then an hour commute each way brings it to about 16 hours per day of work and just 8 hours to sleep and then repeat.

I guarantee you that I am guilty of "violating" other laws of Moses. A misconception regarding the laws of Moses is applicability to a believer in Jesus. The Apostle Paul spent a great deal of time trying to explain to the new believers that they were no longer "under the law", but "under grace". The law and blood sacrifices no longer were used for "justification" (salvation) because Jesus fulfilled (completed and made unecessary the requirement to be obedient to) the law. Does that mean that the Christian is allowed to go out and sin "like the devil"? No. The obedient Christian is supposed to flee from sin and be obedient to God's Word - as a matter of desire, not out of fear of punishment. The laws of Moses, save for rituals associated with defining the Jews "separate" life and faith (e.g., "shellfish" and "circumcision"), are useful as guidelines for an obedient Christian life. What is in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20) and the death penalty prescription for murder (Gen 9:6) are NOT laws of Moses; they are directly from God. But obedience to those still does not define salvation - only faith in Christ.

Tech, A cogent thought. As we are all like sheep who have gone astray. There is a time and place and manner to lay out the matter-of-fact truths of the Bible regarding sin. Mostly from the pulpit or general Bible discussions and studies. However, both the Old Testament and New Testament warn the believer to warn others of sin - or "blood will be on their hands". Yet, Jesus emphasized not being judgmental, hypocritical, and the oft-stated "holier than thou". A quandary? He told his disciples to shake the dust off their feet and leave those that reject their message (of salvation through Jesus). One challenge with sharing the love of God is explaining why it is important and how it is manifested. It is difficult, if not impossible, to discuss God's love without pointing out that it is obtained through belief in Jesus who died for our sins. And, thus, the "sin" issue is unavoidable and it is also appropriate to be discussed. Unless a person sees him or herself as a "sinner", the logical question would be, "so why do I have to believe?" The consequences of disbelief are explicit in the Bible and have to be explained. But, the Christian is remiss by thinking that he or she must bear down and press the non-believer into addressing specific sin with the Christian (personally). That I believe is God's job. And the work of the Holy Spirit. It is often sufficient to state that "all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God" (Romans 3:23) - from which most people get the message.

Of course losing N carolina might peeve some . . LONDON (AFP) - The US Air Force came dramatically close to detonating a huge atomic bomb over North Carolina in 1961, according to a newly declassified document published by Britain's Guardian newspaper on Saturday.Two hydrogen bombs were accidentally dropped over the city of Goldsboro, North Carolina on January 23, 1961 when the B-52 plane carrying them broke up in mid-air, according to the file.One of the bombs began to detonate -- a single switch was all that stopped it from doing so. The three other safety mechanisms designed to prevent an unintended detonation failed.The US government has acknowledged the accident before, but the 1969 document is the first confirmation of how close the United States came to nuclear catastrophe on that day."It would have been bad news in spades," wrote its author, US government scientist Parker F. Jones.The bomb was 260 times more powerful than the one that devastated Hiroshima in 1945, according to the Guardian.The accident happened at the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.The declassified report was obtained by US investigative journalist Eric Schlosser under freedom of information legislation."The US government has consistently tried to withhold information from the American people in order to prevent questions being asked about our nuclear weapons policy," said Schlosser."We were told there was no possibility of these weapons accidentally detonating, yet here's one that very nearly did."Jones jokingly titled the report "Goldsboro Revisited, or: How I Learned To Mistrust the H-Bomb", a reference to Stanley Kubrick's classic 1964 film about nuclear Armageddon, "Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb".</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1379811089340</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-21 20:51:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379811223246-61</Id><Title>Hilary will be an Angela Merkel on Steriods</Title><Msg>The 1% don't like either. Merkel grew the German economy to such an extent to bail out most of Europe. Likewise, Deng Xiaoping (Dung Shall Ping) grew China to such an extent to bail out the rest of the world, including Bush's America. PS Hilirary wasn't a big fan of Xiaoping. She didn't need a big military career to recognize whats wrong with China holding half of more of the debt of the USA.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1379811223246</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-21 20:53:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379811332583-62</Id><Topic><Title>I lived to See the Day when the Pope and the President of Iran are more doctrinally Flexible than the GOP</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1379808517149</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-21 20:08:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MY OH MY!!!

"Planet of the Apes" or a little sterility will end your species. Nuclear power could play a role in reducing global warming emissions because reactors emit almost no carbon while they operate and can have low life-cycle emissions. Partly for that reason, advocates are calling for a nationwide investment in at least 100 new nuclear reactors, backed by greatly expanded (Obama) federal loan guarantees. However, the industry must resolve major economic, safety, security, and waste disposal challenges before new nuclear reactors could make a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions. We already had an energy presidents so called promise, but all we really got was Bushwacked by a dim bulb in the whitehouse.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1379811913767</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-21 21:05:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379812215625-64</Id><Title>7 in 10 Americans think the Government is for the Big Banks and Big Corporations</Title><Msg>Told ya so ! Zero Hedge Sept. 20, 2013 72% of the poor and 71% of the middle-class believe government policies (fiscal and monetary) have done little or nothing to help them. Of course, this will be eschewed by the academics (as Santelli recently exclaimed regarding the arrogance of the intellectuals) because “the people” just don’t get it. But when 69% of all Americans, according a new Pew study, say large banks and financial institutions have benefited the most from post-recession government policies; communications policies are going badly awry. Despite a surging stock market, exploding home prices, and low rates spurring all kinds of subprime auto loan exuberance, there has been little change in these perceptions since July 2010.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379812215625</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-21 21:10:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379818849244-65</Id><Topic><Title>Colorado Dems who voted for gun control lose recall elections</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1378906632525</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 09:37:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I made that remark facetiously because I didn't care for the 'Little Lady' remark.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1379818849244</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-21 23:00:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379820362889-66</Id><Topic><Title>The Carzy Party</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1379803683494</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-21 18:48:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And right here--seeing Chemical_Ali_Infested, checkn, badolt, blob, doublehaul, and a host of other crazies--proof that the R party needs to take Bob Dole's advice.
