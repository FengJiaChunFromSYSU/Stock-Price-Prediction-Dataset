He is famous for writing a play about a transgender womwn that killed her father when she was a child. Who wants ti know about that or cares about that? Maybe Obamer can relate to such a character. Theater people and Hollywood types are not regular people. They are mostly neurotic freaks that constantly need and crave attention. That is why they see Obamer as one of their own. They see themselves as defending the fringe elements of society as if those of us who struggle on a daily basis to care for own families really give a crap about the struggles of transgender people. Guys like Wright live in the "artist bubble" with an ideology that no one else relates to. He provides people with entertainment a distraction from their reality. He clearly has no clue about the fiscal crisis we are nearing and he is projecting his own fears of loss of freedoms which is #$%$. Nobody will lose any freedoms with Romney as president. Can you or Wright offer me an example of a freedom that was lost in Massachusettes under Romney. Hooz I know thinking is hard work and unfamiliar territory for you. You need to find better examples than Wright if you want to persuade people. Progressives whose big issue is LGTB politics, aren't a priority when the fiscal ship is sinking. Wright is in la la land and doesn't get it.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351252004820</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 07:46:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351252348416-12</Id><Topic><Title>Do you trust Romney?</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1351203437950</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 18:17:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No but I'm finally applying hope and change in my decision.

It's not the fact that the Democrat Party fought a war to keep slavery legal. It's not the fact that Democrats started the KKK, that Democrats opposed the civil rights movement or that the Democrat Party has adamantly opposed individual liberty at every turn The real danger is the the Democrat Party is now controlled by progressives. Progressive sounds nice but so does "Democratic Republic" (of N. Korea) or "People's Republic" (of China) or Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Occupied and controlled countries). Totalitarians always have to cloak their evilness with nice sounding names. Why is so-called "progressivism" to be feared? American progressivism takes much of it's damaging root from the Woodrow Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt era. Historia Ronald Pestritto says “In general, modern liberals favor an expansive and active central government of the kind we have seen in America since the early part of the twentieth century, as opposed to classical liberalism, which saw the fundamental purpose of government as the protection of individual rights, viewing with suspicion any extension of governmental power into spheres beyond this limited purpose.” In short, progressives believe that the masses are too stupid to mange their own lives and property and that certain elitists should be empowered to manage them for them. The truth is they believe in legalized plunder. Frédéric Bastiat: But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime. Now, legal plunder can be committed in an infinite number of ways. Thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it: tariffs, protection, benefits, subsidies, encouragements, progressive taxation, public schools, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed profits, minimum wages, a right to relief, a right to the tools of labor, free credit, and so on, and so on. All these plans as a whole—with their common aim of legal plunder—constitute socialism. Government is the great fiction through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else. People are beginning to realize that the apparatus of government is costly. But what they do not know is that the burden falls inevitably on them.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1351262679978</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:44:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351263198178-21</Id><Topic><Title>Reaching Out To Republicans</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1351211946628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 20:39:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Loading_Dock, In the end, there is only one Friend that satisfies - and that is Jesus.

Powell used his good name to promote the invasion of Iraq. "Powell's chief role was to garner international support for a multi-national coalition to mount the invasion. To this end, Powell addressed a plenary session of the United Nations Security Council on February 5, 2003, to argue in favor of military action. Citing numerous anonymous Iraqi defectors, Powell asserted that 'there can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more.' Powell also stated that there was 'no doubt in my mind' that Saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons." (WIKIPEDIA) Shortly following Powell's UN speech, in March 2003, the invasion of Iraq began. I happen to like Colin Powell and appreciate his military service to the nation. However, I remember him giving that speech to the UN and he did not look like he believed what he was saying. How truthful is he today?

"When he took over, the country was in very, very difficult straits, we were in one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression ... we were in real trouble," Powell said, adding that housing market has started to pick up, the auto industry has recovered and consumer confidence is rising. "I think generally we've come out of the dive and starting to gain altitude," he said. "I see that we are starting to rise up," he said, but added problems such as unemployment and the housing market still need work. Powell also criticized Romney's foreign policy as inconsistent and questioned the former Massachusetts governor's ability to address the deficit and looming defense cuts. "I'm not quite sure which Governor Romney we'd be getting with respect to foreign policy," he told CBS, calling Romney's foreign policy "a moving target." As for the U.S. budget, he added: "It's essentially, let's cut taxes and compensate for that with other things, but that compensation does not cover all the cuts intended or the expenses associated with defense." Powell, a moderate Republican, served as secretary of state under President George W. Bush. Some of Romney's advisers are more conservative veterans of the Bush administration.

Like Shaking Hands With Dead Fish'... Charles Woods, the father of Tyrone Woods, who was killed in the 9/11 terrorist attack at the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, reveals details of meeting Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton at the publically broadcast memorial service for the slain Americans at Andrews Air Force Base only days after the attack. And, in a recent radio appearance, Woods publicly questions who made the call not to send in back-up forces to possibly save his son’s life, as well as the three other Americans killed in Benghazi (which includes the American ambassador to Libya). Middle east in flames Newscom “When [Obama] came over to our little area” at Andrew Air Force Base, says Woods, “he kind of just mumbled, you know, ‘I’m sorry.’ His face was looking at me, but his eyes were looking over my shoulder like he could not look me in the eye. And it was not a sincere, ‘I’m really sorry, you know, that your son died,’ but it was totally insincere, more of whining type, ‘I’m sorry.’” Woods says that shaking President Obama’s hands at his son’s memorial service was “like shaking hands with a dead fish.” “It just didn’t feel right,” he says of his encounter with the commander in chief. “And now that it’s coming out that apparently the White House situation room was watching our people die in real time, as this was happening,” Woods says, he wants answers on what happened—and why there was no apparent effort to save his son’s life.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1351266913682</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:55:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351266987223-36</Id><Topic><Title>Colin Powell endorsed President Obama</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1351202287756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 17:58:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another affirmative action/social engineering politician..</Msg><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1351266987223</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:56:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351267080135-37</Id><Topic><Title>Poll Manipulation</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351258683851</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:38:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only skewing in the polls is to give hope to the delusional republicon fascists so that they won't go ballistic and hurt themselves or someonelse after Obama is re-elected in a rout</Msg><Username>republicanfascists</Username><Timestamp>1351267080135</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:58:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351267118878-38</Id><Topic><Title>Colin Powell endorsed President Obama</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1351202287756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 17:58:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who cares!!!</Msg><Username>chickentoy2</Username><Timestamp>1351267118878</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:58:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351267171340-39</Id><Topic><Title>Thank God for All the Anti-Democrats</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1351258559440</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:35:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>.......remember Obama's Daddy was Communist, his childhood mentor Frank Davis was a communist and Obama himself said he chose to hang out with the Marxists when he was in college.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1351267171340</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351267227407-40</Id><Topic><Title>Colin Powell endorsed President Obama</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1351202287756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 17:58:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Colin Powell's career of crimes was exposed years ago by Robert Parry.

Presidents have long used formal dinners to court foreign heads of state and to dish out fine food and wine to reward political, financial and show business celebrities and supporters. But current and former government officials said the documents obtained by The Examiner point to an unprecedented upsurge in White House spending on such events. The Obama extravaganza two years ago for Mexican President Felipe Calderon, which included a performance by pop star Beyonce, cost $969,793, or more than $4,700 per attendee, the documents show.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1351268038139</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:13:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351268955793-45</Id><Topic><Title>Spending on White House dinners soars under Obama</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1351268038139</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:13:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is a Socialist Hypocrite as He Thinks He is More Equal Than the Rest of Us!

In "A Look Ahead to EPA Regulations for 2012" the minority staff of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works has issued a chilling review of a massive rise in the costs of living for all Americans, massive layoffs in all sectors of the economy, and the destruction of the nation's energy and manufacturing sectors. The report provides a nightmarish look at the regulations that EPA plans to initiate, having put them under cover prior to Election Day in order to hide President Obama's agenda of attacking the energy sector and businesses large and small. Here's a list of the regulations: 1. Greenhouse gas regulation via the Clean Air Act An Ozone rule 2. Hydraulic Fracturing 3. Florida's Numeric Nutrient Criteria 4. EPA's water guidance under the Clean Water Act 5. Stormwater regulation 6. Tier II Gas regulations 7. Boiler MACT rule 8. Cement MACT rule 9. 316 (b) Cooling Tower rule 10. Coal ash 11. Farm dust regulation 12. Spill prevention control and Countermeasure rule These proposed regulations in aggregate,if enacted---that is to say if not stopped by congressional action based on Republican control of both the House and Senate---would prove disastrous, starting in 2013.

BFD on word play- 4 people are dead ! “Fox News has learned from sources who were on the ground in Benghazi that an urgent request from the CIA annex for military back-up during the attack on the U.S. consulate and subsequent attack several hours later was denied by U.S. officials—who also told the CIA operators twice to ‘stand down’ rather than help the ambassador’s team when shots were heard at approximately 9:40 p.m. in Benghazi on Sept. 11.” It gets worse. A third request for back-up was also denied when Americans “were taking fire at the CIA safe house, or annex. The request was denied. There were no communications problems at the annex, according those present at the compound. The team was in constant radio contact with their headquarters. In fact, at least one member of the team was on the roof of the annex manning a heavy machine gun when mortars were fired at the CIA compound. The security officer had a laser on the target that was firing and repeatedly requested back-up support from a Spectre gunship, which is commonly used by U.S. Special Operations forces to provide support to Special Operations teams on the ground involved in intense firefights. The fighting at the CIA annex went on for more than four hours—enough time for any planes based in Sigonella Air base, just 480 miles away, to arrive. Fox News has also learned that two separate Tier One Special operations forces were told to wait, among them Delta Force operators.” And of course panetta admitted they did not provide support cuz they were " uncertain " CIA claims they did not deny requests for help - SO WHO DID ??</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351293947247</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 19:25:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351294470922-102</Id><Title>Bain Capital</Title><Msg>The company failure rate is 22 percent, thats three times worse than Obama's 8 percent</Msg><Username>vampyrr</Username><Timestamp>1351294470922</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 19:34:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351294680493-103</Id><Topic><Title>The Election Shoud be Cancelled!</Title><Username>mocking_heads</Username><Timestamp>1351278472083</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:07:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, BUT (from the page you quoted) "The chance for a 269-269 tie has never been more real than it is in this electoral cycle. While the likelihood of there being a tie is not overwhelming, it is significantly higher than in any previous presidential election in the modern era. ... The Fivethirtyeight electoral prediction model is widely regarded as the most objective and realistic election statistics available to the general public." And fivethirtyeight says, as of today, the chance of an Electoral College tie (269 electoral votes for each candidate) = 0.6% There is almost as great a chance that "rogue electors" will vote for a candidate their state did NOT commit them to (IOW, a elector from a state where Obama won the popular vote casts his ballot for Romney, or one from a state Romney one casts his EC vote for Obama.)
