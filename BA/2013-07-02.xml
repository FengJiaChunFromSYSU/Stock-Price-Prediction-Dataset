Last year Galloway was the subject of an Eye Witness News investigation. It's true that Christians are being massacred by Jihadists. I believe that the beheading of the Franciscan priest is authentic. I couldn't watch it though. Well, Assaud protects the Christians and the Allowites in Syria. What else could be expected but brutal executions when they are captured by the rebels? America wants Assaud out. Russia supports Assaud. It's complicated.</Msg><Username>maramwp</Username><Timestamp>1372737719946</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 00:01:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372738422707-2</Id><Topic><Title>Catholic Priest Beheaded By Syrian 'Rebels'...</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1372688792626</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 10:26:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Spanish Inquisition was no picnic either.

He is using the same excuse every #$%$ uses, claiming every body else is a #$%$, I am no different than everybody else. Everybody spys on each other America is no different. In the international arena no principals of fair play exist. That it is okay to backstab your friends. That is exactly what Edward Snowden is standing up against. Edward Snowden is letting no that American leadership is wrong. He is calling for America to walk the talk when it comes to values. He wants America when it comes to its relationship with its allies to be fair, open and honest. That is what America should be about.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1372738424203</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 00:13:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372739889851-4</Id><Topic><Title>Catholic Priest Beheaded By Syrian 'Rebels'...</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1372688792626</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 10:26:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When did that ever stop us before?

Next the 5( % gain for Boeing is due mainly , to stock price manipulation, not real , Boeing has artificially used stock buyback to cover the 4 month 787 grounding , that is where the main gain occurred! while Airbus made all that gain without stock price manipulation by their own companyperformance over the whole 3 years . Tom O'Brien,, a stock market expert states, Boeing stock volume is decreasing , the stock is "dead on the vine" and will hit about 107, the 2007 high and then fall back over time to the 70 dollar range.

Airbus studied the 787 contractors , cherry picked the good ones made a lighter A350 and will eat Boeing's lunch with the A350 eating from both the 787 and the 777 and have the best American CEO to do just that , allan McArtor., McArtor was founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Legend Airlines, a regional airline based at Dallas Love Field, Texas. Prior to that, McArtor held a series of leadership and senior management positions in the military, civil and government sectors. From 1979 to 1994, McArtor served on the senior management team of Federal Express Corporation - except for two years (1987-1989) when President Ronald Reagan appointed McArtor to serve as the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). During that time, McArtor was credited with helping to regain public confidence in air transportation in the U.S., while accelerating the modernization of air traffic control (ATC). He was also active in gaining increased FAA funding for ATC and other critical programs, including Extended Twin OperationS (ETOPS) and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). In addition, McArtor created the standards for “Aging Aircraft” regulations and issued the industry’s Stage III noise regulations. While at Federal Express, McArtor’s responsibilities included oversight of maintenance, operation, training, scheduling and planning for the carrier’s global airline operations, including the successful merger of the Flying Tigers air cargo airline into the Federal Express operations and the development of the long-range fleet plan, which first introduced Airbus A300-600R freighters. Also at Federal Express, McArtor served as Senior Vice President for Telecommunications. McArtor is a 1964 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy (BSE) and was the Cadet Wing Commander. In addition, he holds a Masters Degree (MSE) from Arizona State University. McArtor was a highly decorated combat fighter pilot in Vietnam, an Associate Professor of Engineering Mechanics at the Air Force Academy, and capped his Air Force career as a pilot with the U.S. Air Force “Thunderbirds” Aerial Demonstration Team. McArtor continues to hold a Commercial Pilot’s license (instrument rating, multi-engine) and is a member of Tau Beta Pi (engineering honorary society).</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372744070569</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 01:47:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372748795842-8</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing stock up 2.5% this week, and what's your point ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372558853706</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 22:20:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go to CNN money, put in the EADS official website symbol for their stock (EAD.PA) and see what happens.

Seldom is there a speck of evidence that the thugs are troubled, and often there is ample evidence that they are in fact enjoying themselves, as they create trouble and dangers for others. Why then the built-in excuse, when juvenile hoodlums are called "troubled youth" and mass murderers are just assumed to be "insane"? At least as far back as the 18th century, the left has struggled to avoid facing the plain fact of evil -- that some people simply choose to do things that they know to be wrong when they do them. Every kind of excuse, from poverty to an unhappy childhood, is used by the left to explain and excuse evil. All the people who have come out of poverty or unhappy childhoods, or both, and become decent and productive human beings, are ignored. So are the evils committed by people raised in wealth and privilege, including kings, conquerors and slaveowners. Why has evil been such a hard concept for many on the left to accept? The basic agenda of the left is to change external conditions. But what if the problem is internal? What if the real problem is the cussedness of human beings? Rousseau denied this in the 18th century and the left has been denying it ever since. Why? Self preservation. If the things that the left wants to control -- institutions and government policy -- are not the most important factors in the world's problems, then what role is there for the left? What if it is things like the family, the culture and the traditions that make a more positive difference than the bright new government "solutions" that the left is constantly coming up with? What if seeking "the root causes of crime" is not nearly as effective as locking up criminals? The hard facts show that the murder rate was going down for decades under the old traditional practices so disdained by the left intelligentsia, before the bright new ideas of the left went into effect in the 1960s -- after which crime and violence skyrocketed. What happened when old-fashioned ideas about sex were replaced in the 1960s by the bright new ideas of the left that were introduced into the schools as "sex education" that was supposed to reduce teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases? Both teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases had been going down for years. But that trend suddenly reversed in the 1960s and hit new highs. One of the oldest and most dogmatic of the crusades of the left has been disarmament, both of individuals and of nations. Again, the focus of the left has been on the externals -- the weapons in this case. If weapons were the problem, then gun control laws at home and international disarmament agreements abroad might be the answer. But if evil people who care no more for laws or treaties than they do for other people's lives are the problem, then disarmament means making decent, law-abiding people more vulnerable to evil people. Since belief in disarmament has been a major feature of the left since the 18th century, in countries around the world, you might think that by now there would be lots of evidence to substantiate their beliefs. But evidence on whether gun control laws actually reduce crime rates in general, or murder rates in particular, is seldom mentioned by gun control advocates. It is just assumed in passing that of course tighter gun control laws will reduce murders. But the hard facts do not back up that assumption. That is why it is the critics of gun control who rely heavily on empirical evidence, as in books like "More Guns, Less Crime" by John Lott and "Guns and Violence" by Joyce Lee Malcolm. National disarmament has an even worse record. Both Britain and America neglected their military forces between the two World Wars, while Germany and Japan armed to the teeth. Many British and American soldiers paid with their lives for their countries' initially inadequate military equipment in World War II. But what are mere facts compared to the heady vision of the left?</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1372775631607</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 10:33:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372776181904-35</Id><Topic><Title>Trayvon and The Mindset of the Left</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1372775631607</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 10:33:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mediocre?? you bet you are- your understanding of the causes of the social ills of the day is straight out of the 7th century- you are about as advanced in your thinking as any Taliban terrorist-- in fact I suspect that you either trained under the Taliban or the Taliban trained under you because you are so much alike</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1372776181904</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 10:43:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372776638438-36</Id><Title>WSJ: Health Costs "Set for a Jolt," Hospitals Bolt</Title><Msg>Almost a third of 32 hospitals and health systems involved in an experiment aimed at changing the way medical providers are paid may exit the program, a potential threat to the Affordable Care Act’s ambitious cost-saving goals. Medicare’s “Pioneer” program is designed to save money by more efficiently managing care for patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes and dementia. The providers agreed to a three-year plan to forgo traditional fee-for-service payments, where hospitals charge for every procedure, and instead get a fixed monthly stipend for individual patients. Nine Pioneer members have told the U.S. they may exit, said Brian Cook, a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesman...Depending on the number of patients involved, “it really shows a critical cost-containment approach in the Affordable Care Act is running into real problems,” said Robert Blendon, a health-policy professor at Harvard University’s School of Public Health...The experimental programs were set up under the law to save Medicare, the U.S. insurer for the elderly and disabled, as much as $940 million through 2015....Also, Medicare has lagged, by about six months, in providing the Pioneer systems medical claims data they need to track spending on their assigned patients, according to Hinton. In other words, more of the "savings" baked into the CBO's initial force-fed scoring of Obamacare are unlikely to fully materialize, further exacerbating the law's deficit problem. The president told Americans that his signature accomplishment would reduce overall health spending and would not add "a dime" to deficits.

(CNN) - Boeing Co. inspectors have discovered intentional wire damage on at least seven Boeing 737s at a company assembly plant in Renton, Wash., the company confirmed to CNN Thursday. The damage was found during routine service testing over the past two weeks. Boeing says it notified the FAA of the sabotage Tuesday. The company also said an additional three aircraft also may have had sabotaged wiring, but evidence is not conclusive. A 737 jet is assembled at the Boeing plant in Renton, Wash. The company is investigating sabotage of wiring on 7 jets under construction there. There are no suspects at this time. "No airplane is delivered until it has met rigorous testing starting with Boeing, the FAA, and the airlines," spokesman Sandy Angers told CNN. "The fact that we found the damaged wires proves our quality system works." The Federal Aviation Administration said it is looking into the matter, but could not elaborate on details. The agency recently referred the case to the FBI, which is the only law enforcement agency working on the case. The FBI did not comment on possible suspects or motives, saying only it has just started investigating.�� Boeing (BA: down $0.22 to $65.88, Research, Estimates) employs about 12,000 people at the Renton plant, where the narrow-body 737 jet is assembled along with the 757, another narrow-body jet, and the Boeing business jet. It makes about 24 of the 737 jets a month. The world's largest aircraft manufacturer announced in March that some of the 757 assembly work now done in the Renton plant would be shifted to its plant in Wichita, Kan., although the fuselages of the planes will still be shipped by rail from Wichita back to Renton for final assembly.</Msg><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1372778934506</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:28:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372778986088-44</Id><Title>Cramer and Price Action</Title><Msg>When I hear Cramer yesterday say BUY, BUY, BUY Boeing and Ford.

The F.B.I. would not comment on the investigation, which formally began on Thursday evening. The Boeing Company reported the wire damage to the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday, but has not said whether it considered the damage deliberate, calling it only ''suspicious.'' But one person familiar with the company's internal investigation said the planes were sabotaged. ''We know something happened, and we eliminated the chance that it is unintentional,'' the person said. While wires are often bent or stretched during production, the recent cases involved wires being damaged intentionally in a variety of ways, the person said. When bundles of suspicious-looking wires were found, the person said, ''that's when we knew this was deliberate.'' Most of the planes in which damage was discovered have been fixed, ground-tested and flight-tested, and delivered to customers, the company has said.</Msg><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1372779250097</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:34:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372779288853-47</Id><Topic><Title>Are you Democrats and RINOs Opposed to lower Taxes?</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1372772838792</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 09:47:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since they're not opposed to lower taxes they must be ready to be part of the TEA party movement.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1372779288853</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:34:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372779316087-48</Id><Topic><Title>Which is better Boeing Barkers, or TSLA and SCTY?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372744070569</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 01:47:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are we reading a news item that is 12 years old and talks, among other things, about a model that is no longer in production?</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1372779316087</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:35:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372779855221-49</Id><Title>Poll: Obama Now Viewed as Less Competent, More Dishonest Than Bush</Title><Msg>From the PEW research center: For a guy who was elected as a sophisticated, nuanced, long-awaited "lightworker" after the dark and unspeakable years of Bush, President Obama doesn't exactly stack up all that favorably against the predecessor he's blamed for virtually everything under the sun: The word "incompetent" is a popular word for both, though Obama just edged Bush in those references, 27-26.

Smart Democrats are beginning to get frantic about the need to suppress the confusion and hide the cost of ObamaCare between now and the 2014 midterm elections. We are just three months away from the October 1st enrollment start date and so far, nothing about the ObamaCare implementation process should be politically encouraging for Democrats. In fact, the more people learn about ObamaCare, the more frightened they become. Right now, small businesses across America are making the final determinations on how to reduce the working hours of their employees so fewer employees qualify for the mandated, employer-provided health insurance. Employers are also deciding whether it makes more economic sense to pay a fine to the government or pay for healthcare benefits for their employees. What this means is that hundreds of thousands – and perhaps even millions – of Americans will learn that they are being dismissed from their employer’s healthcare coverage. The healthcare pink slips will start raining down in late summer and early fall. This will push people into the healthcare exchanges, where, in some cases, people will be writing health insurance checks for the first time. And in many cases, people will be facing increased health insurance costs, particularly if they are young and healthy. The negative effects on personal income and the overall economy will be undeniable. Sometime next year, before the elections, the penalties associated with not having or providing health insurance will begin to pour in. Will the fines come in the mail? Will you be able to appeal? What happens if someone doesn’t pay? No one knows. Or, no one who knows is talking. The consequences of ObamaCare are being hidden.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1372780943062</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 12:02:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372781198231-56</Id><Topic><Title>Thank You, Young and Stupid</Title><Username>simublight</Username><Timestamp>1372771043469</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 09:17:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's old and stupid.

Without any evident embarrassment these mighty politicians deny science, defy mathematics and dismiss every fact that contradicts their prejudices. But bad as these chairs tend to be, none is quite as flamboyantly awful as Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the Government Oversight Committee, a special investigative panel whose latest effort to conjure scandal from nothingness at the Internal Revenue Service would provoke his removal by a responsible leadership. As we have pointed out repeatedly in these pages, and as testimony by the IRS inspector general has since confirmed, it is now clear that right-wing groups were not targeted for exceptional scrutiny. Moreover, there was no political motive in the agency’s treatment of the tea party and associated groups seeking tax exemption (in many cases illegitimately). It is now equally obvious that the behavior of Issa himself, with his attempts to skew his committee’s investigation and conceal testimony that exonerated the agency, represents the most serious wrongdoing in the supposed “IRS scandal.” But this isn’t the first time that the California Republican, who happens to be the wealthiest man in Congress, has misused the broad powers of his chairmanship. Actually, that is all he does—as he demonstrated in equally opportunistic and amateurish examinations of both the Benghazi tragedy and the “Fast and Furious” affair. Issa’s stewardship of the House Government Reform Committee has failed even by the standards of the Republican congressional leadership, which must have hoped that he would have collected some Obama administration scalps by now. He delayed the Fast and Furious probe solely to extend it into the election year, blustered against Attorney General Eric Holder and accomplished—nothing. There is little hope that Speaker John Boehner, who has enough problems maintaining a semblance of authority and dignity, will question Issa’s fitness to chair this important committee. But still we are left wondering: What would become of Issa if he were subjected to the Republican style of investigation? What if the presumption of guilt, the preference for insinuation over evidence, the omission of exculpatory facts, and the promulgation of conspiratorial speculations that feature in all of Issa’s theatrical probes were applied to him? As the richest member of Congress, Issa seems to enjoy the same veneer of respectability that great wealth has provided to many dubious figures. But his past includes several troubling encounters with law enforcement, from alleged car thefts to weapons offenses. So what would the public learn from an Issa-style investigation of Darrell Issa? First, the committee chair would reveal the troubling findings about Issa, namely that he was arrested not once but twice for illegal weapons offenses. Worse yet, he would explain, Issa had been convicted the second time. Then he would release slightly redacted copies of court records on file in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where Issa grew up, showing an arrest, charges of auto theft and carrying a concealed weapon only one month after his discharge from the Army in the winter of 1972. Those same records would also reveal that Issa and an older brother were both suspects in the theft of a “new red Maserati sports car” from an auto dealership and that Issa was eventually indicted for larceny. And then the committee might leak a second, even more damaging set of records showing that Issa had been picked up several months later on another weapons charge in Michigan, where he attended college. Police arrested him for possession of an unregistered handgun, leading ultimately to his conviction. What we might not learn—at least not until the facts were excavated by less partisan probers—is that Issa was only 19 years old at the time; that the first set of charges in Ohio was eventually dropped by prosecutors; and that the Michigan charge was a misdemeanor, punishable by a $100 fine—which young Issa paid. Yet whatever Issa did as a foolish kid could be made to look quite sinister by a congressional committee chair like him, dedicated to trumping up minor irritations into major scandals. How fortunate he is that nobody in authority has ever misused the investigative power to smear him—and that those currently in authority over him have no appetite for reining in his abuses of that power.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372784979710</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 13:09:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372785072574-72</Id><Topic><Title>WAYNEDICK STILL BULLSHOUTING TSLA...</Title><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1372778817767</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:26:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Merrill site shows only 270 shares traded today.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1372785072574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 13:11:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372785355215-73</Id><Title>777 for indonesia delivered</Title><Msg>JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 2, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Garuda Indonesia celebrated the arrival of the airline's first 777-300ER (Extended Range) in Jakarta Tuesday.

The irony of the age of Obama in which black folks found themselves pushed to the back, [and] our gay brothers and lesbian sisters more and more pushed to the center.

Democrats need to win states like Texas and Kentucky, and fed-up women are the key By Joan Walsh Public Policy Polling is out with a new survey showing that Texas Gov. Rick Perry has actually increased his lead over State Sen. Wendy Davis in the wake of her nationally heralded filibuster against SB 5, the draconian anti-abortion legislation Perry’s trying to pass in a second special section. It should be noted that Davis isn’t even a candidate for governor at this point, so this is a theoretical match-up absent any kind of campaign. Still, the poll numbers are likely to bolster the already strong cynicism of Texas political observers about the chance that Davis could beat Perry if she fulfilled the dream of many liberal women nationwide and ran against him next year. Similarly, most journalists dismiss the chance that Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lunderman Grimes can knock off Sen. Mitch McConnell. But the rise of these red state women is good news for Democrats, even if pundits say they can’t beat right wing veterans (and national villains among liberals) like McConnell and Perry next year (and I’m not conceding that here). In most red states, the best hope for Democrats is a rising coalition of Latinos, black people, Asians, young voters and white women. Davis and Grimes could accelerate the future. I’ve been struck by even liberal Texas reporters minimizing Davis’s chances, and suggesting that the national groundswell of support will hurt her in her home state. Writing in the New York Times, Texas Tribune reporter Jay Root reports that it “puzzles” Matthew Dowd, a former George W. Bush strategist, that Davis and her backers “are allying themselves with Hollywood actresses and handing Mr. Perry the ideological battle he so desperately needs to revive his standing — at least with the right,” Root writes. “The best thing to do with Rick Perry is to make people laugh at him,” Dowd told Root. “If you get into a sort of ideological thing, and into a back and forth, that’s how Rick Perry survives.” Another Texas Tribune writer, Ross Ramsey, wrote a piece headlined “For Davis, Opportunity Knocks at Inopportune Time,” arguing that the Fort Worth Democrat is little known outside her district and the state party is poorly organized to give her a statewide lift. “It’s her bad luck that she’s the fastest runner on a team that can’t seem to find its way to the track,” he writes. But then he concludes his piece by seeming to contradict it, claiming that if Davis doesn’t run now, “she’ll never have a better shot.” That’s puzzling – to follow his logic, she’d have a better shot if Democrats were better organized in a few years. So I’m not convinced anyone knows for sure that Davis can’t beat Perry. The truth is, I’m a lifelong blue-state resident, and I don’t presume to suggest I know Texas politics better than these men. I was convinced Rick Perry humiliated and hurt himself with his laughable 2012 presidential run, where he famously forgot the agencies he wanted to cut and made sweet love to a bottle of maple syrup. Instead today he’s stronger than ever with his Texas GOP base. But I do know this: red state Democratic women are the ones fighting the toughest battles on behalf of women’s rights – and they seem pretty happy about the attention. On Tuesday alone, new abortion restrictions took effect in five red states — Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi and South Dakota – all passed by Republican legislatures and signed by Republican governors. Kansas’s new law requires abortion doctors to tell their patients right wing lies: that an abortion puts them at high risk for breast cancer (totally unfounded by science) and that after 20 weeks, a fetus feels pain and “abortion will terminate the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being,” Again, medical experts say neither is true. In South Dakota, women must wait 72 hours before obtaining an abortion – and weekends don’t count, which means some women will wait six days. Indiana women must undergo ultrasounds. In Mississippi and Alabama, women can no longer obtain a prescription for an early abortion drug via teleconference; they must now go to a doctor’s office. The hypocrites who claim to oppose late-term abortion are ensuring that all abortions will at least be later-term in these states. Even as women’s votes were credited with re-electing President Obama on the national level, statehouse Republicans are restricting their rights. So national feminists and Democrats have got to turn their attention to these red states, along with purple states like Wisconsin and Ohio where Scott Walker and John Kasich are acting like they govern Mississippi when it comes to women’s rights. Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner’s decision to run for Secretary of State is welcome news, in a state known for its attempts to limit voting rights (as well as its failure to elect any black Democrats statewide, ever.) We know that eventually, Texas will be a blue state. That day will arrive sooner if Latino voter turnout rises. Texas women’s groups are paying a lot of attention to the Latina vote, since Latinas are less likely than other groups to go to the polls. Young Latinas are also more likely to be pro-choice, so is an opportunity to use this battle to make more of them voters. At any rate, I find it encouraging to see national Democrats paying attention to Texas, with projects like Battleground Texas driven by Obama campaign veterans, most notably Jeremy Bird. Nobody expected Obama to pour money into Texas or Kentucky in 2012; the goal was to win, and there were plenty of states where he had a better chance, as well as some purple states, like Ohio, that he couldn’t afford to lose. But it’s unconscionable for national Democrats to ignore opportunities – and need – in the state that gave us Ann Richards and Barbara Jordan. Likewise, I’d like to see national Democrats more engaged in the Grimes race. She’s gotten criticism for a lackluster announcement on Monday and her Web presence is minimal. McConnell is unpopular in Kentucky and knocking him off in 2014, while unlikely, would be a sign that Democrats will leave no state behind. McConnell’s campaign gave Grimes a favor Tuesday by releasing a bizarre autotuned ad that made fun of her name but actually served to get me to be able to type it from memory. (Oh, and they misspelled McConnell’s name in the ad.) So his team may not be the second coming of Obama 2012. Meanwhile, the Texas battle over abortion rages on, with the legislature expected to vote next week in the second special session called by Perry. I got into a little Twitter discussion with Matthew Dowd, after I Tweeted that he’d “trashed” the involvement of Hollywood actresses in the Times piece. “Wasn’t trashing celebrities, was just saying [Davis] only helps Perry by involving national media and celebs.” Point taken; trashing was useful shorthand in 140 characters; “dismissing” or “disdaining” would have been more accurate. But Dowd knows Texas past and present, not necessarily its future. I’m not ready to concede that Planned Parenthood’s wrangling television stars like “Law and Order: SVU”’s Stephanie March (a Texas native), Lisa Edelstein of House or Connie Britton, who played Tami Taylor in the legendary Texas football series “Friday Night Lights,” are just “Hollywood” liberals who are going to drive more Texans into the arms of Rick Perry. That PPP poll that found Davis trailing Perry also found that she’d doubled her in-state name recognition, from 34% to 68%, since January. More significant, she is now the best- liked Texas political figure among those PPP tested statewide — and the third-best-known after Rick Perry and Ted Cruz. That’s not bad for a Fort Worth lady in tennis shoes. National Democrats are going to keep paying attention to Texas; the women of Texas deserve no less.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372797560143</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:39:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372797737127-100</Id><Title>Travyon Martin conspiracy theorists get desperate</Title><Msg>Travyon Martin conspiracy theorists get desperate In their zeal to make the slain teen look like a thug, conservative bloggers push nonexistent police coverup By Alex Seitz-Wald As mainstream conservative pundits started defending George Zimmerman and attacking Trayvon Martin, various conspiracy theories have emerged on the fringes, but the latest one catching fire in the right-wing blogosphere is especially odd, considering it claims police covered up information about the slain teen that was reported over a year ago. A Washington Times Communities contributor wrote yesterday, based on documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request by a pseudonymous conservative blogger who goes by “Sundance,” that police engaged in an intentional coverup to conceal reports that Martin was suspected of stealing jewelry, among other crimes. The post has already been picked up by a number of well-read conservative blogs and is currently leading FoxNation, the conservative news network’s aggregation website. “This is corruption, under the guise of ideology, of the highest order,” the pseudonymous blogger wrote. “The Miami-Dade School Police Department failed Trayvon Martin and as a consequence George Zimmerman. One can only imagine what the outcome would have been, if the M-DSPD had followed the laws as they are written, instead of ignoring law and manipulating/falsifying reports. Indeed a strong argument could be made that Trayvon might be alive today.” The story goes like this: Martin was once caught graffiti’ing a door at school and when his bag was searched, an officer came across jewelry and a screwdriver, which they described as a potential “burglary tool.” But the jewelry didn’t match descriptions of stolen items, so administrators dropped the matter and instead suspended him for graffiti. At the time, police were carrying out a program aimed at sending fewer kids into the juvenile justice system, since outcomes are rarely good, so they gave Martin a break even though they could have arrested him for vandalism. It gets “weird,” the Sundance told Times Communities writer Joseph Cotto, after Martin’s death when police were compiling a report of his history with the department. The report about the jewelry “mysteriously vanished.” This could be because Martin wasn’t charged with anything, or it could be a concerted effort to hide the fact that Martin had a “propensity for violent confrontation.” Naturally, Cotto, Sundance and the folks at Fox Nation are convinced it was the latter. But the notion of a coverup is what’s really “weird,” considering the Miami Herald reported all of this in March of last year, citing, “a Miami-Dade Schools Police report obtained by The Miami Herald.” The details are identical and the paper even got a comment from Martin’s family’s attorney. “It’s completely irrelevant to what happened Feb. 26,” said attorney Benjamin Crump. “[His parents] never heard this, and don’t believe it’s true. If it were true, why wouldn’t they call the parents? Why wasn’t he arrested?” As the Herald reported: “No evidence ever surfaced that the jewelry was stolen.” But don’t let that get in the way of smearing a dead 17-year-old kid.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372797737127</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:42:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372797853297-101</Id><Title>The smearing of Rachel Jeantel</Title><Msg>The smearing of Rachel Jeantel So why is the star witness in the George Zimmerman case being treated like a defendant? By Mary Elizabeth Williams Rachel Jeantel is a 19-year-old Florida woman. On Facebook and Twitter, she’s been known to post photos of her nails and talk about drinking. She is also the last person to have spoken with Trayvon Martin before George Zimmerman shot him to death last year, the woman who was on the phone with him when his fateful encounter unfolded. She is known in the justice system as Witness #8 in Zimmerman’s trial. She is, in fact, the prosecution’s key witness. But you’d be forgiven if you’d gotten the impression recently that she was sitting up there to defend herself. Jeantel does not fit the comfortable image of the grieving girl. As Rachel Samara wrote Wednesday in Global Grind, “A predominantly white jury is not going to like Rachel Jeantel,” a girl “who has no media training and who is fully entrenched in a hostile environment.” There is confusion over whether or not she was Martin’s girlfriend, which eradicates her chances of being depicted as a devastated young quasi-widow. On the stand, she has been blunt, hostile and at times seemingly confused. Online, she has a documented history that includes partying. She is not thin or blond or demure. So there goes her credibility. This week, the Smoking Gun carefully picked through her social media history, uncovering such bombshells as a recent image of what she described as her “court nails.” She has posted photos of liquor bottles and declared that “wowww I need a drink” and tweeted “party time let get high” [sic]. The Smoking Gun also reports that she’s posted “a sexually suggestive series of photos,” “made references to Martin’s death, referred to acquaintances as #$%$’ and #$%$,’ and wrote about having ‘jack#$%$ lawyers on my #$%$.’” She has in recent days deleted several dozen of her more damning tweets. And so Smoking Gun commenters have, in their turn, declared that she’s not just a “thug” but “proof the gene pool NEEDS more chlorine!” … “and maybe some arsenic too.” Funnily enough, there’s no mention on the site that on Monday she also posted, “I’m a friend #$%$ it,” or that she loves Jill Scott and Janet Jackson. Here is what is true about Jeantel. She has publicly admitted to underage drinking and getting high. She is a poor speller (at least on social media). Her way with words is not calculated to win favor – she has testified that Martin told her “a creepy-#$%$ cracker” was following him. She has responded to the defense’s line of questioning with an icy “You got it?” and “That’s #$%$, sir.” The Daily News describes her diction as “often difficult-to-understand” and says it’s “cringe-worthy” and “humiliating” that she couldn’t read a letter out loud on the stand because she says, “I don’t read cursive.” Jeantel has also admitted to law enforcement that she lied about her initial claim that she didn’t attend Martin’s funeral because she was hospitalized at the time; she now says that she felt too “guilty” to face his parents and “didn’t want to see the body.” She admits that at the beginning of the investigation, she said she was under 18, because she didn’t want to get involved. She is unpolished and emotional. So is she a reliable witness? That’s yet to be determined. And watching her struggling to articulate “the sound of wet gr#$%$” to the jury, you can see not just her frustration but defense lawyer Don West’s undisguised exasperation. But when outlets like MSN gleefully seize upon the fact that she’s posting photographs of her nails, they invite exactly the kind of troubling and deeply offensive conclusions about what a #$%$,” what “ghetto trash,” what an “ugly ho” “buffalo” she is, that they have been racking up ad nauseam. Of course it’s the job of the defense to question her and cast doubt on her testimony. And of course it is significant that her version of events has varied. There’s a lot at stake. George Zimmerman decided Trayvon Martin’s fate on Feb. 26, 2012, and now a jury will decide his. A jury that, by the way, is part of a justice system that is not supposed to exclusively serve the best educated and most articulate of our citizenry. So now would be a good time to point out that Jeantel’s weight, her nails, her sex, her color – these things have precisely jack to do with her account of what happened the night Travyon Martin died. Justice is supposed to serve teenagers too, and people who party and who don’t hide it when they’re angry or flustered, and women who can’t read cursive. It’s supposed to serve people whose dialogue wasn’t written for them by David E. Kelley. Remember that. Remember that Rachel Jeantel is not the one on trial.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372797853297</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:44:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372798116724-102</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats need to win states like Texas and Kentucky, and fed-up women are the key</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372797560143</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:39:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Levon was a thug.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1372798116724</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:48:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372798151129-103</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats need to win states like Texas and Kentucky, and fed-up women are the key</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372797560143</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:39:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dems should either love it or leave it.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1372798151129</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:49:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372798218981-104</Id><Title>Polling: Majority of Texans and Americans Want Bans on Late-term Abortion</Title><Msg>A hearing on new Texas legislation banning abortions after five months has been scheduled for 3:30 pm ct.

The modern GOP is based on an unlikely coalition of wealthy business executives, small business owners, and struggling whites. Its durability depends on the latter two categories believing that the economic stresses they’ve experienced for decades have a lot to do with the government taking their money and giving it to the poor, who are disproportionately black and Latino. The real reason small business owners and struggling whites haven’t done better is the same most of the rest of America hasn’t done better: Although the output of Americans has continued to rise, almost all the gains have gone to the very top. Government is implicated, but not in the way wealthy Republicans want the other members of their coalition to believe. Laws that the GOP itself championed (too often with the complicity of some Democrats) have trammeled unions, invited outsourcing abroad, slashed taxes on the rich, encouraged takeovers, allowed monopolization, reduced the real median wage, and deregulated Wall Street. Four decades ago, the typical household’s income rose in tandem with output. But since the late 1970s, as these laws took hold, most Americans’ incomes have flattened. Had the real median household income continued to keep pace with economic growth it would now be almost $92,000 instead of $50,000. Obviously, wealthy Republicans would rather other members of their coalition not know any of this — including, especially, their role in making it happen. Their nightmare is small-business owners and struggling whites joining with the poor and the rest of the middle class to wrest economic power away. So they’ve created a convenient scapegoat in America’s minority underclass, along with a government that supposedly taxes hardworking whites to support them. This is where the five Republican appointees to the Supreme Court have played, and continue to play, such an important role. First, wealthy Republicans have to be able to spend as much money as possible to bribe lawmakers to do their bidding, tell their version of history, and promulgate several big lies (the poor are “takers not makers," government keeps them “dependent," the wealthy are “job-creators" so cutting their taxes creates more jobs, unions are bad, regulations reduce economic growth, and so on). The five Republicans on the Supreme Court have obliged by eviscerating campaign finance laws. Their 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, along with the broad interpretations given it by several appellate judges (also Republican appointees), has opened the money floodgates. Second, wealthy Republicans want to quietly reduce the impact of any laws that might limit their profits, even though they may help struggling whites as consumers or employees. The easiest way to execute this delicate maneuver is to make it harder to sue under such laws. Here, too, the five Republicans on the Court have been eager to oblige by tightening requirements for class actions and limiting standing to sue. In their recent Comcast Corp. v. Behrend decision, for example, they threw out $875 million in damages that a group of Philadelphia-area subscribers had sought from the cable giant, reasoning that the subscriber plaintiffs hadn’t proven they constituted a “class" for the purpose of a class action. Third and finally, wealthy Republicans want to minimize the votes of poor and minority citizens – and further propagate the myth that these people are responsible for the economic problems of struggling whites – through state redistricting and gerrymandering, voter-identification requirements at polling stations, and the use of almost any pretext to purge minority voters from voting lists. The five Republicans on the Court obliged last week by striking down a section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that sets the formula under which states with a long history of discrimination must ask the federal government or a judge for approval before changing their voting procedures. The significance of Shelby County, Alabama vs. Holder was made plain Thursday when the Court effectively nullified two cases involving Texas voter laws by sending them back to lower courts to reconsider in light of Shelby. One was a voter identification requirement, enacted in 2011, that a federal judge had rejected on grounds that it imposed a disproportionate burden on lower-income people, many of whom are minorities. The other was a redistricting plan, also rejected by a federal court, in part because it would block minorities from gaining a majority vote in almost all districts. But now both are effectively reinstated, as are the efforts of several other states to suppress votes. Supreme Court justices are appointed for life in order to ensure their independence from politics. But when it comes to the core political strategy of the Republican Party, the five Republican appointees are, in effect, an extension of the GOP.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372800661651</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 17:31:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372800912346-116</Id><Topic><Title>Paris Air Show- Vote on Boeing vs Airbus Stock Price</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1371247771854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 18:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope you got that cbx, I hope it helped you.. remember spartacus99991 is really neospart99 who has to get support from his hero , one of the guys that started the boeing message board to go other than Boeing user comments a long time ago, this is really the troll and chris genna message board mostly, you need to ask spartacus99991 about his wife as he mentions his personal life here and then ask him about California real estate a topic he discussed and then his stock IGZ that is really a test symbol for the stock market , he is a fool, spartacus9991 , he asked me not to mention his mistake hummm?and then have him talk to you about his career with MD and how he transferred to Boeing pension when Condit purchased the Bankrupt MD. after that remember another barker, domerrrr who is a troll, custerious , the barker who is not much more than a troll with attitude , then there is joe dokes45 and barbing a Boeing employee who will "not steer you wrong", Boeing is going to 150 well bark if you had been in Apple for the years I suggested it or ACAD for the year it took to make me 1200% or been in TSLA since I called it may 3 or the year to date its up 248%you would be very well off, But if you had been in Boeing instead of Airbus your not doing as well.

As if that's not enough, Perry gave a speech Thursday at the National Right to Life conference and used Davis' personal life as an example of someone who was "born into difficult circumstances," the daughter of a single mom and a teen mother herself. Think the world needs an alternative to media that just serves those in power? Click here to make a tax-deductible donation to Truthout and keep independent journalism strong. Perry's immediate need not just to argue with Wendy Davis and the people who stood with her but to shame them personally, to tell a crowd that "The louder they scream, the more we know that we are getting something done" is just the latest reminder of what this kind of anti-abortion politics is really about: power. It's not just a tactic to move toward banning abortion slowly, inch by inch, hoping that we don't notice our rights disappearing. This strategy of passing more and more restrictions on how and when and where and with whose permission one can obtain an abortion is itself a method of demonstrating and reiterating power over our bodies; it's a sharp reminder that they exercise this power largely because they can. Because as members of a privileged class - economically and politically as well as by virtue of race and gender - they will wield that power, not for our own good but in spite of our desires, and the more we scream the more pleasure they take in their victory. The discipline, Perry's comment shows, is the point. Perry, and his comrade-in-sadism Paul Ryan, aren't just anti-abortionists, of course. They're also big fans of punishing and controlling the poor - usually imagined, often not entirely correctly, as non-white people. Ryan has proposed drastic cuts to Social Security, wanted to turn Medicare into a voucher program, and just last week voted to support an amendment that would boot people off food assistance if they can't find a job; Perry wants to drug test the unemployed and recipients of food stamps and presided over the largest cuts to public education since World War II. And of course, the granddaddy of today's vicious, sadistic politics is Newt Gingrich, about to be launched back into our living rooms via CNN's resurrected Crossfire program. Americans remember him recently telling us that low-income children should work as janitors in schools and should remember him, too, as the driving force behind the 1990s welfare "reform" signed and promoted by Bill Clinton. Welfare reform is perhaps the perfect policy to demonstrate where these issues come together. The Gingriches of the world would deny low-income parents the right to plan their families, and then would punish them for having families at all by forcing them into dead-end low-wage jobs, all the while beating them up rhetorically as well for not being the kind of full-time parents that conservatives dream of. Reproduction is always another pathway to punishment. And we shouldn't forget that the night before Perry spoke these words, he presided over Texas' 500th execution since resuming capital punishment in 1982 - of a woman, Kimberly McCarthy, convicted of the 1997 murder of her neighbor during a robbery. Perry's been in charge of more than half of those 500 executions - 261, to be exact - over the course of his three terms as governor, more than any other governor in the country. In consensual S&amp;M, the exchange of power, the restriction of freedom down to what a dominant allows, is done for pleasure, for boundary-pushing. It's about control willingly given up - without that willingness, play violence turns real. The thrill is seeing how far you can go, not in actually being abused. In the game that Perry and his comrades are playing, there has been no informed consent; there is no safe-word we can use to stop the pain, and the "no" of thousands of Texas women is just an excuse to try it again. We may think we see the psychosexual glint in Perry's eye when he talks about women "screaming," but what he reveals is much bigger than a personal kink - it's the connections between sadistic economic policy, sadistic reproductive health policy (if you can call it that) and sadistic "justice" policy. These issues are of a piece, and the piece is control. Many of us like to point out that abortion is an economic issue, and this is certainly true, but what Perry shows us is that even economic policy is about more than money. It's not enough that unemployment remains high and the people in Texas who are finding jobs are largely finding them in low-wage, no-security industries; no, he has to keep finding ways to turn the rack. A thoroughly cowed working class that has to beg for scraps is less likely to rise up and exercise its own power when the punishment for doing so grows ever harsher. Those of us who've spent time in and around the labor movement know that the boss is often willing to grant workers a raise if they'll give up their demands for a union - giving up a bit of power and control to the workers is infinitely more threatening to bosses than money. They regularly shell out plenty of cash to anti-union "consultants" to make sure their underlings remain suitably scared. The question is not money, but power. Take this line of thought a step further and include this week's Voting Rights Act ruling, a question purely and honestly of power - not fairness or rights but of political power. State governments - like Rick Perry's Texas - have gone about redistricting to draw bright slashes through communities of color that could exercise power at the ballot box by acting together to send representatives that actually speak for them to the legislature. They're deliberately attacking the concentrated political power of those communities. Perry also pushed for and signed into law (in another "emergency" session; taking away rights is often an "emergency" for Perry) a voter ID bill that made "illegal voting" a felony, required one of five acceptable forms of picture ID, and was of course decried as racist by representatives whose districts are largely populated by people of color. The same people whose voting rights are being attacked are the ones who face incarceration and execution at hugely disproportionate rates, and they are the ones who will suffer the most if Perry's anti-abortion bill makes it through. Those of us who don't fit into the categories singled out for special punishment are supposed to be grateful that we're better off, and keep voting the Perrys and Dewhursts and Ryans into office. It works more often than most of us would like to admit. Texas' new district maps are legal now unless Congress - the current makeup of which is itself the result of gerrymandering that allowed a Republican majority to hold without holding a majority of the votes - acts. Of course, Perry can't gerrymander the state's borders (yet) and it's there that we might hold out hope for change. He might be able to redistrict Wendy Davis out of her seat, but if Texans decide to fight back, maybe they can put her - or someone like her - in his job. The only way to beat Perry and his ilk is to be as merciless with them as they would be with us. Organize, shut them down, and throw them out.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372801078195</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 17:37:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372801851140-118</Id><Topic><Title>Are you Democrats and RINOs Opposed to lower Taxes?</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1372772838792</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 09:47:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You and most other True Believers toss that word around a lot.

He doesn't even know that the official symbol for EADS is EAD.PA. And he calls himself a stock trader. With his "$28M" gain from AAPL he could be the one who is buying up to 4000 shares ($200K) in the morning and selling the same 4000 shares in the afternoon. Talk about manipulating a market. BTW, until about 10:00 AM this morning EADSY had traded exactly ZERO shares (same as IGZ). I guess Wayne might have been taking a break from trading EADSY. HarHarHar P.S. The market didn't close early today and how's the hydro racing going with your "friends"? P.P.S. And how's that patent application coming with a "giant step forward in aerospace technology".

It is odd that no aerospace of big shot has figured it out. There are two very great aerospace guys in the eastern Washington and Northern Idaho area. I will patent the idea first. I might share when I visit them. I know Forrest Bird , he is a innovator that could help me get it going . Burt Rutan is in Coeur-d-Alene Idaho I go there just about every day". Wayne, 6/24/13 and a little later today: "I know Boeing management and know the problems and probably will sell an invention soon that will be a giant step forward in aerospace technology, not the baby steps of lighter weight planes that is so lame."

The smallest award, for $7.7 million, is a firm-fixed-price, foreign military sales contract to provide "sustainment services" for Apache AH-64D attack helicopters operated by the Dutch military. A second award, for $15.4 million, also concerns foreign military sales, calling on Boeing to supply Apache Block III helos to Saudi Arabia. As for the largest of the three awards, it, too, is a foreign military sales contract -- and like the second contract, it relates to Saudi Arabia. Boeing was awarded a $109.5 million modification, increasing the value of a previously awarded firm-fixed-price, foreign military sales contract to provide services in support of the Royal Saudi Land Force Aviation Command. DoD notes that the total value of this FMS contract is now approaching $395 million.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1372815771857</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 21:42:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372821629687-135</Id><Topic><Title>Michele Thinks She Lives in a Prison</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1372780707989</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:58:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Laura Bush was there, nodding and agreeing and laughing along on a talk show.
