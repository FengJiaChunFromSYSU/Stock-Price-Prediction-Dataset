While we have all seen various polls demonstrating the general public’s complete opposition to unprovoked military aggression against Syria, I hadn’t seen a survey focused on military members until now. The results are not good for the establishment. From the Military Times: To the list of skeptics who question the need for air strikes against Syria, add an another unlikely group — many U.S. troops. “I haven’t heard one single person be supportive of it,” said an Army staff sergeant at Fort Hood who asked not to be identified by name. A Military Times survey of more than 750 active-duty troops this week found service members oppose military action in Syria by a margin of about three to one. The survey conducted online Monday and Tuesday found that about 75 percent of troops are not in favor of air strikes in response to reports that the Syrian government used chemical weapons to kill civilians in that country.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1379161650886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-14 08:27:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379161771758-28</Id><Title>Military Times Survey 75% of Military does not support strike on Syria</Title><Msg>It’s always a good sign for an empire’s fortunes when the commander in chief of the armed forces completely loses the confidence and trust of the troops. “I haven’t heard one single person be supportive of it,” said an Army staff sergeant at Fort Hood who asked not to be identified by name.

Boeing, which is developing the KC-46A tanker using its 767 commercial airliner, is responsible for all costs exceeding the development-stage contract’s $4.9 billion ceiling, the Air Force said. Next the contract is fixed so any over cost is paid by Boeing shareholders , not the government and we all know the 787 a hard money job is several billion over cost, no reason to think MD outsourcing will make a very slim profit margin , all bowing wanted to do was keep the better plane Airbus out. So the 767 will never make a dime in profit. Airbus made sure by making a very low bid to do the job , in effect killing any profit for bowing then backing out and laughing while they develop their factory for their highly profitable civilian plane on Americn soil d-pooch we are glad you are our of the air force now your too stupid to be on the GI pay. The new, higher estimate was disclosed in response to an inquiry about the latest cost projections for what’s planned as a 179-aircraft, $51.7 billion program including research, production and aircraft support. “The government’s projection of Boeing’s potential liability has increased to about $700 million,” Air Force spokesman Charles Gulick said in a statement. “Government liability is capped,” and any additional “financial liability is completely borne by Boeing.” The Air Force said its estimate of the cost to complete the development contract is $5.6 billion, up from the $5.3 billion projected in 2011 in the service’s annual cost report to Congress.

Now the reality ,dpooch, The AIRBUS Mobile, Ala., factory - due to start up in 2015 -is expected to employ 1,000 people when it reaches full production two years later. The new $600 million plant will make A320 passenger jets, which compete head-to-head with Boeing's 737.

The fact that it took a Democrat of all people to get bin Laden speaks volumes. - The near total collapse of the U.S. banking industry and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, which caused millions of Americans to lose their job, their home and wiped out trillions of dollars of American's wealth. - A massive expansion of Medicare via the Medicare Prescription Drug Program. I thought you guys hated that kind of thing. Apparently it's okay if a Republican does it. - Passage of sweeping tax cuts during wartime (1st time ever in U.S. history I believe), which erased a federal budget surplus that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would pay off the entire U.S. debt in less than a decade and that primarily benefited the wealthy. - Putting a "hack" with absolutely no disaster experience in charge of FEMA, which led to the botched response to hurricane Katrina.
