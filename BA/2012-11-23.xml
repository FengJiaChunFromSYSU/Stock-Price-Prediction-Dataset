(BA) is poised for its largest dividend increase since the financial crisis, returning cash to investors as it tries to bolster a stock price hurt by delays to its 787 Dreamliner jets. The quarterly payout may rise 9.1 percent to 48 cents a share next month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 4.8 percent boost last year and no change in 2010, and would be the most for Chicago-based Boeing since a 14 percent jump in December 2007.”</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353649028179</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 00:37:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353650766290-3</Id><Topic><Title>Does the Boeing airplane delivery number mean anything, how about the 5 year dividend and stock pric</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353649028179</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 00:37:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BA is doing the same thring re dividends as most companies- boosting this year to avoid taxes next year both for company and shareholders. expect next year divs to be much lower.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1353650766290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 01:06:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353651792360-4</Id><Topic><Title>Does the Boeing airplane delivery number mean anything, how about the 5 year dividend and stock pric</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353649028179</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 00:37:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don, if right then foulmoutharbor is incorrect on his reason (claimed reason) that Boeing is potntially increasing the dividend to make up for share price loss due to the 787 failure on cost to deliver and late delivery. According to you then don, the increase in dividend ( potential) from Boeing is realted to taxation , not any attempt to make up for the 21% decrese over five years in stock price. So if you are a buy and hold investor then boeing would in any case not be good for the lat 5 years as your principal amount would be down . For example to use round numbers a $100,000.00 investment in Boeing stock five years ago today would be work $79,000.00 and the annual yearly divident of $1.76 per share would be less than $3.08 per share if you were invested in McDonalds. BTW that original $100,000.00 invested in McDoanlds would be worth $147,000.00 today too. So in any event foulmoutharbor is wrong on using airplane deliveries as any good indicator of Boeing investment. Since it has never been a indicator of stock or divident price. It is a sales gimmic used by foulmoutharbor, similiar to the old sales technique of listing how many Big Mac's were sold, interesting but to any investor in BA or MCD worthless and it does point to foulmooutharbors stock investing opinion and how valuable they are .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353651792360</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 01:23:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353654612300-5</Id><Topic><Title>Does the Boeing airplane delivery number mean anything, how about the 5 year dividend and stock pric</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353649028179</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 00:37:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You do realize the fallicy of using $ amounts for comparing dividends versus percentages?</Msg><Username>neospart99</Username><Timestamp>1353654612300</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 02:10:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353659981993-6</Id><Topic><Title>Does the Boeing airplane delivery number mean anything, how about the 5 year dividend and stock pric</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353649028179</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 00:37:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Neospart99 The new yahoo message board is now tuned into TOS violations, so your past behavior is limited TOS violations do include; ignoring the question" to divert argument to unrelated issues making the argument personal (argumentum ad hominem) and discrediting the opposition's character, "begging the question" (petitio principi), the use of the non-sequitur, false cause and effect (post hoc ergo propter hoc), bandwagoning (everyone says so), the "false dilemma" or "either-or fallacy" in which the situation is oversimplified, "card-stacking" or selective use of facts, "false equivalence", and "false analogy".

Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., broke ranks with other conservatives Wednesday when he made the remarks to a local television station. Chambliss is a member of the Gang of Six, a bipartisan group of senators tasked with finding a solution to the country's fiscal woes. "I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge," he told WMAZ-TV. "If we do it his way then we’ll continue in debt, and I just have a disagreement with him about that." Congress and the White House face a year-end deadline to reach a deal that staves off an avalanche of tax increases and deep cuts in government programs – commonly referred to now as the “fiscal cliff.” Chambliss signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, authored by conservative activist Grover Norquist and embraced by the majority of congressional Republican lawmakers. In it, Norquist, an anti-tax lobbyist and head of Americans for Tax Reform, does not allow for tax rates to rise. Those who sign the pledge "solemnly bind themselves to oppose any and all tax increases," according to the group’s website, which states that 39 senators, including Chambliss, and 219 House members support it. Chambliss acknowledged that distancing himself from the pledge might hurt him in his bid for re-election in 2014, but said he's not concerned about it. "I don't worry about that because I care too much about my country,” he said. “I care a lot more about it than I do Grover Norquist." "I'm willing to do the right thing and let the political consequences take care of themselves,” Chambliss added. A senior aide to Chambliss confirmed the accuracy of his remarks to Fox News. Obama campaigned on a pledge to end the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for households making more than $250,000 a year. Republican leaders say the lower rates from 2001 and 2003 should remain in place for everyone, including the rich. Both sides have dug in so deeply that it will be politically painful to back down. Republicans say tax increases on the rich would inhibit job growth. Democrats dispute that, and say it's only fair for the wealthiest to provide more revenue in this era of historically low tax burdens and a growing income disparity between the rich and the poor. The federal budget cuts would begin Jan. 2, part of a deal reached by Congress after failing to agree on a more measured solution to reducing the federal deficit. The cuts would total roughly $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years, including $65 billion just in 2013. Most Republican lawmakers have signed a pledge not to allow tax rates to rise, even if they are scheduled to do so by law, as are the Bush-era cuts. Some Democrats say it may be necessary to let the Dec. 31 deadline expire and have everyone's tax rates revert to the higher, pre-Bush levels. Then, the argument goes, Republicans could vote to bring the rates back down for most Americans, but not the richest, without breaking their pledge. The tax rate issue is especially thorny because it doesn't lend itself to Washington's favorite tactics of postponing hard decisions. Lawmakers routinely resort to "continuing resolutions" to end budget impasses by keeping spending levels unchanged for yet another year. Politically, no one wins or loses. Obama's campaign promise to raise tax rates on the wealthy precludes that. Either rates on the rich will rise and Republicans will absorb defeat on a huge priority, or the rates will remain unchanged, a political defeat for Obama.</Msg><Username>ahkmed_the_id_homo</Username><Timestamp>1353695577844</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:32:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353696885198-20</Id><Topic><Title>20 of us agreed over Thankgiving Obama never intended to balance the budget...he pretends with Tax the Rich $240K</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1353690995118</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 12:16:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now you get it.

Did the Republicans "lose" (at least at the Presidential level) because of: 1. The Republican message 2. Mitt Romney 3. The shift in American values I suspect, all apply, but more profoundly, number three. We know that the Democrats for example in 2008 simply hinted at abortion relative to a "woman's right to choose". But, for 2012, it is more explicit and it is wide open - that it, that a woman should have the right to choose and "no individual or government" should have anything to say or do about it. Further, there should not be any financial impediments (meaning government funding as necessary). During this period, the Democrats, with leadership from the President, declared that marriage can be with the same sex. Both of these issues are discussed in the Bible as being sinful, but also they have simply been anathema to Republicans. If these issues are paramount, and it appears to be as that is the consistent message during the 2012 campaign, that then presents a dilemma for Republicans. Do they shift left or go away? The American people will chose which direction they will go. I am simply suggesting that what we saw in the 2012 election is not the direction that will please God, but instead invoke His anger.

They were not very FORWARD! in their ways, and as typically happens to a so-called “civilization” when it’s based on capitalism, the Pilgrims began to starve*. Their peaceful and friendly neighboring Native American collective – in spite of the Pilgrims’ racist encroachment upon their sacred land – took pity upon the starving Pilgrims one Thursday in November and brought them bountiful food and drink (including several turkeys, although the Native Americans didn’t eat the turkeys themselves, due to their being peaceful vegans who respect all Life). The Native American collective had, of course, more food than they could eat, as is always the case when you spread the wealth around, so they gladly donated some of their bounty to the poor capitalist Pilgrims, who otherwise were in great danger of starving to death. As the years went by, and the Pilgrims branched out to occupy more and more Native American land – slaughtering the peaceful, harmonious Native peoples as they went – the occupiers nevertheless felt a small twinge of guilt from time to time, and they decided to honor the benevolent Native Americans one day a year (leaving 364 days to slaughter, imprison, encroach upon, infect, and otherwise take advantage of and oppress them). They called the day “Thanksgiving”, to thank the few remaining Native Americans still living for saving their lives** on that cold day one November. So today we honor the memory of those generous Native Americans and their life saving gift of food to the starving Pilgrims with a recurring national holiday, Thanksgiving. And it is in that spirit – the Great Spirit of the Native Americans – that I here and now wish everyone reading this a Happy Thanksgiving! -------- * Pay no attention to the Rethugglikkkan rumor that the Pilgrims actually began their stay in North America in a somewhat communistic way, pooling all of their produce and game for the good of the community – this is an obvious racist lie ** Pay no attention to the Rethugglikkkan rumor that the “Thanks” were actually given to “God”, or that the Pilgrims actually invited the Native Americans to share in THEIR bounty – yet another obvious racist lie</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1353730823337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 23:20:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353731602651-36</Id><Topic><Title>Thanksgiving: The Korrekt Version</Title><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1353730823337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 23:20:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fractured fairy tales.</Msg><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1353731602651</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 23:33:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
