Boeing wrote a fairly rigorous testing process for Lithium batteries for the FAA as an industry consultant and then decided not to follow it since it was not formally approved when the 787 was ready for certification. That turned out to be a bad decision and now they are doing the testing they should have in the first place as part of their plan to get the planes back in the air. Per techpath2000. From this point, Boeing had at least 3 years to test but lost sight of the vendors and had so many other out sourcing problems Boeing can only fix after the problems present themselves , Boeing is not the originator of the 787 engineering just the specifications. . Boeing is not in control of the engineering or the parts making process that was outsourced Boeing is responsible for the results of the problems, such as late fees, any crashes , airline revenue loss, and the perception by the flying public the plane is unsafe . . The 777 was not a high electric power drain machine it used cables and hydraulics and nicad batteries, which are 90% less powerful. The 787 does not in need of the lithium ion battery for weight savings, that is a small difference compared to the total weight of the 787, the real issue is the plane needs the extra power of a lithium ion battery , they have 90% more power and the 787 is a electric power sucking machine . Next the time and delay for a redesign and start over on certification is a issue too. This would be unexplored territory like the Boeing CEO on the 787 roll out said the 787 would be flying in a couple of months it was more like a couple of years . So that was with an existing certification process a do over is unknown for time and cost</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1364020024771</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 02:27:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364021290451-7</Id><Topic><Title>Custerisis on translation please or how I can be a Boeing hack</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1364000002319</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 20:53:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"you can continue to make while tarmac covers for the field" What does this mean, Dell?

An investor does not care for history, here is the stock price appreciation for Boeing Year to date. Boeing stock price has gained as of today's close 12.5%. Airbus has a gain of 35.46% for the year to date . For a long term look Boeing, stock price is up a pathetic 16.21% as of today's close for 3 years. Since you suggested if I want to invest in Airbus I should go there, I have another Boeing related stock market investment fact for you . rs2ms2ts2ks72, considering the Dow Jones average for 3 years is up 32.81% and Boeing is one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones as an investor rs2ms2ts2ks 72 your not doing a good job with Boeing! rs2ms2ts2ks72, in fact, if your an investor you should have been out of Boeing 3 years ago. Airbus stock price appreciation , as of the close of the stock market today for 3 years is up 161.75% these are CNN money stock chart numbers so as an investor why are you pointing backward to the pre MD Chicago real Seattle Based Boeing accomplishments ? In the 1960 era Boeing stock was at one time about 180 dollars when it was a Washington based company that did not outsource and did 100% of their engineering in Washington State but that too is history and as an investor ,you claim? what is your point then rs2ms2ts2ks72?

The University of Chicago-based lab where Obama spoke has partnered with a company to develop batteries for electric vehicles. However, the stimulus-funded manufacturing facility that was supposed to produce the batteries—themselves the product of stimulus subsidies for research and development—has yet to furnish a single one. The president’s green energy proposal calls for using revenues from oil and gas lease sales to fund an additional $2 billion in subsidies for green energy projects. Obama outlined the plan in more detail at a speech Friday afternoon at DOE’s Argonne National Laboratory at the University of Chicago, which received more than $200 million in stimulus subsidies and contracts for electric vehicle research, among other projects. Argonne worked with the company LG Chem Michigan in 2011 to produce electric vehicle batteries. The lab provided its patented design for those batteries to the company, which was supposed to manufacture them at its Holland, Mich., plant. That plant received a $151 million stimulus grant, covering half the costs of its construction. According to the Energy Department’s inspector general, as of last month the plant had yet to produce a single battery that could be used to power electric vehicles. LG Chem cited poor demand for Chevrolet’s electric car, the Volt, as the cause of its lackluster manufacturing performance. The Argonne design was specifically intended for use in the Volt. Instead of producing batteries, the IG found, workers at the Holland plant were paid to play video games, watch movies, and volunteer at local nonprofit groups. Neither LG Chem nor Argonne returned requests for comment.

The FAA is planning to close down the air control tower at the airport. Renton is a municipal airport. If they close the FAA tower, planes can still use the airport just like any other airport without a tower.There are procedures those ariports use every day for takeoffs and landings. Whether Renton loses the tower remains to be seen. Given the use of the airport by Boeing for all the 737 flights, I suspect the city and state of washington will strongly object. But if those objections fail, Boeing will still be able to use the field. But it adds pressure to move the operation out of washington and that is something the city and state do not want.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1364061979073</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 14:06:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364062203137-33</Id><Topic><Title>Layoffs at SC plnt?

We'd like to know too. Freshman California Republican Doug LaMalfa and 14 of his House colleagues, who signed on to his March 5 letter, are asking the Department of Homeland Security to explain why it is buying 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition of various calibers. They aren't happy with explanations provided so far in the press by lower-level officials, answers meant to debunk "unfounded" concerns. As we have noted, DHS has been buying lots of ammo, enough by one calculation to fight the equivalent of a 24-year Iraqi War. Peggy Dixon, spokeswoman for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga., told the Associated Press that the training center and others like it run by the Homeland Security Department use as many as 15 million rounds every year, mostly on shooting ranges and in training exercises. The massive purchases are said to be spread out over five years and due simply to the best practice of saving money by buying in bulk what comes down to five rounds of ammo for every man, woman and child on the U.S. That's a lot of practice and training. A good portion of the 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition are being purchased by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal government's second-largest criminal investigative agency. Yes that's the same ICE that is releasing detained criminal illegal aliens onto our streets because of sequestration cuts. Jonathan Lasher, the Social Security Administration's assistant inspector general for external relations, explained the purchase of 174,000 hollow-point bullets by saying they were for the Social Security inspector general's office, which has about 295 agents who investigate Social Se</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1364090881972</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 22:08:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364090909943-67</Id><Topic><Title>Ray Conneer the Bull with $ / Ray LaHood the Bear with Power punch.</Title><Username>meinfdia</Username><Timestamp>1364085287723</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 20:34:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ray the Bear with power punch will win.</Msg><Username>nicehereinca1</Username><Timestamp>1364090909943</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 22:08:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364091264879-68</Id><Topic><Title>Ray Conneer the Bull with $ / Ray LaHood the Bear with Power punch.</Title><Username>meinfdia</Username><Timestamp>1364085287723</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 20:34:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What goes up must come down.
