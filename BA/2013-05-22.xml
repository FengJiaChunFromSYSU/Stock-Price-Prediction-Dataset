The mainstream media never talks about that. They are much too busy covering the latest dogfights in Washington and what Justin Bieber has been up to. And most Americans seem to think that if the Dow keeps setting new all-time highs that everything must be okay. Sadly, that is not the case at all. Right now, the U.S. economy is exhibiting all of the classic symptoms of a bubble economy. You can see this when you step back and take a longer-term view of things. Over the past decade, we have added more than 10 trillion dollars to the national debt. But most Americans have shown very little concern as the balance on our national credit card has soared from 6 trillion dollars to nearly 17 trillion dollars. Meanwhile, Wall Street has been transformed into the biggest casino on the planet, and much of the new money that the Federal Reserve has been recklessly printing up has gone into stocks. But the Dow does not keep setting new records because the underlying economic fundamentals are good. Rather, the reckless euphoria that we are seeing in the financial markets right now reminds me very much of 1929. Margin debt is absolutely soaring, and every time that happens a crash rapidly follows. But this time when a crash happens it could very well be unlike anything that we have ever seen before. The top 25 U.S. banks have more than 212 trillion dollars of exposure to derivatives combined, and when that house of cards comes crashing down there is no way that anyone will be able to prop it back up. After all, U.S. GDP for an entire year is only a bit more than 15 trillion dollars. But most Americans are only focused on the short-term because the mainstream media is only focused on the short-term. Things are good this week and things were good last week, so there is nothing to worry about, right? Unfortunately, economic reality i</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369224715612</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 08:11:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369224853092-7</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369181763080</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 20:16:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bill Maher Quote: "The planet is too crowded and we need to promote death" For those who are wondering what the socialist agenda is....yet AGAIN another example of Eugenics thinking</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369224853092</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 08:14:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369225447761-8</Id><Title>DOJ Overreaches In Effort to Shut down and Intimidate Freedom of the Press</Title><Msg>DOJ Monitored Phone Lines of Five Fox News Reporters, Fox News Executives and Family Members of Reporters Last night on Fox News' Special Report, anchor Bret Baier revealed that the Department of Justice not only secretly monitored the phone lines of Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen, but of his parents as well. Ronald C. Machen, Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, who is prosecuting the case, has seized records associated with two phone numbers at the White House, at least five numbers associated with Fox News, and one that has the same area code and exchange as Rosen’s personal-cell-phone number (the last four numbers are redacted). Yesterday, the Washington Post reported that, as part of the investigation of the Kim leak, Obama’s Department of Justice seized e-mails from Rosen’s personal Gmail account. In the search warrant for that request, the government described Rosen as “an aider, and abettor, and / or co-conspirator” in violating the Espionage Act, noting that the crime can be punished by ten years in prison. Rosen was not indicted in the case, but the suggestion in a government document that a reporter could be guilty of espionage for engaging in routine reporting is unprecedented and has alarmed many journalists and civil libertarians. The document uncovered today suggests the government seized “call detail” records from Rosen’s work and cell phones, which would show whom he called, who called him, how long they spoke, and the times of the calls. The document suggests that the government was seeking only the subscriber records for the two White House numbers targeted, information that a government source said would include the name of the official who used the specific line.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1369225447761</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 08:24:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369225633774-9</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Exemplifies Fears of Our Founding Fathers</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1368722173628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:36:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well Raven...you remember that when America loses World Reserve Currency status and all the Fiat money is worthless and we go "Weimar Republic" or "Zimbabwe" ...that's IF you can get to your money when the Government declares Bank "Holidays"....happens EVERY SINGLE TIME..in world history.

U.S. drugs maker Actavis (ACT) announced on Monday that it is to acquire rival Warner Chilcott in a transaction valued at approximately $8.5 billion. In the same press release it said the combined company would be incorporated in Ireland, where Warner Chilcott is currently domiciled. Ireland, with its 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, has attracted attention in recent days with accusations that Apple (AAPL) used its international operations unit in Ireland to reduce its tax liability. Apple hit back saying Tuesday that it doesn't use "tax gimmicks" and the company is set to pay more than $7 billion in U.S. taxes in the fiscal year. (Read More: Tax Evasion Dangerous for Europe: Schulz ) "We pay all the taxes we owe - every single dollar," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in testimony in front of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee. The investigation by the subcommittee revealed on Monday that Apple had paid just a 2 percent tax rate on $74 billion of income from overseas.

That the “war on terror” is never going to end. Indeed, it was never supposed to end. This never-ending “war” on a fantastical enemy provides the American oligarch class with too much money and too much power to ever make it worthwhile for the establishment to shut down. It matters not to them that this civil liberties destroying fraud has been going on for my entire post-college life and, if they have their way, for the remainder of it. It matters not to them that the “war on terror” itself has done more to destroy the Constitution and vital essence of this nation than any terrorist act ever could. No, it matters very little indeed. What matters to them is money and power, and the “war on terror” provides them with boatloads of both.” - Oceania has always been at war with Eur-Asia. War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery.

One critical question was how Obama spent that long night of Sept. 11, 2012, while his charges were busy dying in Benghazi. “With all due respect,” asked Wallace, “you didn’t answer my question. What did the president do that night?” This was a good question and one that prompts a careful look at the time line. At 3:40 p.m. Washington time on Sept. 11, 2012, U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens in Benghazi called his No. 2 man, Greg Hicks, and told him, “We’re under attack.” (All times cited will be EDT, six hours earlier than Libyan time). At 4:05 p.m. the State Department Operations Center issued an alert to all relevant agencies, “U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi Under Attack.” At 4:25 p.m. a six-member CIA team headed by Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods arrived at Stevens’ compound from the nearby annex. Under heavy fire, Woods’ team recovered the body of Foreign Service IT specialist Sean Smith but could not find Stevens’ body in the burning building. At 5 p.m. President Barack Obama had a pre-scheduled meeting with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who briefed him on the Benghazi situation. At 6 p.m. Woods and his CIA team arrived back at the annex, which they would defend Alamo-style for the next six hours. They would kill an estimated 60 Libyans before the night was through. At 6:07 p.m. the State Department Operations Center shared a report from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli that Ansar al-Sharia had claimed responsibility for the Benghazi attack. The terror group also called for an attack on the Embassy in Tripoli.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369233994242</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:46:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369234064251-40</Id><Topic><Title>What did Obama do on the Night of September 11 of /2012 ?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369233994242</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:46:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At 7:30 p.m. or thereabouts Obama engaged in an hour-long phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Obama hoped to mend fences with Netanyahu to help secure the Jewish vote in the upcoming election. After roughly 8:30 p.m., there is no known accounting of Obama’s time or whereabouts. At 11:15 p.m. Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, another former SEAL, were killed in a mortar assault at the annex. Doherty had just arrived as part of a six-man team from Tripoli. At 1:40 a.m., having evacuated the annex, the first group of Americans flew out of Benghazi bound for Tripoli. They saw Stevens’ body at the airport and confirmed his death. Said Pfeiffer to Wallace when asked about Obama’s evening, “He was in constant touch with his national security team and kept up to date with the events as they were happening.” Wallace then listed all the critical people with whom Obama had little or no conversation – the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the joint chiefs.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369234064251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:47:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369234097233-41</Id><Topic><Title>End the Term Limit for Presidents !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369230750505</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 09:52:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>our last three term president FDR used his gov't make work programs to similarly intimidate opponents and tried to rid the supreme court of older justices persumably to make room for more justices like his KKK appointment hugo black who invented the wall between church and state</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1369234097233</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:48:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369234118751-42</Id><Topic><Title>What did Obama do on the Night of September 11 of /2012 ?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369233994242</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:46:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pfeiffer clarified, “He was talking to his national security staff, his National Security Council – people who would keep him up to date as these things were happening.” “Was he in the situation room?” Wallace asked. “I don’t remember what room he was in that night,” said Pfeiffer. “That’s a largely irrelevant fact.” No, it is not irrelevant at all. I cannot say for sure where Obama was that evening, but if the night of July 17, 1996, set a precedent, Obama was likely in the White House family quarters. For the record, at 8:35 p.m. on that turbulent night in the election year of 1996, President Bill Clinton and wife Hillary left a Washington fundraiser and headed back to the White House by motorcade. At 8:31 p.m., two FAA veterans at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center observed a target arching and intersecting with Paris-bound TWA Flight 800 as it headed east off Long Island’s south shore. A manager from that center rushed the radar data to the FAA technical center in Atlantic City, and from there it was faxed to FAA headquarters in Washington and rushed “immediately” to the White House situation room. It was in this room, “in the aftermath of the TWA Flight 800 bombing,” as Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos unwittingly told Peter Jennings on Sept. 11, 2001, that all key parties converged. “This looks bad,” said Ron Schleede of the National Transportation Safety Board upon first seeing the data that “suggested something fast made the turn and took the airplane.” Anti-terror czar Richard Clarke got the message too. By 9 p.m., he was driving in to the White House to convene a meeting of his security group, not at all the norm for a plane crash. “I dreaded what I thought was about to happen,” Clarke wrote in his best-seller “Against All Enemies.” Clarke called it “The Eisenhower option,” a retaliatory strike against Iran. When President Clinton met with friendly historian Taylor Branch on Aug. 2, 1996, he also traced the TWA 800 disaster to Iran. “They want</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369234118751</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:48:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369234257224-43</Id><Topic><Title>IRS official will invoke 5th Amendment !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369170653501</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 17:10:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so now you want to give up George....

On the night of July 17, however, the president chose not to join Clarke and the other agency representatives in the situation room. Clinton remained holed up in the family quarters with Hillary. Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Robert “Buzz” Patterson and others have confirmed the president’s location that evening. Patterson was in a position to know. He carried the nuclear football for the president, and he too was in the White House that night, though purposefully kept out of the loop. The one person Patterson has tentatively cited as being in the family quarters with the Clintons is Sandy Berger, the deputy director of the NSA and the Clintons’ political consigliere. As it happened, National Security Adviser Tony Lake, Sandy Berger’ boss, was not invited to the family quarters. Lake was known to excuse himself from meetings when they turned political. That night Berger and the Clintons gathered information from the FAA radar, from the satellite data and from the eyewitness accounts and translated the data into electoral strategy. By 3 a.m. Clinton had apparently gathered enough information to call Lake with the following message: “Dust off the contingency plans.” Dust them off, yes, but let’s not get too serious about them. In late summer 1996, with the election comfortably in the bag, war was the last thing the Clintons wanted or needed. On Sept. 11, 2012, war was the last thing Obama wanted or needed as well. He had already bagged Osama bin Laden, pacified al-Qaida and liberated Libya. Or so he repeated endlessly. Foreign policy was alleged to be his electoral strong suit. Given the political dynamics, Obama likely retreated, just as the Clintons had, to the family quarters. As Pfeiffer said, Obama probably did talk to “people who would keep him up to date as these things were happening.” Oba</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369234275631</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:51:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369234320280-45</Id><Topic><Title>What did Obama do on the Night of September 11 of /2012 ?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369233994242</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:46:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who would keep him up to date as these things were happening.” Obama and certain of these people, the political insiders, would have spent the night translating national security data into electoral strategy. After all, Obama had a big fundraiser the next day in Vegas. That did not allow much time to establish an alibi that would preserve his carefully crafted bin Laden-slayer narrative. It was a close call, but with a little help from the media – a special shout-out to CNN’s Candy Crowley! – the alibi worked just well enough to get the man re-elected. History does repeat itself.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369234320280</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:52:00

"I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules and regulations. I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee." 2. "I assert my constitutional right not to testify or answer questions related to the subject matter of this hearing." Yet, the IRS Inspector General said that someone or some persons have violated the rules, ethics and laws regarding IRS regulations and tax process. Since she was the head of the group that is under investigation, and since she is profoundly innocent, as she claims, it would seem logical that she would be happy to help the American people determine what was done wrong, where it took place, even who participated in the wrong doing that has been admitted by the IRS. And for which the IRS has issued an apology. With her key testimony, it is clear that we could move on. Another approach is to get the personnel list and start hauling everyone before Congress, clerks, supervisors, and managers and ask them the questions that Lois Lerner refuses to answer - because she is profoundly innocent. But, that is why Ms. Lerner has received $100K+ in bonuses these past three years. She was the leader; thus, a reasonable expectation would be that she would still be a leader. Not so much, apparently.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1369241446349</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 12:50:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369241867389-102</Id><Title>china 787 update</Title><Msg>Wednesday, May 22, 2013 NYC787 site: China to issue 787 airworthiness certificate early next week Thanks to our blog readers CX880 and Weijie Deng, a firmer picture now has emerged regarding the start of 787 deliveries to Chinese carriers. A team from China Southern Airlines is in Seattle to conduct customer flight(s) and to complete paperwork needed for delivery and payments. China's aviation regulators are expected to give its approval for its carriers to operate the 787 on May 27th and China Southern is expected to formally take delivery on May 28th. I expect China Southern to take delivery of 8 787s this year. The first one to be delivered will be ZA380 (LN 34, B-2725). Hainan can also take delivery of up to 2 787s this month from Boeing's Charleston facility. Both ZA431 (LN 76, B-2722) and ZA433 (LN 81, B-2723) are painted and have completed Boeing test flights and await us timer inspection and test flights. It is unclear if Hainan will take both this month or one but it does appear at the least that the deliveries will be closely spaced to one another. I expect Hainan to take delivery of 6 787s this year.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1369241867389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 12:57:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369241948762-103</Id><Topic><Title>Black Man: If Obama was White He Wouldn't Be President</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1369227150872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 08:52:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>low information fits you perfect</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1369241948762</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 12:59:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369242055474-104</Id><Topic><Title>No Matter How Much You Shake, Kick. and Dance!!!</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369234838370</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 11:00:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I`m guessing buying a few vowels would only confuse you more.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1369242055474</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 13:00:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369242692013-105</Id><Topic><Title>No Matter How Much You Shake, Kick. and Dance!!!</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369234838370</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 11:00:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>something caught in your panties spart?</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1369242692013</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 13:11:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369242800577-106</Id><Topic><Title>Black Man: If Obama was White He Wouldn't Be President</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1369227150872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 08:52:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>re: low information it sure suits the whitehouse, huh sparty</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1369242800577</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 13:13:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369243634698-107</Id><Title>When the FACTs are on your side</Title><Msg>argue the facts- if the law is on your side argue the law - if neither- hammer the messenger and /or pound the table ( wave your hands ) and yell...

Toensing’s client, Gregory Hicks, testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on May 8. Hicks is the former deputy chief of mission who was in Benghazi, Libya, at the time of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed four Americans. Toensing said State Department officials have told reporters that U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who died in the attack, could not reach Hicks on the telephone to tell him about the attack because Hicks didn’t have his phone on him and was too busy relaxing and watching television. It’s an accusation Hicks has strongly refuted. “It’s a criminal offense to interfere with any federal employee’s right to bring information to Congress,” Toensing told Fox News. Hicks was one of two so-called whistle-blowers who came forward in recent weeks and months. During the congressional hearings that followed, it was revealed that widespread mismanagement at the State Department added to the confusion and miscommunication the night of the attack and the in the days that followed. Allegations of government officials leaking personal information or retaliating against whistle-blowers are not new.

Over the years, aggressive tax avoidance has become the standard practice at many American-based multinationals, particularly at technology companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, which like to portray themselves as being on the side of the angels. Indeed, the only surprise about Tim Cook’s appearance on Capitol Hill today is that it took so long to come about. According to an ongoing congressional investigation, Apple, by setting up a shell company in Ireland, where it had negotiated a tax rate of two per cent or less, was able to pay minimal taxes on much of its overseas earnings. And by transferring ownership of some of its intellectual-property rights to offshore affiliates, including some in Ireland, which then charged other parts of the company for using them, it was able to avoid paying billions of dollars of U.S. taxes on income that was actually generated in this country, which is where Apple does the bulk of its research and development.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369245616957</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:00:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369246136016-119</Id><Title>What Freedom of the Press !</Title><Msg>... wheres the Repturd outrage ?</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369246136016</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:08:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369246425131-120</Id><Topic><Title>Flying on the 787 today especially wow what a thought</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369078902465</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 15:41:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While Mcnierney plays games with where the 777X is going to be built Airbus is securing orders for the A350-1000 from current 777 operators like British Airways.</Msg><Username>revtrst</Username><Timestamp>1369246425131</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:13:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369246944036-121</Id><Topic><Title>What Freedom of the Press !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1369246136016</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:08:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We might as well have Al Jazzera (sp)?

Some of this makes sense, Boeing threw people and money at the 87/47 programs resulting in inefficiencies and staff bloat that needed to be trimmed. I have concerns about cutting R&amp;D and employee development which is going to hurt down the line. Lack of R&amp;D caused a lot of the 787 issues including inadequate maturity of the design and analysis tools and manufacturing problems. Latest Forbes estimate is that the 87s cost $200M to build and sell for $115M on average. While part of this gap will be closed as they work down the learning curve some of it is due to the "black-aluminum" composite design mentality that was used which makes manufacturing very labor intensive. Boeing badly needs more R&amp;D work on composites before they commit to the same sub-optimal design for the 777X wing. This is all part of the McNerney plan to retire in a couple of years with a flourish of high earnings. The success of Alan Mullaley at Ford has really burned him, particularly the $300M Alan is going to clear when he retires. Jim is very good at catering to Wall Street having learned from the master, Jack Welch. He is using the same creative accounting methods and short term thinking that worked for Welch until Barrons finally blew the whistle on him and the 2008 meltdown took out GE's cash cow, their finance unit. Personally I have mixed feelings about this, I've made a lot of money on my Boeing stock this year but am concerned that the seeds of the eventually decline and fall of a great company are being planted for short term gain.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1369257987329</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 17:26:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369258199381-147</Id><Title>Wiener selects Holder in bid for NYC mayor......</Title><Msg>Wiener Holder.

Easy pull a one year chart on a one day time. notice 4 times the stock went to $2.00 and then to $3.50 so that is how I did it. Today I pulled the trigger on my JRCC at $3.46, not luck skill. I know how to trade uing charts. If you followed my simple rule you were out of the other stocks a few days ago and you have over 100% to show for just 13 trade days I added one stock as it was a quick gainer . If your a hack orpimp for Boeing stock or a troll that is yoru skill set and that is what you do. Boeing is a worthless stock you can't make money compared to other stocks . for 5 years boeing is up 49% most of that gain in the last 3 month on the stock buyback , Airbus is up 124%. My point sure if you listen to a Boeing hack or pimp they will talk airplane orders, and deliveries, but they dont mention the 4 years late and 30 billion extra cost. If nike tennis shoes cost an extra 30 billion and were 4 years late then another company would step in that other company is Airbus and the stock price long term reflects the number one Airplane maker. Frankly both stocks suck . Boeing has had a nice stock buyback , Aribus has authorized a 18% stock buyback to cover any problems with their 787 beater so they watch Boeing build a better plane after boeing steps up first. Airbus is very smart watchand improve</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369260793803</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 18:13:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369260906404-153</Id><Title>Signs of an Insecure Person/Investor</Title><Msg>This is not directed at anyone, just interesting information Signs of Insecurity •An insecure person becomes overly selfish. He tries to surround himself with possessions, accolades and attention. •An insecure person becomes overly accommodating and tries to gain other people's approval. •Insecure people tend to be very defensive and cannot handle criticism. They are not comfortable with their own-self. •Insecure people can't enjoy silence and they try to fill it with unnecessary chatter. •Excessive joking is also a mechanism for coping with insecurity. An insecure person craves for other people's attention, which is achieved when other people laugh at their jokes. However, this leads to insensitivity towards others. •Insecure people are self promoting and constantly talk about themselves. They need validation from other people for their actions and qualities. •Insecure people are even threatened by others and therefore by bullying they try to crush their opinion. •Insecure people tent to be overly authoritative as they tend to compensate for their lack of confidence by taking out their frustrations on their subordinates. •Over competitiveness is also a sign of insecurity. They are scared of losing and so they always keep themselves at the edge. •Being materialistic also shows that person is insecure because he feels that by acquiring material wealth and showing it off he will be able to gain people's attention and acknowledgement.</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1369260906404</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 18:15:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369261319900-154</Id><Topic><Title>JRCC or Boeing summary which is better</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369260793803</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 18:13:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so the Boeing hacks and the trolls who monitor this board are already giving me a thumbs down for making over 100% on 4 stocks since May4 are you that bit a loser on Boeing then ? the truth hurts you that bad then !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369261319900</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 18:21:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369261883749-155</Id><Topic><Title>JRCC or Boeing summary which is better</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369260793803</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 18:13:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and for the one big run up on JRCC in the last one year , that was when the election was being run up and one the two candidates the loser r was for coal so it was a slam dunk to make money then coal and jrcc went right back to the range 2 to 3.50 easy as pie I amde huge gains on JRCc during the election run off , but if yoru a troll or a Boeign hack you dont know hwo to trade and you dont know what information is important. like airplane order and deliveries are not important , the Boeing company has a a cycle time per week so the deliveries are baked in, foulmoutharbor is pimping no news the deliveries are already known by any trader who follows boeing and the orders mean nothing, Ie when the cEO said the customer could wait for the 737max Boeing lost two prior all boein cutomers and Airbus got over 1000 plane orders immediately on the CEO blunder . .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369261883749</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 18:31:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369265972310-156</Id><Topic><Title>Rush Has Lost It...
