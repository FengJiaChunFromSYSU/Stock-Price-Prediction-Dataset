The assertions in that article are so full of holes it's rediculous. There is NO evidence the Oregon shooter shot himself because the guy with the piston drew on him. The shooter's weapon was malfuntioning and I could make th eargument that once cleared he wanted to use the last round on himself. I presume that article came out of some NRA propoganda. OK Sparty, I guess you are advocating firearms laws like in Switzerland to get our firearms violence rate down to theirs. You can go to Wikipedia and do a little research on them and watch out for what you wish for. BTW I own lots of firearms but I refuse to go along with the BS of the NRA.

"Said onboard fires on airplanes are as bad as it gets. Even though it happened on the ground, rest assured the FAA is asking 'What if it happened in the air?'"Leake, the analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets, who is also a former commercial and military pilot, said‚Äù Any electrical problem in the next 30 days, for whatever reason, , is going to be a big deal," he added.( sell your Boeing stock ) The Chicago-based jet maker's shares closed down 2 percent at $76.13 after the news. The electrical fire is troubling in part because the 787 relies heavily on electrical power to drive onboard systems that in other jet models are run by air pressure generated by the engines. The new jet also suffered an electrical fire during a test flight, prompting a redesign of electrical systems. since entering service in October 2011, the plane has repeatedly made headlines for mechanical problems. The FAA and the NTSB are looking into what caused the problem, which came just weeks after Boeing endured a string of other electrical problems that briefly grounded three of the planes. The new jet also has suffered an engine failure and fuel leaks in the 14 months it has been in service. Last July, the FAA investigated an incident in which a 787 engine made by General Electric Co blew apart on the ground in South Carolina, prompting changes in how the engines are made, maintained and inspected. A similar engine failed on a Boeing 747 in Shanghai in September. In late December, , calling the problems "normal squawks." Monday's electrical fire raised questions about the view of Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney who said the 787 has not experienced an unusual number of problems for a new aircraft. The number of incidents and especially an onboard fire is likely to make Boeing highly susceptible to the public, shareholders and customers, if any other issues arise on the 787 aircraft.( sell Boeing stock ) Wing de-icing and cabin air conditioning systems on the 787 are electrical. If ventilation failed on a flight or the cockpit filled with smoke, the pilots would have to descend to 10,000 feet to survive, is just an example . . Boeing Chicago is pressing their bad management into the danger zone, so many incidents that could bring this outsourced plane down with all aboard dead. Hopefully the FAA, NTSB will ground this outsourced 30 billion dollar mistake before a 787 crashes killing all passengers onboard. If it's a outsourced Boeing I am not going. Boeing shareholders each 787 deliverd cost you 300 million loss and the SPEEA strike will cost you 400 million per day. Boeing stock is held for dividends and increased value, for one year your stock valuation has increased BA 1.02%, DOW JONES average is up 8.29%,NASDAQ average is up 15.8%, other aerospace companies are way up Northrup (NOC) is up 18.6%, Lockheed (LMT) is up 17.8%, another DOW stock Bank of America (BAC) is up more in the last five days (6.41%) and 96% for the year. Going forward with a potential strike and this huge 787 failure look around for much better stocks sell and move on, your holdings will grow at least 7% faster if you just go with a ETF for the DOW or 16.8% more growth if you go with a ETF for the NASDAQ will far less risk than Boeing a mismanaged and dangerous stock to hold . Until Chicago managment is terminated and replaced any investor should stay clear of Boeing stock .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357636555656</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 04:15:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357641389343-9</Id><Topic><Title>Alex Jones just Humilated Piers Morgan on Gun Control....CNN goes into revisionist mode</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357614318662</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 22:05:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You must of really ruffled the Kent Raven's feathers, notice how he brought out his aliases, and even a new one, to attack your posts?

The fire-suppression systems typically disperse Halon 1301 (bromotrifluoromethane‚ÄîCF3Br) as the suppressant. The conventional fire-suppression systems also have multiple bottles of Halon 1301, each with its own discharge mechanism. In the event of a fire in the cargo compartment, fire suppression is achieved by an initial rapid discharge of Halon into the cargo compartment to establish a minimum Halon concentration of 5% or more by volume in the compartment. This initial high Halon concentration level provides effective and fast initial flame knockdown. Sustained fire suppression against deep-seated fire and conflagrations is achieved by maintaining the Halon concentration in the cargo compartment at or above 3%. The typical fire-suppression systems on large commercial aircraft achieve the initial high Halon concentration level by very quickly releasing the entire contents of one or more high-rate discharge (HRD) bottles of Halon into the cargo compartment. After the HRD bottle(s) are discharged, the Halon concentration peaks and then slowly decreases toward approximately 5% during a period of approximately 20 minutes. In one fire-suppression system used on a Boeing 747-400, two HRD bottles are immediately emptied into a cargo compartment upon activation of the fire-suppression system. The HRD bottles provide approximately 110 pounds of Halon (55 pounds from each HRD bottle) into the cargo compartment to establish an initially high Halon concentration level, which is intended to slowly drop to at least 5%. The Halon concentration in the cargo compartment is then maintained by providing a substantially continuous, regulated flow of Halon from a plurality of ‚Äúmetered‚Äù bottles over an elongated period of time. The metered bottles begin to discharge at a selected time delay after the HRD bottles are discharged. The metered bottles release Halon over an extended time period so the Halon concentration level is maintained at approximately 5%-7%, at least until the aircraft begins its descent to a safe landing. When a commercial aircraft descends from a cruise altitude, the cargo compartment undergoes a repressurization. The cargo compartment also typically experiences an increase in a compartment leakage rate due to outflow valve effects. The repressurization and increased leakage rate effectively result in additional air being added into the cargo compartment, which causes the Halon concentration to decrease as the aircraft descends. The conventional fire-suppression systems compensate for the decrease in Halon concentration during descent by maintaining a higher Halon concentration in the cargo compartment during the cruise phase before the descent phase. Accordingly, the Halon concentration level has room to drop as the aircraft descends, while not dropping below the 3% concentration minimum. For example, the metered bottles provide a continuous flow of Halon into the cargo compartment to maintain an elevated Halon concentration level of over 6% through the majority of the aircraft's flight after activation of the fire-suppression system. The Halon concentration level is maintained at this elevated level to compensate for the Halon concentration drop that will occur during descent of the aircraft to a safe landing. Accordingly, the conventional fire-suppression systems, when activated, must contain enough Halon to maintain the intentionally elevated Halon concentration during the flight time prior to descent. The aircraft, therefore, must carry hundreds of pounds of Halon on each flight to ensure that the fire-suppression system will have enough Halon to meet the minimum Halon concentration level requirements at all times in the event a fire condition occurs in one of the cargo compartments. The weight of the Halon negatively impacts the aircraft's fuel efficiency." This is from a 2009 Boeing patent application...dealing with halon systems for cargo hold.</Msg><Username>commishfree1</Username><Timestamp>1357653517237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 08:58:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357654362874-25</Id><Title>Lessons In Government School Indoctrination</Title><Msg>This really has to be seen to be believed ‚Ä¶.but yahoo won't let me post the page or link to it. It's a page out of a workbook for your government school student. What school and what schoolbook I can‚Äôt tell you ‚Ä¶ maybe the lady who sent this to Boortz will step forward and let us know. This is how our government schools ‚Äì and the liberals who run them ‚Äì effectively brainwash (though indoctrinate is a much more polite word) our children into accepting the liberal philosophy as basic truth. This particular worksheet is meant to help your government student ‚Äúunderstand the distributive property.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm not a dreary slouch at math ‚Ä¶ but this is the first time in my life I‚Äôve ever heard of the distributive property. I strongly suspect that pretty much any student can move through school to a very successful life as a productive adult without ever having heard those words. Really ‚Ä¶ look at this Bolshoi. ‚Äú6 groups of (3+5) = 6 groups of 3 + 6 groups of 5‚Äù I challenge any government school teacher to call the show today and tell me why this is important. What‚Äôs important is that the student be able to figure out what 3+5 equals (8) and that 6x8 = 48. That, as you have guessed if you‚Äôve looked at the picture, isn‚Äôt the real problem here. The problem is HOW this government school document teaches the lesson. The headline at the top of the document reads ‚ÄúDistribute the Wealth.‚Äù And there you have the picture of the pretty little girl with the cute little pony tail. She‚Äôs holding a bag of money in one hand, and giving away some of that money with the other. Yes! She‚Äôs distributing her wealth! But if you study the picture you‚Äôll see there‚Äôs an even more subtle message. She‚Äôs not handing money away from her wallet or her purse. No! That wouldn‚Äôt get the real message across! Why pretty much every little girl has a wallet or a purse. No .. this little sweetheart has a BAG of money! Not every little girl has BAGS of money ‚Ä¶ so this girl must be really RICH! And since she‚Äôs rich her money needs to be redistributed! So she‚Äôs being a good little rich girl and she‚Äôs smiling as she hands her money away. This doesn‚Äôt happen by accident. There was a lot of thought put into the wording and the image on this math workbook page ‚Ä¶ here is a chance to use a math lesson to teach wealth redistribution. This is what happens when you turn the education of your child over to a government education establishment controlled and staffed (with a few exceptions) by Democrats and liberals. We‚Äôve seen this before. Ten years ago someone faxed me a copy of a page out of their child‚Äôs government school workbook. This one came from Harcourt Brace School Publishers. The title of the page was ‚ÄúRights &amp; Wrongs.‚Äù This workbook page purports to teach a lesson about The Bill of Rights. In the lead paragraph you will read ‚ÄúThese first ten amendments to the Constitution state simply and clearly citizens rights that the government cannot take away.‚Äù So far so goodl Harcourt Brace got that much right. The Bill of Rights does, indeed, set forth the people‚Äôs rights, not government rights. But then you get to the Second Amendment. Uh oh. That‚Äôs the one that says protects our right to keep and bear arms. Here‚Äôs how that particular entry reads: ‚ÄúThe Second Amendment - says that states may enlist citizens for a trained militia [army] and provide and train them with weapons.‚Äù Really? Is the word ‚Äúenlist‚Äù in the Second Amendment? How about the words ‚Äúprovide‚Äù or ‚Äútrain?‚Äù You know what this is all about --- once again this is the leftist Democrats and liberals who run our government schools using the classroom to indoctrinate, not educate.

Is this fool serious? Does Obama really believe that the United States doesn‚Äôt have a spending problem? Well, remember that Obama is on record as saying that America‚Äôs greatness comes from government spending. So in his eyes it would be perfectly logical to believe that the more government spends the greater America becomes --- and since American greatness can‚Äôt be a problem, neither can government spending. See what happens when you elect an unqualified community organizer to be president? If Barack Obama can actually look someone dead in the eye and tell them in all sincerity that we do not have a spending problem in this country ‚Ä¶ then we are in a bigger heap than I imagined. It doesn‚Äôt take a rocket surgeon to look at the unprecedented level of spending enjoyed under our Dear Ruler and look at the trajectory of our spending obligations and recognize that we simply and absolutely cannot keep this up. There aren‚Äôt enough evil rich people and greedy corporations for him to tax. It‚Äôs simply unsustainable. Unless, of course, this is precisely his goal: Set America on a path toward fiscal annihilation that cannot be reversed. It will be done in the name of ‚Äúfairness‚Äù and ‚Äújustice,‚Äù and the people will yell and cheer about how Barack Obama saved us poor Americans from the harsh evils of capitalism and individual responsibility. It was Ben Franklin who supposedly said something to this effect: ‚ÄúPeople willing to trade their freedom for temporary security deserve neither and will lose both.‚Äù Neal Boortz</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1357654714175</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 09:18:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357654733153-27</Id><Topic><Title>On board suppression system</Title><Username>fountain123_45</Username><Timestamp>1357652448131</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 08:40:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>First, thanks for the information.

Beinart puts the nomination in context: What makes Hagel so important, and so threatening to the Republican foreign-policy elite, is that he is one of the few prominent Republican-aligned politicians and commentators (George Will and Francis Fukuyama are others, but such voices are rare) who was intellectually changed by Iraq. And Hagel was changed, in large measure, because he bore within him intellectual (and physical) scar tissue from Vietnam. As my former colleague John Judis captured brilliantly in a 2007 New Republic profile, the Iraq War sparked something visceral in Hagel, as the former Vietnam rifleman realized that, once again, detached and self-interested elites were sending working-class kids like himself to die in a war they couldn‚Äôt honestly defend. To my mind, this is his core qualification. Unlike so many of the lemmings and partisans of Washington DC, Hagel actually called out the catastrophe of the Iraq War as it happened. The neocons cannot forgive him for exposing what they wrought on the nation and the world. For good measure, he has a Purple Heart and has served in combat. Not easy to say about most of the Iraq War armchair warriors and war criminals. Which is to say, as Chuck Todd said this morning, this nomination is about accountability for the Iraq War. All those ducking responsibility for the calamity - Abrams, Kristol, Stephens - are determined that those of us honest enough to resist, having supported in the first place, be erased from history. Or smeared as anti-Semites. Or given that epithet which impresses them but baffles me: "outside the mainstream". Rephrase that as - after initial support - being "outside the Iraq War mainstream" in DC - and you have a major reason to back him. Ambers explains the personal background: Why isn't Obama replacing Panetta with a Democrat? Simple: Of all the possible candidates, he trusts Hagel. Hagel was the head of Obama's intelligence advisory board, and was a frequent informal "red cell" brain that Obama privately turned to when he wanted a second opinion. He has been picking Hagel's brain on subjects as diverse as Afghanistan, China, special operations force posture, and intelligence for several years now. (Hagel has all the required clearances.)</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357655775078</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 09:36:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357656056335-33</Id><Title>Democrats Lied - Health Insurance Premiums Going Up By Double-Digits</Title><Msg>Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act as it is officially known, was supposed to make health insurance cheaper and easier to get. But thanks to a raft of new regulations, taxes and mandates put in place by the law insurance premiums are increasing faster than before the law. And small business owners, as well as individuals who purchase their own health insurance (such as this humble blogger) are the hardest hit: Particularly vulnerable to the high rates are small businesses and people who do not have employer-provided insurance and must buy it on their own. In California, Aetna is proposing rate increases of as much as 22 percent, Anthem Blue Cross 26 percent and Blue Shield of California 20 percent for some of those policy holders, according to the insurers‚Äô filings with the state for 2013. These rate requests are all the more striking after a 39 percent rise sought by Anthem Blue Cross in 2010 helped give impetus to the law, known as the Affordable Care Act, which was passed the same year and will not be fully in effect until 2014. In other states, like Florida and Ohio, insurers have been able to raise rates by at least 20 percent for some policy holders. The rate increases can amount to several hundred dollars a month.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1357656056335</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 09:40:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357656242306-34</Id><Topic><Title>On board suppression system</Title><Username>fountain123_45</Username><Timestamp>1357652448131</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 08:40:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You've jumped from fire suppression systems to operating systems of a commercial airliner...can't help you with those questions.</Msg><Username>commishfree1</Username><Timestamp>1357656242306</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 09:44:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357656298262-35</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Lied - Health Insurance Premiums Going Up By Double-Digits</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1357656056335</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 09:40:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too freakin bad, you #$%$ voted for this, it is only the beginning.

At the same time, they used this "science" as new pagan religion to further push out the Christianity they hate and despise and most of all, fear? Gia worship, the earth "mother", has been pushed in popular culture oozing out of the West for a better part of the past 1.5 decades.

We used our thermal imaging equipment to identify hot spots and identified a fire condition about mid-ship in the avionics compartment," he said. Donahue said the battery and other components were on fire, and that the battery exploded after the flames were extinguished. The NTSB investigation will have to decide if the battery was a symptom of another problem, or the cause of the fire. But there‚Äôs a lot of interest in this case as the Federal Aviation Administration granted Boeing a waiver to use lithium ion batteries in the plane. The modern battery technology is commonly used in cell phones and laptops because it can last a long time and holds a charge. But in documents, the FAA says the batteries can catch fire and explode if they are overcharged, or even undercharged. The document stating: ‚ÄúIn general, lithium ion batteries are significantly more susceptible to internal failures than can result in self-sustaining increases in temperature and pressure (thermal runaway) than their nickel-cadmium or lead-acid counterparts.‚Äù In November 2010, a test flight had to make an emergency landing after an in-flight electrical fire. The fire delayed flight tests for several weeks while Boeing investigated. Last month, a United Airlines 787 flying from Houston to Newark, N.J., diverted to New Orleans because of an electrical problem with a power distribution panel. The 787 uses two lithium ion batteries -- including one for the auxiliary power unit, according to a Boeing guide for firefighters dealing with the 787. The rechargeable batteries, , have pilots worried because batteries being used have caused or contributed to the severity of fires in planes. When Boeing proposed using the batteries in the 787, the Federal Aviation Administration issued special rules, including a requirement that they be designed to prevent overheating.( did not work as just demonstrated today ) The FAA noted in its 2007 rule that, "In general, lithium ion batteries are significantly more susceptible to internal failures that can result in self-sustaining increases in temperature and pressure. ... The metallic lithium can ignite, resulting in a self-sustaining fire or explosion." The severity of overheating is higher in larger batteries, the FAA said in the rule. The National Transportation Safety Board said it's sending an investigator to Boston. The Federal Aviation Administration also said it was investigating To compare BA for 1 year now up 1.54%,DOW Jones etf up 7.81%,MASDAQ etf up 15.32%,,Northrop up 17%,Lockheed up 17%, BAC up 93%, so BA for the year is a dead cat bouce stock going into a SPEEA strike the cost to Boeing investors is 400 million per day,each 787 delivered cost Boeing shareholders a losss of 300 million. If the 787 plane is grounded expect more dowslide. The reason for investing in a company is to make a gain on your sharholding including dividend. IF you support the Chicago managment team of outsourcing buy Boeing stock, if you think this outsourcing business plan and the excessive Chicago bonus payola is not right sell your Boeing stock until a change is made. BTW for the risk the lack of reward on Boeing stock is terrible!So BAC,NOC,LMT, DOW or NASDAQ better return lower risk.

Majority leader Harry Reid has blatantly ignored the law by failing to introduce a budget for more than 1300 days. House Republicans on the other hand have fullfilled their duty to the law by introducing and passing a budget every year since Obama has been in office. As Byron York points out, Reid's actions could give Republicans some leverage when it comes to satisfy Presindent Obama's request to increased borrowing (and spending) ability. The situation is deeply frustrating for many Republicans. Sen. Jeff Sessions, ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, has conducted a virtual crusade on the issue, loudly and consistently and unsuccessfully demanding that Reid obey the law and pass a budget. Now, with a fight over the debt ceiling approaching, Sessions wants to try something new. "I think it should be a firm principle that we should not raise the debt ceiling until we have a plan on how the new borrowed money will be spent," Sessions told me Monday in a phone conversation from his home in Alabama. "If the government wants to borrow money so it can spend more, then the government ought to tell the Congress and the American people how they will spend it." There are no specific proposals yet, but under this scenario Republicans would insist on a debt ceiling agreement that includes (among other things) a requirement that Congress pass a budget by a specific date. If that doesn't happen, there would be some sort of enforcement mechanism, perhaps an arrangement whereby the debt ceiling was lowered, or one in which Congress would have to muster a supermajority to raise it again. I want to stress again that Reid has been ignoring the law by refusing to not only pass a budget in the Senate, but by failing to even introduce one.

Hmmm......Small fire........two foot flames reported elsewhere.....heavy smoke reported from Fire Chief at the scene Electric jet - still a good idea.....hummmmm, is that theoretical 5-10 % fuel saving paying off in lost revenue About 40 firefighters and 15 firefighting vehicles quickly extinguished the blaze. JAL said in a statement that the "smoke was discovered in the rear end of the cabin." "The smoke was traced to a fire from the battery used for the auxiliary power unit (APU) which was situated in an electrical room at the back of the aircraft," JAL said. JAL canceled Monday's return flight from Boston to Tokyo and was working to reschedule. Reports from the scene of the fire were confusing. Walsh said firefighters, who used infrared equipment to find the fire, described its location as in the "midsection" of the airplane, not the rear. "When we arrived, it was a heavy smoke, and that was in three minutes, so this was advancing," Massachusetts Port Authority's fire chief, Bob Donahue, told The Associated Press. And Walsh said that while the firefighters were controlling the fire, one of the batteries used to power the APU "exploded," causing a further flare-up. "Something caused this battery pack to overheat, ignite," Donahue said. The National Transportation Safety Board announced it was sending an investigator to Boston to look into what it called the "Boeing 787 smoke event." Because many of the Dreamliner's systems ‚Äî from wing de-icing to brakes to engine start ‚Äî are electrically powered, the jet uses much more electricity than other airliners: about 1.5 megawatts, or enough to power more than 600 homes. The APU is supplied to Boeing by United Technologies, which also provides the new plane's extensive power generation and distribution systems. Used as a source of electrical power while the aircraft is on the ground or as a backup power source during an in-flight emergency, the APU is in the tail of the airplane. That suggests JAL's account is accurate: that the battery was in the rear electrical bay in the lower part of the aft fuselage. That's also the site of the aircraft's power electronics cooling system, designed to dissipate all the heat generated by the heavy electrical loads. The 787's new electrical system first caught public attention in 2010 when a major fire broke out in flight. That fire was attributed to a piece of metal that had worked its way into one of five electrical distribution panels and caused the system to short.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357665132463</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 12:12:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357665463332-79</Id><Topic><Title>That frog in the boiling pot?

APU (logically) does not provide any bleed air...just electricity.</Msg><Username>gerbilfood4me</Username><Timestamp>1357665816245</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 12:23:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357665848269-81</Id><Topic><Title>Analyst said onboard fires on a 787 is as bad as it gets Boeing stock down 2%</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357636555656</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 04:15:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This board will get a lot easier to look at as soon as I push this button.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1357665848269</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 12:24:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357665961314-82</Id><Topic><Title>On board suppression system</Title><Username>fountain123_45</Username><Timestamp>1357652448131</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 08:40:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many airliners have no fire suppression system in cargo hold.

An economic collapse is coming sooner than you think. "If history teaches anything, it is that government cannot be trusted to manage money. When currency is not redeemable in gold, its value depends entirely on the judgment and the conscience of the politicians. (That is the situation in this country today.) Especially in an economic crisis or a war, the pressure to inflate becomes overwhelming. Any alternative may seem politically disastrous. Whether it be the Roman emperors repeatedly debasing their coinage, the French revolutionary government printing a flood of assignats, John Law flooding France with debased money, or the Continental Congress issuing money until it was literally "not worth a Continental," the story is similar. A government in financial straits finds its easiest recourse is to issue more and more money until the money loses its value. The entire process is accompanied by a barrage of explanations, propaganda and new regulations which hide the true situation from the eyes of most people until they have lost all their savings. In World War I, Germany -- like other governments -- borrowed heavily to pay its war costs. This led to inflation, but not much more than in the U.S. during the same period. After the war there was a period of stability, but then the inflation resumed. By 1923, the wildest inflation in history was raging. Often prices doubled in a few hours. A wild stampede developed to buy goods and get rid of money. By late 1923 it took 200 billion marks buy a loaf of bread. Millions of the hard-working, thrifty German people found that their life's savings would not buy a postage stamp. They were penniless. How could this happen in a highly civilized nation run at the time by intelligent, democratically chosen leaders? What happened to business, to wages and employment? How did some people manage to save their capital while a few speculators made fortunes?" I am the Prophet of Profits and I will guide preparing for the coming collapse.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357668501812</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 13:08:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357668587086-115</Id><Title>Who would fly on one of these?</Title><Msg>Who?</Msg><Username>tommy_loops</Username><Timestamp>1357668587086</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 13:09:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357668678354-116</Id><Topic><Title>What should you do now ?</Title><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1357668334965</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 13:05:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like for next few days maybe is good to stay away till we find out more Where do you go ?

The Boeing Mangment not the workforce is the problem, remember SPEEA did not design the 787 and it failed they did design the 777 and it wass a great success the SPEEA group was considered to expensive at 5 billion ot control 100% of the 787 engineering well that cheap outsourcing cost Boeing shareholders an extra 30 billion and they have lost control of the engineering on the 787 and it is a failed plane. If you or mrstock for example pretend that I am a fired Boeing employee to try to discredit me you are enabling Boeing mangment by the TOS violation and false statement used to enable Boeing Mangment or to make it appear that what I post is somehow not true , get it makboe I have made it clear for many year until apple lost Steve Jobs how much money I made and suggested you get on board, or gone with me on coal stock when romney was running or last month gone with stp a one month gain of over 100%. This is a yahoo message board when I mentioned apple an enabler would tell me I should post that on apple , but never compains about the political posting here , that is a enabling comment attempting to make me and my true statement go away , did it work ?

If the problem is in the software, there are millions of lines of code to examine. If the problem is in the wiring there are over 50 miles of wiring and 50,000 connectors that could be the cause. Hardware problems are the easiest to fix, but at this stage we find it hard to believe the problem is related to such highly tested items. The fact that Boeing (1) made major replacements of traditional copper wire with aluminum wire and (2) for the first time in its history outsourced the production and installation of its electrical connection systems only increases our concern that this issue may be more difficult to solve than most are assuming.</Msg><Username>fortuneking1</Username><Timestamp>1357672920857</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:22:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357672985365-192</Id><Topic><Title>The Dreamliner is a death trap!!!</Title><Username>farmergreg100</Username><Timestamp>1357670882152</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 13:48:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oif it's a outsourced 787 I am not going !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357672985365</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:23:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357673014454-193</Id><Title>Where is that guy</Title><Msg>that wanted to bet this woud be at 78/sh by Friday?</Msg><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1357673014454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:23:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357673079140-194</Id><Topic><Title>Where is that guy</Title><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1357673014454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:23:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't think he know that this will happen this was an accident give him a brake</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1357673079140</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:24:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357673250188-195</Id><Topic><Title>FAA needs to step up here and ground these things until safety can be assured.</Title><Username>brattle_smattle</Username><Timestamp>1357669133009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 13:18:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your right the stockholders are in a real pickel now , if the fire had not been caught in 3 minutes that plastic plane would have burt to the ground and the fule leak , the FAA and Boeing and NSTB are playing with peoples lives over money, this plane needs to be grounded now !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357673250188</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:27:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357673317396-196</Id><Topic><Title>FAA needs to step up here and ground these things until safety can be assured.</Title><Username>brattle_smattle</Username><Timestamp>1357669133009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 13:18:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tos violation , your statement has no basis in any reports not allowed by yahoo and reported</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357673317396</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:28:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357673358736-197</Id><Title>WSJ scoop on United's finding of improperly installed bundle of wires</Title><Msg>United Airlines found improperly-installed wiring on one of its Boeing Co. 787s, as operators of the new jet inspected their fleets in the wake of the electrical fire suffered Monday on a Japan Airlines Co.

We‚Äôre talking about a variable-frequency higher voltage system capable of 1.45mW, or enough for around 400 homes,‚Äù says 787 systems director Mike Sinnett. ¬© Boeing The 787 architecture is already seeing the benefits of system integration There‚Äôs a lot of talk in the industry about whether we‚Äôre overextending on this, but frankly the engine doesn‚Äôt care whether its power is extracted electrically or pneumatically. We hear from the ‚Äòequivalent horsepower‚Äô school that a pneumatic engine is just as effective as an electric engine. But that‚Äôs the whole point; our aircraft does not draw as much horsepower off the engine in cruise, so it doesn‚Äôt burn as much fuel. If you look at the extraction profile you see the amount of power you pull off [the engine] is just what you need, so the engine isn‚Äôt working any harder than it needs to. We‚Äôre only getting what we need, and we only use what we generate.‚Äù The bulk of the power comes from two 250kVA generators mounted to each engine</Msg><Username>kored35</Username><Timestamp>1357673783840</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:36:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357673785297-204</Id><Topic><Title>Who would get on one of these Planes ???</Title><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1357669854427</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 13:30:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>40 firefighters and 15 firetrucks and they did not get on without special firefighting suits and only after a whole lot of water/chemical suppressant was used first , not like a passenger for sure</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357673785297</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:36:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357673871720-205</Id><Title>Price target $62 within the week.

Typical non-energetic failure modes (usually considered benign failures) include loss of capacity, internal impedance increase (loss of rate capability), activation of a permanent disabling mechanism such as a CID, shut down separator, fuse, or battery pack permanent disable, electrolyte leakage with subsequent cell dry-out, and cell swelling. Often, energetic failures lead to thermal runaway. Cell thermal runaway refers to rapid self-heating of a cell derived from the exothermic chemical reaction of the highly oxidizing positive electrode and the highly reducing negative electrode; it can occur with batteries of almost any chemistry. In a thermal runaway reaction, a cell rapidly releases its stored energy. The more energy a cell has stored, the more energetic a thermal runaway reaction will be. One of the reasons Li-ion cell thermal runaway reactions can be very energetic is these cells have very high-energy densities compared to other cell chemistries. The other reason that Li-ion cell thermal runaway reactions can be very energetic is because these cells contain flammable electrolyte. As a result, not only do they store electrical energy in the form of electrochemical potential energy, they store appreciable chemical energy (especially compared to cells with water-based electrolytes) in the form of combustible materials. The severity of a cell thermal runaway event will depend upon a number of factors, including the SOC of a cell (how much electrical energy is stored in the form of chemical potential energy), the ambient environmental temperature, the electrochemical design of the cell (cell chemistry), and the mechanical design of the cell (cell size, electrolyte volume, etc.). For any given cell, the most severe thermal runaway reaction will be achieved when that cell is at 100% (or greater, if overcharged) SOC, because the cell will contain maximum electrical energy. If a typical fully charged (or overcharged) Li-ion cell undergoes a thermal runaway reaction, a number of things occur, including: ‚Ä¢Cell internal temperature increases; ‚Ä¢Cell internal pressure increases; ‚Ä¢Cell undergoes venting; ‚Ä¢Cell vent gases may ignite; ‚Ä¢Cell contents may be ejected; and ‚Ä¢Cell thermal runaway may propagate to adjacent cells.</Msg><Username>kored35</Username><Timestamp>1357678272889</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 15:51:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357678597342-255</Id><Topic><Title>787 Special Electrical Dream ?</Title><Username>kored35</Username><Timestamp>1357673783840</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:36:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't that part of the reason some of the electric cars went to banks of small batteries rather than one or two large batteries?</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1357678597342</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 15:56:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357678682035-256</Id><Topic><Title>Are these planes build by Union workers ?</Title><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1357674850042</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 14:54:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Those problems parts probably build in China.</Msg><Username>boatpeople007</Username><Timestamp>1357678682035</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 15:58:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357678706889-257</Id><Title>Looks like the script form Casino Royal!!

Say that 3 is replaced by "a" and 5 replaced by "b", then your original equation would be: 6 x (a + b) = 6a + 6b = 48 The algebra student would then have to have another equation involving "a" and/or "b" in order to resolve their individual values. It is the distributive property that helps us to set that up. A separate equation for establishing the individual values might be 5a = 3b, also equally expressed as 3b - 5a = 0. With algebra, we can perform a subtraction of the left and right parts of both equations, but since we are trying to solve one variable at a time, we make either the "a" or "b" variable quantity equal between the two equations in order to eliminate one of the variables. We choose to make the "b" variable equal, thus: 2 x (3b - 5a) = 6b - 10a = 2 x (0), and then subtract the two equations to allow us to isolate ‚Äúa‚Äù as a variable: (6a + 6b) - (6b - 10a) = 6a + 6b + (- 6b) + 10a = 48 - 0 then applying the "associative" property: (6a + 10a) + (6b - 6b) = 48 6a + 10a = 16a = 48; therefore a = 3, and that then allows us to solve for ‚Äúb‚Äù in either of the two equations The "distributive" property is not inherently a "social" contamination of math. It was defined, along with the "commutative" property way before welfare and socialism were even conceived (like 1814 by French mathematician Francois Joseph Servois). The "associative" property was defined around 1914 by W. R. Hamilton. The example using bags of money and the name of the worksheet ‚ÄúDistribute the Wealth‚Äù is cynical, I would admit. Is it calculating? Hmmm.

This level of debt was not exceeded again until near the end of the 20th century.[20] Jerome (1934) gives an unattributed quote about finance conditions that allowed the great industrial expansion of the post WW I period: Probably never before in this country had such a volume of funds been available at such low rates for such a long period.[21] Furthermore, Jerome says that the volume of new capital issues increased at a 7.7% compounded annual rate from 1922-29 at a time when the Standard Statistics Co.'s index of 60 high grade bonds yielded from 4.98% in 1923 to 4.47% in 1927. There was also a real estate and housing bubble in the 1920s, especially in Florida, which burst in 1925. Alvin Hansen stated that housing construction during the 1920s decade exceeded population growth by 25%.[22] See also:Florida land boom of the 1920s Irving Fisher argued that the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was over-indebtedness and deflation. Fisher tied loose credit to over-indebtedness, which fueled speculation and asset bubbles.[23] He then outlined nine factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust. The chain of events proceeded as follows: Debt liquidation and distress selling Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off A fall in the level of asset prices A still greater fall in the net worths of business, precipitating bankruptcies A fall in profits A reduction in output, in trade and in employment. Pessimism and loss of confidence Hoarding of money A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates.[23] During the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%.[24] Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, which could not be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets.[25] Outstanding debts became heavier, because prices and incomes fell by 20‚Äì50% but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 US banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s). By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday.[26] Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans, which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending.[25] Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated. The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed.[23] This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression. Macroeconomists including Ben Bernanke, the current chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, have revived the debt-deflation view of the Great Depression originated by Fisher.[27][28] Economist Steve Keen revived the Debt-Reset Theory after he accurately predicted the 2008 recession based on his analysis of the Great Depression, and recently advised Congress to engage in debt-forgiveness or direct payments to citizens in order to avoid future financial events.[29] Some people have recently claimed that high levels of private debt may have caused the Great Depression."

It's gained momentum ever since, attracting support from a veteran Congressional Democrat, as well as respected-economist-turned-lefty-polemicist, Paul Krugman. Here's a brief refresher on how this lunacy would work, including a special bonus quote from an economic "expert:" Under this scenario, the U.S. Mint would produce (say) a pair of trillion-dollar platinum coins. The president orders the coins to be deposited at the Federal Reserve. The Fed then moves this money into Treasury‚Äôs accounts. And just like that, Treasury suddenly has an extra $2 trillion to pay off its obligations for the next two years ‚Äî without needing to issue new debt. The ceiling is no longer an issue. ‚ÄúI like it,‚Äù says Joseph Gagnon of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs obviously economically problematic about it.‚Äù In theory, this is much like having the central bank print money. But, says Gagnon, the U.S. government would simply be using the money to keep spending at existing levels, so it wouldn‚Äôt create any extra inflation. And if it did cause problems, the Fed could always counteract the effects by winding down some of its other programs to inject money into the economy. Is the platinum coin option really legal? Apparently so. It was discussed* during the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis by Jack Balkin, a law professor at Yale Law School. Under law, he noted, there‚Äôs a limit to how much paper money the United States can circulate at any one time, and there are rules that limit how many gold, silver and copper coins the Treasury can mint. But there‚Äôs no such limit when it comes to platinum coins. Good news! It's perfectly legal and not "economically problematic" in any conceivable way. Thank God for that handy platinum loophole, am I right? Although I must say I prefer Allahpundit's cheeky suggestion that the Treasury "mint" magic beans to accomplish the same farcical trick. And as I've asked previously, if engaging in monetary mysticism to avoid issuing new debt isn't a devastating economic risk (see: acute devaluation, a collapse of confidence in the bond market and Zimbabwe-style inflation), why not churn out 17 of these puppies and retire the entire debt in one fell swoop? Hell, we'd have a surplus. Imagine the "investments" we could make with with that surplus. For the children. Back to reality: Our official national debt is hurtling toward the $17 trillion mark. Our more realistic national debt is closer to $90 trillion. We've run trillion dollar deficits for four consecutive years, and next year won't be much better -- despite policies to tax "the rich" more and substantially wind down both wars. Our spending and future obligations are unsustainable.

But the oil giant will instead suffer a multi-million dollar loss on the exercise after the rig ran aground off the Alaskan coast on Monday night. The rig was beached during a violent storm on its way to a Seattle shipyard for routine maintenance, in a round-trip timed so that, thanks to an accounting loophole, Shell could avoid an Alaskan state tax. However, because the rig ran aground late on New Year‚Äôs Eve and began 2013 within three miles of the Alaskan coast, Shell remains liable for a unique state property tax on equipment dedicated to oil and gas development and exploration. Shell admitted today that its decision to move the rig, the Kulluk, just weeks after it was brought to the Gulf of Alaska in November, was motivated by financial considerations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fair to say that the current tax structure related to vessels of the type influenced the timing of our departure. It would have cost Shell multiple millions to keep the rigs here,‚Äù a Shell spokesman said. Another Shell spokesman, in London, said: ‚ÄúWhile we are aware of the tax environment wherever we operate, the driver for operational decisions is always governed by safety. In this case, what mattered most to Shell was the two-week window of favourable weather that was forecasted for that journey.‚Äù [Note: atmospheric scientists STRONGLY disagree with Shell's claim of a favorable 2 week forecast. See Cliff Mass weather blog for Jan 5 - Rand] He denied suggestions that the routine maintenance and inspection could have been carried out in Alaska. David Gregory, a councillor for the city of Unalaska, said Shell‚Äôs equipment tax bill would come to between $6m and $7m, adding: ‚ÄúMaybe they should have just stayed there.‚Äù In addition to the tax, Shell faces millions of dollars of charges including the cost of repairs. It must also reimburse the federal and state governments for an emergency response which involved more than 500 people, including the evacuation of the rig‚Äôs crew of 18 by Coast Guard helicopters in weather the Captain later described as ‚Äúclose to a hurricane‚Äù. Salvage experts flown to the rig concluded that none of the 139,000 gallons of diesel and 12,000 gallons of hydraulic fluids on board had been spilled. However, they cautioned that it was unclear how serious the damage was or how long it would take to refloat and move the Kulluk. For Shell, the incident is the latest in a series of setbacks in its costly pursuit of oil in the environmentally-sensitive Arctic region which is nonetheless regarded as the next great frontier for oil exploration. The Kulluk began its journey on 21 December and a week later was about 50 miles south of Kodiak Island ‚Äì out of reach of the Alaskan tax man. But the tug that was pulling it suffered multiple engine failures just as a subtropical cyclone made its way into the North Pacific. On Monday night, in the dying hours of 2012, the rig ran aground about 1,600 feet from Sitkalidak Island, next door to Kodiak. Shell has so far spent ¬£3.2bn buying up leases and on exploratory drilling off Alaska‚Äôs north and north-west coasts but has yet to discover any commercial quantities of oil. Full-scale production in the region is still thought to be years away.</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1357687596664</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 18:26:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357688650937-308</Id><Topic><Title>one user wants to know why the 787 problems were not caught in testing</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357681270136</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:41:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep and they also have recieving inspectors and line worker instpectors , but notice how another user here thinks this information is wrong and calls me names .Boeing has sent workers and engineers all over the world toafter the fact look at the possible fix for the outsoruced 787 problems , But Beoing is not in charge of that now the contractors are in the power seat. if SPEEA had been allowed to engineer the whole plane like the 777 then this 787 would have been much better.

I was familiar with Dershowitz‚Äôs stance on torture before this article, but I was gravely shocked to see his advocacy for the targeted assassinations of U.S. citizens.

My guess is the 787 problems over time as detailed by major newpaper outlets and the WSJ, CNN and expert analysts have a lot to do with the stock price. cbx, the big news today made a lot of hits come to the Boeing message board . , I guess the message from the people today is a lack of trust in the 787 or Boeing now. But doubtful that the comments here are the reason for the sell off. therr were only two posters advising that they were buying more or shorting and a ew poster who toss around insults and then say stay in , like anyone here would follow someone that has a fake nake and is not a engineer or a top of the line investor . If warren Buffett said he was buying a lot of Boeing stock it would make the news but not here , he would be interviewd on CNN. Most successful traders today are fast on their feet, CBX, the stock market is a rigged system, you need to understand the rules to make money. Engineers use facts good, but the Yahoo Message board , not much of a investor manipulator anyway too many users here are spamers especially the political posters almost always outnumber any Boeing poster comments by a wide margin. .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357694627462</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 20:23:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357694933630-334</Id><Topic><Title>Alot of wannabe engineers out there on this board but failing</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1357692929253</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 19:55:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My note was not to offend anyone, just point out that some messages are premature and can/will be misleading</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1357694933630</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 20:28:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357696164673-335</Id><Topic><Title>Today's fuel leak was a non issue</Title><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1357694017165</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 20:13:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fuel was leaking from the engine was it not?</Msg><Username>u8everything</Username><Timestamp>1357696164673</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 20:49:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357696381568-336</Id><Topic><Title>Alex Jones: Best Night of Television Ever</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357690656502</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 19:17:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would have destroyed that loud mouth two-bit #$%$ lunatic.

F'in idiots all of them grad-i-ating from business school. Pay your testers more - they are actually worth more per person then the CEO, etc. And if anyone says this shows the tester wasn't any good, they were probably worried about their mortgage or car payment or checking if they paid a bill or something - if they were paid decently, this wouldn't have happened - I know.</Msg><Username>jjacksgeo</Username><Timestamp>1357704380252</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:06:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357704543171-368</Id><Topic><Title>Wiring problems in the Dreamliner</Title><Username>moneymeyka</Username><Timestamp>1357676064810</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 15:14:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1.

It wasn't a leak, it was a built in safety system to allow excess fuel to be "expelled" like what happened today. If your not aware, all comercial airplanes have a system called "fuel jettison" , the planes are designed with safety features just for this purpose, automaticaly or manually activated depending on the situation, I'm sure today's occurance was automatic and an FAA requirement to do such a thing, but I'll wait for an official announcment to confirm that.</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1357705916189</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:31:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357706237300-372</Id><Topic><Title>Strike is tomorrow word is...............</Title><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1357703835647</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 22:57:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As far as I know there hasn't even been a vote yet to authorize a strike.
