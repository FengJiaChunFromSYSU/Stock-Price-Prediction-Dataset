The Americans With No Abilities Act is being hailed as a major legislative goal by advocates of the millions of Americans who lack any real skills or ambition. "Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society," said California Sen. Barbara Boxer. "We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability (POI) to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they have some idea of what they are doing." In a Capitol Hill press conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pointed to the success of the U.S. Postal Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has an excellent record of hiring Persons with No Ability (63 percent). Under the Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million mid-level positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance. Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given to guarantee upward mobilityfor even the most unremarkable employees. The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that promote a significant number of Persons of Inability (POI) into middle-management positions, and give a tax credit to small and medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires. Finally, the Americans With No Abilities Act contains tough new measures to make it more difficult to discriminate against the non-abled, banning, for example, discriminatory interview questions such as, "Do you have any skills or experience that relate to this job?" "As a non-abled person, I can't be expected to keep up with people who have something going for them," said LaRhonda Wilson-Washington-Lincoln, who lost her position as a lug-nut twister at the GM plant in Flint, Mich., due to her inability to remember righty tighty, lefty loosey. "This new law should be real good for people like me. I&#146;ll finally have job security." With the passage of this bill, Wilson-Washington-Lincoln and millions of other untalented citizens will finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. Said Sen. #$%$ Durbin: "As a senator with no abilities, I believe the same privileges that elected officials enjoy ought to be extended to every American with no abilities. It is our duty as lawmakers to provide each and every American citizen, regardless of his or her inadequacy, with some sort of space to take up in this great nation and a good salary for doing so."</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359214160641</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:29:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359214898793-31</Id><Topic><Title>How much damage in Boston fire?</Title><Username>habu_driver</Username><Timestamp>1359123009123</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:10:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the APU is toast considering how long it took to put out the fire.

The story exploded all over Facebook earlier this week and quickly went viral. It was posted by Jim Garrow, a humanitarian who has helped rescue tens of thousands of Chinese baby girls from infanticide and who was a 2009 nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize. Garrow shared some extremely disturbing information, which was leaked to him by someone he describes as "one of America's foremost military heroes." Here is what he posted on his Facebook page: "Obama is using a new 'litmus test' in determining who will stay and who must go in his military leaders. Get ready to explode folks. 'The new litmus test of leadership in the military is if they will fire on US citizens or not.' Those who will not are being removed." Is it a coincidence that just one day earlier, on Sunday, January 20th, General James Mattis, head of the U.S. Central Command, was told "to vacate his office several months earlier than planned"?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359217762358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:29:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359217909961-37</Id><Topic><Title>****THE AMERICANS WITH NO ABILITIES ACT****</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359214160641</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:29:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The #$%$. and the Raven will be pleased to hear this</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359217909961</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:31:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359218105479-38</Id><Topic><Title>Military leaders are being asked if they will fire on U.S. citizens if ordered.</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359217762358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:29:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sparty - do you remember if Obama ever made comments about having his own special militia several years ago?

I just don't see BA doing that, and instead going for a redesign. I know a lot of people are hope for a quick fix, but it is time to get real as the FAA hasn't found any signs of a defect that could lead to a fast fix. The longer the investigation goes on, the more it iplies it's a battery systems issue that can only be fixed by a major redesign.

The instructor got permission from the school board to teach the class, which probably meant they reviewed the curriculum. I was the atheist. All other students ranged from agnostic to various Christian faiths, some barely religious to some very religious. The instructor was firm Christian, but did an exceptionally good job of presenting the material and teaching the class. Comparative Religion covered most Christian faiths as well as most major religions around the world. It was one of the best and most interesting classes in all 4 years of high school and certainly made me more flexible regarding other people's religions and lack thereof. There was no prayer. There was exchange of knowledge and information. To this day group prayer is a very uncomfortable situation. It is one thing to go to a wedding or a funeral in a church. A person is on their turf, but public school, business meetings, these are no place to assume everyone wants to pray or to listen to others pray. My school years were not too bad regarding religion, but my older sister, who went to the same schools I did but had different teachers experienced some pretty peculiar ideas from her teachers regarding religion. In those days teachers had a lot more liberty in the classroom. Thankfully, those days are past.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1359222066915</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:41:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359222354294-54</Id><Topic><Title>Bulky, so now you want an electoral college</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1359156974566</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 18:36:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tell me you are not the odd man out.

That's at leadership positions the masses have been duped and are willing gulping the Kool-Aid without looking deep into the Party's relations ship with communist and socialist organizations. Neither do they look into how horribly evil communism is. Here's more proof: William F. Jasper New American Jan 25, 2013 It should come as no surprise that the Communist Party USA is on board with President Obama’s plan to attack Americans’ right to keep and bear arms as a means to “end gun violence.” A cardinal feature of communist regimes, like all dictatorships, is the prohibition of private ownership of arms, creating a monopoly of force in the hands of the State. In a January 18 article, People’s World, an official publication of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), declared that “the ability to live free from the fear or threat of gun violence is a fundamental democratic right — one that far supercedes any so-called personal gun rights allegedly contained in the Second Amendment.” The article, entitled, “Fight to end gun violence is key to defending democracy,” written by People’s World labor and politics reporter Rick Nagin, claims that “the right-wing extremists opposing all efforts to curb gun violence are the same forces that rallied behind Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, hoping to undermine every other democratic right as well as the living standards of workers and ordinary Americans.” “It is for that reason,” declares Nagin, “as well as the need to protect public safety, that the same coalition of labor and its allies that worked so hard and effectively to re-elect President Barack Obama must now go all-out to back his common sense proposals for gun law reform.” The Communist Party’s “journalist” continued: As Obama has charged, the extremists recklessly “gin up fear” that the government is coming to take away hunting rifles and personal weapons owned for legitimate self-defense. Led by the hate-mongering leadership of the National Rifle Association, they use a totally fraudulent and only very recent interpretation of the Second Amendment which they falsely claim as necessary for protecting every other freedom contained in the Bill of Rights. However, gun rights advocates don’t need to “gin up fear” that President Obama’s “common sense” proposals will lead to even more onerous infringements than the current calls to ban or restrict so-called “assault weapons”; the gun control zealots have been quite emphatic about intending to severely restrict (and many have called for a total ban on) all privately owned firearms. A December 21 article for the Daily Kos is one of the candid admissions against interest by the Left that the real end goal is a total monopoly of gun ownership by the government. Entitled, “How to Ban Guns: A step by step, long term process,” the regular Daily Kos writer “Sporks” says: The only way we can truly be safe and prevent further gun violence is to ban civilian ownership of all guns. That means everything. No pistols, no revolvers, no semiautomatic or automatic rifles. No bolt action. No breaking actions or falling blocks. Nothing. This is the only thing that we can possibly do to keep our children safe from both mass murder and common street violence. The writer then outlines the piecemeal plan by which the federal government can begin with registration and end up with confiscation. The Daily Kos article also cites the need to delegitimize hunting as well. “We should also segway [sic] into an anti-hunting campaign, like those in the UK,” it says. “By making hunting expensive and unpopular, we can make the transition to a gun free society much less of a headache for us.” Nagin surely must know that it is not merely groundless paranoia exploited by “extremists” inspiring fear that President Obama’s multi-part gun control plan is but the opening wedge in a new drive for ever-expanding federal restrictions and infringements of the Second Amendment. And Nagin surely is aware that his comrades ruling China, Cuba, North Korea, Russia, and other communist countries have never stopped at partial restrictions on private ownership of weapons. As The New American reported recently, Communist China’s ruling mandarins, sounding very much like our own media commentators, have blasted the United States for our “rampant gun ownership.” A Chinese government report last year detailing alleged human rights violations in the United States declares: The United States prioritizes the right to keep and bear arms over the protection of citizens’ lives and personal security and exercises lax firearm possession control, causing rampant gun ownership. More recently, on December 14, 2012, the Beijing regime’s Xinhua news agency editorialized: Twenty-eight innocent people, including 20 primary students, have been slaughtered in a mass shooting at an elementary school in the U.S. state of Connecticut. Their blood and tears demand no delay for the U.S. gun control. “Action speaks louder than words,” concluded the Xinhua editorial. “If Obama wants to take practical measures to control guns, he has to make preparation for a protracted war and considerable political cost.” Communist China, of course, is no paragon of virtue when it comes to liberty, safety, and human rights. Its total ban on private ownership of guns under Mao Tse-tung (Zedong) guaranteed that the Communist Party would have unchallenged power. And, as Professor R. J. Rummel has pointed out in his several published studies on democide (mass murder by governments): Power kills and absolute power kills absolutely. In the case of Communist China, the mass murder by the communist government under Mao was somewhere in the neighborhood of 38 million souls! And China remains a rigidly controlled police state to this day, notwithstanding the limited market reforms that the Party has allowed for pragmatic purposes to obtain the capital and technology it needs to modernize. Only Party officials and the police and military (who must be members of, and be vetted by, the Communist Party) are allowed to possess weapons. Mao’s comrades in Russia, Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin, likewise disarmed the civilian population before initiating mass murder. As did Adolf Hitler and every other “successful” mass-murdering tyrant throughout history. Vladimir Gladkov, a radio propagandist on Vladimir Putin’s “Voice of Russia” program, expressed disappointment on December 20 that the Sandy Hook mass shooting probably would not generate the support President Obama needs to implement his desired gun controls. “Unfortunately, there are grounds for very serious doubt that even after this terrible massacre, a ban on selling weapons will be introduced in the US,” said Gladkov. Again, considering that rigid, absolute, centralized power is the essence of all totalitarian regimes, those regimes must, therefore, automatically strike down all checks and balances that would limit their central authority. It is not surprising that spokesmen for these totalitarian governments would endorse policies that give the government a monopoly on deadly force. The American Founding Fathers, on the other hand, recognized that the armed private citizen is the ultimate check and balance against the centralized monopoly of force which invariably turns tyrannical and deadly. Nagin and People’s World, not surprisingly, side with communist tyrants and deride American commitment to our natural rights enshrined in our Constitution. “The Second Amendment is obsolete and now has been twisted to threaten the basic safety and security of all Americans,” says Nagin. Nagin, according to the profile provided on Keywiki by Trevor Loudon, has been a member of the CPUSA for several decades and a writer for the People’s World and other communist publications since 1970.

We recognize the totalitarian ideology and objectives of Nagin and other communist propagandists when they advocate disarming of civilians and a total monopoly of force in government. Many of the other people advocating the same gun control policies may not have those totalitarian objectives in mind — but by their support of these policies they would lead us down the same deadly path nonetheless.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1359224213749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:16:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359224406967-63</Id><Topic><Title>Military leaders are being asked if they will fire on U.S. citizens if ordered.</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359217762358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:29:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I put the quote up and it is clear that Obama felt that he did not trust the military to protect the public.

Obama's private army Here is how Section 5210 from the ObamaCare bill starts: H. R. 3590-496 (Page 496) SEC. 5210. ESTABLISHING A READY RESERVE CORPS. Section 203 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 204) is amended to read as follows: "SEC. 203. COMMISSIONED CORPS AND READY RESERVE CORPS. "(a) ESTABLISHMENT.- "(1) IN GENERAL.-There shall be in the Service a commissioned Regular Corps and a Ready Reserve Corps for service in time of national emergency. "(2) REQUIREMENT.-All commissioned officers shall be citizens of the United States and shall be appointed without regard to the civil-service laws and compensated without regard to the Classification Act of 1923, as amended. "(3) APPOINTMENT.-Commissioned officers of the Ready Reserve Corps shall be appointed by the President and commissioned officers of the Regular Corps shall be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. "(4) ACTIVE DUTY.-Commissioned officers of the Ready Reserve Corps shall at all times be subject to call to active duty by the Surgeon General, including active duty for the purpose of training. Now, I ask you...currently we have the regular Army, the Marines, The Navy, the Air Force, the National Guard, state and local police, state troopers, first responders, firefighters, EMT, rescue workers of all kinds and in all locations, plus we have the Federal Emergency Management Agency, otherwise known as FEMA. So what exactly does Mr. Obama need a private "ready reserve corps" who are hand-picked by him and report directly to him for? Let's go on with Section 5210 - "(c) PURPOSE AND USE OF READY RESEARCH.- "(1) PURPOSE.-The purpose of the Ready Reserve Corps is to fulfill the need to have additional Commissioned Corps personnel available on short notice (similar to the uniformed service's reserve program) to assist regular Commissioned Corps personnel to meet both routine public health and emergency response missions. "(2) USES.-The Ready Reserve Corps shall- "(A) participate in routine training to meet the general and specific needs of the Commissioned Corps; "(B) be available and ready for involuntary calls to active duty during national emergencies and public health crises, similar to the uniformed service reserve personnel; "(C) be available for backfilling critical positions left vacant during deployment of active duty Commissioned Corps members, as well as for deployment to respond to public health emergencies, both foreign and domestic; and "(D) be available for service assignment in isolated, hardship, and medically underserved communities (as defined in section 799B) to improve access to health services. To boil it all down, President Obama with the stroke of his pen, signed into law a bill that gives him the power to create a standing army of soldiers to carry out his direct orders without consulting anyone. Keep asking yourself, why does Obama need his own army? What would he do with it? Now, keep that thought on one side of your brain, and let's learn about the FEMA camps and REX-84. It just could be the Number One Conspiracy theory out there today - FEMA Camps This didn't start with Obama. It was in place long before he came on the scene. A dentention center in America built to house Americans? Just the very idea...just the very thought of it makes the blood of any true Patriot run cold. How could we ever get to a point where the government would make detention camps for the purpose of holding it's own people? What is FEMA? It stands for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and here is a description taken from the offical FEMA website: "FEMA's mission is to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards. DISASTER. It strikes anytime, anywhere. It takes many forms -- a hurricane, an earthquake, a tornado, a flood, a fire or a hazardous spill, an act of nature or an act of terrorism. It builds over days or weeks, or hits suddenly, without warning. Every year, millions of Americans face disaster, and its terrifying consequences. On March 1, 2003, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) became part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)." source - FEMA.gov So, they have the power to support and help when disaster strikes, that's a good thing. but they also have the power to seize complete control of government and suspend the Constitution if thats "deemed necessary"...and that's a bad thing. Remember, the Ready Reserve Corps that Obama has established also operate as he "deems necessary." All you would have to do to "deem it as necessary" is to have an emergency...like the financial crisis, the healthcare crisis, or right-wing extremists who are out of control. And that takes us to REX-84. Rex 84, short for Readiness Exercise 1984, is a plan by the United States federal government to test their ability to detain large numbers of American citizens in case of civil unrest or national emergency. This project was launched under Reagan, and was headed up by Col. Ollie North now going fully operational under Barry Obama.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359227658398</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:14:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359227769843-73</Id><Title>Boeing Hollowed Out - #$%$ Win</Title><Msg>Good articles linked to this one about Boeing technology and R&amp;D giveaway during the early part of this decade.

In fact, I didn't actually propose that it be done (if it is not welcome) but I was lamenting that God is excoriated, purged like He had fallen out of favor in the Soviet politburo. And some of the reactions (not yours, which is thoughtful) were a tad vehement and full of the appearance of having a form of "righteousness", which is interesting. So we push God out, mostly because of the bullying by a few feigning "offense" and the mini-skirt of constitutional interpretation, and then, with God "good and gone", we fill the vacuum with singing the praises to Obama and some exposés regarding all manner of sexual orientation. You mention that, "prayer is a very uncomfortable situation", yet, we really have to admit, it is just for a small pause in time. I understand that some claim offense and would note the irony that, to many, singing the praises by children at a grade school assembly of a Godlike Obama using the music of an old spiritual song is exceedingly offensive, if not a perversion. And instruction with in-depth discussions of offensive life-styles, consuming great lengths of time in classrooms, is that not also uncomfortable? This is what society wants at this time. In the past, they gave God the credit for blessings and that was done in many private and public settings. Today, society does not want that. God is certainly not interested in being "thanked" by the "thankless". But I would not find it true or honest to intone "comfort" as a reason for banning prayer since comfort is not apparently the priority. Comfort is just an excuse and a "codeword" for our politically correct society.

I may not enforce that federal law.” Broomhead pushed the man sometimes called “America’s toughest sheriff” even further, asking Arpaio if the feds passed a law banning ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, would his deputies confiscate such magazines? “No,” Arpaio said. “My deputies, I said before, I’m going to arm all my deputies – a month ago I said before this – with automatic weapons and semi-automatic weapons. We’re going to be able to fight back. … I don’t care what they say from Washington.” Arpaio expressed a certain camaraderie with many other sheriffs around the country who have similarly warned they will not enforce what they believe to be infringements on the citizens’ 2nd Amendment right to bear arms. Some of the strongest language to that effect has come from Utah, where 28 of the state’s 29 elected sheriffs signed a letter to President Obama warning him not to send federal agents to start confiscating guns. “[M]ake no mistake,” the sheriffs wrote, “as the duly-elected sheriffs of our respective counties, we will enforce the rights guaranteed to our citizens by the Constitution. No federal official will be permitted to descend upon our constituents and take from them what the Bill of Rights – in particular Amendment II – has given them. “We, like you swore a solemn oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,” the sheriffs concluded, “and we are prepared to trade our lives for the preservation of its traditional interpretation.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359245452391</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:10:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359245591306-160</Id><Topic><Title>Gotta go.</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1359242334597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:18:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Raven: "come up with some witty cracks" Gone to look for some "cracks" at the Bath-House ?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359245591306</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:13:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359246578509-161</Id><Topic><Title>Gotta go.</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1359242334597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:18:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is it "witty crack night" at the Kent House of Bath?</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1359246578509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:29:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359246581155-162</Id><Title>You know what Jesus said about the Sabbath</Title><Msg>Iowa beating the point spread tomorrow over the boiler-makers accoroding to the bookies in reno betting large who rubbed my head and said get up and walk away what no more...</Msg><Username>swrordfishiii</Username><Timestamp>1359246581155</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:29:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359246727960-163</Id><Topic><Title>Took two guns to the buyback today.</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1359240630599</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:50:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He spends his days posting under at least 12 to 15 aliases.

However, there was at least one person listening who didn’t give Kerry a pass. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) provided several tense moments as he grilled Kerry for his past support of the past unauthorized attacks by America, his views on what the Constitution allows for military policy and his support for unilateral interventions by America. Paul began by stating that he agrees with the Barack Obama of 2007 who said that the Constitution does not give unilateral power to the President to authorize military attacks. He then asked Kerry, Do you agree with candidate Barack Obama or do you agree with President Obama who took us to war in Libya without congressional authority, unilaterally?” Kerry did say that he supported the War Powers Act of 1973, which was a federal law intended to check the power of the president to authorize military attacks. However, he then went on to state that, “there are occasions which I have supported where a President of the United States has to make a decision immediately and implement that decision, execute on it immediately.” He then recounted his support for Ronald Reagan’s military actions in Grenada, George H. W. Bush’s sending troops into Panama and even Bill Clinton’s military intervention of Bosnia and Kosovo during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He claimed that he believed that Obama’s intervention into the civil war in Libya was “in that tradition.” Paul then made the point that I have often made and that is new laws cannot and should not undermine the Constitution, but they are written everyday. He said, “I would argue that the Constitution has no exceptions for when you are having a tough time or people disagree with you that you just go ahead and do it.” The Kentucky Senator then recalled a younger Kerry, saying, “After Vietnam, you were quite critical of the bombing in Cambodia, because I think you felt it wasn’t authorized by Congress. Has your opinion changed about the bombing in Cambodia?” As soon as Kerry expressed the fact that he still has negative feelings about both Cambodia and the Vietnam Way, Paul asked, “Is Cambodia different than Libya?” “It is because it was an extension of the war that was being prosecuted without the involvement of Congress after a number of years,” Kerry answered. “That’s very different.” “Different length of time, but similar circumstances — a bombing campaign unauthorized by Congress,” Paul responded. “See, the Constitution doesn’t give this kind of latitude to sometimes go to war and to sometimes not go to war.” While Senator Paul pointed to the 2007 candidate Barack Obama and the Constitution stating that it doesn’t allow for such things as Kerry was affirming, Kerry, like most liberals would have none of it and sought to equivocate on the Constitution. “Well look, I respect that. Look, you can be absolutist and apply it to every circumstance. The problem is, it just doesn’t work in some instances when 10,000 people are to be wiped out by a brutal dictator and need to make a quick judgment about engagement, you can’t rely on a Congress that has proven itself unwilling to move after weeks and months.” At this point, personally I wanted to scream, “Yeah, how about years, as in the Senate you are a part of that hasn’t passed a budget in 4 of them!” Additionally, let me say that you are either an absolutist when it comes to the law or you are simply lawless. It is one or the other and since the Constitution is the law of the land, this answer from Senator Kerry should be alone enough for him not to be confirmed for the position of Secretary of State</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359254176691</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:36:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359254650902-176</Id><Title>787 show why mgt bonus plan is flawed</Title><Msg>If you have a bonus tied to cost and schedule, why would you be honest and acknowledge cost overruns and schedule delays?</Msg><Username>america_wants_change</Username><Timestamp>1359254650902</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:44:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359254791882-177</Id><Topic><Title>As for the next Olmpics in Soschi</Title><Username>swrordfishiii</Username><Timestamp>1359245028444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:03:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>39 seconds and a square mile away no stoppin ; along the way go: a kniown liar</Msg><Username>swrordfishiii</Username><Timestamp>1359254791882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:46:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359254877722-178</Id><Topic><Title>National Hero, Sheriff Joe on Unconstitutional and Criminal Gun Confiscation</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359245452391</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:10:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sheriff Joe is the John Wayne of the 21st century!</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1359254877722</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:47:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359255171668-179</Id><Topic><Title>National Hero, Sheriff Joe on Unconstitutional and Criminal Gun Confiscation</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359245452391</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:10:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>anJoes Quote: "we are prepared to trade our lives for the preservation of its traditional interpretation.” sums up what we are facing.

I hated Bush and thought of myself as a Democrat just because I thought there was only two ways to look at a problem....and of Course Bush was HIMSELF abusing the Constitution. I gave up on Kerry when he would not be consistent on his core principles. I thought Kerry would speak out agaisnt illegal wars in the Middle East., since he had done so when he was younger in Vietnam .... How can you protest ONE war in the 1960s without congressional declaration and not condemn one in 2004 I thought...the fact that Kerry was in the same Skull and Bones culb as Bush should have offered a clue and Kerry kept changing his postion on the war as if political manuevering and political gain were more important then ones country. Kerry showed himself to be as hypocrytical and inconsistent as anyone else n the Democratic party. As we now know Obama has taken lying to a whole new absurd Orwellian level. Both parties are corrupt beyond belief ...the only ROCK we have left and the ONLY path to salvation is an adherence to the constituion...or we just have lawlessness.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1359258419594</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:46:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359259753857-193</Id><Topic><Title>Took two guns to the buyback today.</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1359240630599</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:50:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chris, if the .303 is still in it's military configuration and hasn't been butchered (sporterized) I'd be interested and it would be under lock and key.</Msg><Username>gerbilfood4me</Username><Timestamp>1359259753857</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:09:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359259951036-194</Id><Topic><Title>Took two guns to the buyback today.</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1359240630599</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:50:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was going to take a .22 auto pistol in (another Walther ripoff) that has a bad habit of slam firing but I figured it would be a zoo down there.

And the worst part of this is that a safer battery was available for the 787 all along. That safer battery would have come at a cost, however — adding 40 pounds — .01% to the 787′s 502,500 pound maximum takeoff weight. That’s the view of MIT professor, Donald Sadoway, who told the Times that a nickel-cadmium battery would have worked just as well without the little self-immolation problem that afflicts lithium-ion batteries. And the tiny additional weight of nickel-cadmium batteries — which would make the 787 a bit more costly to operate — hardly justified the fire risk of the lithium-ion ones.</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1359261000650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:30:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359262083879-197</Id><Title>The former ussr/cccp have used the scope on the 2014 USA winter Olympic team</Title><Msg>passed all drug tests half-human drones 3-2 no betting aloud</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359262083879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:48:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359262278109-198</Id><Topic><Title>The former ussr/cccp have used the scope on the 2014 USA winter Olympic team</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359262083879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:48:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Joe Biden 9/11</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359262278109</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:51:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359262318046-199</Id><Topic><Title>The former ussr/cccp have used the scope on the 2014 USA winter Olympic team</Title><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359262083879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:48:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jill Biden</Msg><Username>fourmoreprog</Username><Timestamp>1359262318046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:51:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
