Every military action he has taken has been to anger folks int he Middle east with his drone wars and undermine stable non-radical countries turning them over to al Brother QaedaHood with seething hatred for Is.rael. As Clint Eastwood said, "Obama is the greatest hoax in history."

This unlimited QE (quantitative easing) , buying mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and continuing operation twist has the implication of simply having asset prices go up and the money flows down to the Mayfair economy. A Mayfair economy is one which benefits the wealthier and better off in society. This latest round of QE would not help the man on the street. QE helps rich people whose asset prices go up and whose net worth then increases but it doesn't flow to the man on the street who is faced with higher costs of living with price rises. You just have a small economy that is booming but the majority of the economy is damaged by QE. The money printers are responsible for this crisis. If we continue with this expansionist monetary policy we won't be facing a fiscal cliff it will be a fiscal grand canyon. Save your money for the coming crash.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347623234288</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 07:47:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347626874246-12</Id><Title>Myth Rmoney --</Title><Msg>Don't drop out of the race.

Brent crude [LCOCV1 117.16 1.28 (+1.1%) ] rose $1.47 to $117.35 a barrel by 1206 GMT, after reaching a four-month peak of $117.95 in earlier trade. The global North Sea benchmark is on track to end the week up more than 2 percent. U.S. crude [CLCV1 99.49 1.18 (+1.2%) ] rose $1.47 to $99.78 a barrel after hitting a four-month high of $100.42. It is set to close the week up 3 percent. "The Fed will be indirectly adding more liquidity into the asset markets and that money will need to go somewhere and part of it will go into commodities, even if current commodity prices are already at demand destruction levels," said Olivier Jakob, at Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland. The Fed's decision to tie its third bond-buying program directly to economic conditions was an unprecedented step that marked a big escalation in its efforts to drive down U.S. unemployment. The U.S. dollar on Friday fell to a four-month low against the euro [EUR= 1.3098 0.011 (+0.85%) ]due to the Fed action. Losses in the dollar can support dollar-denominated commodities such as oil by making them cheaper to consumers using other currencies. Oil was also boosted by escalating anti-U.S. protests over a film demonstrators consider blasphemous to Islam. Protesters attacked the U.S. embassies in Yemen and Egypt on Thursday, and the United States sent warships towards Libya, where the U.S. ambassador was killed in related violence this week. Demonstrations have also taken place in Kuwait, Iran, Bangladesh, Tunisia, Morocco and Sudan. "Supply risks are lending psychological support," said a Commerzbank research note. "This region, which is so crucial to the supply of oil, is thus far from stable, something that is likely to give rise to a lasting risk premium."</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1347628423381</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 09:13:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347631041638-15</Id><Topic><Title>Navy Seals and no ammunition to protect the Ambassador. say what orders from the top</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1347592053761</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 23:07:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama's Foreign Policy is In the Toilet!

Going back nearly seventy years, the Republicans were doing the same thing to the Democratic Party they are doing now: blaming the incumbents for the economic disaster precipitated by the last GOP administration. President Franklin Roosevelt described how they managed this spin during his time in office. Here are excerpts from an FDR campaign speech (the "Fala" speech) in 1944: The whole purpose of Republican oratory these days seems to be to switch labels. The object is to persuade the American people that the Democratic Party was responsible for the 1929 crash and the depression, and that the Republican Party was responsible for all social progress under the New Deal"... The opposition in this year has already imported into this campaign a very interesting thing, because it is foreign. They have imported the propaganda technique invented by the dictators abroad. Remember, a number of years ago, there was a book, Mein Kampf, written by Hitler himself. The technique was all set out in Hitler's book -- and it was copied by the aggressors of Italy and Japan. According to that technique, you should never use a small falsehood; always a big one, for its very fantastic nature would make it more credible -- if only you keep repeating it over and over and over again. Well, let us take some simple illustrations that come to mind. For example, although I rubbed my eyes when I read it, we have been told that it was not a Republican depression, but a Democratic depression from which this Nation was saved in 1933 -- that this Administration this one today -- is responsible for all the suffering and misery that the history books and the American people have always thought had been brought about during the twelve ill-fated years when the Republican party was in power. Change a few words, and 68 years, and it sounds all too familiar.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1347639757428</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 12:22:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347640251594-31</Id><Title>U of Texas Evacuated, Terrorist Bomb Threat on US Soil...

Carney: Protests not directed at the United States 'This is not a case of protests directed at the United States writ large or at U.S. policy, this is in response to a video that is offensive to Muslims' BY: Washington Free Beacon Staff September 14, 2012 11:59 am White House press secretary Jay Carney said Friday the violent protests throughout the Middle East are not directed at the United States or U.S. policy but are a response to a YouTube video: CARNEY: We also need to understand that this is a fairly volatile situation and it is in response not to United States policy, and not to, obviously, the administration, or the American people, but it is in response to a video, a film that we have judged to be be reprehensible and disgusting. That in no way justifies any violent reaction to it, but this is not a case of protests directed at the United States writ large or at U.S. policy, this is in response to a video that is offensive to Muslims. Again, this is not in any way justifying violence, and we have spoken very clearly out against that and condemned it. And the president is making sure in his conversations with leaders around the region that they are committed as hosts to diplomatic facilities to protect both personnel and buildings and other facilities that are part of the U.S. representation in those countries. The protests which began earlier this week have expanded rapidly across the Middle East on Friday. Protesters attacked the U.S. Embassies in Tunis and Sudan; Tunisian protesters smashed windows and lit fires inside the embassy compound, while gunfire could be heard. Images of a dark column of smoke over the Tunisian site have circulated on the Internet Friday. According to a page on the State Department’s website describing what an embassy is, an attack on an embassy is considered an attack on that country. “Because an embassy represents a sovereign state, any attack on an embassy is considered an attack on the country it represents,” the page reads.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1347641031591</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 12:43:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347641218335-39</Id><Title>Romney said</Title><Msg>That whatever the embassies said was like Obama saying it because it was his administration.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney repeated this heavily-parsed denial at his briefing today (note that he appears to be reading a verbatim statement), only to give a markedly different answer just 45 minutes later: ABC's Jake Tapper notes that the Defense Secretary briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee on the attack, telling Senators that the US Government believes it was a premeditated terrorist act. At first Carney ducks, suggesting that reporters "wait to hear more from administration officials" (does he not qualify?), then concludes that the violent incidents are "under active investigation." So which is it? No indication of premeditation, or substantial indication of premeditation with an ongoing investigation? I'll repeat the point I made earlier: Administration officials are very carefully denying something that nobody is alleging. They're saying, "no, there was no direct, actionable intelligence that the Benghazi mission specifically was at risk of an imminent attack. False, wrong, bad." But the Independent story said the intel warned of attacks on our diplomatic missions in the region more generally. They're not denying that. In fact, they're taking pains to write out statements that sound like broader denials, but that are actually extremely narrow, by design. Even so, might our government have extrapolated which locations were most likely to be in the cross-hairs based on, say, previous bombings and specific threats? From CNN: "A pro-al Qaeda group responsible for a previous armed assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi is the chief suspect in Tuesday's attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya, sources tracking militant Islamist groups in eastern Libya say. They also note that the attack immediately followed a call from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri for revenge for the death in June of Abu Yahya al-Libi, a senior Libyan member of the terror group. The group suspected to be behind the assault -- the Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades -- first surfaced in May when it claimed responsibility for an attack on the International Red Cross office in Benghazi. The following month the group claimed responsibility for detonating an explosive device outside the U.S. Consulate and later released a video of that attack." I wonder if this information was in any of the intelligence briefing books that our president supposedly reads cover-to-cover every single day.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1347651112729</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 15:31:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347651680856-61</Id><Title>Montana's Good Common Sense</Title><Msg>Montana's constitutional amendment setting it as state policy that 'corporations are not people' has a wide lead for passage right now with 53% of voters saying they support it to 24% who are opposed.

State Department sets up 24-hour monitoring team for embassy crisis Posted By Josh Rogin Friday, September 14, 2012 - 2:21 PM The State Department has gone into full-blown crisis mode, organizing a round-the-clock effort to coordinate the U.S. government's response to the expanding attacks on U.S. embassies in the Middle East and North Africa. "The State Department has stood up a 24-hr monitoring team to insure appropriate coordination of information and our response. In addition, our consular team is working with missions around the world to protect American citizens and issue appropriate public warden information," a senior State Department official told reporters Friday afternoon. "We have been monitoring events in the Middle East and North Africa intensively today, and working with our personnel and missions overseas and host governments to strengthen security in all locations and to respond effectively where protests have turned violent," the official said. The official noted that U.S. embassies in Libya and Yemen have been reinforced with Marine FAST teams and noted that other unspecified measures are being taken to strengthen embassy security around the region. The State Department is working with the governments in Tunisia and Sudan to increase security at the U.S. embassies there as well, the official said. The U.S. Embassy in Tunis was breached by rioters who replaced the American flag with the black banner of al Qaeda. According to Tunisian state television, at least three Tunisians died when security forces open fire in an effort to disperse the crowd; another rioter was killed in Sudan, Reuters reported. "The secretary, other department principals, and our ambassadors and charges in the field have been in constant contact with regional leaders, and we appreciate the many public statements that leaders have made in recent days condemning the attack in Benghazi, denouncing violence and calling for calm," the official said. The White House said in a memorandum to Congress Friday that the Marine FAST teams will be there are long as they are needed but will be limited to the mission of protecting U.S. assets and personnel. "Although these security forces are equipped for combat, these movements have been undertaken solely for the purpose of protecting American citizens and property. These security forces will remain in Libya and in Yemen until the security situation becomes such that they are no longer needed," the White House memorandum stated.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1347656920977</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:08:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347656942743-70</Id><Title>Boeing stock price goes down while the stock market goes up ?</Title><Msg>After a two day run up in the Dow Jones only Boeing and a few other Dow Jones stocks actually lost the shareholders money, so for you Boeing shareholders better move out of that dead cat bounce stock and move to better stocks like apple or bac. , Also if BA goes down in a 200 plus tow day run up then what happens when the stock market goes down with your stock price? apple up for the past two days BAC up for the past two days , most good stocks seem to go up with the stock market and Boeing is gone down, as the number one Boeing Employee is not worried about EADS and BAE forming a company much larger than Boeing, wow no wonder your stock price is down on the year 2.82% and apple is up 70.69% and BAC is up 71.76% YTD.

Thanks, Obama, You Economic Fool!</Title><Msg>Egan-Jones Analyst Hints At US Rating Downgrade Post QE3 By Market News International || September 13, 2012 at 19:30 GMT –QE3 To Lead To higher Unemployment, Stall US Growth Within Months –’We Are Not Receiving QE3 Positively’ By Yali N’Diaye WASHINGTON (MNI) – The latest round of quantitative easing announced Thursday by the Federal Reserve will almost certainly trigger a rating downgrade by Egan-Jones. Already the rating agency had warned on Wednesday when it affirmed the U.S. rating at AA that “QE3 will likely trigger a negative action.” Given that the outlook is already negative (AA-), a downgrade to AA- would be a logical next step for the rating agency. “We are not receiving QE3 positively,” Vice President and co-manager of the ratings’ desk Bill Hassiepen told MNI Thursday, while the fiscal situation is a “nightmare.” While the Fed is seeking to support economic growth through its quantitative easing, Hassiepen argued that the central bank’s “massive monetization” is instead causing “sluggish to stagnant economic growth.” In fact, he expects growth to become stagnant within six months as a result of the Fed’s policy. The reason the country does not have a weaker rating, he said, is that it remains “the only viable reserve currency in the world.” The Federal Reserve Open market Committee said Thursday it “agreed today to increase policy accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month,” but did not announce an end date. At the same time, it will continue its Operation Twist through the end of the year as it is currently scheduled, while “maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.” The Federal Reserve’s “money printing,” Hassiepen said, has not “really contributed to the improvement in the general economy” so far. Instead, all it has done is increase inflation and the cost structure in the general economy, as will the new round of QE just announced Thursday. “We actually think this is going to cause unemployment, not employment,” he said. the Fed’s policy will reduce household’s disposable income and raising costs will also “lead companies to lay off people,” he said. “Let’s say six months from now, you might see job actions” in some of the more commodity-sensitive industries that are particularly vulnerable to an increase in commodity prices and a weak dollar, he predicted. “This is going to cause the economy to completely stagnate,” he said, expecting the effect to start within three or four months. He first expects a “rapid uptick in gasoline and food prices,” which will affect households’ disposable income. This in turn will take several months to work its way through into the general economy. “People are going to feel nostalgic for the 1.7% for the last quarter,” he said, referring to the second quarter GDP growth. “Unfortunately we have a Federal Reserve that simply does not recognize the inflationary impact of food and energy prices any longer,” he said. He expects another “massive uptick in the speculation in the strategic commodities and energy markets.” Speculators, he said, hedge themselves against a depreciating dollar by “boosting up the cost of the commodity.” “They have been doing it since 2004 and it’s worked,” he said. While the Fed’s policy is increasing the costs structure in the economy, he said wages are stagnant. “You don’t have the buying power in the economy,” he argued, and buying more securities won’t resolve that issue. Hassiepen also stressed that “the United States’ financial flexibility is almost gone given $16 trillion in debt,” which is 104% of GDP, and there is no real plan to put “the fiscal house under control.” In fact, even sequestration would not solve the problem of U.S. deficits, he said</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1347657600586</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:20:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347657875295-72</Id><Topic><Title>Montana's Good Common Sense</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1347651680856</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 15:41:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1347657875295</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:24:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347657984386-73</Id><Title>Who is in Charge of American Foreign Policy? Obama or Hillary's State Department? Obama Doesn't Know</Title><Msg>Obama is "Leading" From Behind! State Department corrects Obama, says Egypt is an ally Published September 14, 2012 Will 'inconsistent' WH foreign policy hurt the US? Is Egypt an 'ally' of the US? Obama campaign adviser defends president's foreign... The State Department, cutting through the confusion over President Obama's claim that Egypt is not a U.S. ally, contradicted his characterization Thursday. For the record, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, Egypt is considered a major non-NATO ally. The comment came as White House aides also carefully clarified the president's remarks. The president made the initial statement in an interview with the Spanish-language Telemundo. "I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we do not consider them an enemy," Obama said, reacting to the ongoing and intense demonstrations outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. The comment raised eyebrows, considering that Egypt - at least before the fall of Hosni Mubarak -- has long been among the top U.S. allies in the Middle East along with Saudi Arabia and Israel. And legally, it is still considered a major "non-NATO" ally, as Nuland confirmed. Nuland and White House aides, though, tried to at the same time suggest that Obama was referring to the fact that Egypt is not part of any formal NATO treaty. "'Ally' is a legal term of art. We don't have a mutual defense treaty with Egypt like we do with our NATO allies. But as the president has said, Egypt is long-standing and close partner of the United States, and we have built on that foundation by supporting Egypt's transition to democracy and working with the new government," White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said in a statement. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the same, claiming Obama was referring to the lack of an alliance treaty with Egypt. But they made clear that Egypt is a major partner, noting that Obama spoke Wednesday with President Mohammad Morsi Not everyone was in the same page, though. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday would not go so far as to say Egypt is or will be a U.S. ally. "We'll see," she said. Pelosi's comment and Obama's original comment indeed reflected concern about the direction of Egypt's post-Mubarak government, heavy with the presence of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1347657984386</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:26:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347658158010-74</Id><Title>God Bless President Obama !!!</Title><Msg>...and God Bless the USA!!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1347658158010</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:29:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347658358016-75</Id><Topic><Title>Montana's Good Common Sense</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1347651680856</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 15:41:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Corporations are a Conglomeration of People, Called ShareHolders If you are Economically Astute, You Would be a Shareholder as Well.
