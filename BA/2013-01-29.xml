But, that monitoring and control circuit that is inside the case, is battery specific. And it is complicated, and it must be able to control the charge and discharge for each individual cell to work properly. Once you have that, you don't need an external circuit to monitor the battery. Monitoring the battery does no good, unless you have the ability to control the charge rate, AT THE CELL LEVEL. And I don' t believe that containment is a feasible option. It would be less mass to simply use a different battery chemistry than to build a containment vessel capable of withstanding a thermal run away. This is there main issue. And yes, they wouldn't have to change their charging system if you are considering that as simply an energy source to the battery. They need a new battery subsystem and that means the charge and control circuitry for it. And I believe that they are months away from a real solution.</Msg><Username>madrusky</Username><Timestamp>1359435670200</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 00:01:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359435782860-2</Id><Topic><Title>Guess how long it takes BA to fix 787 battery problems</Title><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1359401341552</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:29:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>McNerney will announce that it is the unions fault during the earnings report.</Msg><Username>steinberger1us</Username><Timestamp>1359435782860</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 00:03:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359442351509-3</Id><Topic><Title>Sarah Palin By The Numbers: or The Price of Stupidity</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1359399270021</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 13:54:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL!

In point of fact Asymetric warfare using only small arms against technologically superior foes who possess Nukes is waged everyday.

I bet the idiot (Stonecipher) is living in luxury off his ill gotten gains from McDonnel Douglas and Boeing. The guy should be in jail, but as long as everyone follows the wall street shills (Goldman Sachs et. al.) this kind of behavior is encouraged. The question remains can Boeing become an engineering company again or will it remain a bastion of MBA clowns who have no clue how to engineer but sure know how to pay themselves. Boeing has only one way to go with the current BOD and CEO team in place. One more generation and this former giant of manufacturing and engineering will be sunk. The guys at the top really are all hollow men, they don't have a clue how to run Boeing. They are good at presenting themselves as if they had control of the ship even as it heads for the rocks. You will see them during their earnings presentations; no doubt, no self-reflection, no-humbleness, and no-solution.

We also gave kudos to Vice President Biden for acknowledging that the statistic might not be accurate. So we said we would be watching carefully for how the statistic would be used by gun-control advocates in the future Turns out according to even the Washington Post, that number is far from accurate. Cash purchase from gun, hardware or department store, from pawnshop, or from seller at gun show, flea market or military, or through mail that respondent says “yes” was FFL [federally licensed dealer]: 22 percent Add cash purchase from seller at gun show, flea market or military, or though the mail that respondent says “probably was/think so:” 20 percent Add cash purchases, trades with family, friends/acquaintance that respondent says are or probably are FFL: 14 percent In other words, rather than being 30 to 40 percent (the original estimate of the range) or “up to 40 percent” (Obama’s words), gun purchases without background checks amounted to 14 to 22 percent. And since the survey sample is so small, that means the results have a survey caveat: plus or minus six percentage points. So, do we really need new "universal background checks?" Marion P. Hammer says absolutely not, there are already plenty of laws on the books. That’s what “universal background checks” do. They turn traditional innocent conduct into a criminal offense. They target you, law-abiding gun owners. Universal background checks are background checks on EVERY transfer, sale, purchase, trade, gift, rental, and loan of a firearm between any and all individuals. All background checks must be conducted through a federally licensed dealer. (costing hard earned cash) Universal background checks have nothing to do with gun shows – they are about you. It is ALREADY a federal felony to be engaged in the business of buying and selling firearms and ammunition without having federal firearm dealers license. It is ALREADY a crime for a federally licensed dealer to sell a gun without doing a background check – that’s all dealers, everywhere, including at retail stores, gun shows, flea markets or anywhere else. Further, it is ALREADY a federal felony for any private person to sell, trade, give, lend, rent or transfer a gun to a person you know or should have known is not legally allowed to own, purchase or possess a firearm. The penalty for selling a gun to a person who is a criminal, mentally ill, mentally incompetent, alcohol abuser or drug abuser is 10-year federal felony. That’s now, today, with no changes to the law. It is even a federal felony to submit false information on a background check form for the purpose of purchasing a firearm. Even so, according to a 2012 report to the Department of Justice, more than 72,000 people were turned down on a gun purchase in 2010 because they didn’t pass the background check.

Even with the public relations nightmare and the tense contract negotiations with a labor union factored out, expectations aren’t that high. Analysts predicting a 9.2 percent year-over-year decline in net income share, on a 14 percent rise in revenue to $22.36 billion.. That is bad making less with more is not good, that means a lot of overhead like executives giving themselves too much money for failure. Results falling in line with expectations would echo similar progress made by the company last quarter. That is, falling profit and rising revenue could become a trend. The company has many plane orders but that is not the whole story. . But Boeing has already invested $32 billion to develop the 787 dreamliner plane, and the battery fiasco could push the company into a costly rut. An expected production ramp could also be delayed because of the issues. Boeing will head into Wednesdays earning report with a number of bad news bears in tow. A conference call later in the day will probably yield some Q&amp;A about the ongoing investigation, but it seems unlikely that Boeing would wait until the call to reveal good news, and even more unlikely that it would willingly reveal any bad news that it didn’t have to. Speculation has grown since fleets of the 787 were grounded around the world, and the cost to carriers will be passed to Boeing shareholders for the 787 groundings. While everyone waits with bated breath to figure out who they can point their fingers at and blame for the whole mess, a number of whistleblowers, who tried to raise safety concerns about the battery six years ago, have made their way into the media spotlight. Kelly Nantel, NTSB director of public affairs, confirmed the NTSB was pursuing information provided by “more than one” whistleblower, but reportedly decline to comment further.

Martin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Region 8 Administrator in Denver, used a private email account to conduct official business in possible violation of federal open government and record-keeping laws, The Washington Examiner has learned." "The October 2012 memo was generated in response to a growing clamor in Congress and elsewhere about the use by then-EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson of a fake email name - "Richard Windsor" - to conduct official business in a manner that would not be accessible to FOIA requestors or federal record-keeping purposes. Jackson resigned in December 2012 to return to private life. She has not since said what her next job, though she has been reportedly been considered for a leadership position at Rutgers University in her native New Jersey. Jackson's actions were detailed in a book published last year and written by Washington attorney Christopher Horner and entitled "The Liberal War Against Transparency." Citing multiple sources, including GAO and EPA memos, Horner described a practice apparently dating from the Clinton administration in which top federal environmental officials used private email accounts and fake names on government email accounts to communicate illegally with each other and coordinate actions and policies with political and ideological allies outside the government. Several House committees are conducting probes of the Windsorgate scandal and Vitter has made it a top priority of his work on the Senate panel.

Or, if it's 2013 and you're the Republican party, if you can't beat them, change the rules of the game so you can at least give yourself a shot. After President Obama swept all seven "toss-up" battleground states in the 2012 election, Republicans in Pennsylvania and Virginia, cheered on by national leaders of the party like RNC Chief Reince Priebus, have proposed bills to rig the way that electoral votes are counted in these states to favor a Republican candidate. Currently, the winner of the statewide vote takes all state electoral votes (except in Nebraska and Maine, neither of which offer a large number of electoral votes like larger battleground states). Under the system being proposed by Republicans, electoral votes would be allocated by congressional district, so that whichever presidential candidate received more votes in a given congressional district would win one electoral vote for that district. In Pennsylvania, the winner of the state popular vote would then be awarded two additional electoral votes. However, it's even worse in Virginia, where those two extra electoral votes would be awarded to the candidates who won the most districts in total. It might sound complicated, but when you play it out, it's clear that this is an affront to democracy. An argument could be made that if all states allocated their electoral votes this way (don't hold your breath if you're waiting for Republican-controlled Texas to move towards this kind of system), it would be more fair than the current system. The problem with that hypothetical is that partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts in state after state has assured that districts are not representative of these states as a whole. Democrats have been packed in a few districts to assure the maximum number of Republican congressmen. It's the same reason that while nationally, Democrats received 1.1 million more votes than Republicans in congressional races, Republicans still enjoy a 33-seat margin in the House. Republicans are even bragging about it -- the Republican State Leadership Committee put out a report last week entitled "How a Strategy of Targeting State Legislative Races in 2010 Led to a Republican U.S. House Majority in 2013." And as a ThinkProgress post lays out: The report credits gerrymandered maps in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin with allowing Republicans to overcome a 1.1 million popular-vote deficit. In Ohio, for instance, Republicans won 12 out of 16 House races "despite voters casting only 52 percent of their vote for Republican congressional candidates." The situation was even more egregious to the north. "Michiganders cast over 240,000 more votes for Democratic congressional candidates than Republicans, but still elected a 9-5 Republican delegation to Congress." In 2012, President Obama won Virginia with just over 51 percent of the vote. But under the Republican-proposed system of allocating votes, Obama would have received just four electoral votes while Mitt Romney would have received nine. Raise your hand if that sounds right. No one? President Obama won Pennsylvania by 5.2 percent -- under the original plan proposed in Pennsylvania that would have meant 13 electoral votes for Romney and seven for Obama There are other states where Republicans control both chambers and the governorship where this kind of bill could move forward. If Wisconsin had adopted the Virginia plan, Romney would have won 7 electoral votes and Obama would have taken only 3 electoral votes despite the fact that Obama won by 7percent of the statewide popular vote. In Florida, where Obama won 50percent - 49percent, the electoral vote allocation would have been Romney 18, Obama 11. Put simply - this doesn't pass the sniff test. As Ari Berman pointed out for The Nation, if Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia, Florida, and Pennsylvania had all adopted this vote-splitting plan for the 2012 election, Romney would have garnered 270 electoral votes and won the presidency. It's important to note that Republicans in Pennsylvania tried to pass a similar law prior to the 2012 election. The same state senator pushing the bill in 2013, Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi, introduced the same bill in 2011. Understandably, the bill was met with strong resistance from Democrats, but that wasn't the reason the bill died on the vine. The most effective pushback came from GOP congressmen who were wary of driving more Democratic campaign resources into close congressional districts. For example, Republicans representing the swing suburbs of Philadelphia were rightfully concerned that Democrats would move resources from safe, urban districts to suburban districts in an attempt to pick up a handful of extra electoral votes, making those Republican congressmen more vulnerable in their seats. Take a look at the vote share President Obama won in congressional districts won by Republicans. The data shows at least 38 districts where Obama won 47 percent of the vote or more. If states move toward allocating electoral votes by congressional district, that's at least 38 incumbent Republican congressmen who can expect an influx of Democratic spending in their districts because they offer a chance for the Democratic presidential nominee to pick up electoral votes. We can be sure those GOP congressmen won't be happy about that idea. Beyond that, the system would present a new problem for the GOP -- increased scrutiny of their gerrymandered state maps. This change could be subject to DOJ scrutiny and potential legal challenges under the Voting Rights Act, which in part requires that changes not limit the voting strength of minorities. If the suggested changes to allocating electoral votes happened in, say, Virginia, where the majority of the African American population is packed into four congressional districts, African American voters would go from being able to elect a presidential candidate with 13 electoral votes to only awarding that candidate four electoral votes. Again, the legalities are complicated, but the result is not -- a move to rig the Electoral College could mean the end, once and for all, to the current Republican gerrymandered congressional maps. Will it work? Unclear. But be aware and make your opposition known. Attend hearings at the state capitol if possible. This is a stealth attack on democracy until voters expose it. America Votes and its partners are making all progressive groups in these vulnerable states aware of this pending legislation and will be pushing back like we did in Pennsylvania in 2011. As if severely gerrymandered congressional districts didn't undermine our democracy enough, we won't stand for partisan legislators seeking to add insult to injury by forever skewing election results. In the meantime, maybe Republicans will realize that the smart way out of the political wilderness is not by rigging the Electoral College, but by making honest assessment of their party priorities against the backdrop of changing demographics around them.

See this snippet: Some analysts say the 787 problems appear to be relatively easy to fix, perhaps by swapping in a different battery type. But even so, Boeing still faces a longer-term review of its design, manufacturing and assembly processes by the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA has not set a time frame for its wide-ranging investigation, which is aimed at dealing with an assortment of problems with the new jet. An electrical fault caused an emergency landing by a United Airlines (UAL) plane on December 4, the same day that the FAA ordered inspections of fuel lines because of leaks. A few weeks later, a 787 in Boston spilled about 40 gallons of fuel on the tarmac as it taxied for take-off. Then a plane in Japan had fuel leaks. Another had brake problems and a third had a cracked cockpit windscreen.</Msg><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1359483331630</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:15:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359483361233-82</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's EPA Officials Use Alias Email Account And Violate Law</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1359477766293</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 11:42:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooz it was a reference to Chris Matthews who implicitly accepted and believed everything Obama said he would do as president.

It is also the part of the brain where our emotions emanate and where many human drives such as fight or flight, sex, etc., reside. In animals it is the center for what we call instinct. At one time humans were more like animals and depended more on instinct, but as man evolved he developed larger and larger frontal lobes giving man the advantage of being able to think at a much higher level than animals. So when you call me a pig face as opposed to making a rational comment, you are relying on your amygdala in your response rather than your frontal lobes and in doing so demonstrate behavior much more like an animal ie. pig, that you project on me. ;-)</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1359485106784</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:45:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359486659765-89</Id><Title>Stock AlertProjected biggest mover in February (YTRV)</Title><Msg>TARGET PRICE $1.00</Msg><Username>trades.western</Username><Timestamp>1359486659765</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 14:10:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359487585243-90</Id><Title>x6xxx234 Lied About Gun Background Checks</Title><Msg>x6xxx like most gun crooks wants to be able to give guns to criminals, ex cons, mentally ill children and so on rather than use comprehensive background checks- x6xxx belongs in the slammer along with the rest of the gun criminals</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1359487585243</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 14:26:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359488212276-91</Id><Topic><Title>Am I tjhe only one seeing this?</Title><Username>foxgang7878</Username><Timestamp>1359483678557</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:21:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are not the only one.

This report was written in July 2009, (8 months after the fire), and the Navy had yet to determine the cause of the fire !! They gave up and scrapped the program. "The Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) submersible suffered major damage during a fire Nov. 9 while the craft was recharging its lithium-ion batteries at a special base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. No one was severely hurt in the accident, but the fire burned for several hours before it was extinguished. Although an investigation still hasn’t determined what caused the fire, the Navy estimates repairs to the 60-ton craft would cost $237 million, or $180 million more than the craft’s operating budget, and take nearly three years to complete."</Msg><Username>madrusky</Username><Timestamp>1359501317720</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 18:15:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359501492655-147</Id><Topic><Title>NTSB is having Navy look at the batteries</Title><Username>madrusky</Username><Timestamp>1359500821207</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 18:07:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah and I heard the batteries on my dog's collar started on fire and it would take $50 to repair.

They were correct a battery charging issue is not reportable. However along with this other battery blowups it is reportable. seems like Boeing who knew and ANA were trying to hid it. NSTB in its diclosures would have mention this. So it looks like Boeing was hiding it from the NSTB. The hole just keeps getting deeper.
