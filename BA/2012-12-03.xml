The move marks the third recall for burning 1.6-liter turbocharged engines in the new Escape, a cornerstone of Ford's plans to lure buyers with smaller, more efficient vehicles. The previous two recalls earlier this year had been triggered by a lose coolant cap that could spew engine coolant and a weak gas line. Ford also told owners in the gas line recall to stop driving, but vowed to fix that within two weeks. Ford says no injuries have been linked to the new problem, which it didn't immediately identify. It says owners in the United States and Canada of any 2013 Escape or Fusion with the 1.6-liter engine should call their dealer immediately, and the dealer would arrange for loaner vehicles until the problem can be repaired. The issue doesn't affect owners of Fusion and Escapes with other engines. One hint of the problems come from an October complaint to federal auto safety officials from a 2013 Ford Escape owner, who said a few days having the two previous engine fire recalls completed, their Escape broke down on the freeway and burned. "There was a 'pop' sound in the engine area. Instantly, the accelerator had no response, the high engine temperature warning light came on, and then all warning lights, gauges, &amp; tachometer all went dead. Luckily, we were adjacent to an exit ramp, and we coasted to a stop...Immediately, white steam came out of the engine compartment. Knowing the third recall dealt with the "risk of engine fires", we got out, and moved well away from the vehicle. Within minutes, brown, oily smoke came out from under the hood. Then flames came out from under the hood, at the windshield and out the sides of the engine compartment. Then the car burst into flames and was destroyed. The owner added: "We feel we are lucky to be alive!" Other automakers have ordered owners to stop driving vehicles due to safety recalls in the past, but have been able to say how long repairs might take. After winning a reputation for better quality vehicles than its Detroit competition, quality issues have been rising on several new Ford models. The automaker has said it was missing its own targets for quality this year, and cited the high pace of new models as one reason. Given how strongly Ford has staked its future on its EcoBoost turbo engine line -- with millions of copies sold and now featured in Ford models from the Fiesta to the F-Series -- the costs from any lingering worry of engine fires could rise rapidly. Ford says U.S. owners with questions can call 866-436-7332 and Canadian customers can call 888-222-7814.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1354512646891</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 00:30:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354535950356-3</Id><Title>Geithner: Raise U.S. debt limit to infinity</Title><Msg>Geithner: Raise U.S. debt limit to infinity Ethan A. Huff Natural News Dec 2, 2012 The elaborate Ponzi scheme officially known as the U.S. financial system is set to completely transform into a Monopoly-style fantasy economy where money and debt are both meaningless and limitless. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has actually come out with a proposal that the American debt ceiling be completely eliminated, allowing the crooks that run the federal government to print as much phony debt currency as their hearts desire, and spend away into oblivion. During a recent interview on Bloomberg TV, Geithner told Political Capital‘s Al Hunt that the Congressionally-established debt ceiling, which was specifically designed to establish reasonable limits on the amount of money the federal government can borrow, should be completely abolished. Even though Congress is the only entity that can make such a decision, Geithner expressed his belief that the limit be scrapped to avoid its being used as “a tool for political advantage.” “It would have been time a long time ago to eliminate it,” said a nervous Geithner to Hunt, after being asked when he believed the debt ceiling should be eliminated. “The sooner the better.” The so-called debt ceiling is virtually meaningless anyway, as Congress has already voted dozens of times in years past to raise it every time the national debt approaches a breach. But a permanent lifting of any sort of debt ceiling will officially seal the deal, and drive the last nail in the coffin for the American economy, which is today built solely on debt rather than actual monetary currency. Geithner proposal part of ‘Cloward-Piven’ strategy to collapse national economy Geithner’s suggestion also seems to follow the playbook of the infamous Cloward-Piven strategy to the tee, which is built on the idea of intentionally crashing the existing U.S. economy for the purpose of rebuilding it in the image of socialist ideals. Part of this strategy includes deliberately destroying the nation’s currency by accumulating large amounts of unsustainable debt, none of which can ever truly be paid off and settled. “The [Cloward-Piven strategy] taught that if you flooded the welfare rolls and bankrupted the cities and ultimately the nation, it would foster economic collapse, which would lead to political turmoil so severe that socialism would be accepted as a fix to an out-of-control set of circumstances,” wrote Jeannie DeAngelis for American Thinker about this malevolent agenda. “Combine class warfare, demonizing the rich, getting as many people onto the welfare rolls as possible, and pushing the economic system to collapse and you have a flawless formula for Cloward-Piven 2.0.” This appears to be the precise strategy behind eliminating the debt ceiling, as federal government controllers would truly have a limitless bank account from which to continue swelling the welfare state and spending the nation into complete collapse. And once the system eventually collapses in on itself, as planned, the masses will be begging for their own enslavement in the form of full nanny state provisions and complete government tyranny</Msg><Username>spartacus8463</Username><Timestamp>1354535950356</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 06:59:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354536449837-4</Id><Topic><Title>LMAO at the WHINEY Loser republican RUBES!

Well, I am not the one saying this. Law enforcement authorities all over the country are telling citizens that they can no longer deal with all the crime and that people need to lock their doors and prepare to defend their families. Just recently, the city attorney of San Bernardino, California told citizens to "lock their doors and load their guns" because there is not enough money to pay for adequate police protection any longer. The murder rate in San Bernardino is up 50 percent this year, but the city is dealing with bankruptcy and has been forced to lay off 80 police officers. But San Bernardino is not the only city dealing with this kind of a thing. In Oakland, burglaries are up 43 percent so far this year, and to say that there is a "crime wave" going on in Oakland would be a massive understatement. If you can believe it, in Oakland "more than 11,000 homes, cars or businesses have been broken into so far this year – translating to about 33 burglaries a day." Sadly, there simply are not enough police to keep up with it all. Due to budget cuts, it is being projected that by February the size of the police force in Oakland will be about 25 percent smaller than it was back in 2008. But what is happening in Detroit is perhaps even more frightening. Today there are about 1,000 fewer police officers in Detroit than there was a decade ago. But crime just continues to rise. So now even the police are telling people to "enter Detroit at your own risk". With very little police protection, an increasing number of citizens are taking matters into their own hands. As I noted in a previous article, justifiable homicide in the city of Detroit increased by 79 percent in 2011, and the rate of self-defense killings in Detroit is approximately 2200 percent above the national average. But don't laugh at what is happening in cities like San Bernardino, Oakland and Detroit. What is happening in those cities will be coming to your community soon enough. From coast to coast, criminals are becoming increasingly bold and increasingly desperate. My sister lives near a large city in the middle part of the country, and a house across the street from the one her family just moved into was recently vandalized. The criminals took all of the exposed copper pipe and copper wire that could be accessed easily. Other criminals have become very focused on gold because it has soared in value and it is easy to resell. For example, there have been more than 250 gold chain robberies in Stockton, California just since the month of April. According to the CBS News affiliate in Sacramento, criminals are just ripping these chains right off of the necks of unsuspecting citizens, and many of the victims that have tried to resist have ended up getting hurt. Normally the criminals sell off the jewelry within 24 hours, so solving these crimes is a real challenge...</Msg><Username>spartacus8463</Username><Timestamp>1354536648934</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 07:10:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354539817955-6</Id><Topic><Title>What is the advantage</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1354498713561</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 20:38:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree with the fish for a change.

Did the world just wake up to the idea that the only way out of this quagmire is a twisted currency war that appears to have re-ignited thanks to Abe's efforts? Something appears to have snapped in the American psyche as the last 30 days have seen the largest physical gold sales on record. Between the search volume for 'bulk ammo' and this, we fear something is afoot and while Congress fiddles as our economy burns, Bernanke going 'back to work' is perhaps what the physical 'horders' are thinking... or maybe they understand, as we noted here, that just as Kyle Bass has confirmed previously, Paper Gold is just like allocated, unambiguously owned physical bullion... until it’s not.” Paper money is a promise.......and when you can no longer trust the people who print the promises.....there are alternatives.

Credit cards maxed out, economy ain’t growing and taxing the nation’s most prolific wealth producers is counter productive, revenue-wise. It sooths the jealousy and envy of the mediocre class but as always, the mediocre class will pay the price for their jealousy and it will be very costly. That’s why most will stay forever locked in mediocrity or they will slip back into poverty. History always repeats it’s self. And some people never learn that insanity is when you keep doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. So, the nation has no growth, insufficient revenue to cover expenses, expenses growing rapidly, credit maxed and government muggers lusting after your wealth. What to do? First – get the bulk of your wealth out of reach the government. Already, ten trillions dollars is being kept out of the reach of government thieves. "Once one accepts the principle of self-ownership, what's moral and immoral becomes self-evident. Murder is immoral because it violates private property. Rape and theft are also immoral -- they also violate private property. Here's an important question: Would rape become morally acceptable if Congress passed a law legalizing it? You say: "What's wrong with you, Williams? Rape is immoral plain and simple, no matter what Congress says or does!" If you take that position, isn't it just as immoral when Congress legalizes the taking of one person's earnings to give to another? Surely if a private person took money from one person and gave it to another, we'd deem it theft and, as such, immoral. Does the same act become moral when Congress takes people's money to give to farmers, airline companies or an impoverished family? No, it's still theft, but with an important difference: It's legal, and participants aren't jailed." -- Walter Williams</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1354550668746</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:04:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354551525397-15</Id><Topic><Title>Yes, the Collapse is Coming</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1354548605200</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 10:30:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The children and grandchildren of the moocher/looter class will be the masses that suffer the greatest.

It WILL always be about Obama. Obama is the focus of all that has ever been or shall ever be good. As that idot Jamie Foxs said, Obama is “our Lord and Savior” and we are not permitted to forget that. Do you remember when Obama made his first state visit to England? He needed a gift for the Queen. Hmmmm now what do you get for a Queen: How about …. ….. an iPod containing Obama’s greatest speeches! Do you remember when Neil Armstrong died? Now for those of you educated in government schools, Neil Armstrong was the first man to set foot on the moon. Obama decided that he needed to post some sort of a tribute to Armstrong. So … a picture was released …. ….Of Obama looking at the moon! Recently we celebrated the 55th anniversary of Rosa Parks refusing to take her seat at the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Obama decided that he needed to post some sort of a tribute to Rosa Parks. So …. A picture was released …. …… Of Obama looking out the window of Rosa Parks’ bus! Let me tell you something about Obama and Rosa Parks. That brave lady made her stand in 1957. That was 22 years before Obama first came to live in America. Now don’t give me this load of yak squeeze about him living in Hawaii. I lived there too, and living in Hawaii in those years, even now, is not living in America. You are not immersed in American culture; you’re immersed in Hawaiian and Polynesian culture. You are not taught American history beyond mere basics; you are taught Hawaiian and Polynesian history. The native Hawaiians consider themselves as having been colonized by The United States. I bring this up to say this …. When Obama came to America in 1979 he didn’t have a clue who or what Rosa Parks was. For all he knew Rosa Parks was a botanical garden in Los Angeles. This is a narcissistic tool who has no real connection, other than the color of his skin, with the black experience in America. In short, he’s a fraud – but a fraud who is embraced by many blacks for no other reason than the reflectivity of his epidermis. And now that I’ve stepped in it already … let me just add this. (Oh boy, this is gonna stir the puddin’). One of the things that is going to have to happen if this country of ours is going to be salvaged is for black Americans to grow up and get rid of this immense racial chip so many are fond of carrying around on their shoulders everywhere they go. A candidate for any political office is not automatically more qualified than any other candidate because of skin color .. .be it white, brown or black. When we --- all of us --- mature to the point that we recognize and understand this we may have taken one step toward restoring American greatness. Hopefully it will be a step taken in time. Now .. let’s all sit back and wait for Obama next moment honoring some great American with ….

It’s quite simple: House Republicans would allow a vote on extending the Bush middle class tax cuts (the bill passed in August by the Senate) and offer the President nothing more: no extension of the debt ceiling, nothing on unemployment, nothing on closing loopholes. Congress would recess for the holidays and the president would face a big battle early in the year over the debt ceiling. Two senior Republican elected officials tell me this doomsday plan is becoming the most likely scenario. A top GOP House leadership aide confirms the plan is under consideration, but says Speaker Boehner has made no decision on whether to pursue it. Under one variation of this Doomsday Plan, House Republicans would allow a vote on extending only the middle class tax cuts and Republicans, to express disapproval at the failure to extend all tax cuts, would vote “present” on the bill, allowing it to pass entirely on Democratic votes. By doing this, Republicans avoid taking blame for tax increases on 98 percent of income tax payers. As one senior Republican in Congress told me, “You don’t take a hostage you aren’t willing to shoot.” Republicans aren’t willing to kill the middle class tax cuts, even if extending them alone will make it harder to later extend tax cuts on the wealthy.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354553427002</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:50:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354553440291-23</Id><Title>"A majority of the electorate has voted itself a size of government it's not willing to pay for.”</Title><Msg>Generally speaking, functioning societies make good-faith efforts to raise what they spend, subject to fluctuations in economic fortune: Government spending in Australia is 33.1 percent of GDP, and tax revenues are 27.1 percent. Likewise, government spending in Norway is 46.4 percent, and revenues are 41 percent – a shortfall but in the ballpark. Government spending in the United States is 42.2 percent, but revenues are 24 percent – the widest spending/taxing gulf in any major economy. So all the agonizing over our annual trillion-plus deficits overlooks the obvious solution: Given that we're spending like Norwegians, why don't we just pay Norwegian tax rates? No danger of that. If (in Milton Himmelfarb's famous formulation) Jews earn like Episcopalians but vote like Puerto Ricans, Americans are taxed like Puerto Ricans but vote like Scandinavians. We already have a more severely redistributive taxation system than Europe, in which the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans pay 70 percent of income tax while the poorest 20 percent shoulder just three-fifths of 1 percent. By comparison, the Norwegian tax burden is relatively equitably distributed. Yet Obama now wishes "the rich" to pay their "fair share" – presumably 80 percent or 90 percent. After all, as Warren Buffett pointed out in The New York Times this week, the Forbes 400 richest Americans have a combined wealth of $1.7 trillion. That sounds like a lot, and once upon a time it was. But today, if you confiscated every penny the Forbes 400 have, it would be enough to cover just over one year's federal deficit. And after that you're back to square one. It's not that "the rich" aren't paying their "fair share," it's that America isn't. A majority of the electorate has voted itself a size of government it's not willing to pay for. A couple of years back, Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute calculated that, if Washington were to increase every single tax by 30 percent, it would be enough to balance the books – in 25 years. If you were to raise taxes by 50 percent, it would be enough to fund our entitlement liabilities – just our current ones, not our future liabilities, which would require further increases. This is the scale of course correction needed. If you don't want that, you need to cut spending – like Harry Reid's been doing. "Now remember, we've already done more than a billion dollars' worth of cuts," he bragged the other day. "So we need to get some credit for that." Wow! A billion dollars' worth of cuts! Washington borrows $188 million every hour. So, if Reid took over five hours to negotiate those "cuts," it was a complete waste of time. So are most of the "plans." In fact, any "debt reduction plan" that doesn't address at least $1.3 trillion a year is, in fact, a debt-increase plan. So, given that the ruling party will not permit spending cuts, what should Republicans do? If I were John Boehner, I'd say: "Clearly there's no mandate for small government in the election results. So, if you milquetoast pantywaist sad-sack excuses for the sorriest bunch of so-called Americans who ever lived want to vote for Swede-sized statism, it's time to pony up." OK, he might want to focus-group it first. But that fundamental dishonesty is the heart of the crisis. You cannot simultaneously enjoy American-sized taxes and European-sized government. One or the other has to go.

But those taking part in deficit discussions in Washington won't allow such numbers into the discussion. The Serious People in Washington, such as The Washington Post (both the opinion and news sections), the Wall Street Campaign to Fix the Debt, and the Republican Congressional leadership are in full budget-cutting frenzy. They demand cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and everything else that benefits middle income and poor people because, well, because the market demands it. And we know the market demands these cuts because the Serious People told us the market demands these cuts. The fact that the cuts have the effect of redistributing income from the rest of us to the Serious People and their friends is just a coincidence. Those of us who focus on numbers and data might see that we actually have near-record low interest rates on U.S. government debt, suggesting that the markets aren't at all concerned about budget deficits. We can also point out the obvious truth that budget deficits are supporting the economy, given the loss of more than $1 trillion in annual construction and consumption demand as a result of the collapse of the housing bubble. But the Serious People in Washington don't have the time to deal with the stinkin' numbers.

WASHINGTON (CBS DC) – The median net worth of American households has dropped to a 43-year low as the lower and middle classes appear poorer and less stable than they have been since 1969. According to a recent study by New York University economics professor Edward N. Wolff, median net worth is at the decades-low figure of $57,000 (in 2010 dollars). And as the numbers in his study reflect, the situation only appears worse when all the statistics are taken as a whole. According to Wolff, between 1983 and 2010, the percentage of households with less than $10,000 in assets (using constant 1995 dollars) rose from 29.7 percent to 37.1 percent. The “less than $10,000″ figure includes the numerous households that have no assets at all, or “negative assets,” which is otherwise known as “debt.” Over that same period of time, the wealthiest 1 percent of American households increased their average wealth by 71 percent.</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1354558993203</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 13:23:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354559156031-48</Id><Title>The facts that proggies hate:</Title><Msg>The tax rate paid by individuals with incomes in the top 1% averaged 23.39%, while all filers in the bottom 50% paid an average tax rate of 2.37%.</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1354559156031</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 13:25:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354559560813-49</Id><Title>Hmmm....so Democrats think spending doesn't drive deficits</Title><Msg>When Bill Clinton so famously "balanced the budget" with the Internet boom and all the taxes from those stock sales, the GOP and Newt Gingrich passed a budget (yes, Congress used to do that) of $1.7 trillion in expenditures.

I did not block you. Something goofy is going on with yahoo's new format. Actually, I thought you may have been trying to block me. Just for the record I didn't make up or bring up the wildcat strike My post was a response in regards to a wildcat strike post on this board which as far as my "KNOWLEDGE BASE" goes has also been mentioned in the news. And yes I am fully aware that the union workers "AGREE NOT TO GO ON (a wildcat) STRIKE". That is why I think that all this talk about a wildcat strike is nothing more than a bunch of braggdocio. The union workers know that a wildcat strike could subject/expose them to termination, especially for the rabble rousers and the deadwood. Therefore, there will be no wildcat strike as I so stated. As for the rest of your diatribe, I consider it nothing more than a refresher lecture of an undergraduate business management class but given with a heavy bias against Boeing's management by a pro-union malcontent. From a management perspective it only makes good and sound business sense, if you have to deal with unions, to make plans to use down time during a strike in a useful manner. No sense sitting on your thumbs. I can recall my grandfather, a head millwright for a Weyerhaeuser plant, using down time during a strike to upgrade and service equipment. Of course he had to concern himself about a Molotov cocktail crashing through his window. Sounds to me by your way of thinking you could throw a monkey wrench (ala sabotage a plane like a Boeing union worker did during one strike) in Boeing's business plan by not going on strike.</Msg><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1354563949791</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 14:45:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354563960760-57</Id><Topic><Title>The facts that proggies hate:</Title><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1354559156031</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 13:25:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In principle, coming out of all of this envy, the progressives, Obama being the progressive master, is the notion that those so-called "1%-ers" are simply not paying their "fair share".

Bob Corker of Tennessee, a member in good standing of the Serious People club. Corker's plan, the Fiscal Reform Act of 2012 includes items like cuts to Social Security and Medicare, which are described in classic Washington fashion as "reform." But the best part of Corker's plan is his proposal for cuts in the wages and benefits of the federal government's workforce. These cuts average $$180,700 for every federal employee. That is not a typo. The figure comes from taking the $397 billion in savings that Corker wants to come from "Federal Employee Hiring and Benefit Reform" and dividing it by the 2,197,000 employees on the federal government's payroll. That one is worth mulling over for a few minutes. We're talking about $180,700 in wage and benefit cuts for every nurse and custodian working at the Veterans Administration's hospitals; $180,700 in cuts for every letter carrier who delivers our mail; $180,700 in cuts for every meat inspector at the Food and Drug Administration who ensures that our food is safe. In Washington today, proposals like Corker's pass for serious. At a time when tens of millions of people are still unemployed, underemployed or out of the labor force altogether as a result of the fallout created by the collapse of the housing bubble, in Washington it is serious to argue that our biggest problem is that custodians at the VA hospitals are getting paid too much. In fairness, it is not only federal employees who Corker and the other deficit hawks want to whack. They also want to cut Social Security benefits, raise the age of eligibility for Medicare to 67 and to cut Medicaid, which covers the cost of most nursing home care for the nation's elderly. The basic story is that anyone who is not rich can expect to see a big hit if these deficit hawks get their way; it's just that federal employees get special treatment. As always, the folks who were the central cause of the economy's wreckage and the large current budget deficits escape largely unscathed in the Serious People's offensive on the debt. For some reason, the Serious People never consider the idea of a modest tax on Wall Street speculation. Hey, they don't even consider the idea of cutting the pensions of folks like Alan Greenspan, whose astounding incompetence as Federal Reserve Board chairman allowed the housing bubble to grow so big that its collapse would destroy the economy. But going after the rich and incompetent would not be Serious. In Washington, "Serious" means beating up on people without money and power. It's that simple.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354565560429</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 15:12:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354565827112-68</Id><Title>Bob Woodward can't explain why Obam</Title><Msg>is dodging and politicizing the need for spending reductions, and why the pesident isn't approaching the fiscal cliff seriously in the manner that Bill Clinton did during his second term.

The GOP plan also proposes to raise $800 billion in higher tax revenue over the decade but it would keep the Bush-era tax cuts — including those for wealthier earners targeted by Obama — in place for now.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1354571254954</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 16:47:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354571364260-81</Id><Topic><Title>What is your "FAIR SHARE"</Title><Username>chinamanpro</Username><Timestamp>1354567300602</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 15:41:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You could always try get rich by writing your fictional memoirs likey Obumer did.

Because Obama won't sit down with republicans in straight forward negotiations over taxes and debt but instead goes to twitter to do some more post campaign rhetoric he's disengaged from his responsibilities of governance. He isn't taking leadership seriously. He isn't a reliable public servant. What he does take seriously is pushing his own personal agenda for an entire nation where the majority of Americans are against him according to all media polls. Those who are for the President's plans don't even understand what those plans consist of.

Declaring that this time he won’t negotiate with himself, he has refused to lay out a proposal reflecting what he thinks Republicans want. Instead, he has demanded that Republicans themselves say, explicitly, what they want. And guess what: They can’t or won’t do it. No, really. While there has been a lot of bluster from the G.O.P. about how we should reduce the deficit with spending cuts, not tax increases, no leading figures on the Republican side have been able or willing to specify what, exactly, they want to cut. And there’s a reason for this reticence. The fact is that Republican posturing on the deficit has always been a con game, a play on the innumeracy of voters and reporters. Now Mr. Obama has demanded that the G.O.P. put up or shut up — and the response is an aggrieved mumble. Here’s where we are right now: As his opening bid in negotiations, Mr. Obama has proposed raising about $1.6 trillion in additional revenue over the next decade, with the majority coming from letting the high-end Bush tax cuts expire and the rest from measures to limit tax deductions. He would also cut spending by about $400 billion, through such measures as giving Medicare the ability to bargain for lower drug prices. Republicans have howled in outrage. Senator Orrin Hatch, delivering the G.O.P. reply to the president’s weekly address, denounced the offer as a case of “bait and switch,” bearing no relationship to what Mr. Obama ran on in the election. In fact, however, the offer is more or less the same as Mr. Obama’s original 2013 budget proposal and also closely tracks his campaign literature. So what are Republicans offering as an alternative? They say they want to rely mainly on spending cuts instead. Which spending cuts? Ah, that’s a mystery. In fact, until late last week, as far as I can tell, no leading Republican had been willing to say anything specific at all about how spending should be cut. The veil lifted a bit when Senator Mitch McConnell, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, finally mentioned a few things — raising the Medicare eligibility age, increasing Medicare premiums for high-income beneficiaries and changing the inflation adjustment for Social Security. But it’s not clear whether these represent an official negotiating position — and in any case, the arithmetic just doesn’t work. Start with raising the Medicare age. This is, as I’ve argued in the past, a terrible policy idea. But even aside from that, it’s just not a big money saver, largely because 65- and 66-year-olds have much lower health costs than the average Medicare recipient. When the Congressional Budget Office analyzed the likely fiscal effects of a rise in the eligibility age, it found that it would save only $113 billion over the next decade and have little effect on the longer-run trajectory of Medicare costs. Increasing premiums for the affluent would yield even less; a 2010 study by the budget office put the 10-year savings at only about $20 billion. Changing the inflation adjustment for Social Security would save a bit more — by my estimate, about $185 billion over the next decade. But put it all together, and the things Mr. McConnell was talking about would amount to only a bit over $300 billion in budget savings — a fifth of what Mr. Obama proposes in revenue gains. The point is that when you put Republicans on the spot and demand specifics about how they’re going to make good on their posturing about spending and deficits, they come up empty. There’s no there there. And there never was. Republicans claim to be for much smaller government, but as a political matter they have always attacked government spending in the abstract, never coming clean with voters about the reality that big cuts in government spending can happen only if we sharply curtail very popular programs. In fact, less than a month ago the Romney/Ryan campaign was attacking Mr. Obama for, yes, cutting Medicare. Now Republicans find themselves boxed in. With taxes scheduled to rise on Jan. 1 in the absence of an agreement, they can’t play their usual game of just saying no to tax increases and pretending that they have a deficit reduction plan. And the president, by refusing to help them out by proposing G.O.P.-friendly spending cuts, has deprived them of political cover. If Republicans really want to slash popular programs, they will have to propose those cuts themselves. So while the fiscal cliff — still a bad name for the looming austerity bomb, but I guess we’re stuck with it — is a bad thing from an economic point of view, it has had at least one salutary political effect. For it has finally laid bare the con that has always been at the core of the G.O.P.’s political strategy.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_667</Username><Timestamp>1354575722296</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 18:02:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354576388386-97</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP's Big Budget Mumble</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_667</Username><Timestamp>1354576336657</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 18:12:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The veil lifted a bit when Senator Mitch McConnell, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, finally mentioned a few things — raising the Medicare eligibility age, increasing Medicare premiums for high-income beneficiaries and changing the inflation adjustment for Social Security.

Obama was part of the Democratic Machine in Illinois which is less trustworthy and less honorable than the Chicago mob (not an exaggeration). Republicans are amateurs compared to Obama and his tax avoiding property stealing cronies like Valerie Jarett . I assure you that if you challenge or embarrass Obama's most trusted advisor Rahm Emanuel for example, that you will be visited and reminded that your wife and kids could become accident prone unless you keep your mouth shut. That is how the Obama Democratic Machine Team rolls. I hope you're not really naive enough to think that team Obama really cares about people like you.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1354580955277</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 19:29:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354581104547-113</Id><Topic><Title>Union Cannibalism.</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1354472489345</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 13:21:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Phantom changed his name from MBFIELD because he couldn't stand the ridicule he received when he posted his idiotic comments..</Msg><Username>oldbuck56</Username><Timestamp>1354581104547</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 19:31:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354581410993-114</Id><Title>Obama Pushing U.S. To Economic Disaster: Google Founder</Title><Msg>The eccentric and frugal billionaire college professor who helped Sergey Brin and Larry Brin develop Google has warned that US President Barack Obama is pushing the U.S. towards a path of economic disaster. Stanford University’s David Cheriton, who is worth almost $2-billion according to Fortune magazine, believes that innovative and creative American entrepreneurs are being driven out of the country by Obama’s fiscal policies. Cheriton told BBC: “When you look at, say, Larry and Sergey of Google, they made billions of dollars, but they contributed many more billions of dollars to the US economy. And so we should be empowering these people; we should be cultivating more of the next generation of those types. And yet, I think there’s almost a hostile attitude towards people who have been successful in this country.” He added balefully that “the people that are taking the risks… or would be taking the risks… [now] start thinking twice about what it means to do this in the US.” According to BBC, Cheriton -- who is shy about his vast wealth and lives very simply, still riding his old bicycle to work -- is investing more money outside the US than within it. He also warns that most Americans do not understand the magnitude of the economic peril they are under. “I think of this like being a jetliner at 35,000 feet and you say, well, we’re low on gas and we’re headed towards the ground, maybe not straight down, but there’s gonna have to be a course correction or this is gonna end very badly,” he said. He also discussed the scale of the economic and financial crisis in the US. “The US has amazing resources, amazing people, and some very fundamentally good institutions, but it’s hard to gauge it has ever encountered this type of challenge before,” he warned. ”The solution has to be that this large portion of the population has to accept some economic pain and [an] adjustment in how much [they think the] government can do for them. [But] I think the pain hasn’t [quite] reached a level yet which [would force such] a change.”</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1354581410993</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 19:36:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354582158266-115</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Pushing U.S. To Economic Disaster: Google Founder</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1354581410993</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 19:36:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We have too many voters who are victims of socialized government education and can't begin to understand even rudimentary economics like, you can't spend more than you take in without incurring debt and debt limits your choices.
