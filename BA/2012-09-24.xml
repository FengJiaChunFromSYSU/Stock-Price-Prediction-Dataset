The Australian treasurer, Wayne Swan, in an unusually blunt criticism of US politics weeks before the presidential election, said "cranks and crazies" had taken over the Republicans and posed the biggest threat to the world's largest economy. Swan, one of few world leaders able to boast his country had avoided recession during the global financial crisis, also labelled the Tea Party wing of the Republicans as "extreme". "Let's be blunt and acknowledge the biggest threat to the world's biggest economy are the cranks and crazies that have taken over the Republican party," Swan said in a speech to a conference in Sydney. The Republican party's position on the US budget had led a year ago to the deadlock in negotiations, Swan said, to prevent the looming "fiscal cliff" – nearly $600bn in planned spending cuts and tax hikes that will bite early next year. Congress had been debating whether to increase the US borrowing ceiling but the Republicans would not budge. "Despite President Obama's goodwill and strong efforts, the national interest was held hostage by the rise of the extreme Tea Party wing of the Republican party," he said. Australian politicians rarely launch such blunt criticism of their counterparts in the US, a key strategic ally. Swan, named by banking magazine Euromoney as its finance minister of the year in 2011 and treasurer of a centre-left government, also called on the US Congress to resolve an agreement on the budget to support growth in the short term. With the US presidential campaign entering its final weeks, the spending cuts and tax rises will kick in unless Obama and Congress reach a deficit-reduction deal. Democrats want to make up the shortfall by increasing taxes on wealthy Americans, while Republicans favour spending cuts.</Msg><Username>cloroxcowboy</Username><Timestamp>1348463495560</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 01:11:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>21</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348485772320-3</Id><Topic><Title>Democrat Party has bought the Main Stream Media</Title><Username>tminusten</Username><Timestamp>1348478306674</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 05:18:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BFD.

Pennsylvania Now in Play for Romney</Title><Msg>Poll: The presidential race is tight in Pennsylvania By Mike Wereschagin Published: Saturday, September 22, 2012, 9:17 p.m. Two percentage points separate President Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney in a state poll conducted for the Tribune-Review, even though the campaigns largely are ignoring Pennsylvania and concentrating on other battlegrounds. Obama polled 47 percent to Romney's 45 percent among likely Pennsylvania voters, with 6 percent of voters undecided and 44 days until Election Day, according to the survey by Susquehanna Polling &amp; Research. The survey of 800 voters, conducted Sept. 18-20, has a margin of error of 3.46 percentage points. The poll showed most voters are disappointed with the country’s direction, evenly split on whether Obama deserves another term and hesitant to back Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. Fifty-one percent of the state’s voters approve of Obama’s job performance. Other recent polls showed a larger margin for Obama, leading some to speculate that Pennsylvania — which hasn’t voted for a GOP presidential candidate since 1988 — no longer is a swing state. Two of those last four polls gave Obama a lead larger than his margin of victory in 2008, when he defeated Sen. John McCain of Arizona by 10 percentage points. “All the evidence points to a much closer margin,” said Jim Lee, Susquehanna president. “Nothing suggests we’re looking at anything like 2008.” Voters continue to put the economy at the top of their list of concerns. Only one in three believes the country is headed in the right direction. Yet, a deeper look at the numbers shows a more nuanced picture. Romney leads Obama, 48 percent to 44 percent, on the question of who would create jobs to speed up the recovery. Ask who looks out for the interests of the middle class and Obama leads, 56 percent to 38 percent. “People run with the numbers without really paying attention to what’s behind them,” said Dilip Namjoshi, 66, of Abington, a Philadelphia suburb. “Somebody says, ‘I created 2 million jobs.’ Well, yes, but 600,000 of them are in China.”</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1348487500483</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 07:51:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348490859875-5</Id><Topic><Title>Wow!

In our latest POLITICO-George Washington University Battleground Poll with middle-class families, which comprise about 54 percent of the total American electorate and usually split in their vote behavior between Republicans and Democrats, Romney holds a 14-point advantage (55 percent to 41 percent). Middle-class families are more inclined to believe the country is on the wrong track (34 percent right direction, 62 percent wrong track), are more likely to hold an unfavorable view of Obama (48 percent favorable, 51 percent unfavorable), and hold a more favorable view of Romney (51 percent favorable, 44 percent unfavorable) and Paul Ryan (46 percent favorable, 35 percent unfavorable) than the overall electorate. These middle-class families also hold a majority disapproval rating on the job Obama is doing as president (45 percent approve, 54 percent disapprove), and turn even more negative toward Obama on specific areas; the economy 56 percent disapprove; spending 61 percent disapprove; taxes, 53 percent disapprove; Medicare 48 percent disapprove; and even foreign policy 50 percent disapprove.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1348493664998</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 09:34:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348494705777-13</Id><Title>Romney' s tax issue</Title><Msg>Is a non-issue. Of course he will be paying at a lower rate because his income is mostly unearned and is treated differently from earned income. Until the law changes it will stay the same.on the issue of charitable contributions and deductions, he has been consistent over the years in his donations. Everybody knows that investment income fluctuates with the market. What I observe with Romney is that his charitable donations do not fluctuate from year to year. So deductions are the place to make adjustment in your tax return once your investment income dips. Makes sense since the deductions can be carried over for the next five years. That , ladies and gentlemen is not manipulation but generosity in its noblest form.</Msg><Username>zosimomaximo</Username><Timestamp>1348494705777</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 09:51:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348494777494-14</Id><Topic><Title>Wow!

Prominent among them: BAE Systems, the British arms maker now in talks to merge with Boeing's biggest civilian rival, EADS , maker of Airbus jets. "We are grateful to have them as key members of our team," Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said of the contractors feted at the Field Museum in Chicago. The potential pairing of a top Boeing partner with its fiercest competitor shows how deeply the deal could disrupt the complex relationships in the aerospace and defense industries, which account for hundreds of billions in sales a year. The BAE-EADS merger would create the world's largest integrated defense and commercial aviation company with annual sales of $92.4 billion, topping Boeing by more than a third, based on 2011 figures. Boeing initially said it did not see a big threat,(top employee James McNerney said he was not worried, no wonder BA is second to Airbus ) but its top defense executive told Reuters this week the deal raised national security and industrial concerns that needed to be addressed. The 777 has been a mainstay for airlines' long-haul routes. But the orders have been slowing, and airlines are asking for a makeover. Boeing has a lot to lose if the process doesn't go well, and according to company insiders, infighting over the products design and cost are already challenging the makeover. Just like the 747-8, and 787, and the late 737MAX no Jim the customer will not wait, no Jim ,you should worry about BAE and EADS joining forces, Jim, are you ever going to step aside and let Boeing get a good top employee?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1348495901970</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 10:11:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348496237899-16</Id><Title>Obama to Swell Unemployment Rolls.......</Title><Msg>.....by one next January.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1348496237899</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 10:17:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348496612331-17</Id><Topic><Title>All states in play</Title><Username>harrydokes</Username><Timestamp>1348495332919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 10:02:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only people who think like communists will vote for Obama.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1348496612331</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 10:23:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348496849293-18</Id><Topic><Title>'Cranks and crazies' have taken over US Republicans, says Australian minister</Title><Username>cloroxcowboy</Username><Timestamp>1348463495560</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 01:11:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Baggers like harrydokes are delusional.

I mean in front of an audience. And I don’t mean some sort of extemporaneous blather at a city council meeting. If you have done so, you know that there are a few rules of effective presentations: 1) the three part structure of “tell them what you are going to say, tell them, and tell them what you said”; and 2) the opening statement has to get their attention. Thus, the opening statement may be an exaggeration or may not even be the truth, but it lays the foundation for what you are going to talk about. Romney was talking to donors and he was talking about his prospects for winning. And, yes, he was categorizing and “percentigizing”. In no way in that opening statement, however, did he say that he thought ill of any group of people. Now, consider Obama. Did it bother you that the conservatives/Republicans made great hey out of “you did not build that”, making it out to mean that the President believes that small business owners did not do the work to make their businesses what they are? Of course. That one, from my perspective, is a mixed bag of ambiguity from the Master of Ambiguity, but I can see that he may have been only referring to the “building” of infrastructure, not the business itself. It was an incredible “sound bite” that played all the way through the Republican Convention, perhaps beyond. And, yet, you and the liberal camp will opine that Obama's words were “being taken out of context”. This is also the problem with this tape. And regarding your statement, “Somehow somebody thinks every person with a phone or video camera at every political gathering needs to sign a consent form of some kind.” You do not seem to “get” what the law is about. In a PRIVATE group of folks where a camera or phone is displayed in the OPEN amongst them, they see it and can react to it, deciding upon what they will say or not with an obvious assumption of disclosure. This camera was purposely HIDDEN from view by someone that was not a party to the event. That is what the U.S. Code says is illegal and is punishable.

Operated activity was focused on the northern block of Evi during Q1, where LPR drilled eight wells in a single section. All eight wells are now on stream and initial rates indicate no signs of interference between wells. LPR has regulatory approval for up to 16 wells per section in certain sections at Evi and has plans to initiate a pilot of up to 12 wells per section in H2.

ANDERSONSingle PagePrintLarger TextSmaller TextAlerts The release of Mitt Romney’s 2011 tax returns shows that he freely gave away more than $4 million to charity last year (about 30 percent of his income). In comparison, when Joe Biden was first running for vice president, his tax returns showed that he had given away just $3,690 to charity over the previous ten years (about 0.2 percent of his income). In other words, Romney gave away a thousand times as much to charity in one year as Biden gave in a decade. That’s despite the fact that the Bidens earned well over $2 million over that decade. In fact, their income was $320,000 in 2008, thereby putting them comfortably over the $250,000-a-year line that marks the entry point for “millionaires and billionaires” in Obama-speak. Last year, Romney freely gave away more than $10,000 a day to charity — an impressive sum by nearly any standard. Of course, it’s not too hard to beat Biden’s tally. Over the span of that decade, or 3,650 days, he gave away $3,690 — an average of $1.01 a da</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1348511110868</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 14:25:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348511477367-37</Id><Title>Obama Plays the Political Coward, Again! "Quietly Cancels Meeting with Terrorist"</Title><Msg>Obama cancels election-season meeting with Egyptian Islamist Morsi Published: 8:11 AM 09/24/2012 By Neil Munro President Barack Obama has quietly cancelled a politically risky plan to meet this week with Egypt’s new Islamist president. The plan was cancelled amid a wave of riots and attacks in Arab countries that have damaged Obama’s campaign-trail claim to foreign policy competence. In 2011, Obama had “bilateral” meetings with 13 Arab and world leaders during the annual U.S. summit. This year, amid the foreign policy meltdown, his schedule shows no so-called “bilats” with any foreign leaders. The cancelled visit with Morsi was mentioned in a Sept. 23 New York Times article about Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist who now governs the Arab region’s most important country. Despite critical 2011 support from Obama for the revolt that removed Hosni Mubarak, Morsi is now demanding restrictions on U.S. free speech that is critical of Islam, demanding more U.S. support for the anti-Israeli Islamist governments in Gaza and the West Bank, and more financial aid to help the cash-strapped Egyptian government buy food and fuel for its population of 82 million people. These Islamist demands clash with Obama’s promise of good U.S.-Arab relations made in his June 2009 “New Beginning “ speech in Cairo. That controversial speech reversed President George W. Bush’s policy of opposition to Islamists’ demands for theocratic governments in Egypt and other Muslim-majority states. To emphasize the reversal, Obama even invited some members of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood movement to his Cairo speech. Following elections in 2011 and 2012, that Islamist movement now controls Egypt, and is taking steps to end the 1979 peace deal between Egypt and Israel. Morsi complimented Obama, telling the New York Times that Obama had “decisively and quickly” supported Egypt’s Islamist and smaller secular parties by helping remove Egypt’s autocratic, pro-Western government. The article downplayed the proposed Obama-Morsi meeting, which was highlighted by the Egyptian press in July. Morsi’s request to meet with Obama “received a cool reception … [from the White House, and] mindful of the complicated election-year politics of a visit with Egypt’s Islamist leader, M. Morsi dropped his request,” claimed the New York Times.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1348511477367</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 14:31:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348512201553-38</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Delves into Aircraft Design</Title><Username>gerbilfood4me</Username><Timestamp>1348504317051</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 12:31:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Smart guy, that Mittens... ... ... ...

Pathetic! Elizabeth Warren’s law license problem Posted by William A. Jacobson Monday, September 24, 2012 at 7:37am Maintained private law practice at Cambridge office for over a decade but not licensed in Massachusetts But there was one subject most people watching probably did not know about, Elizabeth Warren’s private legal representation of The Travelers Insurance Company in an asbestos-related case. Brown brought the point up late in the debate, and hammered it: Warren attempted to deny her role, and referred to a Boston Globe article, but the Globe article supports Brown’s account. The Globe article indicated the representation was for a period of three years and Warren was paid $212,000. The case resulted in a Supreme Court victory for Travelers arising out of a bankruptcy case in New York. Whatever the political implications of the exchange, Warren’s representation of Travelers raises another big potential problem for Warren. Warren represented not just Travelers, but numerous other companies starting in the late 1990s working out of and using her Harvard Law School office in Cambridge, which she listed as her office of record on briefs filed with various courts. Warren, however, never has been licensed to practice law in Massachusetts. As detailed below, there are at least two provisions of Massachusetts law Warren may have violated. First, on a regular and continuing basis she used her Cambridge office for the practice of law without being licensed in Massachusetts. Second, in addition to operating an office for the practice of law without being licensed in Massachusetts, Warren actually practiced law in Massachusetts without being licensed. Warren refused to disclose the full extent of her private law practice when asked by The Boston Globe. If Warren denies that she has practiced law in Massachusetts without a license, Warren should disclose the full extent of her private law practice. The public has a right to #$%$ whether Warren has failed to comply with the most basic requirement imposed on others, the need to become a member of the Bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in order to practice law in and from Massachusetts.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1348513820268</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 15:10:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348514075875-43</Id><Topic><Title>POW WOW Elizabeth Warren Not Licensed to Practice Law in Massachusetts</Title><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1348513820268</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 15:10:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You oughta go outside and get some fresh air.

The comment came in Obama's CBS '60 Minutes' interview that aired on Sunday night. Steve Kroft, the interviewer, asked: 'Have the events that took place in the Middle East, the recent events in the Middle East given you any pause about your support for the governments that have come to power following the Arab Spring? Obama responded: 'Well, I’d said even at the time that this is going to be a rocky path. The question presumes that somehow we could have stopped this wave of change. 'I think it was absolutely the right thing for us to do to align ourselves with democracy, universal rights — a notion that people have to be able to participate in their own governance. 'But I was pretty certain and continue to be pretty certain that there are going to be bumps in the road because, you know, in a lot of these places, the one organizing principle has been Islam.'</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1348523228836</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 17:47:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348528345990-64</Id><Title>Obama Starting to Slip in All Polls!</Title><Msg>Obama Will be the Next Jimmy Carter!

James Carter indeed conspired to obtain (emails and tweets to prove "trustworthiness") and distribute the video. That is what I said earlier. It does not matter that he did not do either the video or final distribution himself. He convinced this "Anne Onymous" to turn the video over to him and he sent it to Mother Jones for distribution. There are two dimensions to the U.S. Code here: 1) recording (he did not do that) and 2) distributing it via electronic means (that he did with Mother Jones as the final distribution proxy). If we played out what I think is your argument, then only the producer and local distributor of illicit drugs are culpable.The fellow that moves the drugs from one country to another or is the regional pusher to the local pusher is blameless - an absurd notion. The separate issue of conspiring with a foreign nation to interfere with or influence U.S. elections is another problem for him - should the government desire to enforce the law.
