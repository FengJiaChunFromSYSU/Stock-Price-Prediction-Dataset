If or when the aerospace business tanks again, it won't be because of wages, and massive layoffs will occur no matter how poorly employees are paid. It's blatantly obvious the company is NOT bargaining with us in good faith. The ONLY reason Boeing is pulling this crap now is because they think we will just roll over for it. So much for "team spirit" and "mutual respect". According to the Holy Gospel of the Great God of the Free Market, if we overprice our labor, it should be easy for Boeing to replace us. That theory didn't work in 2000, it didn't work with the 787, and it won't work now. If the "free market" game is all about charging as much as the market will bear, then it's time we began playing by the same rules as everyone else. I don't find much substance in your statements, MB, they are just a bland rehash of anti-union talking points. I'm not going to reply to any more of your posts, it's just a waste of my time.</Msg><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1345090616000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:16:56

The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called "premium support.") You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform," Cutter said. "You know what those cuts are? It’s taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget." Because we’re wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking? Well, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally "cut" a dollar from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1345132635000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:57:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345132731000-53</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan's plan includes $700 billion in Medicare "cuts," says Stephanie Cutter</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1345132239000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:50:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1345132731000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:58:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345133105000-54</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan's plan includes $700 billion in Medicare "cuts," says Stephanie Cutter</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1345132239000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:50:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whats the matter little man....don't like it when people shine light on your B.S.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1345133105000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 12:05:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345134024000-55</Id><Topic><Title>BA union head jailed</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1345053492000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:58:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1) aren't you special: Yes.

The problem with government investment is not that it spends money to spur development of technologies, but when it spends money to foster a business OR when it pursues implementation (place into use) technologies that have not sufficiently matured or are non-competitive. On occasion, the government pursues technology developments that the commercial world could give a rat's behind about. Some technologies are inherently defense oriented - such as for "stealth". Solyndra did not achieve anything remarkable with its 8.5% efficient solar panels. The range is anywhere 8% to 15% for commercial and up to 34% for space. The flexible thin-film cells are placed on tubes and a "white" roof is assumed in order to achieve some amount of illumination over 360 degrees (over the entire tube). But there are sun illumination drop-offs due to cosine losses and reflective losses. In the end, what Solyndra did was "novel" but not "impressive", basically “useless”. Therefore the government, which is incapable of any form of understanding the commercial market and cost-benefit strategies wasted tax payer's money on a method that was never going to be attractive to any buyers. Hence, failure and bankruptcy. For the $0.5 billion spent/wasted, it would have been way better to mature or improve competing or new technologies and then license the result to competing companies who would have spent their own money to engineer the customer solutions and market the product. Obama's failure, which he owns, in the Solyndra experiment is classic and will be a "case study" taught in government procurement agency training on WHAT NOT TO DO.

After Ryan pick, Romney leading in Wisconsin August 16, 2012 | 12:17 pm Paul Bedard Washington Secrets The Washington Examiner Eric Holder’s uphill battle: Huge public support for voter ID (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Mitt Romney's choice of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan has reversed the presidential polling in the state, pushing the Republican over President Obama for the first time. It has also pushed Romney to his highest-ever level of support in politically-progressive Wisconsin. The latest Rasmussen Reports survey found that 48 percent of likely voters support Romney now, compared to 47 percent for Obama. In late July, said Rasmussen, the it was Obama 49%, Romney 46%. "This is the Republican's largest level of support yet in the Badger State. Prior to this survey, the president has earned 45% to 52% of the vote, while Romney has picked up 41% to 46% of the vote." A Romney victory in Wisconsin this fall would be a devastating blow to Obama's reelection. Ryan is viewed favorably by 57% of the state's voters and 51% of Wisconsin voters believe Romney made the right choice in tapping Ryan as his running mate, said Rasmussen. His favorable ratings are similar nationwide, the pollster said. From Rasmussen: Romney's choice of Ryan, the leading GOP congressional budget reformer, puts entitlement programs in the spotlight this election campaign, and 66% of Wisconsin voters view Medicare favorably. That's comparable to sentiments nationwide. When asked which scares them more when it comes to the future of Medicare, 48% of Wisconsin voters name the president's health care plan. Forty-two percent say Ryan's Medicare proposal scares them more. If necessary, 45% of Wisconsin voters say Ryan is ready to be president, but 42% don't share that view.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345150008000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 16:46:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345150214000-72</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Pulls Ahead in Wisconsin...

Obama Has Plenty of Time to Drop Biden 12:35 PM, AUG 15, 2012 • BY DANIEL HALPERSingle PagePrintLarger TextSmaller TextAlerts UPDATE: The countdown clock now reads 21-days: *** President Barack Obama has slightly more than 22 days to drop Vice Presidential Joe Biden from the 2012 Democratic presidential ticket, according to lawyers familiar with the party nominating process. That is, Democrats have until September 6 to formally nominate their presidential ticket which will then be qualified for the 50 state ballots. And it is still possible for that ticket not to include the current vice president, Joe Biden. "As a sitting president and vice president, Obama and Biden are both considered the Democrats' presumptive nominees and will not be the official nominees until after Charlotte," a lawyer familiar with the party nominating process tells me. "Each party has to file paperwork with each state once the candidates become official nominees. So it's still quite possible for Obama to drop Biden and replace him with someone else and pay no consequences with listing on ballots." The nominating process will take place at the Democratic party convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is being held September 3-6</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345150812000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 17:00:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345150898000-79</Id><Topic><Title>How Ryanization Threatens the GOP</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_86</Username><Timestamp>1345147758000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 16:09:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Yes, the Democrat won 486 to 52."

MSNBC’s Touré: Romney Engaging In The ‘Niggerization’ Of Obama VIDEO by Andrew Kirell | 4:41 pm, August 16th, 2012 » 1076 comments On Thursday’s edition of MSNBC’s The Cycle the group discussed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney‘s assertion that President Obama should “take [his] campaign of division and anger and hate back to Chicago.” Co-host Touré saw what he believes to be explicit racial connotations beneath what Romney was saying, calling it the “niggerization” of the campaign. “That really bothered me,” he said. “You notice he said anger twice. He’s really trying to use racial coding and access some really deep stereotypes about the angry black man. This is part of the playbook against Obama, the ‘otherization,’ he’s not like us.” “I know it’s a heavy thing, I don’t say it lightly, but this is ‘niggerization,’” Touré said to the apparent shock of his co-panelists. “You are not one of us, you are like the scary black man who we’ve been trained to fear.” Naturally this led to a battle between Touré and conservative co-host S.E. Cupp. She took particular issue with the fact that Touré admitted that VP Joe Biden‘s “chains” comments were divisive, but is now calling Romney a “racist” for saying the Obama campaign is “angry.” “Do you see how dishonest that is?” she asked. - RELATED: Biden’s Staff Tried To Influence Reporting On His Virginia Trip, According To Report Touré denied calling anyone a racist, which prompted Cupp to say, “Certainly you were implying that Mitt Romney and the base will respond to this dog-whistle, racially-charged coding, and hate Obama, the angry black man?” “Absolutely,” he replied. “That’s so irresponsible,” Cupp answered back. “This is not a revolutionary comment,” Touré later said. “This is a constituency all-white party that rejects the black vote.” “You have two white guys in Joe Biden and Mitt Romney,” Cupp clarified. “Joe Biden made the overtly racial comment and has a history of making bigoted remarks. Mitt Romney was responding to the comment. Yet he is the one responsible for the whole Republican history of racism in politics?” “That’s not what Touré is saying,” co-host Krystal Ball interjected. “You’re twisting his words.” “No, he can speak for himself,” Cupp shot back. “He’s using the playbook Republicans have been using for decades now,” Touré conclude</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345160692000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 19:44:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345160946000-87</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Pulls Ahead in Wisconsin...

Democrats' nerves start to show as Ryan fires up conservative voters The Republican candidate was kept on the back foot for weeks but in choosing Paul Ryan, Romney is looking to his core vote Ewen MacAskill in Washington guardian.co.uk, Thursday 16 August 2012 16.03 EDT Jump to comments (162) Republican vice-presidential hopeful Paul Ryan campaigning in the battleground state of Ohio. Ryan is already being seen as a frontrunner for future presidential races. Photograph: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images After the 2008 Sarah Palin debacle, Mitt Romney was understandably keen to pick a very different kind of vice-presidential running mate. Instead of a relatively inexperienced governor of an outlying state, in Paul Ryan the Republican presidential candidate has gone for a consummate political professional with 14 years of congressional experience under his belt. But while Ryan is unlikely to have embarrassing, flustered moments in television studios when asked to list the daily newspapers he reads, he is proving every bit as controversial and polarising as his Alaskan predecessor. The Democrats have dubbed him a "certifiably rightwing idealogue", claiming he is out to destroy America's modest welfare programmes. Usually, vice-presidential candidates have only a few days in the media spotlight before retreating into obscurity, apart from one VP nationally televised debate in October. Palin did not follow that pattern and neither does Ryan, who after less than a week in the job has redefined the campaign and looks likely to go on doing so. The Romney campaign chose him to deliver the Republican base vote amid fears that die-hard conservatives could cost him the White House by staying at home on election day rather than turning out for a candidate they are ambivalent about. Conservatives are coming round, reflected in the crowds Ryan has been attracting on his tour of the swing states this week. The Democrats have been sending out panic-laden appeals for donations, one of them expressing concern over the size of the crowd. One of the appeals, for $3 or more, said of Romney-Ryan attacks: "This could cost us the election." Charlie Gruschow, the Iowa-based founder of the Tea Party of America, said there had been a large crowd to see Ryan in Iowa. Gruschow is one of many conservatives who were slow to warm to Romney, having first supported Herman Cain and then Newt Gingrich as the Republican presidential candidate. "Ryan has fired up the base," said Gruschow, after speaking to friends in the evangelical Christian community and the Tea Party who he said had been a little hesitant, a little concerned, about Romney. "I think now that Ryan has been selected as his running mate, there's a lot of enthusiasm. He is a Tea Party guy."</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345161873000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 20:04:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345162265000-90</Id><Topic><Title>The Brits Think Obama is Toast...</Title><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345161873000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 20:04:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And you'll never catch on to the fact that your support of a war criminal serves the interests of the 1%.</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1345162265000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 20:11:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345162655000-91</Id><Title>Democratic Starting to Eat Their Own!!!!!!</Title><Msg>The Liberal Gravy Train is ending as Governments (State and Local) realize there is no money to pay the Union Thugs Retirement benefits... so they will file for Bankruptcy Wisconsin... way to go!

In an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News Radio, Ryan kept up the new tough tone that Mitt Romney set earlier in the week. "You know, these are the kinds of things you say when you're desperate in a campaign," Ryan said of Biden's comments. "I think you're going to hear more of these things as we go on because they have a terrible record and can't run on it so they're going to kind of sink this campaign to these low levels to distract people. "To try and you know, stoke the emotions of fear and envy, and it's just not going to work. People are going to see through this. We've gone from hope and change to anger and division and blame and attack and I think people are going to see through this," he said. Ryan's remarks echoed aggressive comments by Romney on the stump Tuesday evening. The president, though, is standing by his No. 2. He also brushed off Sarah Palin's recent suggestion on Fox News that he drop Biden from the ticket in favor of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee and a Fox News contributor, had said Biden's comments are the latest example of how he "really drags down that ticket." "We don't spend a lot of time worrying about the chatter and the noise and this and that," he said. "The country isn't as divided with gaffes or some stray remark as Washington is. Most folks know that's just sort of a WWF wrestling part of politics. It doesn't mean anything, just fills up a lot of air time." He also said in an interview with People magazine that Biden's remarks meant consumers would be worse off if Republicans succeeded in doing away with new restraints on financial institutions. "In no sense was he trying to connote something other than that," Obama said. Biden made the comments Tuesday in Danville, Va., while saying that Republicans want to deregulate financial institutions -- or, as Biden put it, to "unchain Wall Street." Hundreds of black people were in the audience when Biden added, "They're going to put y'all back in chains." In Iowa for a bus tour, Obama said the reaction to Biden's remarks was a function of politics, but he did not blame his vice president. "The truth is that during the course of these campaigns, folks like to get obsessed with how something was phrased even if everybody personally understands that's not how it was meant," Obama told People. "That's sort of the nature of modern campaigns and modern coverage of campaigns. But I tell you, when I'm traveling around Iowa, that's not what's on people's minds." A prominent Democrat, though, spoke out against Biden's comments Wednesday. The nation's first elected black governor, Doug Wilder of Virginia, claimed the comments brought race into the presidential contest. Romney alluded to Biden's comment Tuesday evening in delivering a tough critique of the Obama campaign. "His campaign and his surrogates have made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the presidency," Romney told a crowd of thousands at the final stop on his five-state bus tour. "Another outrageous charge came a few hours ago in Virginia. And the White House sinks a little bit lower. This is what an angry and desperate presidency looks like." He continued: "So, Mr. President, take your campaign of division and anger and hate back to Chicago."</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345163281000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 20:28:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345163722000-95</Id><Topic><Title>More More Hate and Racism from Team Obama</Title><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1345163281000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 20:28:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a laugh riot you Paul Ryan and you goose-stepping fans of his are.

Are you saying that Iran is no threat at all to the United States? Food for thought: in September of last year, Iran claimed that they could send "ships" (I would guess including subs) to the U.S. shore. Also, their missiles are certainly capable of hitting U.S. targets in Afghanistan (and what is left in Iraq). Are we worried about it? (Especially the subs off our coast.) Probably not. But then again, we weren't ready for 9-11 either.
