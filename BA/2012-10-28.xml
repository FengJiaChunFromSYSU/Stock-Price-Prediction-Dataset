In 2012 as in 2008 and 2010, Rasmussen has been the nation's most prolific polling organization at the state level. Almost every day Rasmussen produces two or three new polls of key battleground states in the presidential election along with their national tracking poll. But in addition to being the nation's most prolific pollster, Rasmussen gets a lot of attention, especially from conservative media outlets and pundits, because its polls consistently produce results more favorable to Republican candidates than the overall averages -- results that frequently don't match the actual election results very well. So how is Rasmussen doing this year? Along with its national tracking poll that has typically showed Mitt Romney with a lead that is two to three points larger than the overall average, Rasmussen's polls in the battleground states have also had a consistent Republican lean. I compared Rasmussen's latest results in the nine key battleground states -- Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, New Hampshire, Iowa, Wisconsin, Nevada and North Carolina -- with the overall averages from the HuffPost Pollster -- an average that includes Rasmussen polls. In every case, Rasmussen's poll showed a better result for Romney than the overall average.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1351441808682</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 12:30:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351442043960-17</Id><Title>An investigation is appropriate</Title><Msg>Wild accusations and erroneous conclusions to try and score minute political points via Faux Noos is not.

"Neither the president nor anyone in the White House denied any requests for assistance in Benghazi," National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor told Yahoo News by email. Fox News Channel reported Friday that American officials in the compound repeatedly asked for military help during the assault but were rebuffed by CIA higher-ups. At a press briefing one day earlier, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, asked why there had not been a quicker, more forceful response to the assault, complained of "Monday-morning quarterbacking." Panetta said he and top military commanders had judged it too dangerous to send troops to the eastern Libyan city without a clearer picture of events on the ground. The "basic principle is that you don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on; without having some real-time information about what's taking place," he said during a joint question-and-answer session with Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff General Martin Dempsey. "As a result of not having that kind of information, the commander who was on the ground in that area, General Ham, General Dempsey and I felt very strongly that we could not put forces at risk in that situation," Panetta said. General Carter Ham commands the U.S. Africa Command. And the CIA has denied that anyone in its chain of command rejected requests for help from the besieged Americans. But Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, in a post published Friday, doubted Panetta's explanation and said the fault must lie with Obama himself. "Would the secretary of defense make such a decision on his own? No," Kristol wrote. "It would have been a presidential decision." "He's wrong," said Vietor. On Friday, Obama himself forcefully denied deliberately misleading Americans about the attack in Benghazi, which claimed the lives of four Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens.</Msg><Username>faithflagfamily</Username><Timestamp>1351442865506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 12:47:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351443419667-22</Id><Topic><Title>An investigation is appropriate</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1351442043960</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 12:34:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's all Faux Noos inspired noise in a desparte last ditch attempt the arouse the RWNJ base to frothing at the mouth Cujo type rage knowing that Obama is going to be re-elected over the religious cultist, king of the flip-floppers, and etch-a-sketch Rawmoney candi-dtae...</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1351443419667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 12:56:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351445560495-23</Id><Topic><Title>what the spectre gunship could have done</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351305950401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:45:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If embassy security is anything like the military there are always requests for more personnel My last duty station by TOE doctrine was supposed to be staffed by eight led by an 0-6. When I got to base it was staffed by five led by an LTC. When I was assigned, it was staffed by three, led by a Maj. Then staffed by two. Then staffed by one, moi, during Operation Desert Storm. Always there were requests for more personnel. Desert Storm had a coalition of over 500,000 troops to remove Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Bush43 wanted to invade and occupy Iraq with half as many coalition forces. The military wnated twice as many. It was Ambassador Stevens call to go to Benghazi that day, for the opening of a school by the fellow who rescued our pilot. It was probably a bad call in hindsight. But to politicize the situation before all the facts are known is just plain ludicrous.

Col. Tony Shaffer told Fox News that according to his sources, President Obama watched the assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, from the White House as it took place. “This was in the middle of the business day in Washington, so everybody at the White House, CIA, Pentagon, everybody was watching this go down,” he said on Fox News’ “Justice with Judge Jeanine.” “According to my sources, yes, [President Obama] was one of those in the White House Situation Room in real-time watching this,” he added. Military analyst says Obama watched Benghazi attack in real time. Video: Military analyst says Obama watched Benghazi attack in real time. Col. David Hunt, a Fox News military analyst, said the "entire U.S. government was paying attention," since this was the fourth embassy to have been attacked in a 24-hour period. But President Obama said Friday that he was "not personally aware" of any requests for additional security. "Ultimately, though, any time there is a death of an American overseas, I want to find out what happened because my most important job as president is keeping the American people safe, and we will get to the bottom of what happened," he said during an interview on "The Michael Smerconish Show." Both military analysts said that only President Obama could have given the order to send military assets into Libya “He, only he, could issue a directive to Secretary of Defense Panetta to do something. That’s the only place it could be done,” Lt. Col. Shaffer said. According to Col. Hunt, the military could have had jets on the scene within 20 minutes and special forces on the ground, including a contingent of Delta Force, within two hours.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351452597220</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 15:29:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351453082385-35</Id><Topic><Title>The Des Moines Register endorsement: Mitt Romney offers a fresh economic vision</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351447268517</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 14:01:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Black Pariah is flushing the USA down the crapper and Americans need not suffer anymore.

Yes and no. I refer you back to the so-called "good" thief on the cross with Jesus. The one that believed. Spent perhaps his entire life living a raucous and vile life. Jesus said he (the one that believed) would be with Him in paradise that very day - because the thief recognized that he was a sinner, that Jesus was Lord, and believed in His resurrection (Romans 10:9,10). Jesus did not say anything to the one that mocked Him. But, clearly, the Bible teaches us that we are saved by faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8,9). That is how it works. But the danger for a person that thinks he can ignore salvation and belief in Jesus up until his end of life ignores the truth of the uncertainty of his mind and safety at that time.

The United States is embroiled in unstable regions that could easily explode into full-blown disaster. An ideological assault from the right has started to undermine the vital health reform law passed in 2010. Those forces are eroding women’s access to health care, and their right to control their lives. Nearly 50 years after passage of the Civil Rights Act, all Americans’ rights are cheapened by the right wing’s determination to deny marriage benefits to a selected group of us. Astonishingly, even the very right to vote is being challenged. That is the context for the Nov. 6 election, and as stark as it is, the choice is just as clear. President Obama has shown a firm commitment to using government to help foster growth. He has formed sensible budget policies that are not dedicated to protecting the powerful, and has worked to save the social safety net to protect the powerless. Mr. Obama has impressive achievements despite the implacable wall of refusal erected by Congressional Republicans so intent on stopping him that they risked pushing the nation into depression, held its credit rating hostage, and hobbled economic recovery. Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has gotten this far with a guile that allows him to say whatever he thinks an audience wants to hear. But he has tied himself to the ultraconservative forces that control the Republican Party and embraced their policies, including reckless budget cuts and 30-year-old, discredited trickle-down ideas. Voters may still be confused about Mr. Romney’s true identity, but they know the Republican Party, and a Romney administration would reflect its agenda. Mr. Romney’s choice of Representative Paul Ryan as his running mate says volumes about that. We have criticized individual policy choices that Mr. Obama has made over the last four years, and have been impatient with his unwillingness to throw himself into the political fight. But he has shaken off the hesitancy that cost him the first debate, and he approaches the election clearly ready for the partisan battles that would follow his victory. We are confident he would challenge the Republicans in the “fiscal cliff” battle even if it meant calling their bluff, letting the Bush tax cuts expire and forcing them to confront the budget sequester they created. Electing Mr. Romney would eliminate any hope of deficit reduction that included increased revenues. In the poisonous atmosphere of this campaign, it may be easy to overlook Mr. Obama’s many important achievements, including carrying out the economic stimulus, saving the auto industry, improving fuel efficiency standards, and making two very fine Supreme Court appointments. Health Care Mr. Obama has achieved the most sweeping health care reforms since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The reform law takes a big step toward universal health coverage, a final piece in the social contract. It was astonishing that Mr. Obama and the Democrats in Congress were able to get a bill past the Republican opposition. But the Republicans’ propagandistic distortions of the new law helped them wrest back control of the House, and they are determined now to repeal the law. That would eliminate the many benefits the reform has already brought: allowing children under 26 to stay on their parents’ policies; lower drug costs for people on Medicare who are heavy users of prescription drugs; free immunizations, mammograms and contraceptives; a ban on lifetime limits on insurance payments. Insurance companies cannot deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions. Starting in 2014, insurers must accept all applicants. Once fully in effect, the new law would start to control health care costs. Mr. Romney has no plan for covering the uninsured beyond his callous assumption that they will use emergency rooms. He wants to use voucher programs to shift more Medicare costs to beneficiaries and block grants to shift more Medicaid costs to the states. The Economy Mr. Obama prevented another Great Depression. The economy was cratering when he took office in January 2009. By that June it was growing, and it has been ever since (although at a rate that disappoints everyone), thanks in large part to interventions Mr. Obama championed, like the $840 billion stimulus bill. Republicans say it failed, but it created and preserved 2.5 million jobs and prevented unemployment from reaching 12 percent. Poverty would have been much worse without the billions spent on Medicaid, food stamps and jobless benefits. Last year, Mr. Obama introduced a jobs plan that included spending on school renovations, repair projects for roads and bridges, aid to states, and more. It was stymied by Republicans. Contrary to Mr. Romney’s claims, Mr. Obama has done good things for small businesses — like pushing through more tax write-offs for new equipment and temporary tax cuts for hiring the unemployed. The Dodd-Frank financial regulation was an important milestone. It is still a work in progress, but it established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, initiated reform of the derivatives market, and imposed higher capital requirements for banks. Mr. Romney wants to repeal it. If re-elected, Mr. Obama would be in position to shape the “grand bargain” that could finally combine stimulus like the jobs bill with long-term deficit reduction that includes letting the high-end Bush-era tax cuts expire. Stimulus should come first, and deficit reduction as the economy strengthens. Mr. Obama has not been as aggressive as we would have liked in addressing the housing crisis, but he has increased efforts in refinancing and loan modifications. Mr. Romney’s economic plan, as much as we know about it, is regressive, relying on big tax cuts and deregulation. That kind of plan was not the answer after the financial crisis, and it will not create broad prosperity. Foreign Affairs Mr. Obama and his administration have been resolute in attacking Al Qaeda’s leadership, including the killing of Osama bin Laden. He has ended the war in Iraq. Mr. Romney, however, has said he would have insisted on leaving thousands of American soldiers there. He has surrounded himself with Bush administration neocons who helped to engineer the Iraq war, and adopted their militaristic talk in a way that makes a Romney administration’s foreign policies a frightening prospect. Mr. Obama negotiated a much tougher regime of multilateral economic sanctions on Iran. Mr. Romney likes to say the president was ineffective on Iran, but at the final debate he agreed with Mr. Obama’s policies. Mr. Obama deserves credit for his handling of the Arab Spring. The killing goes on in Syria, but the administration is working to identify and support moderate insurgent forces there. At the last debate, Mr. Romney talked about funneling arms through Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which are funneling arms to jihadist groups. Mr. Obama gathered international backing for airstrikes during the Libyan uprising, and kept American military forces in a background role. It was smart policy. In the broadest terms, he introduced a measure of military restraint after the Bush years and helped repair America’s badly damaged reputation in many countries from the low levels to which it had sunk by 2008. The Supreme Court The future of the nation’s highest court hangs in the balance in this election — and along with it, reproductive freedom for American women and voting rights for all, to name just two issues. Whoever is president after the election will make at least one appointment to the court, and many more to federal appeals courts and district courts. Mr. Obama, who appointed the impressive Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, understands how severely damaging conservative activism has been in areas like campaign spending. He would appoint justices and judges who understand that landmarks of equality like the Voting Rights Act must be defended against the steady attack from the right. Mr. Romney’s campaign Web site says he will “nominate judges in the mold of Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito,” among the most conservative justices in the past 75 years. There is no doubt that he would appoint justices who would seek to overturn Roe v. Wade. Civil Rights The extraordinary fact of Mr. Obama’s 2008 election did not usher in a new post-racial era. In fact, the steady undercurrent of racism in national politics is truly disturbing. Mr. Obama, however, has reversed Bush administration policies that chipped away at minorities’ voting rights and has fought laws, like the ones in Arizona, that seek to turn undocumented immigrants into a class of criminals. The military’s odious “don’t ask, don’t tell” rule was finally legislated out of existence, under the Obama administration’s leadership. There are still big hurdles to equality to be brought down, including the Defense of Marriage Act, the outrageous federal law that undermines the rights of gay men and lesbians, even in states that recognize those rights. Though it took Mr. Obama some time to do it, he overcame his hesitation about same-sex marriage and declared his support. That support has helped spur marriage-equality movements around the country. His Justice Department has also stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act against constitutional challenges. Mr. Romney opposes same-sex marriage and supports the federal act, which not only denies federal benefits and recognition to same-sex couples but allows states to ignore marriages made in other states. His campaign declared that Mr. Romney would not object if states also banned adoption by same-sex couples and restricted their rights to hospital visitation and other privileges. Mr. Romney has been careful to avoid the efforts of some Republicans to criminalize abortion even in the case of women who had been raped, including by family members. He says he is not opposed to contraception, but he has promised to deny federal money to Planned Parenthood, on which millions of women depend for family planning. For these and many other reasons, we enthusiastically endorse President Barack Obama for a second term, and express the hope that his victory will be accompanied by a new Congress willing to work for policies that Americans need</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1351455785747</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 16:23:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351456358569-42</Id><Topic><Title>NYT Editorial: Barack Obama for Re-Election</Title><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1351455785747</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 16:23:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Five-stars for you posting that, using the old messageboard rating system....</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1351456358569</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 16:32:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351456474882-43</Id><Topic><Title>The Des Moines Register endorsement: Mitt Romney offers a fresh economic vision</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351447268517</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 14:01:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$., plain and simple.

Boeing broke federal labor law by banning talk of unions on company time at its North Charleston site, an administrative law judge found in a ruling issued Friday. The jet maker can't prohibit workers from talking about unions if it allows them to talk about other topics not related to work, the judge wrote. The NLRB brought the complaint against Boeing at the behest of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The judge's ruling against Boeing comes as the labor union considers an organizing effort at the South Carolina site. The South Carolina 787 final assembly site has been a point of contention between Boeing and the Machinists. Prompted by District 751 of the Machinists, the NLRB filed in 2011 a federal lawsuit against Boeing, claiming the company illegally retaliated against union workers in Washington state for labor strikes when Boeing picked North Charleston for additional work. The NLRB case drew plenty of attention in the business community and among politicians. Ultimately, the union agreed to drop the case in exchange for a guarantee from Boeing for 737 MAX work. The two also inked a new labor contract late last year. Workers at a 787 subassembly site in South Carolina voted out the Machinists union shortly before the company picked North Charleston for the second Dreamliner assembly line. The original line is here in Everett. The union recently held informational meetings for Boeing workers in South Carolina. The Machinists anticipate holding a vote to allow representation at Boeing South Carolina, a union representative told The Post and Courier newspaper earlier this week. “We're committed to working with our employees down in Charleston,” Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said on Wednesday, during the company's earnings call with journalists and analysts. “It's not clear to us they need representation. We like dealing directly with our employees.” Boeing spokeswoman Candy Eslinger expressed disappointment over the ruling in an email sent Saturday. "Boeing does not – and has not – told any employee that he or she can’t talk about the union (or any other subject) during work time, as long as the discussions don’t impact production," Eslinger wrote. "To the contrary, we encourage our South Carolina teammates to carefully consider the impact that a union would have on their relationship with management, and talking about the IAM’s attempt to organize Charleston is an important aspect of their decision-making." In his ruling, administrative law judge William Nelson Cates instructed Boeing to cease the ban on talking about the union at the South Carolina site. Boeing also has to post notices at the North Charleston facility acknowledging that it violated labor law and informing workers of their rights.</Msg><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1351457129635</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 16:45:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351457147119-48</Id><Topic><Title>Spectre Gun Ship, or F-15 Eagle Could Have Been Mowing Down Libyan Terrorists</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1351391671214</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 22:34:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sigonella waiting on pins and needles to get the 'word' to buy or sell from Y.T.

to do some research on the status of Aircraft Carriers, probably any one of which could have supported the repulsion of the attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya. We have 11 Aircraft Carriers. At the time of the attack, only FOUR were even at sea and capable of being useful. The rest were either at Home Port for leave (1), complex overhaul (3), and 6 to 10 month planned incremental availability (3). All of these unavailabilities occurred this year. Why??????? What is with this President? The remaining ACs were either in the Pacific (2) or the Persian Gulf (2). ELEVEN AIRCRAFT CARRIERS WITH ONLY FOUR AVAILABLE? The rest being serviced in some way and UNAVAILABLE with all of the crew sitting around at home port. The ONLY thing being saved is FUEL. Who is the idiot that planned this? Does anyone doubt what Romney was saying in the debates that our Navy has been driven to its lowest availability/size since before WW1? And smug mug answers, "we also do not use bayonets and horses .. and we have these things called aircraft carriers". Yes, but Obama FAILED to mention that he has only 36% of them deployed.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1351465789839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:09:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351465924992-69</Id><Title>This is R431 drone operator from Houston, TX</Title><Msg>I woulda called in an air strike on behghazi but didn't too stoopid a RWNJ to know</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351465924992</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:12:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351466065397-70</Id><Topic><Title>This is R431 drone operator from Houston, TX</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351465924992</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:12:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stop the drone; turn off NPR .

When the quick response team arrived (Libyan) shortly after that all they could do was retrieve the bodies. Gunship would not have helped because the terrorists were in too close and it all happened too quickly. (you gonna station gunships over every consulate at risk?) The AC gunship is not effective in support of close quarter combat even if there is good intelligence. I don't think there was good intelligence in place to anticipate the attack, the same can be said for GW prior to 9/11. Despite that I have a problem blaming GW or Obama since it's hard to control things down to that level of detail. My hope is that this is a learning experience and that it will not happen again. GW put in reforms and Obama is, hopefully doing the same. I hate to see this sort of tragedy politicised like it is by Monday morning quarterbacks.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1351468177139</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:49:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351468343905-82</Id><Topic><Title>5000 per frame camera, the World Series, Fox</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351467885882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:44:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a detroit steak ta-ta a green salad some spicy penne and oatmeal rasisin cookies what are you havin'...</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351468343905</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:52:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351468901385-83</Id><Topic><Title>By my calculations, the government is usually 2 years behind the curve</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351466660508</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:24:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ding ding ding ding ding those betting 4 obama are gonna need a bigger hat in Reno, Nov. 6-7 when it rains pennies from heaven who needs watter</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351468901385</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:01:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351469335339-84</Id><Title>three feet</Title><Msg>the RWNJ speech therpist blew a chunk AT A RWNJ LUNCHEON when I said we need a new preisdent... due to home prices not too bad EVEN HEINLICH DIDN'T GET A MENEAUVER TO BLOW A CHUNK THAT FAR PLAY BALL!</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351469335339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:08:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351469793912-85</Id><Topic><Title>what the spectre gunship could have done</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351305950401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:45:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>may not have saved ambassador - but how about the others- the fight went on for 6 to 7 hours, and the SEALS were killed aobut 6 hours LATER as to gunships in close quarters- suggest you look a t a few videos on youtube</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351469793912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:16:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351471417381-86</Id><Topic><Title>Aircraft Carriers and Obama Smoke</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1351465789839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:09:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny how Obama felt that the Persian Gulf (about 0.07% of the world's oceans) required two ACs - the same number as available for the rest of the world - on 9/11. Perhaps that is the reason that Rear Admiral Charles Gaouette (USS John C. Stennis) was relieved of duty in the Middle East for "accusation of inappropriate leadership judgment". He probably opened his mouth and told Panetta and Obama what he thought of their military leadership - in light of the attack at Benghazi. There was a comment on a different post that this should not be politicized. OK, fine, but let's still vote him out of office this November for malfeasance in office. No politics involved in evaluating his demonstrated incompetence as Commander in Chief. Again, as Clint Eastwood observed, "if they do a bad job you have to let them go".</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1351471417381</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:43:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351471688867-87</Id><Topic><Title>Aircraft Carriers and Obama Smoke</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1351465789839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:09:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Once agin you failed to answer a question or ask one hence your grade remains F oatmeal raisin cookies or don't you have the ball to answer the King of Saudi Arabia holding hands with Boosh43 and talking about the tulips he don't lik,e-mittens either crazy flip-floppin' df mf'r</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351471688867</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:48:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351472107984-88</Id><Topic><Title>Aircraft Carriers and Obama Smoke</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1351465789839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:09:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Black, Apparently you are taking lessons from Obama on double-speak, riddles, and dark sentences.

That would suggest that for every 9 months up, they are 13.7 months down. The planned interim availabilities (3 AC) of standard 6 to 10.5 months don't run up 13.7 months. And the RCOH's, complex overhauls, should not be done on 3 AC's at the same time. The only thing that I might imagine is that Obama has all of these AC's in the shop to drive up employment - to help his re-election. Otherwise, this has to be either an unusual integration of unforeseen circumstances (hard to believe) or massive lack of concern and/or preparation. The final kicker is that Obama ordered two AC's to the Persian Gulf - at the expense of the Mediterranean. His choice; his mistake.

The story was in reference to General Ham that Panetta referenced in the quote below. quote: "(The) basic principle is that you don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on; without having some real-time information about what's taking place," Panetta told Pentagon reporters. "And as a result of not having that kind of information, the commander who was on the ground in that area, Gen. Ham, Gen. Dempsey and I felt very strongly that we could not put forces at risk in that situation." The information I heard today was that General Ham as head of Africom received the same e-mails the White House received requesting help/support as the attack was taking place. General Ham immediately had a rapid response unit ready and communicated to the Pentagon that he had a unit ready. General Ham then received the order to stand down. His response was to screw it, he was going to help anyhow. Within 30 seconds to a minute after making the move to respond, his second in command apprehended General Ham and told him that he was now relieved of his command. The story continues that now General Rodiguez would take General Ham's place as the head of Africom. This version of events contradicts Mr. Panetta’s October 25 statement that General Ham advised against intervention. But so far there is nothing solid to back it up. Maybe Ham attempted to send a reaction force against orders, or maybe he simply said the wrong thing to the wrong people. Perhaps he gave whomever he was talking to up the chain a piece of his mind about leaving Americans to die when there was a chance of saving them. At the very least U.S. forces might have made those who killed our people pay while they were still on the scene. +++++ It figures</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351479619910</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:00:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351480197426-108</Id><Topic><Title>Was General Hamm fired for wanting to help in benghazi ?</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351479619910</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:00:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nothing figures- its all speculation- speculation tho is what the pukes and their ignorant racist redneck sweethearts use for facts</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351480197426</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:09:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351480374359-109</Id><Topic><Title>Was General Hamm fired for wanting to help in benghazi ?</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351479619910</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:00:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting coincidence ??? Navy replaces admiral leading Mideast strike group WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Navy said Saturday it is replacing the admiral in command of an aircraft carrier strike group in the Middle East, pending the outcome of an internal investigation into undisclosed allegations of inappropriate judgment. Rear Adm. Charles M. Gaouette is being sent back to the USS John C. Stennis’ home port at Bremerton, Washington stae, in what the Navy called a temporary reassignment. The Navy said he is not formally relieved of his command of the Stennis strike group but will be replaced by Rear Adm. Troy M. Shoemaker, who will assume command until the investigation is completed. It is highly unusual for the Navy to replace a carrier strike group commander during its deployment. The Navy did not reveal details of the allegations, citing only an accusation of “inappropriate leadership judgment” that arose during the strike group’s deployment to the Middle East. Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Navy’s chief spokesman, declined to discuss the investigation. The Stennis group deployed from Bremerton in late August and had entered the Navy 5th Fleet’s area of operations in the Middle East on Oct. 17 after sailing across the Pacific. The Stennis made port visits in Thailand and Malaysia on its way to the Middle East. It deployed four months earlier than scheduled in response to a request by the commander of U.S. Central Command, Marine Gen. James Mattis, to maintain two aircraft carriers in the Middle East. The Stennis replaced the USS Enterprise carrier group. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta visited the Stennis and its sailors in Bremerton shortly before they departed. He thanked them for accelerating their deployment on short notice. “I understand that it is tough,” Panetta said. “We are asking an awful lot of each of you, but frankly you are the best I have and when the world calls we have to respond.”</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351480374359</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:12:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351480529611-110</Id><Topic><Title>Aircraft Carriers and Obama Smoke</Title><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1351465789839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:09:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>more lies- and speculation- if you already have a hardon for Obama then the least little suspicion suffices for fact and he is condemned by this boards ignorant racist redneck chicken hawks who are afraid to walk in the shoes of the real warriers</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351480529611</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:15:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351480696695-111</Id><Topic><Title>Spain's Push For Green Economy Leads To Unemployment Over 25%</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351362044457</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:20:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ali which part of the moooslim world did you pick up your moniker in- Yemen?? you havent got a clue what caused the Spanish financial problem so #$%$</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351480696695</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:18:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351480744268-112</Id><Topic><Title>three feet</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351469335339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:08:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maybe L8ter we will put pennies on the train tracks pretrend it is missiion impossible gum and the dead don't count ...no to blowing up trains and counting up the dead vat ist dis all aboot no mittens</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1351480744268</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:19:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351480830900-113</Id><Topic><Title>Spain's Push For Green Economy Leads To Unemployment Over 25%</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351362044457</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:20:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" Germany is facing a crisis of energy poverty beacause of soaring energy costs and businesses are starting to leave Germany"" #$%$!!! that is a desperate lie to cover your a..... for all the flak your anti green stance earns you</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351480830900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:20:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351480985901-114</Id><Topic><Title>Spain's Push For Green Economy Leads To Unemployment Over 25%</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1351362044457</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:20:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>too much energy?? you are so dumb about wind energy you wouldnt be able to hold up your end of a conversation on the subject in a kindergarten-- #$%$ untill you learn something about green energy and especially wind energy and its distribution thru the power grid</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351480985901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:23:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351481147975-115</Id><Topic><Title>Was General Hamm fired for wanting to help in benghazi ?</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1351479619910</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:00:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apparently the Stennis was somewhere in the Pacific Ocean at that time ???
