How much did it cost you? You say, "Williams, that's a silly question. It cost $3." That's where you're mistaken, because there's a difference between price and cost. To prove that price and cost are not the same, consider the following. Suppose you live and work in New York City and routinely pay $15 for a haircut. Imagine you were told that there's a barber in Boise, Idaho, who can give you the identical haircut for just $5. Would you start going to the Boise barber? I'm betting you'd answer no because even though the price is cheaper, the cost is greater. We might think of price as the money that's actually given in exchange for the transfer of ownership. When you purchased the gallon of gas, you simply transferred your ownership of $3. What the gas cost you is a different matter. One way to determine the cost of a gallon of gas is to ask yourself what sacrifice you had to make in order to have $3 to buy it. Say that your annual salary is $75,000. Your total federal income tax, state income tax, local taxes and Social Security and Medicare taxes come to about 35 percent of your salary. That means that in order to purchase the $3 gallon of gas required that you earned about $4.60 in order to have $3 after taxes. That means a gallon of gas costs you $4.60 worth of sacrifice. But that's not so costly as it is to a richer person -- for example, someone earning a yearly salary of $500,000. He has to earn more than $5 before taxes in order to have $3 after taxes to purchase gas. If taxes only concealed hidden costs of what we buy, we'd be lucky, but taxes are destructive in another hidden way. Suppose I want to hire you to repair my computer. Having the work done is worth $200 to me, and performing the work is worth $200 to you. The transaction occurs because we have a meeting of the minds. Suppose Congress imposes a 30 percent income tax on you. That means that if you repaired my computer, you would receive not $200, what it was worth to you to do the job, but instead $140 after taxes. You might say the heck with repairing my computer; spending time with your family is worth more than $140. You might then offer that you'd do the job if I paid you $283. That way, your after-tax earnings would be $200 -- what doing the job is worth to you. There's a problem. The repair job was worth $200 to me, not $283. So it's my turn to say the heck with it. This simple example demonstrates that one effect of taxes is that of destroying transactions and hence jobs. But politicians have what economists call a zero-elasticity vision of the world. In other words, they're fool enough to believe that people will behave after taxes are levied just as they behaved before and that the only effect of a tax is to bring in more revenue. Of course, a more flattering assessment is that politicians are not fools and know that their actions destroy transactions and hence jobs but they don't give a damn and only care about revenue. Here's a question: Would you and I, as well as our nation, be better off if you repaired my computer and I gave you $200 in cash and we agreed not to report the transaction to the agents of Congress? I'd answer yes and no. Yes, because there'd be more transactions, more jobs and greater wealth. No, because we'd be criminals. Taxes are necessary to fund the constitutionally mandated functions of the federal government. If Congress spent according to its authority under Article 1, Section 8 of our Constitution, taxes wouldn't be any more than 5 percent of the gross domestic product, as it was between 1787 and 1920, as opposed to today's 20 percent.</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1366204709273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 09:18:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366205314030-20</Id><Topic><Title>Bush kept us safe for 8 years, Obama has failed Americans</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1366073101852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 20:45:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You aren't very old but it's good your momy let's you use a computer, even if it's before you know anything.</Msg><Username>db0865</Username><Timestamp>1366205314030</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 09:28:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366205699716-21</Id><Title>SALON: 'Let's hope the Boston Marathon bomber is white American'...</Title><Msg>Left-Wing lunatic so called journalists are spinning their propaganda as usual trying to connect dots where there is no connection.

Those kids will be subject to more frequent locker checks and pat downs.</Msg><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1366216387384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 12:33:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366216570965-66</Id><Topic><Title>Why are Democrats so Fearful of Answering Questions?</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1366155470330</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 19:37:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post bouncer......well said!!</Msg><Username>rover472u</Username><Timestamp>1366216570965</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 12:36:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366216624387-67</Id><Title>the almost 4 year late , 33 billion dollar overcost sparky is flying ? still not certified har</Title><Msg>BA is up 4.47% for five years right now, while Airbus is up over 118% for the same 5 years , FMH its not the 787 is flying, its which stock returns investors the most money get it now ?wow will wonders never stop the non certified firestarter is testing how about that , no revenue, almost 4 years late and able to fly with restrictions, in a non revenue producing test flight.

If a person has campaigned, petitioned, lobbied on local, state and federal level and still not gotten their way, it could just be that the majority has ruled another way.

Novermber 11, 2008 is when the great divide was put up by those lockstep repubilcans hated see a democrat and an African American become the president. Divisive language first came from leading republicans. I was listening to talk radio today and heard two different callers attack President Obama. The rist was a birther with that same old POC dogma. The second actually believed that liberals hated America, because they were against the republicans. What a nut job. Liberals, like anyone else love the Bill of Rights and they think more about what is good for American Citizens as whole and dislike corporatization of the government. The Boston bomber is the most recent example of someone who hates America. I'd hardly believe hime to be a liberal or a progressive.

Here we have a striking flash of candor from lefty Marc LaMont Hill on Huff Post Live (scroll through to the end): “For what it’s worth, I do think that those of us on the left have made a decision not to cover this trial because we worry that it’ll compromise abortion rights. Whether you agree with abortion or not, I do think there’s a direct connection between the media’s failure to cover this and our own political commitments on the left. I think it’s a bad idea, I think it’s dangerous, but I think that’s the way it is.” Points for telling it like it is, although the Right (and others) put two-and-two together awhile back. Lamont Hill earns some tepid applause for honesty here -- plus, at least the man's consistent: He's demonstrated a pattern of sympathizing with killers.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1366229028008</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 16:03:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366229195931-110</Id><Topic><Title>If I move to South America, Will I be An American-American</Title><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1366128627983</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 12:10:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the Kent Raven moves to San Francisco will he still be gay.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1366229195931</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 16:06:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366229688169-111</Id><Topic><Title>The U.S. Used to be Number One</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1366210839435</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 11:00:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's been down hill since 1913 when the progressive movement began to consolidate political power.

Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said Wednesday he fears a "train wreck" as the Obama administration implements its signature healthcare law. Baucus, the chairman of the chamber's powerful Finance Committee and a key architect of the healthcare reform law, said he fears people do not understand how the law will work. "I just see a huge train wreck coming down," he told Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a Wednesday hearing. "You and I have discussed this many times, and I don't see any results yet." Baucus pressed Sebelius for details about how the Health Department will explain the law and raise awareness of its provisions, which are supposed to take effect in just a matter of months. "I'm very concerned that not enough is being done so far — very concerned," Baucus said. He pressed Sebelius to explain how her department will overcome entrenched misunderstandings about what the healthcare law does. "Small businesses have no idea what to do, what to expect," Baucus said. Citing anecdotal evidence from small businesses in his home state, Baucus asked Sebelius for specifics about how it is measuring public understanding of the law. "You need data. Do you have any data? You've never given me data. You only give me concepts, frankly," he said. Sebelius said in response that the administration is not independently monitoring public awareness of specific provisions but will be embarking on an education campaign beginning this summer. Baucus is facing a competitive reelection fight next year, and Republicans are sure to attack him over his role as the primary author of the healthcare law. A messy rollout of the law's major provisions, months before Baucus faces voters, could feed into the GOP's criticism.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1366237550331</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 18:25:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366237645502-133</Id><Topic><Title>Statement on the Failure of the U.S. Senate to Pass Gun Background Check Legislation</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1366234487883</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 17:34:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama will go insane with rage to think that ANYONE would oppose him on gun control.

John Cornyn alleged President Obama has told the families of Newtown shooting victims that the Republican party “doesn’t really care about their loss.” But Obama never said that. Cornyn’s misrepresentation of Obama’s comments came during a speech on the Sen. floor on April 11, just before the Texas Republican voted against allowing debate to begin on Democrats’ gun legislation sponsored by Sen. Reid. Cornyn, April 11: "The President has told some of these victims’ families that this side of the aisle doesn’t really care about their loss. That’s not true. That’s false. The President is wrong. All of us care about these families, and all of us should care about violence in our communities, and we should try to work together to find ways to address this – not in a symbolic sort of way, but in a real way that offers a solution" Cornyn’s accusations about over-the-top rhetoric from Obama —and tough denunciation of it —were highlighted during several cable TV news programs, including MSNBC’s “Morning show" and CNN. We asked Cornyn’s press office when Obama made these comments, and we were referred to this section of a speech by the president in Hartford, Conn.: Obama, April 8: "And yet, some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms. Think about that. They’re not just saying they’ll vote “no” on ideas that almost all Americans support. They’re saying they’ll do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions. They’re saying your opinion doesn’t matter. And that’s not right" Obama was referring to Sen. Republican threats of a filibuster on gun control measures being proposed by some Democrats. Obama’s criticism of those filibuster threats, however, is well short of telling the families of Newtown shooting victims that Republicans don’t “really care about their loss” Here, Cornyn is putting words in Obama’s mouth that he never said, and then calling them false</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1366244406376</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 20:20:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366244644193-154</Id><Topic><Title>Gun Background check fails Senate</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1366233999587</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 17:26:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't see a random number.
