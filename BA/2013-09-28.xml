He was a graduate of a real estate school. 2. He was a journey level union carpenter. 3. He worked for the FHA as a housing inspector. 4. He was an experienced Labor Relations Manager for a very large top 10 prime contractor. 5. He knew how to jump the evolution of airplane technology and he would have sold an invention that would "be a giant step forward in aerospace technology". 6. He thought that "the A350 burns 25 percent less fuel than the Boeing" 787. 7. He thought that Airbus booked and delivered more planes than Boeing in 2012.. 8. He thought the market closed early on the Thursday before Good Friday this year. 9. He recently bought a mobile home (I wonder if he keeps it "down by the river"?) 10. He thought American Airlines didn't have any 737-800s recently coming down the line in Renton. 11. He didn't always drink beer, but when he did it would have been Dos Equis.</Msg><Username>spartacus99991</Username><Timestamp>1380340840584</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 00:00:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380341111479-2</Id><Topic><Title>Vierzig_nachion are you feeling insecure with this report ?

We're not living under it anymore. It has to be put back together and reaffirmed. It's being ignored by this president who just chooses which law and what part of a law he wants to obey or not. Levin proposes 10 amendments that simply reaffirm the original intent of the Constitution and then gives a thorough explanation for why each amendment is in fact justified and warranted and traces it back to the days of the founding. Presidents don't have the right to pick and choose what parts of legislation they like and implement that and deny other parts. The American people have the power to change this. One of the points in the book is that the states, the amendment process is right there in Article V, how to deal with out-of-control administrations, how to deal with leaders that are abrogating and denying the Constitution, shredding it. It's right there. The Founders are brilliant. They knew what they were doing. They weren't just devising a formula for life during their era. They were devising a structure for all time, and, as such, they were able, because they understood human nature, they were able to understand exactly how despotism happens, dictatorship happens, usurpation of freedom by governments, how it happens. That's why the country came into existence. And there is a recipe, there's a formula, there's a prescription in the Constitution for addressing the problems we have today and fixing them. And it involves the states. In our Constitution, the states, particularly banded together, have far more power than the federal government, and the people, and it's going to have to happen. And it's going to be slow in coming. This is going to be resisted by the current ruling class. They're not going to want any part of this. So it's going to have to effervesce from the grassroots up. And Levin's book is a series of ideas of how to do it that involves the American people.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380370606280</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 08:16:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380371680601-26</Id><Topic><Title>Here's The Chart That Destroys What Republicans Are Saying About The Deficit</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380320102645</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 18:15:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least 10 trillion of the deficit belongs to Raygun, GHW Bush and W Bush-Clinton ran a defecit Obama's tax revenue was taken away from him so that his deficit has passed 6 trillion.

I can understand when airlines are #$%$ off and call Boeing on it.

McNerney was hired as window dressing because he, at least is not a playboy with women employee's while married in a publicly or a known part of the problem like Allan Mulally was,so boeing wanted a fresh image r at least lewis Platt figured that out. Too bad he went with a guy who was turned out of GE and was a jet engine man not a airframe guy. That means James Mcnerney had very little experience with what Boeing doe,s build airframes to make with GE and RR jet engines. Mr McNerney cut himself a huge employment contract before he started work so he has no reason to do a good job if he were capable compare with Steve Jobs who was paid 1 dollar per year and had to make his money on stock price gain. I made a huge amount of money in apple and sold after Steve jobs died . I looked at the new guys contract with Apple same thing Hostess cupcake CEO and BOD and executives, those guys killed the company and their retirement package paid them more than working ., the guy at apple now is paid huge for failure or success it does not matter to the CEO's of BA or AAPL . . James Mcnerney is basically a figurehead for the MD family . This all occurred because an attorney who ran Boeing named Frank Schrontz made the huge mistake of making Phil Condit the CEO, the man was incompetent. This is caused by the Boeing mentality FBI gets ahead more than SKS= if you are a friend, brother or in-law you get promoted or a good job, if you have skill ,knowledge and ability your not promoted.

The problem is transfer of engineering from Boeing which was their core strength, to contractors and going cheap, it was as stupid move done by a company that already knew it would not work. MD went out of business and lost to Boeing onthe MD outsource mentality. Condit bought MD in bankruptcy and sold Boeing in the process, then like a poor gambler at Las Vegas the new Boeing management MD- continued to use outsourcing to win big, doubling down on the basic problem (outsourcing engineering) the failed business plan. Next when a good Boeing executive mouthed off to Chicago and said we need to keep the engineering at Boeing they got themselves retired early . Why, because Chicago is living in denial. How did that happen , well look at the CEO current employment contract he was paid so much from day one he has zero reason to do a good job he was set for life before he set foot on Boeing soils . He was paid to be a figure head and that is his job, If you listen to James Mcnerney he has been wrong every time he stated when the 787 would fly and now he is wrong on fixing the plane. the plane will never be fixed it was not engineered by Boeing there is NO CONTROL AND BOEING WILL NOT KNOW ABOUT FUTURE PROBLEMS UNTIL THEY HAPPEN AS THEY DID NOT ENGINEER THE PLANE ANDA HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT THE PLANE SHOULD DO THEY ARE CLIENTS OF THE OUTSOURCED PLANE IN EFFECT THE GUY RESPONSIBLE</Msg><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1380392358115</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 14:19:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380393604397-52</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh: Bin Laden Raid “One Big Lie”</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380327374526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Al - You have to take a historic perspective to understand.

The recent vote of House Republicans to cut $40 billion from the food stamp program reflects a deep-seated and insidious racial resentment toward Americans of color. This racial resentment rears its ugly head within the provisions for the bill that demand that non-employed participants in the program get a job, job training or do community service activities. Though the bill in its current form will most likely die in the Senate, the fact that Republicans would even pass it should concern us. Conservatives continue to lead under the aegis of a deliberate and willful ignorance about the long-term existence of a group known as the working poor, people who work long hours in low-wage paying menial labor jobs, and therefore cannot make ends meet. Moreover, there is a refusal to accept that the economic downturn in 2008 created conditions of long-term unemployment, such that people simply cannot go out and “get a job” just because they will it to be so. I often wonder if government officials actually talk to real human beings about these policies, because if they did, they would find many people with a deep desire to work, but a struggle to find well-paying jobs. Some of those people would gladly take jobs that pay far less, but are frequently told that their education and years of work experience make them over-qualified. This is not a race-based problem. The American middle class itself is shrinking dramatically each year in relation to a poor economy, an insistence on austerity measures from the right, and a capitulation to these measures on the left. However, the complete irrationality and utter severity of the legislation, and the total lack of empathy and identification that inform contemporary Republican social advocacy is tied to a narrative about lazy black people and thieving “illegal” brown people. In 1976, Ronald Reagan invented the term “welfare queen,” to characterize the actions of exactly one person in Chicago who had bilked the welfare system out of a staggering amount of money. Buttressed by an underlying white racial resentment of the liberal pieces of legislation that emerged during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations – laws that had attempted to change conditions, but could not change hearts and minds around racial inequality issues — white conservatives latched on to a narrative about lazy African-Americans stealing from taxpayers and living lavish lives financed by the welfare state. That narrative has persisted well into the 21st century when Newt Gingrich derisively referred to Barack Obama as the “Food Stamp President” in the 2012 elections. Uninterrogated and misplaced racial resentment has been the most effective strategy for making white people support draconian social policies in the name of “taking the country back.” This is true, even though in sheer numbers, white people are the largest group of recipients of the SNAP program. Fiscal conservative politicians (including some Democrats like Bill Clinton) have presided over a massive and systematic redistribution of wealth into the 1 percent since the 1980s. For African-Americans this means that we lost over half of our collective (and meager) net wealth, in just the last five years, due to predatory lending and the the machinations of big business. But it is easier to hate and regulate welfare recipients. Since everyone knows that welfare queens finance their lives of luxury through the receipt of food stamps, which amounts on average to about $135 in groceries each month, cutting the food stamp program, a move that will take nearly 4 million people off the rolls in the next 10 years, is not merely a pragmatic measure or a “necessary evil,” but rather a deeply symbolic act that points to recalcitrant and entrenched racist attitudes on the right. It turns out, then, that African-Americans are not the only group of voters whose political behavior is motivated – at least, in part — by racial identity.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380403110478</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 17:18:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380403146667-69</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Launches Race War to Boost the 1 Percent</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380403110478</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 17:18:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Republican Party often capitalizes on these attitudes about poor African-Americans in moments of economic downturn, as a way to rally white working- and middle-class American voters. This is very similar to the strategy used by the Southern Planter class in the 1850s to curtail alliances between working-class white people and enslaved African-Americans. Rather than create a more equitable system by freeing the enslaved and paying everyone fair wages, the plantocracy deployed a narrative about white racial superiority that caused poverty-stricken white people to disavow their own class interests in service of racial unity. In fact, as David Roediger outlines in his now classic work “The Wages of Whiteness,” this is one of the key processes that led to white people in the U.S. becoming a unified racial group, beyond the ethnic identities (Polish, German, Irish, etc.) that had previously characterized them. Without benefit of this historical context, the consistency with which contemporary white conservatives vote against their own economic interests, in order to remain beholden to fiscal and social conservatism would appear downright peculiar. Beyond the academic implications of these choices, I am concerned about real people who need access to these services. There are members of my own family who need public assistance, because they live in economically depressed areas where job opportunities are few. There are college students and graduate students whom I teach, who are supporting themselves through school, and use food stamps so they can eat each month. And there are countless children, who come from poor homes in rural and urban areas throughout this country, who need the security that comes from being able to eat three square meals a day, so that they can be healthy and perform well in school. A final note of caution: In a world with no food security, there will be increased violence. This is related to a contemporary crisis that we are seeing among youth. When we scratch our heads wondering why we have seen a surge of bullying in schools and bullying deaths in response, perhaps we should admit that we are a nation of bullies. Our children are merely modeling the logic of a nation that ties its own sense of status, identity and power to its ability to unrelentingly pick on the “least of these.” In this American dystopia, the disproportionately black and brown least of these will be left with no other choice but to fight back or (destroy themselves and others as they) die trying.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380403146667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 17:19:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380403777300-70</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing Is An International Embarrassment</Title><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1380377472565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 10:11:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not limited to Norwegian airlines.

Boeing (Phil Condit) had decided to buy McDonnell Douglas Airplane Co., and had MASSIVELY oversold the production of the entire Boeing Co AND it's suppliers in order to drive up the value of the stock in order to buy MDC, the MDC acquistion deal was done in Boeing stock, NOT cash. This was a fatal mistake, as it made John McDonnell and Harry Stonecipher the two largest individual stockholders and allowed them to take over the BOD and the CEO position (Stonecipher, a despot by any standard) deposed Condit as CEO.. We, the production managers screamed that we had neither the personnel, the tooling or the technical support required to support the massive production increases that Condit had created by overselling the production capacity of the company. Boeing went out and hired thousands, anyone who could pass the "Cold Mirror Test" (holding a cold mirror under the potential hirees nose to determine if they were still breathing) was hired. They were not adequately trained, instead they were often put on the production line without completing even the most basic training, such as how to drill a hole, how to drive a rivet, how to apply sealant and how to read a blueprint. Thus, it is NO surprise that these failures happened. In fact, those of us who were loudly protested these decision and practices fully expected these events, and there are probably many more of this type of failure in store. BTW, the FAA ignored our protests, stating that Boeing was "fully compliant with FAA Quality Standards and Practices". Which, ON PAPER, they were.

To support the defund, unravel, or delay efforts, health reform’s opponents over many months have produced a long list of exaggerated claims, misleading complaints, glaring omissions, and blatantly false arguments. Unfortunately, syndicated columnist Kathleen Parker echoed many of them in a recent Washington Post op-ed, and we should expect to hear more of them as part of the government funding fight. Not only are most of Parker’s points inaccurate, but some of them are wrapped in heated rhetoric that’s more likely to inflame rather than inform the public debate. Parker’s bottom line is that, as House Republicans now propose, health reform should be delayed a year. But no one should think the result of such an action would simply be a one-year postponement. A year from now, opponents would demand another delay and then another or outright repeal. Indeed, House Republicans have said they are designing their new debt-limit bill so that we hit the debt limit again at the end of 2014 at the same time that the one-year health reform delay would end — so they can be tied together again a year from now. A one-year delay would be a mortal blow to health reform, with tens of millions of Americans who otherwise would gain coverage instead remaining uninsured, possibly for many years. Parker, herself, may not share that more sweeping goal. But we should see the push for a one-year delay, buttressed by misleading and inaccurate arguments and the selective use or omission of relevant data, for what it is: a core element of an effort to impede and ultimately dismember health reform so that it never comes to pass. Here’s where Parker and various other health reform detractors err and misrepresent important health reform issues. ◾Health reform has not spurred a big jump in part-time work. Employment data don’t support the claim, which Parker repeats, that health reform’s requirement for employers to offer coverage is prompting widespread cutbacks in workers’ hours to below the 30-hour threshold at which this requirement applies. Although some employers have said they are cutting certain employees’ hours, the data show they are the exception. The number of people who want to work full time but can only find part-time employment has declined, as a share of all workers, over the last couple of years.[1] And analysis conducted by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco finds that “the ultimate increase in the incidence of part-time work when the ACA [the Affordable Care Act, the health reform law] provisions are fully implemented is likely to be very small, on the order of a 1 to 2 percentage point increase or less.”[2] ◾Health reform is not causing big layoffs. The data also fail to support another of Parker’s assertions — that employers are eliminating employees altogether as a result of health reform. She cites only one example — the Cleveland Clinic. And there she misrepresents the situation, as the very article to which she links reveals. [3] Like other health care systems, the Cleveland Clinic is taking steps to operate more efficiently — a desirable trend that predates health reform and that health reform will encourage. But the Clinic reports that it’s still growing and still hiring. ◾Young adults won’t have to pay unaffordable premiums for their health insurance. Parker says that health reform will require young people who are unemployed or earn little to buy coverage that many of them will have difficulty affording. In fact, the large majority of young adults aged 19 to 29 who either are uninsured or now purchase individual coverage — and nearly all young adults who have low incomes because they’re unemployed or earn low wages — will be eligible for premium tax credits to help them buy coverage through the new health insurance exchanges or for Medicaid (if they are poor and live in states that adopt health reform’s Medicaid expansion). Parker’s claim here is far off base. A young adult earning $17,200 a year, for example, will have to pay a premium of no more than $57 a month for a mid-level “Silver” plan in the exchange thanks to the tax credits, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.[4] He or she also will be eligible for substantial help with deductibles and co-payments. ◾Most young adults won’t be subject to tax penalties. Parker uses heated rhetoric about large numbers of young adults “falling under the thumb of the IRS” because they will elect to remain uninsured and be subject to a penalty. But the relatively small number of young adults who don’t already have coverage, cannot stay on their parents’ health insurance plans because they are over age 26, and have incomes too high for premium tax credits will be able to purchase cheaper “Bronze” plans or special, low-cost plans that provide only catastrophic coverage. If they still can’t afford the premiums because the plans would cost more than 8 percent of their income (or they are poor and their state won’t expand Medicaid at this time), they will not have to pay any penalty for not having health insurance. ◾Health reform will be of substantial benefit to the near-elderly — precisely the opposite of what Parker asserts. Today, large numbers of people aged 55 to 64 who don’t have employer-provided coverage either cannot afford coverage on their own or can’t find an insurer willing to sell them a policy at any price. As a result, many of these people don’t get treatment for their medical conditions. Today, insurance companies that are willing to sell policies to near-retirees charge them a great deal more because of their age. Health reform addresses this affordability problem. Nearly four of every five uninsured people in this age bracket — 78 percent of them — have incomes that, under health reform, will make them eligible for either premium credits or Medicaid. And more than half of the 55- to 64-year-olds who already purchase coverage in the individual market will also qualify for premium credits or Medicaid, which will lower their costs. While insurers will be able to charge the near-elderly higher premiums than they charge young adults, the degree to which they will be permitted to do so will be less than it is today in most states. Moreover, near-elderly people will get larger premium subsidies to make coverage affordable. ◾The health plan from the Republican Study Committee (RSC) isn’t a serious alternative to health reform. Parker cites the RSC plan as a better alternative to the ACA. In fact, the RSC plan would not prohibit insurers from refusing to cover anyone with pre-existing medical conditions, as the Affordable Care Act does starting in 2014. The RSC plan would only bar insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions who already have continuous health coverage, whether through an employer or in the individual market; that’s only a slight improvement over the deeply flawed situation before health reform. Under the RSC plan, someone without job-based coverage who has been denied coverage in the individual market because of cancer or diabetes would likely remain uninsured. Moreover, even if someone had continuous coverage, if it was in the individual market, they would be eligible under the RSC plan only for coverage through a high-risk pool. Relying on such pools to provide coverage would be “extremely expensive and likely unsustainable,” as the Commonwealth Fund has explained.[5] That’s because high-risk pools don’t pool sick individuals with healthy individuals, but rather pool sick people with even sicker individuals who cost more to insure. Indeed, experience with state high-risk pools, as well as with the temporary high-risk pools created by health reform (until the major coverage expansions take effect), shows that unless the government increases its financial support for such pools, they eventually have to sharply restrict enrollment, set premiums at high levels that exceed what many families can afford, and/or scale back the scope of the coverage that can be purchased, in order to keep their costs from spiraling out of control. The RSC plan, however, provides no federal high-risk pool funding (other than an authorization for appropriations that might never be acted on, especially if sequestration remains in effect, severely constraining the funding available for appropriated programs). Moreover, the RSC plan terminates the tax exclusion for employer-based coverage and replaces it with a tax deduction for health insurance that can be used by people who buy on their own or through their employer. That would likely cause employer-based health coverage to seriously erode by encouraging employers to discontinue their coverage. And insurance companies in the individual market would be able to deny coverage to workers in poorer health, whose only options would then be a high risk pool or becoming uninsured. The deduction would also do very little to help uninsured people gain coverage. That’s because the subsidy that the deduction would provide would primarily benefit people in higher tax brackets and be worth little (or nothing) to the vast majority of uninsured; most of the uninsured don’t earn enough to owe income tax or are in the 10 percent or 15 percent tax brackets. The deduction’s primary benefit would go to high income people, who least need help in affording insurance and are the most likely already to have coverage. ◾Health reform won’t be a drag on the economy. Claims that health reform will seriously damage the economy and cause the loss of many jobs, which Parker echoes, are sharply inconsistent with the assessments of leading non-partisan economists. Recent statistics show no sign that health reform is negatively affecting hiring, notes Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. And the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has found that health reform would not seriously damage the economy or cause big layoffs. CBO foresees only a small reduction in labor supply — and only because some people who now work mainly to get health insurance would choose to retire earlier or work somewhat less, not because employers will eliminate jobs. Health reform will also increase labor market flexibility and productivity since the need for health coverage will no longer lock workers into a job. ◾The Administration did not provide a special break for lawmakers and their staffs. Parker also echoes the claim that because the federal government will make an employer contribution to the cost of coverage for members of Congress and their staffs, Congress is getting favored special treatment. She portrays the federal employment contribution as a “break other Americans won’t get.” This is mistaken. Under health reform, small employers are eligible to purchase coverage for their employees through the new health insurance exchanges and to make a contribution toward the premium costs. The treatment of members of Congress and their staffs is similar. Moreover, it is the result of a Republican amendment to the health reform law (added during its Senate consideration); the amendment requires that members of Congress and their staffs enroll in plans offered through the exchanges, rather than continuing to enroll in plans available to all other federal employees through the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. And the amendment’s author, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA), has said he intended for the federal government to continue its employer contributions. In short, members and their staffs will be treated like the employees of the small businesses that use the exchanges — they will buy coverage through the exchanges, their employer will make a contribution toward the premium, and they will be ineligible for the premium subsidies that people buying coverage through the exchanges on their own (rather than through their employer) can get if their incomes are low enough. This isn’t special treatment. There is no additional federal contribution here. In contrast, barring the federal government from making an employer contribution for coverage for members of Congress and their staffs, as Parker and other critics suggest or imply should be done, would single them out for special, but less favorable, treatment than all other employees. They would be the only individuals in the country whose employer is barred by law from making an employer contribution toward their health care costs. ◾A one-year delay in health reform’s individual mandate would have serious adverse consequences. Such a delay, which Parker joins health reform’s opponents in calling for, would add millions to the ranks of the uninsured and raise health insurance premiums. CBO estimates that it would increase the number of Americans who are uninsured by about 11 million in 2014, relative to current law, and would reduce health reform’s coverage gains in 2014 by nearly 85 percent. CBO also finds that it would lead to higher insurance premiums in the individual market.[6] And it would create severe problems for the health insurance exchanges just as the open enrollment season is about to begin; insurance companies have said that the prices at which they have pledged to offer coverage through the exchanges would have to be withdrawn — and new, higher prices imposed instead — if the individual mandate is delayed</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380405508545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 17:58:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380405938735-75</Id><Title>Norwegian and LOT are not going to take it from Boeing any more on the lemon 787's</Title><Msg>Norwegian Air fleet director Tore Jenssen said in advance of the meeting with Boeing. “If you look at the other 787 customers, most of them have technical problems too,” Jenssen said. “It’s a performance-reliability problem and a quality issue from Boeing.”Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief Ray Conner traveled to Norway and promised Wednesday better support for Norwegian Air’s fleet of 787 Dreamliners after a series of reliability issues that repeatedly grounded flights this month.

The NTSB's findings, released Friday say that when the jet was assembled in 1996, two panels appeared to have been misaligned, and many rivet holes were drilled incorrectly. The agency said it showed "a lack of attention to detail and extremely poor manufacturing technique." Boeing then was paper record O&amp;IR, and only held for 6 years at completed records. Now I am told, it is all digital and the culprits could be found. The report does not say if the work was done in Wichita or Renton. From my experience the 737 comes complete as a fuselage on a train from Wichita . I have been spent time at Wichita to look at their production process and identify Quality issues. . I did see shoddy workmanship at the factory and very few QA workers. The Renton factory manufacturing and QA supervisors reward rubber stamping jobs ,pressure good QA to stop doing their job. the excuse is it is production oriented get the job done deal. . A good QA simply tells his boss to use his MRB stamp and buy the job. One of my supervisors did and was transferred to Auburn and the shop was closed she bought a job with a open hole in the skin, wow, good night - JAW The Boeing 737-300 was en route from Phoenix to Sacramento, Calif., on April 1, 2011, when a 5-foot-long gash opened in the fuselage. Air rushed in, oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and a flight attendant fainted, breaking his nose, as the pilots made a rapid descent and an emergency landing at Yuma International Airport.</Msg><Username>elonmusk909</Username><Timestamp>1380408679044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 18:51:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380409218180-80</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh: Bin Laden Raid “One Big Lie”</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380327374526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As you were, private.</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1380409218180</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 19:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380409283933-81</Id><Topic><Title>liberal Trolls</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1380345066393</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 01:11:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you claiming to be a Liberal Troll or a Keebler Elf?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1380409283933</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 19:01:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380409342525-82</Id><Topic><Title>New "Zombie Apocalyspe Store" opens</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380379688704</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 10:48:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Kent Raven likes that.</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1380409342525</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-09-28 19:02:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380412189074-83</Id><Topic><Title>Seymour Hersh: Bin Laden Raid “One Big Lie”</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380327374526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 20:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The US government’s claim to have killed bin Laden has a zero probability of being true. According to Pakistani eye witnesses to the attack on the alleged Osama bin Laden compound in Pakistan, the Obama regime’s claim is simply more theater, more lies. 01: 57: Muhammad Bashir: The events that happened are thus; we were awake, we were not asleep. 02: 00: Muhammad Bashir: a Helicopter came, and circled and dropped some people there. 02: 07: Muhammad Bashir: in that house. . . where they are saying, Osama lives here; on that house’s roof, they dropped people, after that, the helicopter returned and went back. 02: 16: Reporter: How many people were they? 02: 18: Muhammad Bashir: They were ten, twelve people 02: 20: Muhammad Bashir: After that it left and for approximately 20 minutes, there behind us, on those mountains, it kept going around, the top of the mountains. 02: 27: After 20 minutes, it returned. When it returned, at that time there were TWO more helicopters arrived. One came from the West and one came from the North. When it approached for landing, after that. . . At this point; Video cut and resumed: 02: 41: Muhammad Bashir: that helicopter, there was an explosion within it and there was fire within it, immediately, we came out and arrived there. When we arrived, the helicopter was on fire, it was burning. After that, about twenty minutes later the Army arrived, the police arrived. They moved all of us back. . . 03: 04: Muhammad Bashir: . . . and all the people inside it, all of them. . . we think; if Osama was inside it, or inside this house—then who took him to the Americans? 03: 16: Muhammad Bashir: Because America. . . the helicopters that America is saying; IT carried out the operation. If America did this operation and it’s army came and it’s helicopter came, then that helicopter that came from the American’s, within that, all the people that came, those people with the explosion were finished, got destroyed! 03: 35: Muhammad Bashir: Within it, there was fire, those people, all of them died! 03: 39: and if Osama was there, they would have put him in the helicopter. Obviously, if the helicopter caught fire, Osama could have died there. If their own people were gone, (dead) so could have Osama. After that, the fallen helicopter was destroyed after this, how can Osama be, with them in America? this is a strange thing! Video cut &amp; resumes 03: 59: Muhammad Bashir: They are saying we killed Osama here. After that, they picked him up and took him away. 04: 04: Muhammad Bashir: PICKED HIM UP AND TOOK HIM AWAY—how did they do this? This, what we are thinking! 04: 07: Muhammad Bashir: The Americans’ helicopter that came, that fell here and got destroyed! 04: 09: Reporter: There was only ONE helicopter? 04: 11: Muhammad Bashir: ONE helicopter landed down here, the second helicopter came from above and went towards Mansera. It did not land. No second helicopter landed! 04: 20: Only ONE helicopter, that first dropped it’s passengers, the SAME returned to pick the people and there was an explosion within it. 04: 27: Reporter: People were inside it? 04: 29: Muhammad Bashir: People were inside it! 04: 30: Reporter: How do you know this? 04: 32: Muhammad Bashir: These people, we seen them all. 04: 34: Reporter: In the helicopter. . . you saw dead people? 04: 36: Muhammad Bashir: We saw dead people! 04: 38: Reporter: How many people? 04:39: Muhammad Bashir: This, we could not count, within the compound there was fire. 04: 43: Muhammad Bashir: and we. . . the gate was open, we entered the gate, at that time the Army had not arrived. 04: 48: Muhammad Bashir: Police had not arrived. Some people from the agencies, were present, but they did not prevent anybody, they kept entering, every person was looking , now, nobody is saying, but everyone from the mohalla (neighbourhood) and all the people present from the mohalla arrived first. We saw the gate open, we entered inside, saw the burning helicopter, the people inside were dead. After that everything was lifted. Now, there is nothing there! 05: 16: Reporter: How many dead bodies did you see? 05: 18: Muhammad Bashir: Look, you cannot count, the dead bodies were in pieces everything else was broken pieces, some here, some there, some broken, some half, some like this. 05: 27: Reporter: Tell me fully—what happened? 06: 30: Reporter: Tell me the full events 05: 31: Muhammad Bashir: I told you, this is. . . 05: 32: Reporter: You did not. . .

Having been denied their proposal to defund Obamacare completely, their new plan would delay the law for one year and repeal the medical device tax it contains. But National Review's Robert Costa reports that House leadership is already discussing a Plan C for when the Senate rejects today's plan: passing a continuing resolution that funds Obamacare but includes the so-called Vitter Amendment. That amendment would bar the federal government from providing subsidies to help members of Congress and their staff pay for health plans in the Obamacare exchanges. Coupled with the existing Grassley Amendment to the Affordable Care Act (which forces Congress and its staff off the Federal Employee Health Benefit plan and into the exchanges), this amounts to a pay cut of several thousand dollars a year for most people who work for Congress. This idea is bizarre, for two reasons. One: three weeks ago, Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor tried to get House Republicans behind a plan that would have forced the Senate to take a vote on funding Obamacare but kept the government open even if the Senate chose to keep Obamacare funded. They couldn't get enough Republican votes to pass this plan because conservative Republicans (correctly) called it out as a gimmick that wouldn't defund Obamacare. If an otherwise-clean continuing resolution with the Vitter Amendment attached is adopted, congressional staff pay will be cut, but Obamacare implementation will continue as scheduled. Why would the anti-Obamacare dead-enders consider that to be any more acceptable than the approach they rejected three weeks ago? I am very skeptical that Boehner can get the votes for this in the House. Two: Let's say this plan does pass the House. Republicans seem focused on the idea that this will be a tough vote for Senate Democrats. If Democrats refuse to take up a CR with the Vitter Amendment, or if they strip out the amendment and send it back to the House, "Republicans would argue that Democrats shut down the government to protect their perks," as Costa puts it. But what if Senate Democrats just agree to the CR with the Vitter Amendment and it becomes law? That's a disaster for Republicans. House Republican staffers are already furious with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and the outside conservative groups that have forced them to turn these CR negotiations into a fight over Obamacare. News reports over the past two weeks have been filled with anonymous GOP staff quotes attacking Cruz. Cruz even mocked his House Republican staff detractors during his 21-hour floor speech, noting "There is no courage like the courage in Washington of the anonymous congressional staffer." If a CR with the Vitter Amendment becomes law, the upshot will be that Cruz hijacked the House's legislative process over the CR, Obamacare is still being funded, and all Republicans have to show for it is a staff pay cut of several thousand dollars. That will not help to calm the already-ongoing civil war within the congressional GOP. Of course, Democratic staff will also be angry about having their pay cut. But they will have a common enemy (the Republicans) and a plausible legislative strategy (repeal the Vitter Amendment.) Republicans will try to direct staff anger toward the Democrats, but the name of the person responsible is right there on the amendment: Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), one of Cruz's allies in the defunding fight. Republican members will be left saying the way to fix the pay issue is to repeal Obamacare. But the whole reason House Republican leadership and staff was resisting the Cruz approach on the CR is that they know repealing Obamacare while Barack Obama is president is a fantasy. In other words, Republican members will be saying they have no plan to undo the pay cut they "won" for their staff. The Vitter Amendment is one of those proposals that's only useful as a talking point. Vitter has been prattling on about how there is a "special Obamacare exemption" for Congress that his amendment would fix. That's not true, as National Review's Jonathan Strong points out, but truth is rarely an important factor in Republican health policy talking points. If Vitter's proposal actually becomes law, Republicans will lose their talking point and gain a very unhappy employee base.
