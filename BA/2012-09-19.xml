So tell me, was he correct when he said none of those people will vote for him? Because if he is SO wrong about that how much will he mess up being the president. Romney might have made money investing other peoples money, but, he isn't very good at anything else. He is a lousy speaker, he has no moral compass and will say what ever it takes to any given group. And talk about someone that doesn't pay taxes, how would we know if he paid any? He won't release more than one record.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1348061696171</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:34:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348061835797-38</Id><Topic><Title>BA has beat esitimates for the last 4 qtrs</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1348029691576</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 00:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BUY BUY BUY</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1348061835797</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:37:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348061839833-39</Id><Topic><Title>BA has beat esitimates for the last 4 qtrs</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1348029691576</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 00:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BUY BUY BUY</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1348061839833</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:37:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348061918026-40</Id><Topic><Title>Test needs to be given</Title><Username>harrydokes</Username><Timestamp>1348061694521</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:34:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And I want you to solve some simple calculus equations.

They might want to take a look at the latest Economic Freedom of the World Index to see how cool it really is. This index is exactly what it sounds like … a measure of how free an economy is, measuring the size of government, taxes, spending, the legal system and protection of property rights, the monetary system, free trade and regulations. A measure of how free an economy is a measure of how easy it is for an ambitious entrepreneur to put their dreams and capital to work building a new business enterprise … a business enterprise that will create jobs and expand opportunities for others. The lower you are on the index of economic freedom, the harder it is to get started as a businessman or entrepreneur .. and the harder it is to create new jobs and be a part of a growing economy. For years, the United States topped the charts. We were the beacon of economic freedom for the world. Starting in 2000, we began to slide. In just a decade, we have managed to squander all of our gains made since the 1970s. Not only has the United States fallen out of the top ten, we now rank a pathetic 18th on the list. Countries ahead of us include Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Bahrain, Mauritius, Finland and Chile.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1348063377437</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:02:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348063692760-45</Id><Topic><Title>Romney 320, Obama 218</Title><Username>breck80424</Username><Timestamp>1347903942369</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 13:45:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>---bump</Msg><Username>breck80424</Username><Timestamp>1348063692760</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:08:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348063861775-46</Id><Title>Time to buy something other than AAPL.

Does Obama’s Plan ‘Gut Welfare Reform’? Posted on August 9, 2012 A Mitt Romney TV ad claims the Obama administration has adopted “a plan to gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements.” The plan does neither of those things. ■Work requirements are not simply being “dropped.” States may now change the requirements — revising, adding or eliminating them — as part of a federally approved state-specific plan to increase job placement. ■And it won’t “gut” the 1996 law to ease the requirement. Benefits still won’t be paid beyond an allotted time, whether the recipient is working or not. Romney’s ad also distorts the facts when it says that under President Obama’s plan “you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job.” The law never required all welfare recipients to work. Only 29 percent of those receiving cash assistance met the work requirement by the time President Obama took office. Under the new policy, states can now seek a federal waiver from work-participation rules that, among other things, require welfare recipients to engage in one of 12 specific “work activities,” such as job training. But, in exchange, states must develop a plan that would provide a “more efficient or effective means to promote employment,” which may or may not include some or all of the same work activities. States also must submit an “evaluation plan” that includes “performance measures” that must be met — or the waiver could be revoked. Ron Haskins, a former Republican House committee aide who was instrumental in the 1996 overhaul of the welfare program, told us the Obama administration should not have unilaterally changed the work-requirement rules. But Haskins said the Romney claim that Obama’s plan will “gut welfare reform” is “very misleading.” “I do not think it ends welfare reform or strongly undermines welfare reform,” said Haskins, co-director of the Brookings Institution’s Center on Children and Families. “Each state has to say what they will do and how that reform … will either increase employment or lead to better employment” of recipients. The Obama policy responds to state officials who say they can improve job placement and retention if freed from the time-consuming process of documenting and verifying that recipients are engaged in those work activities. “In times of reduced funding, waivers may be the best method to allow states to find effective and efficient approaches to assist the unemployed to find and keep work,” the Utah Department of Workforce Services wrote to federal welfare officials last year. Republicans criticized the new policy shortly after it was implemented on July 12. That prompted Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican who supports Romney, to issue a July 17 press release “defending Utah’s waiver request for state flexibility to achieve work-related outcomes for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) recipients.”</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1348067433438</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 11:10:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348067843421-67</Id><Topic><Title>Wall Street Journal: Rmoney Sinking</Title><Username>agent0977</Username><Timestamp>1348065510555</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:38:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rmoney campaign is in free fall.

The NBC News/ Wall Street Journal survey found Obama at 50% and Romney at 45% among likely voters. The president's five point edge is up slightly from a four point 48%-44% margin over Romney in an NBC/WSJ survey conducted in mid August, just before the Republican and Democratic conventions. Obama's five point advantage in the new poll is within the survey's sampling error, meaning the race can be seen as a tie.</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1348071544857</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:19:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348071579938-84</Id><Title>He don't got to show you no stinkin taxes...</Title><Msg>Since Willard Mittford didn't pay any income tax for 10 of the last 12 years, will he be voting for Obama too?</Msg><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1348071579938</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:19:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348072252027-85</Id><Topic><Title>1600 Boeing jets may have cracks , move over Airbus BA has more cracks!</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1348064226651</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:17:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Union leaders aren't happy with Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) proposed contracts for its engineers and technical workers, and have floated the suggestion of work slowdowns to make sure the company gets the Boeing currently has 671 net orders for 2012 from 24 customers, according to its website, with 99% being for the 737.

The House of Representatives will vote today on a contempt of Congress charge against Holder. (Photo by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images) Internal Department of Justice emails obtained by The Daily Caller show Attorney General Eric Holder’s communications staff has collaborated with the left-wing advocacy group Media Matters for America in an attempt to quell news stories about scandals plaguing Holder and America’s top law enforcement agency. Dozens of pages of emails between DOJ Office of Public Affairs Director Tracy Schmaler and Media Matters staffers show Schmaler, Holder’s top press defender, working with Media Matters to attack reporters covering DOJ scandals. TheDC obtained the emails through a Freedom of Information Act request. (RELATED: TheDC’s complete coverage of Media Matters) Emails sent in September and November 2010 show Schmaler working with Media Matters staffer Jeremy Holden on attacking news coverage of the New Black Panther Party voter intimidation scandal. Holden attacked former DOJ Civil Rights Division attorneys J. Christian Adams and Hans von Spakovsky on Sept. 20, 2010 for what he called an attempt “to reignite the phony New Black Panther Party scandal.” Before Holden posted his article at 7:52 p.m., Schmaler sent him several emails with information helping him attack both former DOJ oficials. “Here’s one Wolf letter,” read the subject of one email Schmaler sent Holden that contained no text. The email was likely a reference to Virginia Republican Rep. Frank Wolf, a member of Congress who led the Republican charge on the New Black Panther Party scandal involving alleged voter intimidation at a November 2008 polling place in Philadelphia. In response, Holden told Schmaler that “The response to interog 38 is particularly helpful. Thanks!” Interrogatory 38 was a reference to a question from Congress that the Justice Department answered, concerning the role of several senior officials in discussing litigation related to that voter intimidation case. A follow-up email shows Schmaler sending Holden more information. “[H]ere’s another one to Smith,” Schmaler wrote. “[I]t’s about perrelli contact with w. WH. helpful in that it makes clear perrelli didn’t have discussions w/ WH on the case (obviously confirming he knew of it) … but also illustrates [REDACTED] they’ve tried to throw up that won’t stick[.]” Holden responded at 8:34 p.m. — three hours after Schmaler sent her first email at 5:34 — to say, “Post is live, FWIW [for what it's worth]. Thanks again.” Nearly two months later, on Nov. 18, 2010, Holden wrote a new blog post he described as an “EXCLUSIVE,” titled “Right-wing commission to vote on flawed New Black Panthers report.” “The conservative-dominated U.S. Commission on Civil Rights will vote Friday on an interim report that omits critical evidence disproving allegations that the Obama administration refuses to enforce voting-rights laws against racial minorities, according to Media Matters’ analysis of a copy of the report we obtained,” Holden wrote in the Nov. 18 article. Holden attacked Adams again, and Christopher Coates — another now-former DOJ attorney. After Holden published that piece, Schmaler sent him an email titled “Great piece…” and continuing in the body of the message, “On USCCR investigation.’” One minute later, Holden responded, writing, “Thanks!” At 9:50 a.m. on July 8, 2011, Media Matters’ Matt Gertz wrote to Schmaler asking for her help “debunking what I think is a conservative media myth about Operation Fast and Furious.” (SOURCE: DOJ’s anti-Gallup ‘whistleblower’ made bizarre work requests, said he was a ‘devout Marxist’) Gertz told Schmaler that “Xochitl directed me to you as the person to talk to.” Gertz was referring to Xochitl Hinojosa, a DOJ spokeswoman and former Media Matters staffer.

Wall street has decided on president, it is immaterial anyway, politics is Jiff versus Skippy, Coke versus Pepsi, red versus blue. Overspending versus assault on human rights. Gun rights versus abortion rights. Aren't we sick of this yet?No need to pick your poison when they are all deadly poisons. But who cares, I am on BA message board so that i can get insight into people's sentiment toward BA, the ACTUAL reason this board is here. Imagine that! You are more interested in peddling nonsensical political propaganda. What a waste of time, I trade stocks and make MONEY and create wealth while you flap your gums about which idiot is the money printing institutions' next puppet, meanwhile your dollars are inflated to nothing, while we all pay for unjust and wasteful wars that benefit military contractors and nation builders, and the miners are lining my pockets, while your jobs are sent overseas. The two party system is destroying us, and it is too late, we have been hijacked by corporations and banks that control the world anyway, and they convinced you that a choice between the same old crap we have had is a choice at all. Dems and repubs are both retarded because they actually believe in the menus their respective parentalist "liberal" spendocrats and their jingoist hateful religious nut "conservatives" represent, not single stances on any given subject. Where is the party for people who don't want to swallow a whole horse pill of disconnected ideals meant only to divide us when only the MONEY matters. Polarization of collective memes. So if I want to support gun rights, I have to hate gays, or vote for some idiot that wants to take away rights given to women regarding their own bodies. If i want universal healthcare I have to buy into insane government spending and eternal handout programs and pay city bus drivers 120K. If I believe that both parties are retarded, option 3 is choose some schmuck who actually believes we can move to a gold standard. if one of these fools really invested in putting the unskilled back in school there would be jobs, but that will always take backseat to building nukes, bailing out banks, and feeding thismrotten political machine you are all pushing like crack. So I choose to do something quite a bit more useful and profitable. Anticipate the market's next move, before they find a way to take every inflated dime I have, cuz leaving it in the bank is doing nothing for me. Buy gold, buy BA, scalp out your profits, watch out after the election on equities, or go find a job, instead of hanging around here corrupting a stock message board with your political slams and nonsense endorsements. While PACs control your reps, it is all a waste. So what does anyone think of this STOCK? I am long for a quick swing, it looks pretty cheap here. Real thoughts. And please don't try to rebuttal my rant. You asked for it by admitting you have no idea what the fed really is. You have nothing to say that can interest me politically, it is all a distraction from my dollars growing while yours inflate.</Msg><Username>shakagenghis</Username><Timestamp>1348092945653</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 18:15:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348093023739-136</Id><Topic><Title>Confirmed Again: DOJ Working With Media Matters to Squash Reporters</Title><Username>libsrwhiners</Username><Timestamp>1348078705516</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:18:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Geogre Soros is Nothing but a Convicted Felon and Liberal 1 Percenter....

Blocks Veteran Jobs Bill By LAWRENCE DOWNES Veterans won’t be getting a new, billion-dollar jobs program, not from this Senate. Republicans on Wednesday afternoon blocked a vote on the Veterans Job Corps Bill after Jeff Sessions of Alabama raised a point of order — he said the bill violated a cap on spending agreed to by Congress last year. The bill’s sponsor, Patty Murray of Washington, said that shouldn’t matter, since the bill’s cost was fully offset by new revenues. She said Mr. Sessions and his party colleagues had been furiously generating excuses to oppose the bill, and were now exploiting a technicality to deny thousands of veterans a shot at getting hired as police officers, firefighters and parks workers, among other things. The vote was 58-40; the bill needed 60 votes to proceed.</Msg><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1348094509676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 18:41:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348094881356-142</Id><Topic><Title>Why Does Romney Dislike America?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_001</Username><Timestamp>1348090867840</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 17:41:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Baggers hate the truth .
