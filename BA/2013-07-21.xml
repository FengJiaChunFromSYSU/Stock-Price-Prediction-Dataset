And the folks who are paying for the free stuff want the free stuff to stop. And the folks who are getting the free stuff want even more free stuff on top of the free stuff they are already getting! Now... the people who are forcing the people who pay for the free stuff have told the people who are RECEIVING the free stuff that the people who are PAYING for the free stuff are being mean, prejudiced, and racist. So... the people who are GETTING the free stuff have been convinced they need to hate the people who are paying for the free stuff by the people who are forcing some people to pay for their free stuff and giving them the free stuff in the first place. We have let the free stuff giving go on for so long that there are now more people getting free stuff than paying for the free stuff . Now understand this. All great democracies have committed financial suicide somewhere between 200 and 250 years after being founded. The reason? The voters figured out they could vote themselves money from the treasury by electing people who promised to give them money from the treasury in exchange for electing them. The United States officially became a Republic in 1776 , 236 years ago. The number of people now getting free stuff outnumbers the people paying for the free stuff . Failure to change that spells the end of the United States as we know it.

Robbins Rare July 21, 2013 Would you trust thousands of low-level Federal bureaucrats and contractors with one-touch access to your private financial and medical information? Under Obamacare you won’t have any choice. As the Obamacare train-wreck begins to gather steam, there is increasing concern in Congress over something called the Federal Data Services Hub. The Data Hub is a comprehensive database of personal information being established by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement the federally facilitated health insurance exchanges. The purpose of the Data Hub, according to a June 2013 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, is to provide “electronic, near real-time access to federal data” and “access to state and third party data sources needed to verify consumer-eligibility information.” In these days of secret domestic surveillance by the intelligence community, rogue IRS officials and state tax agencies using private information for political purposes, and police electronically logging every license plate that passes by, the idea of the centralized Data Hub is making lawmakers and citizens nervous. They certainly should be; the potential for abuse is enormous. The massive, centralized database will include comprehensive personal information such as income and financial data, family size, citizenship and immigration status, incarceration status, social security numbers, and private health information. It will compile dossiers based on information obtained from the IRS, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Veterans Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, the Social Security Administration, state Medicaid databases, and for some reason the Peace Corps.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374414948539</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 09:55:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374415284431-17</Id><Title>George Zimmerman and Barack Obama share same disapproval rating</Title><Msg>Patrick Howley Daily Caller July 21, 2013 Former neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman is viewed favorably by 32 percent of the American public, according to a new Rasmussen poll. 32 percent of American adults view Zimmerman favorably, while 48 percent view him unfavorably, according to the poll. Zimmerman was acquitted this month in the shooting death of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, but his case remains a lightning rod in the public discourse. Though just 34 percent of the public actually disagreed with Zimmerman’s not-guilty verdict, according to a previous Rasmussen poll, the 29-year old watchman remains a polarizing national figure. “Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,” President Obama said in a press conference on Friday after the verdict. Protests related to Zimmerman’s acquittal resulted in 17 arrests in Southern California after a demonstration in Victorville Wednesday. Florida governor Rick Scott was forced to hold an emergency meeting with protesters that camped out in the lobby outside his office, demanding repeal of Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” self-defense law. NBA legend Charles Barkley has been one of the few public figures anywhere near Zimmerman’s side during the frenzy, saying, “I agree with the verdict.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374415284431</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 10:01:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374415334966-18</Id><Topic><Title>Obama supporters sign petition to repeal the Bill Of Rights</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1374362948876</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 19:29:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A democracy can't work for long when such a large part of the population of the country is so dead bone stupid.

Medicare for all would have been a better system, but the stoopid RWNJ base would scream that it's bloody communism,, , and evens the playing field one step, such that the elites would have one less thing to feel superior about... A new survey released by the number-crunching technocrats at NerdWallet last month clearly illustrates how extending Medicare coverage to all Americans might cut costs for everyone. According to NerdWallet, Medicare generally pays out no more than $0.27 for every dollar that hospitals bill it for medical services -- a savings of 73%. Put another way, an uninsured patient receiving the same care as is provided to a patient covered by Medicare can expect to pay nearly four times as much. A government takeover? So Medicare for all is cheaper, more efficient, and better than Obamacare -- but isn't it a "government takeover" of health care? It needn't be. If an individual consumers think they're better off with a private health insurance plan from WellPoint -- or from UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, or Cigna -- then fine. They could still sign up for one of those, either as a supplement to Medicare-for-all or, if they prefer, as an exclusive plan, and choose not to participate in Medicare at all. For that matter, there should be no need to require anyone to buy any insurance whatsoever. All that's really required for Americans to begin reaping the 73% savings of a Medicare-for-all plan is to open up Medicare enrollment to everybody. Give everyone the right to sign up for Medicare, rather than requiring us all to sign up for a private insurance plan under the ACA. And then let the marketplace decide if Medicare for all is really as good an idea as NerdWallet's survey makes it sound.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1374415823313</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 10:10:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374416721148-23</Id><Topic><Title>Move over NSA, here comes the Obamacare Big Brother database</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374414948539</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 09:55:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you trust barack hussein and the dumb party don't you contard? you were a big fan of hugo chavez, and che guevara too as i recall, can't have it both ways contard...you chose #$%$ a long time ago</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374416721148</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 10:25:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374416984169-24</Id><Topic><Title>Bay Area Drivers Encounter “Speed Enforced by Drones” Signs</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374377389424</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 23:29:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From CNNs own web site: (Not the Ravens fevered ramblings) Responding to a question stemming from that discussion, Attorney General Eric Holder said this week that he wouldn't rule out the possibility of a drone strike against Americans on U.S. soil What law or precedent might support their argument? CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said there is no law on drone strikes. "Police officers use weapons on American citizens all the time," he said. "This is just another weapon." The Supreme Court has held that the military may constitutionally use force against a U.S. citizen who is a part of enemy forces. But that's not in the United States. Again, there is other documentation about drone use against U.S. citizens abroad. Consider a Justice Department memo, given to select members of Congress last year, that says the U.S. government can use lethal force against American citizens overseas who are operational leaders of al Qaeda or its affiliates. One high-profile example of a U.S. citizen killed in a strike overseas is Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric born and educated in the United States. A drone killed him in Yemen in 2011.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374416984169</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 10:29:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374417087818-25</Id><Topic><Title>Act Now 4 Trayvon</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374414246753</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 09:44:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's the use of a petition to affect change.

She told the first doctor she saw: "My Mama told me that I am the breadwinner for the family." He asked her to explain. She said that she can make babies ~ and babies get money from the State for the family. It goes like this: The Grandma calls the Department of Child &amp; Family Services, and states that the unemployed daughter is not capable of caring for all of her kids. DCFS agrees, and tells her the children will need to go into foster care. The Grandma then volunteers to be the foster parent, and receives a check for $1500 per child each month in Illinois. Total yearly income: $144,000 tax-free and nobody has to go to work! In fact, they get more if there is no husband/father/man in the home! Not to mention free healthcare (Medicaid), plus a monthly card entitling them to free groceries and a voucher for 250 free Obamaphone minutes each month. This does not include WIC and other welfare benefits...that they are "entitled" to. Indeed, Grandma was correct that her fertile daughter is the "breadwinner" for the family. This is how the liberal politicians spend our tax dollars. When this generous program was invented in the '60s, the Great Society architects forgot to craft an end date... and now we are hopelessly overrun with people who vote only for those who will continue to keep them on the dole.... No wonder our country is broke!” Worse, Muslims have been paying attention, just as they’ve taken advantage to transform European nations.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374422125900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 11:55:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374422507316-47</Id><Topic><Title>Our real problem is white rage</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373906402577</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 12:40:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>our real problem is a party dedicated to disinformation and division</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1374422507316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 12:01:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374422952779-48</Id><Topic><Title>Bay Area Drivers Encounter “Speed Enforced by Drones” Signs</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374377389424</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 23:29:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right ...so for the factually incorrect Raven to claim that this could never happen ...one only need look at precedent since it has ALREADY happened....when one sees road signs saying you are being monitored by drones...it does not inspire confidence.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374422952779</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 12:09:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374423241787-49</Id><Topic><Title>Free Stuff !!!</Title><Username>jetstream_2010</Username><Timestamp>1373423927267</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 22:38:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That story was spread via e-mail and has since been debunked.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374423241787</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 12:14:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374423441171-50</Id><Topic><Title>Act Now 4 Trayvon</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374414246753</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 09:44:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sign the petition.

Airbus said , opening one in the U.S. made sense because this country will be the largest market for planes for 20 years. Airbus already procures $13 billion a year from U.S. companies, and since Airbus has been the number one plane maker for over a decade now, we need to take over from Boeing in America too. Our stock has bettered Boeing by over 218% over the past 5 years and out dividend is similar 1.6% to 1.9% for Boeing and we will catch the dividend up in time. Right now all investors in Airbus have seen their stock value go up by 218% compared to Boeing investors at 60% so overall those large American holders of airbus are far ahead of Boeing. Many investors hold more than 25000 shares of airbus or Boeing stock, and the dividends alone is over $ 50,000 dollars per year income for a Boeing shareholder. . Airbus is a growth stock, with a ever increasing dividend tare, now up over 50% from the last year dividend much better gain than Boeing and Airbus stock price up 218% over 5 years. Expect a 100% jump in stock price once the A350 goes into approved delivery. It gets better for the Airbus stock holder on dividends, while the 1.6% dividend is net , taxes taken out prior to dividend, due to international rules the Boeing dividend is not net that is a dividend which has a tax to be paid. Airbus stock dividends come to you already net per international tax rules. So if you have say 25000 of Boeing stock and you would get a pre tax payout of about $50,000 in dividends each year depending upon how long you have owned Boeing but, then pay at least 28% tax under normal earning situations while Airbus pays 1.6% dividend free of all taxes This is kind of like a retiree moving to a State that does not tax you on retirement income so many retiree’s do both .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1374434612291</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 15:23:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374434903063-64</Id><Topic><Title>Our real problem is white rage</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373906402577</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 12:40:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>doublehaul, don't you just hate it when you're treated like a second class citizen?

Boosted by a wave of orders announced and signed at the Paris Air Show, Airbus surpassed the 5,000-aircraft backlog milestone – the first time an aircraft manufacturer has ever attained a backlog of this magnitude. Airbus’ 241 jetliners booked during the month increased its overall backlog to 5,109 aircraft, representing more than seven years of sustained production. This performance also brought total Airbus orders over the 13,000 aircraft mark, of which more than 9,600 are for the single-aisle A320 Family. Highlights of the month included the 65 additional orders for Airbus’ latest product – the A350 XWB – bringing combined total bookings for this next-generation extra widebody jetliner to 678 in the month when the aircraft performed its maiden flight. Acquisitions announced in June were Singapore Airlines’ agreement for 30 A350-900s; the Air France-KLM Group’s booking for 25 A350-900s; and 10 A350-1000s for United Airlines. The widebody A330 also continued to build up its order volume with SriLankan Airlines’ signing for six A330-300s. In new business involving Airbus’ A320 product line, Lufthansa acquired 30 A320ceo, 35 A320neo and 35 A321neo versions; 50 A320neo jetliners were booked by ILFC; and Spirit Airlines ordered 20 A321ceo aircraft. With the volume added in June, and taking cancellations into account, Airbus’ total net orders logged during the first six months of 2013 reached 722. Airbus delivered 48 jetliners during the month, composed of 38 A320 Family aircraft, eight A330s and two A380s – bringing the total provided so far in 2013 to 295, which were received by 73 customers</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1374435016810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 15:30:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374435042696-66</Id><Topic><Title>Geroge Zimmerman got a Fair Trial</Title><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1374354781046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 17:13:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't see anything I could argue with about your scenario, other than wondering: Would Zippy have BEEN following Martin if he had not been packing a gun?

We know a court has spoken,and that's fine. But we also know that the Supreme Court has spoken via Roe v. Wade, and that's been challenged by conservatives since it was handed down. I've spoken with many African-Americans and they remember the infamous Willie Horton ad of 1988 and Rodney King, and they were told "it's not really about race until the media makes it an issue". Black folks figured out that Willie Horton was a large Black male. Why choose him? The GOP played on white racism. But Blacks sometimes feel that they are always told it isn't about race until the media or "race pimps" make it so. During the Fall of 2012 I kept predicting an Obama victory in the electoral college by over 100 votes. I was immediately attacked for using "left-wing" sources. When I mentioned Paula, the same thing happened. The fact that she made a joke about "dressing little ( n word ) up as slaves" ( in 2007 ... not 1785 ) didn't make it about race... the media did. Regarding Trayvon: African-Americans sometimes have a different view of this as well. Looking at a timeline, Zimmerman was driving through the neighborhood on a personal errand. At approximately 7:09 PM, Zimmerman called the Sanford police non-emergency number to report what he considered a suspicious person in the Twin Lakes community. The "non-emergency" number. After mentioning that Trayvon was Black twice, he said "these a$ $holes, they always get away." When Ted Nugent claimed to have #$%$ his pants to get out of fighting in Vietnam, if he had said "I didn't want to fight those a$ $holes", wouldn't it be safe to assume he meant, uh... the Vietnamese? About two minutes into the call, Zimmerman said, "he's running". The dispatcher asked, "He's running? Which way is he running?" Right here there is the sound of what a lot of people believe is a chime indicating he opened the door. That's reasonable, as he started out in his car but later said his head hit some form of pavement in the scuffle... and the dispatcher asked about the direction Trayvon was running. Here's what people ask: if it was Al Capone just days after the St. Valentine's Day Massacre would George have gotten out of his car? Lucky Luciano or John Gotti? A 325 lbs. Black male who played defensive end for the Green Bay Packers? But it was a 130 lbs. young, unarmed Black male, who wasn't breaking the law, had no criminal record, and didn't #$%$ a purse. Most people ( like Nugent ) try to stay out of harm's way. Since Trayvon wasn't breaking the law, couldn't George have stayed in his vehicle and waited for the cops, explained the situation and then had them perform some drive throughs as a deterrent?</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374448335246</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 19:12:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374448362196-82</Id><Topic><Title>Act Now 4 Trayvon</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374414246753</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 09:44:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374448362196</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 19:12:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374448553087-83</Id><Title>Should the City of Detroit receive federal help?</Title><Msg>good day, after gm and chrysler receiveing bailouts, should the city of detroit? most of you do know that chrysler has received another bailout during nixon's term? i do not think detroit should receive a bailout. enough is enough. glta,</Msg><Username>leereece42</Username><Timestamp>1374448553087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 19:15:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374449531396-84</Id><Topic><Title>Act Now 4 Trayvon</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1374414246753</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 09:44:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>.....and I know how much witty replies means to you.....Try mastering the Truth instead...Your self respect will increase exponentially</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374449531396</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 19:32:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374449809109-85</Id><Topic><Title>Our real problem is white rage</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373906402577</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 12:40:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In New York from January to June 2008, 83 percent of all gun assailants were black, according to witnesses and victims, though blacks were only 24 percent of the population.

Bankruptcy will force Detroit City Council to address and eliminate those reasons that forced Detroit to declare bankruptcy in the first place. City pension benefits to retired local union workers will have to be addressed before Detroit can be given a clean bill of heath. Over compensated Retired Union Workers will have to come to the bargaining table and settle. Tax base has been falling for years in Detroit because of people leaving the area. Raising taxes on cash strapped taxpayers will only force the exodus from Detroit to increase. If not stopped Union Pensions will collapse and all retirees will lose their pensions all together. It's in Detroit's best interest to declare their bankruptcy and force the Unions back to the bargaining table. It'd be a crime if Obama forces the American Taxpayers to keep financing this failing city because Democrat mayors of Detroit for the last 50 years have been paying tribute to Unions.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1374452972621</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 20:29:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374453127008-90</Id><Topic><Title>Geroge Zimmerman got a Fair Trial</Title><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1374354781046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 17:13:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your douchebaggery doesn't belong here.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1374453127008</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 20:32:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374453202608-91</Id><Topic><Title>Geroge Zimmerman got a Fair Trial</Title><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1374354781046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 17:13:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More then one personality inhabits the same bulbous body...Get an Exorcist ...</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1374453202608</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 20:33:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374453355541-92</Id><Topic><Title>NAACP Urges Freedom For Black Man Who Killed White Man In Self-Defense</Title><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1374348733161</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 15:32:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why can't you accept the jury's decision?
