And a strange thing, remember when the 787 first flight, and those wings were bent up so much? There is something wrong there. Anyhow the A350 wings didn't do that and they are similar wings, similar aspect ratios.</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1371275172372</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 01:46:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371275880124-2</Id><Topic><Title>787 verus XWB A350</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1371275172372</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 01:46:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the Airbus has the safe NiCad battery no need for a fire box. the airbus will eat away both the 787 and the 777 market share and the Boeing 747 is not selling as planed , the A380 is cutting into that plane. the Airbus has slightly more composite than the 787. Boeing plane cost 30 billion and is 4 years late and grounded for 4 month and the solution was to keep the fire starter battery lithium system, with admitting Boeing has no idea why it burns so they are going with a fire starter box and accepting passenger potential death as a consequence. Money before passenger safety is what a fire box says. . Any fire on a plane is a emergency landing requirement . Airbus will continue to eat up Boeing because Boeing has the MD bankruptcy business model. Boeing expects contractors to do everything while Boeing does not mind the store.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371275880124</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 01:58:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371275990277-3</Id><Topic><Title>How Airbus compares to Boeing</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371221434638</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 10:50:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>6 years under your current name and 4 more under your avatar name , care to stop being a old liar lawyer</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371275990277</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 01:59:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371278273866-4</Id><Title>Spartacus9991 thinks dividend on Boeing Stock compared to Airbus is significant demonstrating his ignorance</Title><Msg>spartacus99991 For one year Airbus stock has increased in value 80% and Boeing has gone up 41%, for 5 years Airbus stock price has increased 162% compared to Boeing(pathetic) gain of 35%. So a less than a percent difference in stock price dividend between Airbus and Boeing is nothing considering Airbus stock for a year is better than Boeing by 39% and for 5 years Airbus shareholders are better than Boeing by 127%. Now spartacus9991 ,don't you feel like a fool Your ignorant user comment about dividends. Once more, spartacus9991, I am going to take you to stock market school . Like I did with you on Apple and ACAD and TSLA . Spartacus9991, you asked me about dividends in a manner, that indicated there was something there that I was not telling , WRONG the dividend difference is insignificant. Spartacus do you really think Airbus would not compete . The comparison of Boeing stock increase i(s pathetic) compared to the Airbus stock increase for the shareholder . â€¢ here is your dumb comment spartacus9991" Ever heard of dividends?" My answer yes , spartacus9991 I know all about dividends and make a lot of money on ACAD and TSLA and did on Apple while you post your troll crapola and make nothing.. I know all about dividends but I know you do not because you just asked me a question that will not help your Boeing hack cause. Airbus paid a .78 cent dividend one time per year. Boeing paid 4 dividends , that is a quarterly payout of .45 cents . The difference between Boeing and Airbus dividend is less than one percent so that has no bearing on how much better shareholders of Airbus are compared to Boeing shareholder. Here is your dividend yield as of today, stock price divided by dividend equals dividend yield so Airbus pays 1.3% and Boeing pays 1.9% dividend yield. Spartacus9991 a difference of .6 %. Now since Boeing is lagging Airbus in stock price appreciation by a wide margin that is not a significant amount of money.

It takes money and guts to bring new tech to market. It usually has its problems before it becomes standard. It takes foresight and engineering capabilities that reach out to the limits. Yep, you guys are right and the public will benefit greatly for the efforts made today by industry leaders like BA. It will be easy to copy the latest and greatest without costing investors a ton of money, but that is the way of business today. SAme with the Twin engine scare Airbus tried when the 767 and 777 hit the markets. Seems to me Airbus is trying to sell a lot of twins now. I guess it was smart to watch the leader then and that still seems to be the norm. This one might of cost shareholders a lot, but I think BA has redefined the way we are going to build future aircraft. Airbus had to be pulled kicking and screamming into the market with the A350 and will have to be dragged into the next market again by its own customers down the line. Composits are the way to go and Airbus finally has a quallity composit competitor.

However, most people do not realize that a similar "brain drain" is occurring within the Commercial Airplane division of Boeing. Because of Boeing's massive layoffs and strategy of offloading design work to foreign design centers, the company has lost control of its engineering processes. The recent actions of the Boeing Company in its Commercial Airplane division are seriously jeopardizing the quality and safety of its airplanes. Hopefully, the company's current course of action will not lead to the same tragic consequences that occurred on February 1, 2003. Our Credentials Before we begin, we wish to establish our credentials. Since we are current Boeing employees, we obviously don't want to give information that can positively identify us. This paper was composed by a group of aerospace design engineers with many years at the Boeing Company. We have been involved in several new airplane programs across a variety of functions and have intimate knowledge of the inner workings of Engineering at Boeing. We are "in the trenches" every day, involved in the nuts-and-bolts business of designing airplanes. We have a unique and in-depth insider's view of the damage being sown at the Boeing Company by Phil Condit and his cohorts. Introduction During the past several years, Boeing Commercial Airplanes has been offloading its design engineering work to foreign "design centers".

Engineering layoffs have cut so deeply into Boeing's talent pool that knowledge has been irretrievably lost. And the layoffs continue. Soon Boeing may reach (if it hasn't already) a "point of no return" where irreversible damage has been done to the company's ability to design and build safe airplanes, even with its so-called "risk-sharing partners". Boeing's senior management has often stated that they are not willing to "bet the company" on another new airplane program as they famously did with the 747. They are pursuing a strategy of accumulating a network of "risk-sharing partners" so Boeing can concentrate on its core competency of "large scale systems integration." We are willing to state that Boeing's management is "betting the company" on a misguided and ridiculous outsourcing plan that is gutting the company of its hard-won knowledge base and human assets. The safety and quality of Boeing airplanes is at jeopardy because of the foolhardy actions of Boeing's senior management, and even the hint of safety and quality issues with Boeing's airplanes can have disastrous results for its Commercial Airplane business. The former executives of McDonnell-Douglas (which arguably as a company was, in the end, a complete failure in the design and manufacture of commercial aircraft) have taken control of Boeing and seem determined to gut the commercial airplane business - all in the name of "increasing shareholder value". Harry Stonecipher, John McDonnell and Mike Sears, along with Phil Condit and Alan Mulally are destroying what was very recently a vital, dominant American company. These men will probably enjoy massive short-term gains in the value of their stock options, but there is a price; the loss of the long-term viability of Boeing in the commercial aircraft business.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321389821</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:36:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371321433924-39</Id><Topic><Title>A BIT OF HISTORY RE BA OFFLOADING TO EAST NOWHERE AND 777</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321318332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:35:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We have to look back less than a decade to see where these men are leading Boeing - to the once glorious McDonnell-Douglas Commercial Aircraft division which has since faded into oblivion. The design and manufacture of commercial aircraft has been a lucrative business for the United States for many decades. The aerospace business has consistently been the largest exporter in the United States economy. Boeing is willingly and recklessly giving this business away to its future foreign competitors. It is time Boeing's practices become public knowledge. Some Perspective It is important to remember that Boeing's commercial aircraft business is a bit different from the standard manufacturing company. Boeing design airplanes - not washing machines, toasters or clock radios. Every day, millions of people entrust their lives and the lives of their friends and family to the quality of Boeing airplanes. Every day, your and our husbands and wives, sons and daughters, fathers and mothers climb aboard a 727, 737, 747, 757, 767 or 777 with faith that experienced Boeing engineers did their job well. Although many airplane passengers pray to God for a safe flight, it is often Boeing engineers who, with their skill and knowledge, have the power to grant that prayer. Currently, Boeing is making severe cuts in its design engineering staff. The cost savings probably look great on paper. But the real question is how do these cuts affect a company in which airplanes are designed? Airplanes - on which millions of people fly each year. Airplanes - to which we entrust our lives every time we fly. Airplanes - that can experience catastrophic failure due to engineering errors.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321433924</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:37:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371321478023-40</Id><Topic><Title>A BIT OF HISTORY RE BA OFFLOADING TO EAST NOWHERE AND 777</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321318332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:35:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Due to their current strategy of off-loading design work to inexperienced engineers and laying off their own highly experienced employees, Boeing management has created an environment where these errors are much more likely to occur. The most telling statement about the trend of engineering at Boeing is this statement, which is heard more and more often from fellow engineers: "After seeing how engineering is done here today, I'm afraid to fly on the next new Boeing airplane." Some Facts About Airplane Design It is obvious that an airplane, especially a large commercial aircraft, is a very complicated machine to design and build. What the general public does not understand is that, however difficult they think it is to design and build an airplane, their belief is not one-fiftieth as complicated as the reality. It takes many years of experience to learn the intricacies of airplane design. Not only does an engineer need to understand how to design detail parts, assemblies and installations, but also where the parts are manufactured, how the parts are manufactured and how they are put together. Engineers are required to understand lead-times and scheduling to make sure drawings are released on time to support vendor requirements. The responsibilities of an engineer are immense. In addition, engineers need to control the configuration of the airplane. The parts that go on an airplane depends on many factors: The base model (737, 747, 757, 767, 777) The derivative (737-700, 737-800, 737-900, 757-200, 757-300, 777-200ER, 777-300, 777-300ER, 777-200LR) Standard options (Small cargo door, large cargo door, overwing exits, in-flight entertainment systems) Customer-specific options (Seats, purser stations, the color of the carpet) There are literally millions of possible configurations. Knowing which parts go on which airplanes is a very important part of an engineer's job.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321478023</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:37:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371321512836-41</Id><Topic><Title>A BIT OF HISTORY RE BA OFFLOADING TO EAST NOWHERE AND 777</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321318332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:35:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are literally millions of possible configurations. Knowing which parts go on which airplanes is a very important part of an engineer's job. The systems Boeing has implemented to control airplane configuration (as part of the DCAC/MRM effort) are immensely complex and constantly changing. There are many technical designers and engineers who spend large portions of their time just learning and understanding these systems. Most engineers only have a cursory knowledge of these systems and rely on local "experts". The problem is that these local "experts" are becoming fewer and farther between and their numbers are diminishing rapidly as layoffs continue. Boeing is lucky that the FAA does not have an audit planned in the near future. The Offloading of Boeing's Design Engineering The key to Boeing's success has never been its plants, tools and buildings, but its superior engineering and its willingness to take calculated risks. Both of these assets are disappearing rapidly. Although much emphasis has been put on such manufacturing concepts as "lean manufacturing" and "just-in-time inventory", it is important to realize that regardless of the efficiencies of the manufacturing process, an airplane or any product cannot succeed without quality engineering design. In the past, Boeing's elite engineering corps has met the challenge and produced the world's best commercial aircraft. Currently, Boeing is rabidly pursuing a strategy of offloading engineering design work to overseas "design centers". This process began more than a decade ago with "design transfers" to the Japanese (Kawasaki, Mitsubishi and Fuji Heavy Industries). It continues today at a more rapid and frightening pace.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321512836</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:38:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371321534536-42</Id><Title>Peope Afraid to Criticize Politicians of their own Political Party are.....</Title><Msg>....are not just being loyal.

There are around 350 engineers employed at this center. They are designing primary and secondary structures, interiors, floors and other systems. There appears to be a common misconception that Russia is a land of promise where the streets are paved with PhD aerospace engineers begging for jobs. The belief is that not only do these brilliant engineers have doctorates, but they have decades of top-notch aircraft design experience. In addition, they are willing to work for 20 to 25% of the pay that American engineers receive. How can Boeing lose? The reality is that BDC Moscow is manned with few experienced engineers and many, many greenhorns - inexperienced engineers who have graduated within the past few years. Boeing engineers are being pressured to off-load design work to Moscow - to these legions of inexperienced engineers. Even if we assume that all of the Russian engineers have PhDs and are experienced, ask yourself the following questions: How and where did they gain aircraft design experience? On what new Russian airplane programs have they cut their teeth in the past 10-15 years? How do Russian commercial aircraft compare to the quality, efficiency and safety of Boeing's airplanes? Which leads to the final question: Based on Russian commercial aviation history, do we really want to fly a commercial airplane designed by Russian engineers? The Russian engineers have to be given some credit.

They are nice guys, likeable and smart with relevant college degrees, but they lack several important traits: Experience designing airplanes. The ability to speak English well enough to have an in-depth technical conversation. The ability to take initiative and to come up with creative solutions. This final point is an important one. Decades of communist rule have apparently made it difficult for some Russians to make decisions. They want to be told what to do, down to the most minute detail. Designing a new airplane with the Russians is like working with a bunch of new college hires - except these new hires don't speak English very well - if at all! Are there any volunteers for who wants to fly on their class project? All that seems to matter to Boeing's senior management is that Russian engineers are significantly cheaper than American ones. It is important to note that although the Russians are cheaper, a number of significant inefficiencies are introduced: The language barrier It is difficult enough discussing technical issues with an American engineer, let alone with a Russian who has only taken 3 months of English classes. Time zones The only way to communicate with BDC Moscow is via e-mail, conference calls and video conferences. The problem is that there is only a 1 or 2 hour window of opportunity to hold conference calls or video conferences. Because of the brevity and ineffectiveness of conference calls, Boeing engineers waste hours and even days trying to resolve issues via e-mail - when it would only take 10 minutes to walk to the next cube to explain to Phil what needs to be done.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321625011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:40:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371321665430-45</Id><Topic><Title>A BIT OF HISTORY RE BA OFFLOADING TO EAST NOWHERE AND 777</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321318332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:35:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because of the brevity and ineffectiveness of conference calls, Boeing engineers waste hours and even days trying to resolve issues via e-mail - when it would only take 10 minutes to walk to the next cube to explain to Phil what needs to be done. Physical distance Documents take days to reach Moscow. Once again, if the work was done within Boeing, it would only take 10 minutes to walk to Harry's desk and drop off the document. CATIA models need to be transferred to Russia in a process that takes hours. If the work was done locally, a model could be transferred almost instantaneously. Out-sourcing has made a complicated process exponentially more complicated. In the engineering world, complicated processes are known to produce one thing consistently - errors. The initial results on the quality of work from BDC are frightening. Much of their work on recent programs has had to be completely re-done. Changes that were supposed to be made aren't made properly, and changes that shouldn't have been made are widespread. Luckily, (until recently) there have been enough experienced Boeing engineers to catch these errors. This is no longer the case after the last painful round of layoffs. It is only a matter of time before a potentially dangerous error slips by. Yet another concern is that the majority of Russian engineers working at the Boeing Design Center in Moscow are contract (temporary) employees who are overseen by a much smaller number of Boeing direct employees. What keeps these engineers from remaining loyal to Boeing? There is a very real threat that Boeing will face a situation in the near future where their domestic (American) talent has been ravaged and the Russian engineers move on to other opportunities (such as contracting overseas for much higher salaries or within Moscow at Airbus' newly opened Moscow Design Center).

Integration takes place at the individual engineer level, which is where Boeing is cutting. The front-line engineer is where the rubber meets the road, but Boeing has made it clear that engineers are merely "costs" to the company, not assets. The relevant questions to ask here are: How can Boeing hope to successfully be a "large-scale systems integrator" if they don't have enough experienced, qualified engineers to do the integration? If Boeing's engineers no longer understand the technical aspects of the airplane's design and manufacturability, how can they integrate? At What Point Do Boeing's Suppliers Decide They No Longer Need Boeing? We have heard that Phil Condit's perfect vision for Boeing is where all of the design and manufacturing work is offloaded. Meanwhile, Boeing (consisting of Phil and his secretary) sits in a penthouse office in Chicago at the top of the pyramid and collects a fat profit margin, thus "enhancing shareholder value". As comic as this may seem, it is probably not far from the truth. Boeing is throwing away thousands of irreplaceable engineers while giving away to its vendors knowledge based on decades of empirical data from Boeing's countless tests and studies. This knowledge, both in the Design Manuals and in the engineers' heads is Boeing's competitive advantage.

The Boeing vision is that eventually the "partners" will design and manufacture body sections, already "stuffed" with the required systems (electrical wire bundles, hydraulics systems, insulation, etc). All of these activities would be coordinated and "integrated" by a small staff of Boeing engineers. The body sections would then be shipped to Everett (or Wichita or Long Beach or Fort Worth), where a small group of Boeing assembly workers would button the sections together. In all honesty, does this deserve the lion's share of the profits? How much better can the Japanese complete this function in Japan? At what point do Boeing's suppliers decide that they no longer need Boeing? JAI (consisting of Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Fuji Heavy Industries) is more than capable to do the manufacturing. In addition, they can do the stress analysis and design work. Boeing has spent the last 10 years handing over their computer "templates" for stress analysis - along with books containing all of Boeing's hard-won knowledge of fatigue analysis, structural damage tolerance and corrosion prevention, which was accumulated over decades of testing and in-service experience. If JAI is capable of doing both the design and manufacturing of airplane structural components, Rolls Royce, Pratt and Whitney and GE provide the engines, Rockwell-Collins provides the avionics and interior components are BFE (Buyer Furnished Equipment), what does Boeing bring to the table?

Engineers believe that management would like nothing more than to eliminate the entire Boeing engineering department. Perhaps they're right. There is a pervasive feeling of doom and fatalism. Engineers believe that there is no future for them at Boeing. The engineers with 20 or more years at Boeing are stoically waiting for that golden day when they will retire and wash their hands of the mess that Phil Condit and Harry Stonecipher have created. It is frightening to see how few experienced engineers are left in the company. When the company is forced to bring in contractors to do high-level design work, it is indicative of a major problem. There are not enough people left to do even a small development program. How will Boeing handle the 7E7? In addition, Boeing is handing out WARN notices to direct employees while these same employees are surrounded by on-site Russian and Japanese engineers! Performance Management One of Boeing's criteria in its "Performance Management" is to measure how front-line management and lead engineers are offloading work to Moscow. The more work the lead engineers and managers are willing to offload and the bigger the smile on their faces as they do so, the more likely they will not be laid-off but will be promoted and given raises. Can you imagine it - having your career depend on how willing you are to give your job away and to train your replacement in the process? Even if you are cheerful in supporting the offloading of engineering work, your reward may still be a WARN notice. How's that for a morale-builder? How's that for an environment in which airplanes are designed?</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321835455</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:43:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371322093577-50</Id><Topic><Title>Peope Afraid to Criticize Politicians of their own Political Party are.....</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1371321534536</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:38:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Precisely !!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>usheartdoc</Username><Timestamp>1371322093577</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:48:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371322343286-51</Id><Topic><Title>A BIT OF HISTORY RE BA OFFLOADING TO EAST NOWHERE AND 777</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321318332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:35:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great post!

How's that for an environment in which airplanes are designed? The 7E7 and Future Airplane Programs It can arguably be stated that Boeing has cut their engineering staff so deeply that they do not have enough remaining talent to tackle a new airplane program. It is well-known that Boeing's engineering staff is greying. Many of the engineers are within 10-15 years of retirement age - and most of those are counting the years, months, days, hours and minutes until that magical time. Trust us when we say that there has already been a huge loss of "tribal knowledge" that can never be recovered. In 5-10 years, when these graying engineers begin to retire, the resulting knowledge loss may well prove fatal to Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Boeing is rapidly approaching, if they have not already passed, the "Point of No Return". The layoffs have been so deep that knowledge and engineering ability has been irrecoverably lost.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371324964331</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 15:36:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371324997046-60</Id><Topic><Title>A BIT OF HISTORY RE BA OFFLOADING TO EAST NOWHERE AND 777</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321318332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:35:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Effect of Development Cost on Product Quality There were a series of lessons supposedly learned from the fantastic success of the 777 airplane program. A tremendous amount of money was spent developing this airplane, much of it on trail-blazing new techniques such as: Concurrent Product Design Digital Pre-Assembly/Mockup Co-location of personnel (i.e. designers, stress analysts, manufacturing engineers) Integration of customers into the design process This "front-loading" of cost, where money was spent on the engineering/development of the airplane, paid off spectacularly. The rework in the factory dropped precipitously, saving millions in ongoing manufacturing costs. The number of rejection tags dropped by over 50%. The factory said that building the 777 was like putting together Tinker Toys. Today, the 777 is one of Boeing's two best-selling airplanes. However, now Harry Stonecipher and John McDonnell want to cut development costs on the 7E7 to 40% of 777 levels. Do they expect to get an airplane of similar quality to the 777 for that price? Engineers are already forced to make unpleasant compromises with their design because of the shocking scarcity of resources - compromises that threaten the quality, safety and performance of the airplane.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371324997046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 15:36:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371325034650-61</Id><Topic><Title>A BIT OF HISTORY RE BA OFFLOADING TO EAST NOWHERE AND 777</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321318332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:35:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We believe that Boeing Commercial Airplanes is headed down the same path as McDonnell-Douglas. Tight-fisted executives dole out miserly portions of budget to "save money" and "increase shareholder value". What they end up with are inferior products that fail in the marketplace. If proof is required, ask yourself: "What is left of McDonnell-Douglas' commercial aircraft business?" The 717. Isn't that proof enough of where Boeing is being led? Are we willing to entrust the future of Boeing's Commercial Aircraft business to the same people who destroyed McDonnell-Douglas? Conclusion The Boeing Company is headed down a dark and dangerous path. It is heading down this path at a reckless pace with little regard to long-term consequences. High-level executives are making decisions that, on paper, may look promising, but are in truth destroying the company. The safety and quality of Boeing airplanes is at jeopardy because of the foolhardy actions of Boeing's senior management. There has been little discussion about this in the media. Perhaps this story is not newsworthy. However, everyone with whom we have spoken has been...let's say "shocked" (although that does not do it justice)...when told of what is going on. We am not prone to exaggeration. We are engineers. We live and breathe logic and facts. We are witnessing first-hand the destructive effects of Phil Condit's "Vision 2016". There may not be a Boeing Commercial Aircraft Company in 2016 because of Phil Condit. What has been described herein is truth. We can only hope it also turns out to be newsworthy.

Thirty-two-year old family physician Doug Nunamaker of Wichita, Kan., said after five years of dealing with the red tape of health insurance companies and the high overhead for the staff he hired just to deal with paperwork, he switched to a system of charging his patients a monthly fee plus the price of an office visit or test, CNN/Money reported. For example, under Nunamaker's membership plan -- also known as "concierge" medicine or "direct primary care" practices -- each patient pays a flat monthly fee to have unlimited access to the doctors and any medical service they can provide in the practice, such as stitches or an EKG. For adults up to age 44, Nunamaker charges $50 a month, pediatric services are $10 a month, and for adults age 44 and older it costs $100 a month. Although Nunamaker calls the practice "cash-only," he accepts credit and debit cards for the fees and services. Nunamaker and his partner negotiated deals for services outside the office. A cholesterol test costs the patient for $3, versus the $90 or more billed to insurance companies; an MRI can cost $400, compared with $2,000 or more billed to insurance companies. The practice encourages patients and families to also carry some type of high-deductible health insurance plan in case of an emergency or serious illness requiring hospitalization, Nunamaker said. Nunamaker said his annual salary is around $200,000, and he gets to spend more time with patients providing better care because he is not watching the clock and he gets to spend more time with this family. Most of Nunamaker's clients are self-employed, small business owners, or small companies that found the monthly fee and the cost of the high-deductible plan was a cheaper option, CNN/Money reported.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1371325168601</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 15:39:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371325314142-63</Id><Topic><Title>Peope Afraid to Criticize Politicians of their own Political Party are.....</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1371321534536</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:38:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right On.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1371325314142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 15:41:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371325384306-64</Id><Topic><Title>A BIT OF HISTORY RE BA OFFLOADING TO EAST NOWHERE AND 777</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1371321318332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:35:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>quality?

He was forced to offload to Russia et all by the mcDummy crowd. Later when he and Hank Queen and Mulally voiced objections to the Chicago gang and the phony aero types from McDummy crowd - they got out of dodge. Now Boeing is touting the ONE BOEING !--- which was what Al M said early on when he went to Ford " ONE FORD " ...

I have worked with Walt quite a bit on Commercial Airplanes. He was a competent aerodynamicist and manager up to the unit chief level. My realization that he was going to be trouble was at one of the initial planning meetings between him and his chief engineers (I was there to provide technical input) going over the schedule. With one exception all of the chiefs told him that they could not meet schedule and backed that up with facts and data. After two hours he told the group that the schedule was not going to change. I've seen managers pull off that sort of tough attitude if they had a good handle on the nuances of the project but Walt didn't. In the context of a brand new airplane loaded with new technology it was a catastrophic decision. Yes, maybe he was following orders but I have no respect for managers who put their careers ahead of doing what's right for Boeing. I respected Mullaley as a manager but could not fathom how he picked the gaggle of duds (except for Sinnett) to head the 87 project. The other point you and I differ on is the relative qualiity of legacy Boeing vs McDac. I detested Stonecipher and Sears but some of the McDac managers have turned out OK either as butt kickers (Delaney, but out of his depth now) or as very good technical managers (Fancher, Toups). The good news coming off the 87 debackle is that Boeing is better managed at the project level now than it was when the 87 started. At the corporate level not so much.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1371351169880</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 22:52:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371352508909-91</Id><Topic><Title>Spartacus9991 thinks dividend on Boeing Stock compared to Airbus is significant demonstrating his ignorance</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371278273866</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 02:37:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not yet, so you are sparty? sparty is similarly infatuated with the EU, as if they're somehow superior to USA.
