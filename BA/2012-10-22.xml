Those that have been around are no longer fooled by the Obamer hype. _____________________________________________________________________________ In his latest book, investigative journalist Bob Woodward looks at President Barack Obama's leadership during the struggle over the debt limit in 2011 and concludes that there were "gaps" in leadership due to a failure to cultivate congressional relationships. "My conclusion is President Clinton, President Reagan — and if you look at them, you can criticize them for lots of things — they by and large worked their will," Woodward told Diane Sawyer in a recent interview. "On this, President Obama did not." In "The Price of Politics," due to be released Tuesday, Woodward contends that during the debt limit standoff, "it was increasingly clear that no one was running Washington."</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1350913248854</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 09:40:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350913637731-18</Id><Title>Sandra Fluke draws huge crowd......speaks to all ten Obama supporters</Title><Msg>Sandra Fluke, the woman at the center of a media firestorm earlier this year after Rush Limbaugh called her a #$%$,” spoke Saturday in front of about 10 people at the Sak ‘N Save in north Reno.

Chris Walker, a British citizen who lives outside London, told The Post he was able to make two $5 donations to President Obama’s campaign this month through its Web site while a similar attempt to give Mitt Romney cash was rejected. It is illegal to knowingly solicit or accept money from foreign citizens. Walker said he used his actual street address in England but entered Arkansas as his state with the Schenectady, NY, ZIP code of 12345. “When I did Romney’s, the payment got rejected on the grounds that the address on the card did not match the address that I entered,” he said. “Romney’s Web site wanted the code from the back of card. Barack Obama’s didn’t.” In September, Obama’s campaign took in more than $2 million from donors who provided no ZIP code or incomplete ZIP codes, according to data posted on the Federal Election Commission Web site. Given the press' performance in the other debates, I'm not optimistic -- but might it be possible that tomorrow night, Bob Schieffer might deign to ask the President of the United States why he fails to take even rudimentary precautions to ensure that his campaign is not benefitting from illegal foreign donations?</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1350915889243</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:24:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350916452251-29</Id><Topic><Title>Obamer supporters will resort to violence and riots</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1350913823885</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 09:50:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My contention?

Here’s the most salient excerpt from the devastating editorial: " However, while he had to contend with a Republican Party that was determined to deny him a second term at any cost, Obama cannot avoid the consequences of poor decisions and misplaced priorities. Foremost among them was his early focus on an overreaching health-care reform plan that wasted 12 very valuable months of his and Congress’ time and cost him precious political capital. The manner in which the legislation was drafted violated Obama’s pledge to govern openly, and its passage — leveraged through a supermajority — served to further galvanize the partisan divide in Congress. Fear of the impact of that reform and the costs associated with it continue to play a major role in preventing businesses from hiring new employees at a time when nearly everyone agrees that jobs must be the president’s foremost goal. A vote to re-elect Obama promises four more years of the same. In the two debates between the two candidates so far (a third, on foreign affairs, is scheduled for Monday), the president has shown little understanding of how his failures are affecting the nation, and he hasn’t offered any tangible proposals to change course."</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1350917336520</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:48:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350917581496-33</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is gong to run as if the past four years did not occur.</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1350915639173</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:20:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's the only way he can run.

What I’d like to hear is Barack Obama resigning over Benghazi, the most extreme public mishandling of an attack on American personnel ever, certainly in my lifetime. If I (or most people) had been president and something like that happened on my (our) watch — and then I had lied about it myself while urging others to cover up — I would be so ashamed of myself I wouldn’t be able to come out in public. But that’s not what happened. In fact, the reverse occurred. The president acted as if it was Mitt Romney’s fault for ever bringing the subject up. And he had a willing co-conspirator in the morally stunted Candy Crowley. Obama’s outrage during the second debate even at being questioned on his response to the terrorist killings is one of the ugliest displays of narcissism I have ever witnessed from a politician and certainly the ugliest if you consider the ramifications of his behavior. That the mainstream media ignored this reaction is a testament to their enduring pathology. Or perhaps to a secret longing for the divine right of kings. But it doesn’t matter. If Barack Obama does not resign on Monday, his reputation will be destroyed forever, even if he wins a second term, because Benghazi will not go away.

I followed the beat to a garage, where I found a guy in his forties hammering away on a large drum kit. He no longer had the shaggy hair or the leather jacket, but I knew it was Jon Stainbrook, the frenetic former drummer of ‘80s punk band The Stain. In its heyday, The Stain released an album and a couple EPs, and played venues in New York and Hollywood. It had a small group of hard-core fans, although its peak notoriety came from taking more famous bands to court for trademark violations, such as in the case of The Stain v. Staind. To be clear, I am not actually a fan of The Stain, which I had never heard of until a month ago. I had tracked down Stainbrook because he is the most important Republican official in one of the most important counties in Ohio and I needed to ask him some questions about the election. Ever since Mitt Romney closed the gap in many swing states, it has become clear that the 2012 election could hinge on Ohio. And if the margin there is narrow, scrutiny will fall on the voting process—especially in cities, which contain large African American populations and where accusations of both voter fraud and voter suppression are most intense. Stainbrook sits on the board that oversees elections in Lucas County, which encompasses Toledo and is the fifth-largest county in the state. Should things get messy on Election Day, it will be obscure local officials like him who’ll make key decisions about who gets to vote and who doesn’t. After drifting away from the music business in the 1990s, Stainbrook rose through the ranks of GOP politics in the county where he grew up, enlisting the help of tattooed, pierced pals from the Toledo club scene to get himself elected chairman of the local GOP. The elections board on which he now serves is made up of two Republicans and two Democrats, but over the past year, Stainbrook has carried out something of a coup. He oversaw a personnel purge in the office and installed a sometime girlfriend, Meghan Gallagher, as director. She got the job over the objections of a former Republican elections employee, who alerted the Ohio secretary of state’s office that Gallagher had been arrested in 2002 for allegedly stealing Oxycontin from a patient’s purse in a hospital room. Local Democrats also pointed out that, in 2008, Gallagher had been part of a group of Republicans who filmed voters as they entered polling booths in heavily minority districts—ostensibly to safeguard against voter fraud. Support thought-provoking, quality journalism. Join The New Republic for $3.99/month. The election board quickly deadlocked. One of its biggest fights was over where to put the early voting location. Democrats wanted a central spot in downtown Toledo; Stainbrook pushed for a site nine miles away in Maumee, which is one-twentieth the size of Toledo and almost entirely white. The Democrats eventually prevailed—but it was only one of numerous battles across the state in which Republicans have embraced tactics to deter Democratic turnout, especially among the state’s growing share of minority voters. “The Republican Party had a choice,” says Lucas County’s Democratic treasurer, Wade Kapszukiewicz. “They could tweak their policies, they could adjust their positions to appeal to this new, emerging America—God forbid. Or—and this is what they’ve decided to do—’Heck, we’ll just stop these people from voting.’” When I entered the garage, which was behind the headquarters of the Lucas County Republican Party, Stainbrook stopped drumming and ordered me out. On the sidewalk, his arms flying, he demanded to know whether I had a tape recorder and shouted that he was going to call the police. Things could have gotten pretty ugly if Joe the Plumber hadn’t shown up. Joe—that is, Samuel Wurzelbacher—is running for a congressional seat near the Toledo area on a hard-right platform; in August, he suggested that border patrol officers “start shooting” at suspected illegal immigrants. He smiled genially, shook my hand, and headed inside, leaving me feeling as if I’d just met a fictional character, like Bob the Builder. His presence seemed to calm Stainbrook a bit. “He’s a heckuva guy,” he observed. I asked him to explain the recent goings-on at the elections board. “I’m offended some would accuse me of trying to disenfranchise [voters],” he told me. His real concern, he added, was preventing electoral abuses by Democrats. “I’m like Kevin Costner in Dances with Wolves,” he said. “It’s Fort Apache up here.” BATTLES OVER THE BALLOT have a long and sordid history in American politics. But the modern-day voting panic was sparked by the fiasco in Florida in 2000, which demonstrated that the technicalities of ballot design and voter lists could decide the presidency of the United States. The two parties reacted very differently to this revelation. In order to ensure that supporters’ votes will be counted, Democrats have sought reforms, such as expanding early voting to prevent long lines and monitoring purges of voter rolls. Republicans, by contrast, have tended to view voting in the context of the party’s looming demographic problems. Non-whites overwhelmingly vote for Democrats. But 20 years ago, minorities made up only 13 percent of the electorate. This year, they comprise at least twice that figure. In response, Republicans have pushed for voting restrictions that would have a disproportionate effect on minorities. As a justification, they’ve invoked the threat of voter fraud—a phenomenon that has repeatedly been shown by exhaustive studies to be virtually nonexistent. Nevertheless, the voter fraud myth has become a cause in nearly every Republican-led state capitol this year. “A lot of blood has been shed to preserve our freedoms—not for people to allow their votes to be diluted by people who should not be voting,” Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos told me. In South Carolina, a constituent e-mailed his Republican state representative to complain that black voters would be “like a swarm of bees going after a watermelon” if they were offered a monetary reward for obtaining photo identification. “Amen,” the state representative replied. In Florida, where Republicans have limited early voting this year, State Senator Mike Bennett said he didn’t “have any problem making [voting] harder.” He explained: “I want the people in the state of Florida to want to vote as bad as that person in Africa who is willing to walk two hundred miles for that opportunity he’s never had before in his life. This should not be easy.” Since the start of 2011, governors have signed into law 23 bills that impose constraints on voting. Many require voters to produce government-issued photo identification, which can be burdensome to obtain for minorities, young people, and the elderly. A study by New York University’s Brennan Center found that 25 percent of blacks and 16 percent of Hispanics lack a government-issued photo ID, compared with 8 percent of white Americans. The most stringent measures have been implemented in deep-red states such as Kansas: Unlike many other states, it won’t allow people without a valid ID to sign an affidavit in order to vote. But it is in battlegrounds like Ohio where these efforts could swing the outcome of the presidential race. In a game of inches, everything counts and anything goes. In 2004, that mindset led Ohio’s Republican Secretary of State Ken Blackwell to, among other things, reject piles of voter registrations, because they were printed on insufficiently thick paper stock. That November, a shortage of voting machines predictably caused huge lines in urban precincts, dissuading thousands from voting. In addition, around 30,000 ballots were thrown out due to minor flaws—such as being cast at the wrong table in the right polling location. When Democrats took power in 2006, they expanded early voting to prevent a repeat occurrence of these debacles. (Blackwell’s successor, Jennifer Brunner, also came under scrutiny for trying to reject some absentee ballots from Republicans on tenuous grounds.) In 2008, African Americans took particular advantage of early voting. In Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati, 42 percent of in-person early voters were black, although African Americans make up less than a quarter of the county’s adult population. In Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, African Americans comprise 28 percent of the population but made up more than half of early voters. Turnout was especially high on the last weekend before Election Day—some 100,000 people voted throughout the state, which President Obama won by four percentage points. When Republicans reclaimed the state government in 2010, the pendulum swung back, hard. The GOP passed legislation cutting back the 35-day early voting period and eliminating a requirement that poll workers ensure voters were at the correct precinct. The implication was clear: In-person early voting benefited Democrats, whose minority and working-class supporters were more likely to have trouble getting to the polls on a weekday, especially in crowded urban precincts. (In fact, any effort to make voting easier helps Democrats, since they poll better than Republicans among people who don’t usually vote. When access to the polls is expanded, Democrats stand a greater chance of winning over the disaffected.) Ohio Democrats threatened to put the new voting law to a referendum. Fearful of a backlash, Republicans repealed the legislation but preserved a separate measure decreeing that only members of the military and their families could vote on the weekend before Election Day. So Democrats took to the courts, with some success. Federal judges ruled that all citizens should be allowed to vote on the final weekend—a ruling that Ohio’s Republican secretary of state, Jon Husted, unsuccessfully appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Federal courts also ordered Ohio to count ballots that were cast in the wrong precinct as a result of poll worker error. But Republicans did prevail on the broader question of early voting hours. In 2008, Ohioans in most big cities could vote on weekends for a month leading up to November 4. This year, both Democrats and Republicans on the election boards of large Republican-leaning suburban counties approved a similar schedule. But in several Democratic-leaning urban counties, including Lucas, Republican members opposed weekend voting. It fell to Husted to break a series of 2-2 ties, and he repeatedly sided with the Republicans. The result was that many large GOP-leaning counties had weekend hours while many large Democratic-leaning counties did not. After an uproar, Husted announced uniform statewide hours—no weekends anywhere. In 2008, nearly 200,000 people—roughly equivalent to Obama’s 2008 margin in Ohio—voted during the non-working hours that Husted has eliminated. A disproportionate share of those votes was in cities containing substantial populations of Democrats. Evening and weekend votes made up half of the early ballots in Franklin County (which includes Columbus) and more than a third in Montgomery County (which includes Dayton). Two Democrats on the Montgomery County board were so outraged that they moved to preserve the weekend hours, in defiance of Husted’s ruling. When they refused to back down, Husted removed them from their posts. In mid-September, I attended a meeting of the board in its cramped basement office. The new Democratic members that Husted had appointed to replace the renegades were tentative, asking basic questions about election operations. Afterward, one of the Republicans, Greg Gantt, assured me that eliminating weekend hours would have little impact: “There’s no way any decision or policy we’ve made will disenfranchise anybody.” Ohio Republicans also like to point out that Husted is sending absentee ballots to all Ohio voters—although they neglect to note that Republicans are likelier to vote by mail. In August, Doug Preisse, a Republican member of the Franklin County board of elections, was more candid about the underlying motivations in an interview with The Columbus Dispatch: “I guess I really actually feel we shouldn’t contort the voting process to accommodate the urban—read African-American—voter-turnout machine.” IN OCTOBER, billboards appeared in African American neighborhoods in Cleveland bearing a picture of a judge’s gavel and the words: “Voter fraud is a felony: up to 3½ years &amp; $10,000 fine.” The billboards’ owner—part of the Clear Channel conglomerate co-owned by Bain Capital—has declined to reveal the buyer. Meanwhile, deejays on local hip-hop stations are urging listeners to get to the polls. So far, early voting has been heavy. In Cuyahoga County, more than 1,000 people turned out each day during the first week—far more than four years ago. It is tempting to see the frenzy over voting this year as an ugly aberration, prompted by bigotry over Obama’s own racial background and partisan anxiety over a Republican candidate who has struggled for most of the race to make his mark. But in Ohio, as elsewhere, the departure of Candidate Obama will not be enough to halt the vendetta against the elusive fraudulent voter. At a Tea Party meeting in Columbus, Husted recently predicted that voter ID would be on the state’s legislative agenda next year. In several states, such as Pennsylvania, laws that were put on hold this fall because of court challenges will be in full effect next time around. If the Supreme Court overturns key parts of the Voting Rights Act next year—and many predict it will—Southern states will be able to pass new restrictions on voting without Department of Justice approval for the first time since 1965. And should Mitt Romney win in November, he has made it clear that his administration would be far more deferential to state’s rights on the question of election rules. None of these causes are likely to help the Republican Party much over the long term, of course, despite their obvious appeal in the here and now. But taking a different course would require a fundamental rethinking of party identity at levels far above Joe the Plumber and The Stain. Alec MacGillis is a senior editor at The New Republic.

Boeing (BA) and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Directed Energy Directorate, Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., successfully tested the Counter-electronics High-powered Microwave Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP) during a flight over the Utah Test and Training Range that was monitored from Hill Air Force Base. CHAMP, which renders electronic targets useless, is a non-kinetic alternative to traditional explosive weapons that use the energy of motion to defeat a target. During the test, the CHAMP missile navigated a pre-programmed flight plan and emitted bursts of high-powered energy, effectively knocking out the target's data and electronic subsystems. CHAMP allows for selective high-frequency radio wave strikes against numerous targets during a single mission.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1350927158150</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 13:32:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350927914960-60</Id><Topic><Title>has anyone blogged Obama's homosexual agenda, I was aghast soon homosexual acts will be a part of sex education in schools</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1350917233588</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:47:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only you have "blogged" this.

The following Obama quotes came from various sources (NYTimes, ABC, etc.) and compiled into a summary at “christianadcDOTorg”. Obama on declaration of faith: (2008 interview with George Stephanopoulos “You’re absolutely right that John McCain has not talked about my Muslim faith.” (Regardless of the correction, was it a mistake or inadvertent truth? How does one make such a mistake after twenty years as a "Christian"?) Obama and prayer: “Uh, yeah, I guess I do. It’s not formal, me getting on my knees. I think I have an ongoing conversation with God. I think throughout the day, I’m constantly asking myself questions about what I’m doing, why am I doing it.” (Jesus was pretty clear as to how to pray: “And when you pray, pray in this manner …”, see Matt 6:5-14). Obama and heaven: “Do I believe in the harps and clouds and wings? What I believe in is that if I live my life as well as I can, that I will be rewarded. I don’t presume to have knowledge of what happens after I die. But I feel very strongly that whether the reward is in the here and now or in the hereafter, the aligning myself to my faith and my values is a good thing.” (Obama is either unfamiliar with or rejects John ch. 14 and the Book of Revelation). Obama and sin: “In the same way that if I’m true to myself and my faith that that is its own reward, when I’m not true to it, it’s its own punishment.” (Obama apparently rejects Romans 3:23 and 6:23). Obama and Jesus: “Jesus is an historical figure for me, and he’s also a bridge between God and man, in the Christian faith, and one that I think is powerful precisely because he serves as that means of us reaching something higher. And he’s also a wonderful teacher. I think it’s important for all of us, of whatever faith, to have teachers in the flesh and also teachers in history.” Also “I believe that there are many paths to the same place”. (Obama fails to say that Jesus was the Son of God and rejects that Jesus is the ONLY way to heaven, John 3:15 and John 14:6). Obama and Islam (NYT interview, 2007): Obama fondly recalled the Islamic evening call to prayer as “one of the prettiest sounds on Earth at sunset.” According to the article, “Obama went on to recite its opening lines with a perfect Arabic accent: “Allah is Supreme! Allah is Supreme! Allah is Supreme! Allah is Supreme! I witness that there is no god but Allah! I witness that there is no god but Allah! I witness that Muhammad is his prophet!” Jesus said, "If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him."

But the "same God, different profits", while a cute play on words, is precisely the problem and the prime error. Allah is the God of Islam described in the Koran. The Koran (written in 600 AD) rejects the truth of the Bible (specifically the Trinity, Jesus as God, Jesus as the Son of God, and the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus). The Bible and the Koran cannot therefore both be true. Thus, the Allah of Mohammad and and the God of Abraham, Moses and Jacob, CANNOT be one and the same.

Some people answer: Joseph Smith a con man founded the Church! Smith had absolute power over thousands of people. That kind of power is a terrific reward in itself. He regularly stripped new converts of their wealth and told them God wanted them to live the United Way, or that the church needed their assets. He married 50 women, mostly very young and pretty girls. He was able to start an illegal bank and his followers gave him their fortunes. He lost it all. The man loved excitement, and whenever things calmed down he stirred the pot with some new scheme. The church fed his adrenaline needs. He avoided the life of a farmer that fate selected for him. It was far too boring. He had people convinced God talked to him directly and that he could translate foreign languages that no one else even recognized. He raised his entire family from poverty and gave them all leadership roles including his father. Smith Sr was named patriarch and allowed to charge for giving blessings. What did he have to gain? At one point he ran for president and commanded an army. This con was a terrific opportunity and he ran it for everything he could. He was shameless. And he didn't start at 14. The vision he claimed he had then wasn't discussed until about 15 years later. There is no record from his youth that indicated he had a vision. Even his mother didn't know about it. His first vision is a story he made up much later - look at the facts. He did start using his seer stone to tell people where to dig for hidden treasure within a couple years of that, however. He was definitely a practiced con man by the time he started the religion.</Msg><Username>jaked.canine</Username><Timestamp>1350940795213</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 17:19:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350941301252-114</Id><Title>RWNJ's to be fired on the burning coal of hell...</Title><Msg>mittens bulky bob the narcissist the bigots the liars to do nothings the know nothings the t'baggers the sobbing boehners in other words cry me a river</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1350941301252</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 17:28:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350941313114-115</Id><Title>RWNJ's to be fired on the burning coal of hell...</Title><Msg>mittens bulky bob the narcissist the bigots the liars to do nothings the know nothings the t'baggers the sobbing boehners in other words cry me a river</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1350941313114</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 17:28:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350941693891-116</Id><Topic><Title>Question of the Day</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1350924713444</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:51:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There were two boll weevils.

In an opinion piece for The Hill, Williams offered three "corrections" for what he describes as "deliberate misinformation" from Republicans (and their conservative media mouthpieces) about the Benghazi attack. Misinformation #1: "U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice lied to the American people in the days after the attack" when she suggested that a viral anti-Islam video sparked violence and wide-spread protests. Fox News has repeatedly pushed this narrative to make it seem like the administration was deliberately misleading the American people. Correction: Williams debunked this false narrative, pointing to the "simple fact" that James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, "confirmed that Rice told the truth in describing the assessment of the intelligence community at the time of her remarks." Williams went on to explain that CIA Director David Petraeus briefed the House Intelligence Committee with the same intel Rice used, as did Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy in testimony before Congress earlier in October. Furthermore, as Media Matters has previously exposed, Williams noted that Rice "stressed that there was an ongoing investigation where conclusions were subject to change." Indeed, Rice appeared on all major networks and repeatedly stressed that there was an ongoing investigation into the attacks. Misinformation #2: "[R]equests for extra security in Benghazi were denied by the administration," coupled with the suggestion that the "attack would have been stopped, and the ambassador still alive, if the requests had been granted." Fox News pushed this myth on multiple occasions. Correction: Williams pointed out that requests for extra security were focused on the embassy in Tripoli, not Benghazi, and State Department officials believe that even if the requests had been granted, they would likely not have changed what happened in Benghazi because the consulate would have been ill-equipped to respond to such a large-scale assault</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350942776855</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 17:52:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350942807398-125</Id><Title>A woman had to Rescue Obama in the last Debate</Title><Msg>.....has he always been a wimpy sissy?</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1350942807398</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 17:53:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350942846940-126</Id><Topic><Title>Fox News "Deliberate Misinformation"</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350942776855</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 17:52:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Misinformation #3: "[T]he attack on Benghazi is evidence that al Qaeda is resurgent."

In another segment on October 12, notorious warmonger John Bolton suggested that the Libya consulate attack shows a "resurgence of Al Qaeda" and "evidence that the War on Terrorism is still very much with us."

That does not work as there can only be one truth. Jesus said, "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice." (John 18:37) That leaves everyone else that embraces a lie and does not hear His (Jesus') voice. By a process of elimination, those that ascribe to Mohammad's version listen, by definition, to the voice of Satan - whether they know it or not. If you are confused by this, not unlike the President, then that is something for you to work on, like soon.

The known history of Nauvoo, Illinois starts with the Sauk and Fox tribes who frequented the area. By 1827 white settlers had built cabins in the area and the area became known as Commerce, Illinois. In late 1839 arriving Mormons bought the small town of Commerce and in April 1840 it was renamed "Nauvoo" by Joseph Smith, Jr., the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Nauvoo grew rapidly and for a few years was one of the most populous cities in Illinois. Smith moved to the Nauvoo area to implement a utopian socialist commune!

Venezuela President Hugo Chavez, after winning a fourth term earlier this month, reportedly said he would vote for Obama and that the president would likely vote for him. The socialist-leaning ruler also reportedly called Obama a “good guy.” His support follows that of the Castro family, which has ruled Cuba under a communist dictatorship for more than 50 years. In June, Mariela Castro, the daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro, said in a CNN interview, translated into English: “As a citizen of the world, I would like (Obama) to win.” And Russian President Vladimir Putin -- who is back in Moscow's driver's seat after a stint as prime minister -- has said the reelection of Obama could improve political relations between the two countries. He also reportedly called Obama a “genuine person" who "really wants to change much for the better." However, Putin also told The Wall Street Journal he is prepared to work with Mitt Romney, who once called Russia the United States’ “No. 1 geopolitical foe.” Putin characterized the Republican presidential nominee’s stance as "pre-election rhetoric." While Obama certainly didn't ask for the support of any of those three leaders, the president has come to Russia's defense on the campaign trail. In his Democratic nomination speech last month, Obama mocked Romney's comment saying "you don't call Russia our number one enemy -- not Al Qaeda, Russia -- unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp." While some foreign leaders are watching the U.S. election and observing from afar, other foreign officials are planning to make a visit, supposedly to make sure things go smoothly. United Nations affiliates from Europe and central Asia are reportedly coming to the U.S. to monitor the Nov. 6 elections. The monitors will go to polling stations to watch for voter suppression activities by conservative groups, according to The Hill newspaper. The paper reports the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe -- a United Nations partner -- will deploy 44 monitors, part of a larger mission that will send an additional 80 to 90 members of parliament from nearly 30 countries.</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1350947372999</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 19:09:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350947575284-137</Id><Title>bbbbbbbb ba ba ba baby, please don't go</Title><Msg>-james brown4 obama, but which one(s),,,,</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1350947575284</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 19:12:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350948432244-138</Id><Title>Romney Ryan argument in favor of deregulation explained!</Title><Msg>Just google or better yet youtube: Roundtable Discussion With Bernard Madoff</Msg><Username>jaked.canine</Username><Timestamp>1350948432244</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 19:27:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350948432306-139</Id><Title>Romney Ryan argument in favor of deregulation explained!</Title><Msg>Just google or better yet youtube: Roundtable Discussion With Bernard Madoff</Msg><Username>jaked.canine</Username><Timestamp>1350948432306</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 19:27:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350950328729-140</Id><Topic><Title>Why a Romney win would be bad for America</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1350949973439</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 19:52:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>President Romney..........

That is no so! The President is misleading the American people about Gov. Romney. I read Romney's NY Times article when it came out. Romney called for the auto makers to go into a managed bankruptcy to get out from under all its huge debts including those obligations saddled by the auto unions. Romney plan was to put the auto makers back on their feet through a Chapter 11 reorganization.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1350962017485</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:13:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350962193194-167</Id><Topic><Title>The President Made a Wopper</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1350962017485</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:13:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How DARE YOU insult the dumbocrats on this board with the truth!</Msg><Username>russell_tom</Username><Timestamp>1350962193194</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:16:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350962951537-168</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is winning big</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_789</Username><Timestamp>1350957903601</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 22:05:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... in his own mind.
