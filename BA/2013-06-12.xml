James McNerney please retire , stockholders need you gone, outsoruce your job</Title><Msg>operator of the world’s biggest fleet of Boeing Co. (BA) 787s, scrapped a service with the Dreamliner today, the third cancellation for the aircraft in Japan this week after a four-month grounding. ANA couldn’t use the 787 for the flight from Ube, western Japan, to Tokyo’s Haneda airport as the right engine failed to start, said Megumi Tezuka, a spokeswoman at the company. . Japan Airlines Co. (9201), the world’s second-largest Dreamliner operator, also canceled a service with the 787 yesterday after an indicator on a flight bound for Singapore showed problem with the engine anti-icing system. ANA and Japan Air both restarted flights with the plane June 1 after battery malfunctions kept their Dreamliner fleet grounded for more than four months. On June 10, ANA scrapped a 787 flight to Tokyo from Fukuoka after a sensor next to an engine indicated a possible problem. . The four-month suspension of 787 services would affect sales this year, ANA and JAL have said, after melting batteries on two jets spurred regulators to park all the planes in January. Biggest Market Japan has been the biggest market so far for Boeing (BA)’s plane, the first jetliner made chiefly of composite plastic materials. That meant ANA and JAL had the broadest disruptions while the aircraft were grounded and Boeing was rushing to find a fix for the lithium-ion batteries.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371011865653</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 00:37:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371011977585-2</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary must own 2014</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1370994620682</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 19:50:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hillary is a tool.

Any selector, anywhere… I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President…” – NSA spy grid whistleblower Edward Snowden. And so it begins: the power to tap the private phone calls of a federal judge or even the President. All at the fingertips of young NSA analysts who sift through masses of private data collected through the government’s back doors into the servers of Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Skype, AOL and others. (Here’s the proof.) But if a 29-year-old working for the NSA could wiretap a federal judge, he could also wiretap a U.S. Supreme Court justice.

How safe is any American when their government regards every citizen as a potential suspect who has no rights? Why is there no discussion of this in American public life? Watch the presstitutes turn Snowden’s revelations into an account of his disaffection and motives and away from the existential threat to democracy and civil liberty. As Paul Craig Roberts said: "What is the government’s real agenda? Clearly, “the war on terror” is a front for an undeclared agenda. In “freedom and democracy” America, citizens have no idea what their government’s motives are in fomenting endless wars and a gestapo police state. The only information Americans have comes from whistleblowers, who Obama ruthlessly prosecutes. The presstitutes quickly discredit the information and demonize the whistleblowers. Germans in the Third Reich and Soviet citizens in the Stalin era had a better idea of their government’s agendas than do “freedom and democracy” Americans today. The American people are the most uninformed people in modern history. In America there is no democracy that holds government accountable. There is only a brainwashed people who are chaff in the wind."</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371038147738</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 07:55:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371038797844-22</Id><Title>JPM sets Boeing price target as $133 per share</Title><Msg>This target was updated yesterday 6/11/13 by JP Morgan.

The name of the provider is not yet known, United Press International said. But Courthouse News Service said the suit claims the agency violated the Fourth Amendment in 2011, when agents executed a search warrant for financial data on one employee – and that led to the seizure of information on 10 million, including state judges. The search warrant did not specify that the IRS could take medical information, UPI said. And information technology officials warned the IRS about the potential to violate medical privacy laws before agents executed the warrant, the complaint said, as reported by UPI. “Despite knowing that these medical records were not within the scope of the warrant, defendants threatened to ‘rip’ the servers containing the medical data out of the building if IT personnel would not voluntarily hand them over,” the complaint states, UPI reported. The suit also says IRS agents seized workers’ phones and telephone data – more violations of the warrant, UPI reported. The complaint alleges the IRS was “invasive and unlawful” and stole access to intimate medical records that included patients’ treatment plans and therapies, UPI said. The suit seeks $25,000 in compensatory damages, per violation. The records’ seizure could impact up to one in 25 Americans, UPI said.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1371045255181</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 09:54:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371045584583-30</Id><Title>Democrats Happy to Defend Lying, Spying and Abuse of Power</Title><Msg>Evidently they think it's all OK if dome by a Democrat.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1371045584583</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 09:59:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371046079739-31</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe it's time to file a shareholder class action lawsuit against Jim McNerney... for failure on the 787</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370988986718</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 18:16:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe it's time for the shareholders/Boeing/McNerney to file a lawsuit against you.</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1371046079739</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 10:07:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371046618141-32</Id><Title>BA SIGNS $4BILLION ARMY CONTRACT! 105+++++</Title><Msg>get more</Msg><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1371046618141</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 10:16:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371046653880-33</Id><Topic><Title>787 Dreamliner is the "airplane from hell"</Title><Username>food_stamp_nation</Username><Timestamp>1371039480534</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 08:18:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you related wayne?</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1371046653880</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 10:17:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371047149551-34</Id><Topic><Title>White House Schedule</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1363270937569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 10:22:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what a surprise, another campaign day (i don't think the occupier likes the office much)...get the big airplanes, limousines, traffic cops ready...or not, here they come, boston then miami 10:00 AM The President departs the White House en route Joint Base Andrews 10:15 AM The President departs Joint Base Andrews 11:25 AM The President arrives Boston, Massachusetts 1:45 PM The President delivers remarks at an event for Ed Markey for Senate and the Massachusetts Democratic Party 2:45 PM The President departs Boston, Massachusetts 5:40 PM The President arrives Miami, Florida 7:05 PM The President delivers remarks at a DNC event 8:55 PM The President delivers remarks at a DNC event 9:55 PM The President departs Miami, Florida</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1371047149551</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 10:25:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371047259521-35</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Happy to Defend Lying, Spying and Abuse of Power</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1371045584583</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 09:59:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and all these Republicans defending it is that ok or is it dome?</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1371047259521</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 10:27:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371047748489-36</Id><Topic><Title>787 Dreamliner is the "airplane from hell"</Title><Username>food_stamp_nation</Username><Timestamp>1371039480534</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 08:18:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So tell all your buddies on the shop floor to do their part in minimizing 787 issues by at least pulling off the shipping tape on sensors after installation.</Msg><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1371047748489</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 10:35:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371048827639-37</Id><Title>"When government fears the people, there is liberty.</Title><Msg>.....When the people fear the government, there is tyranny."

The FAA said it had improved methods used to test lithium-ion batteries after two overheated batteries, including one fire, caused regulators to ground the entire fleet of 50 jets in January. Peggy Gilligan, associate administrator for aviation safety at the FAA, said the agency had learned other lessons from the incident, including drawing on more outsiders to review the certification plan for new technology. She said a broader review of the plane's design, manufacture and production that was launched in January would conclude this summer, but didn't provide a date.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371050396578</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 11:19:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371050854478-43</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe it's time to file a shareholder class action lawsuit against Jim McNerney... for failure on the 787</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370988986718</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 18:16:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so foulvertiss, still the BHT eh, too bad you missed my 16 day call and trade at 100% gain ! wow today you just missed another 5% day trade on TSLA and as I told you , it is now a day trader stock until it breaks above the Bollinger ban, so this morning I made another 5% and out . it is nice for me for a nice day trade too you made well hum you lost .37% this morning on Boeing stock har har har and you missed my call to buy Airbus prior to the Paris Airshow on the new plan news , well sorry foulvertiss ,Airbus is now up 2% today too, are you learning yet? nope your a BHT troll that is all you know how to do ha ha</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371050854478</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 11:27:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371051139192-44</Id><Topic><Title>The 787 is cancelled by ANA today!

Don't compare this Trayvon issue with Emmitt Till or Rodney King either. This is nothing like the the incidents described above. This was a 17 year old young man beating the #$%$ out of an out of shape guy (per witnesses) trying to protect his neighborhood from a rash of burglaries by suspects described as black and wearing hoodies. He went to investigate (he had every right). Zimmerman did NOT have is gun drawn. He was NOT out to harass or shoot anybody. He is not a racist. He has Black friends. News media seems to forget this in their reporting. Trayvon sucker punched George after Trayvon told him "you're my problem", knocked him to the ground, and proceeded to beat George's head on the pavement. Now the activists have become what they hated. A lynch mob. They're out to hang him truth be damned. No trial needed. Death threats on the family. Don't compare this with Emmett Till or Rodney King. It doesn't do them justice. I'm just afraid with all this media conviction there will be riots in the street if George is found innocent. But I guess that will be good for TV ratings.

The principles make political leaders, commanders and combatants responsible for war crimes, even if domestic or internal laws allow such actions. The Nuremberg principles are designed to protect those, like Manning, who expose these crimes. Orders do not, under the Nuremberg principles, offer an excuse for committing war crimes. And the Nuremberg laws would clearly condemn the pilots in the “Collateral Murder” video and their commanders and exonerate Manning.

BY Susan J. Douglas Republicans know from repeated successes how to manipulate the news. They know that the media eats up conflict, and simple stories with heroes and villains. The Republicans may have taken a drubbing in the presidential election, but they’re winning the bigger ideological battle. Neoliberalism—the doctrine of cutting government, reducing social services and then letting market forces run wild—remains the dominant ideology, regardless of its obvious, staggering failures. You have to hand it to them: Republicans stay on message—helped along by the mainstream media and, of late, the government itself. The IRS bungling of a profoundly important investigation into the legality of the activities of 501(c)(4) nonprofits instantly became a media firestorm. Also known as “social welfare groups,” these are the organizations that metastasized after the 2010 Citizens United decision. As tax-exempt entities, they can engage in “issue advocacy,” but their “primary purpose” cannot be to support or oppose specific candidates. They don’t have to disclose their donors, who can contribute unlimited amounts, so they provide corporations and wealthy individuals cover to support business-friendly and/or conservative candidates. (The five top-spending 501(c)(4)s during the 2012 elections were all conservative organizations.) Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS spent an estimated $165 million on the 2012 election, some $71 million of that on explicitly political broadcast ads, phone calls, mailers and the like, according to an NPR investigation. Now, Rove’s donors didn’t get their money’s worth—pretty much every candidate they opposed won—but that doesn’t take away the need to investigate Crossroads GPS. But that’s not going to happen now.

What’s more, this scandal plays into conservatives’ anti-government mantra. Government bashing didn’t work so well in the 2012 presidential election. Obama won, in part, because of the support he drew from women, Latinos and African Americans, who, according to 2012 survey data from Pew, support a government safety net much more strongly than white men do. In other words, Obama won because of his insistence on a more involved, responsible and activist government. His win, then, demonstrated the majority of the electorate’s rejection of neoliberalism. But it doesn’t matter. Republicans know from repeated successes how to manipulate the news. They know that the media eats up conflict, and simple stories with heroes and villains. The Right appreciates that members of Congress remain, aside from the president, the most significant source of political news, especially with the ongoing cuts in news divisions and decline of investigative journalism. So Republicans in Congress have continued to beat the neoliberal drum, advocating further cuts to government revenues and downsizing the government (the villain) itself. And to distract us from, say, the number of Head Start programs around the country being closed as just one result of the sequester, they railed against the Benghazi attacks as more evidence of government ineptitude. And not to minimize the clumsiness of the IRS’s actions, but they appear to have occurred almost totally in one regional office in Cincinnati. Yet Republicans and the media blew it way out of proportion. Compare this “scandal” to, say, the report that CO2 levels—the most important of the greenhouse gases—have reached historically unprecedented and dangerously high levels in the atmosphere. That story hit the New York Times on Friday, May 10, and was dead within days. What does dealing with climate change require? Concerted government action and regulation. At a time when scientists agree on the dangers of global warming and the need for international government action, when so many economists (with historical evidence on their side) insist that governmental austerity is a terrible way to deal with recessions, when we desperately need better gun control laws, the Republicans continue to rant about government overreach and inefficiency. The press suggests that the Republicans are succeeding because Obama remains off message. True, in part. But they’re also succeeding because the news media, week in and week out, allows them to set the agenda and, in the process, to reaffirm an ideology—neoliberalism—that is a ruinous failure.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1371061000433</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 14:16:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371061432766-93</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Sneakily raises 'Carbon Price' as Costs to Climate Increase</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1371056003884</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 12:53:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Probably now wise to respond to the "hope4KlanMembers" as the depth of his despair is quantifiable.

The records include detailed call information (caller, receiver, date/time of call, length of call, etc.) for use in traffic analysis and social network analysis, but do not include audio information or transcripts of the content of the phone calls. The database's existence has prompted fierce objections. It is often viewed as an illegal warrantless search and a violation of the pen register provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and (in some cases) the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The George W. Bush administration neither confirmed nor denied the existence of The George W. Bush administration neither confirmed nor denied the existence of the domestic call record database. This contrasts with a related NSA controversy concerning warrantless surveillance of selected telephone calls; in that case they did confirm the existence of the program of debated legality. The program's code name is Stellar wind.[5] Similar programs exist or are planned in other countries, including Sweden (Titan traffic database) and Great Britain (Interception Modernisation Programme)</Msg><Username>here_comes_old_flatop</Username><Timestamp>1371061494941</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 14:24:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371061555340-96</Id><Topic><Title>How can something as rare as terrorism</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371038147738</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 07:55:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is more to it than just the original document, as it makes no mention of telephones or computers.

And trying to discuss them here is only an invitation to the trolls on this board to twist the meaning of everything said about those feelings. In the first place this is all VERY old news. So old that a legitimate case could be made for the idea that the whistle-blower, a high school, college and military dropout who SOMEHOW got a security clearance, is simply seeking his 15 minutes of fame. There was a cartoon animation of the Web many years ago where NSA guys were singing "You just called / and we were listening." ( Google Zoli's Blog.) Dan Brown wrote "Digital Fortress" a decade ago (of course, he THOUGHT he was writing fiction. :-) A lot of us were saying at the time of the Patriot Act passage that this sort of thing was coming. But the fearful American people seemed OK with it and there seems no point in continuing to bleat about it now. I posted around the 2008 election that Obama would never give up the powers that Boxarox secured for the presidency -- it's against human nature. On the other hand, no one appears to have been renditioned for anything he/she posted on the Web (Sparty's friends aside) or for calling the same number (their mother) twice a week. And the argument could be made that NO remarks should be anonymous -- except for those on rest room walls and railroad cars. I am not sure, for example, that anyone's freedoms would be impinged if everyone posting on the Internet had to use their true identities. Everyone should be responsible for what they say -- Thomas Jefferson was ;-D And this could be simply and extension -- or a first step -- toward that goal. As I have posted before, in another context, no "right" guaranteed under the constitution is absolute. Want freedom of speech? Don't slander anyone, burn crosses in a black neighbor's yard, or yell "fire" in a crowded theater. Want freedom of assembly? Don't let Boxarox's minions heard you into a fenced-off area miles from where he is speaking.

On balance, the pendulum swings both ways and this too will pass. Just like Daniel Ellsberg ended the myth about the Gulf of Tonkin, justice is eventually done. It will be in this case when someone who HAS been renditioned for calling their mother gets to the (responsible) press. The scariest thought to come out of this is, can we expect a Congress, who is more fearful that the American people, to pas any laws against this? No, "National security" is the sacred cow of politics -- it's how we get finessed into invading blameless sovereign nations and passing laws that give weak presidents unlimited tools to use against anyone they want. Just remember Richard Nixon. And thank Geo. W. Bush.

We know what warrantless means: they can't use that data in a court of law. But it will direct their search, and they will use some other probable cause to secure the warrant and proceed with gathering evidence they can use in a court of law. The case against Ellsberg was thrown out because of warrantless wiretapping. By that time it was pointless to persue from a different angle because the beans had been spilled. Ellsberg says this is more important than his case and that if his case had occurred now, he would be in jail.

This has to do with TV ratings and the continued spreading hate. By the way, I don't know why the news media keeps referring to George as being Hispanic. His father is white (I would guess German by the last name) and his mother is Peruvian (so I've read). Therefore, no Hispanic blood in him. I guess they feel that there is a better chance of convicting a Hispanic than White. This is all one sided reporting. No trial needed here. They've already convicted him. The other side of the story, this was a 17 year old young man beating the #$%$ out of an out of shape guy (per witnesses) trying to protect his neighborhood from a rash of burglaries by suspects described as black and wearing hoodies. He went to investigate (he had every right). Zimmerman did NOT have is gun drawn. He was NOT out to harass or shoot anybody. He is not a racist. He has Black friends. News media seems to forget this in their reporting. Trayvon had problems, that's why he went to stay at his grand parents. Trayvon sucker punched George after Trayvon told him "you're my problem", knocked him to the ground, and proceeded to beat George's head on the pavement. Now the activists have become what they hated. A lynch mob. They're out to hang him truth be damned. No trial needed. Death threats on the family. I'm just afraid with all this media conviction there will be riots in the street if George is found innocent. But I guess that will be good for TV ratings. Big money to be made. I hope a fair trial still means something in this country.

Things for the State Department just keep getting worse. First we learned from CBS News that Department official covered up and interfered with inspector general investigations of sexual misconduct, including the soliciation of prostitutes by an ambassador. Then we learned those sexual solicitations involved minors. Now, we're learning State Department officials covered up the shooting of four Hondurans. More from the New York Post: A top State Department official stymied investigators trying to get to the bottom of four killings in Honduras involving DEA agents and local police — yet another revelation from internal memos leaked by a whistleblower claiming a pattern of coverups. The incident ended in the deaths of two pregnant women and two men last year, after Honduran national police opened fire from a State Department-owned helicopter on a small boat. Honduran police said drugs were involved, but locals said the boat was full of fishermen. The killings were referenced in a whistleblower memo obtained by The Post. Two Drug Enforcement Administration agents were involved, an agency spokeswoman said, and they were accompanied by Honduran national police on two State helicopters with contractors as pilots. According to an internal 2012 document, the DEA agents were under the authority of the State Department chief of mission in Honduras, funded by a counternarcotics program, and were “subject to investigation” by State investigators. But when those inquiries began, “despite requests by the US ambassador to Honduras and congressional pressure, DEA reportedly [was] not cooperating.” With everything happening in Washington right now, it's easy to let things like this slip through the cracks. It's more than clear the State Department is operating in a culture without accountability. But, what difference does it make?</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371072588315</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 17:29:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371072695400-144</Id><Title>Hillary had a lot of experience covering up sex crimes.......</Title><Msg>....it looks like she put that experience to work at the state department.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1371072695400</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 17:31:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371072781834-145</Id><Title>The United States Congress has a question for Boeing on the 787 safety record !</Title><Msg>The exact cause of both battery problems remains under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.

Trent Franks By Jillian Rayfield Gabriel Gomez, the Republican candidate in the special election for senator of Massachusetts, said that Republican Rep. Trent Franks is a “moron” for commenting that most rapes don’t result in pregnancy. “I think that he’s a moron and he proves that stupid has no specific political affiliation,” Gomez told ABC News. “I have no idea what goes into the mind of a moron like that,” he continued. “These kinds of comments only come from a moron and they shouldn’t be tolerated one bit.” Franks, of Arizona, was speaking in a House hearing about his measure to implement a national ban on abortions after 20 weeks. When referring to an amendment proposed by Democrats to include a rape or incest exception, Franks said: “Before, when my friends on the left side of the aisle here tried to make rape and incest the subject — because, you know, the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.” Gomez also told ABC News that though he is antiabortion himself, he would not support Franks’ bill, which passed the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday without the rape or incest exception.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371076953652</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 18:42:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371076996852-169</Id><Topic><Title>Did NSA use its massive surveillance apparatus to hijack the Supreme Court decision on Obamacare?</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371035912308</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 07:18:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Both Petraeus and Jutice Roberts changed their minds at the last minute...they were given a nice cozy call ...everyone has something to hide and pressure points to persuade...the Global Elite (who wanted a coverup of Benghazi and the passing of Obamacare knew exactly where to apply pressure.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371076996852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 18:43:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371077093408-170</Id><Topic><Title>'We should all be more like black Muslims'</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371075459304</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 18:17:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was asking YOU not Barry Soetoro</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371077093408</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 18:44:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371077164687-171</Id><Topic><Title>"When government fears the people, there is liberty.</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1371048827639</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 10:53:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you mean a Bowell movement ?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371077164687</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 18:46:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371077767342-172</Id><Title>Boeing</Title><Msg>EVERETT, Wash., June 12, 2013 – Boeing [NYSE: BA] partnered with Thai Airways International (THAI) to transport 1,000 backpacks filled with school supplies onboard THAI’s newest 777-300ER aircraft delivered in Everett, Wash. The Boeing-sourced backpacks are destined for underprivileged children in Thailand. During a ceremony at the Everett Delivery Center, Elizabeth Lund, vice president and general manager of the 777 program, presented one of the backpacks to Thai Airways International President Dr. Sorajak Kasemsuvan. “In addition to being the delivery of the 27th 777 to Thai Airways International, this delivery is special for another reason as well. We have included some extra items in the cargo compartment of the airplane, two pallets containing 1,000 backpacks filled with school supplies. Boeing is pleased to be able to partner with Thai Airways International in support of children’s education,” said Lund. “I am thankful to Boeing for providing the supplies and pleased that Thai Airways International can carry them to children in Thailand. This event demonstrates the close relationship between THAI and Boeing and our shared interest to support development in Thailand,” said Kasemsuvan. Since Boeing’s Humanitarian Delivery Flight program began in 1992, the company has facilitated more than 150 relief flights in partnership with nearly 50 airlines, transporting more than one-million pounds of aid. “Boeing is pleased to have the opportunity to use our own resources, new airplanes, to carry out this work,” said Liz Warman, director of Global Corporate Citizenship for the Northwest region. “Through collaborative efforts such as this, Boeing and its airline partners are able to deploy aid where it’s needed around the world.”</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1371077767342</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 18:56:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371078063689-173</Id><Title>the numbers on Obama care are in 10.50 hr job pays $144.00 a month a 30k job pays $237 a month.

Army Gen. Martin Dempsey said timing and the need for the unit to help with casualties from Benghazi resulted in orders for the special forces to remain in Tripoli. Four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, died in two separate attacks several hours apart on the night of Sept. 11. Gregory Hicks, a former diplomat in Tripoli at the time of the attack, told a House panel last month that the unit was told to stand down. Dempsey said that was not the case. "They weren't told to stand down. A `stand down' means don't do anything," he said. "They were told that the mission they were asked to perform was not in Benghazi, but was at Tripoli airport." Dempsey explained that when the four members of Army special forces contacted their command center in Stuttgart, Germany, they were informed that Americans in Benghazi were "on their way and that they would be better used at the Tripoli airport because one of them was a medic." He also said that "if they had gone, they would have simply passed each other in the air."</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1371085631071</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 21:07:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371086272756-194</Id><Topic><Title>Once is enough</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1371078320851</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 19:05:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On the news, distance runners from Haiti are usually dark-skinned. ;-)</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371086272756</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 21:17:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371086324908-195</Id><Topic><Title>Once is enough</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1371078320851</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 19:05:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Please forgive them Lord because they are too stupid to comprehend".</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1371086324908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 21:18:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371086738654-196</Id><Title>Bush started NSA call database seven months before 9/11</Title><Msg>or about his first month in office,,,wonder what he was thinking,,,which political opponents he could destroy ? June 30, 2006 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. National Security Agency asked AT&amp;T Inc. to help it set up a domestic call monitoring site seven months before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, lawyers claimed June 23 in court papers filed in New York federal court. The allegation is part of a court filing adding AT&amp;T, the nation's largest telephone company, as a defendant in a breach of privacy case filed earlier this month on behalf of Verizon Communications Inc. and BellSouth Corp. customers. The suit alleges that the three carriers, the NSA and President George W. Bush violated the Telecommunications Act of 1934 and the U.S. Constitution, and seeks money damages. ``The Bush Administration asserted this became necessary after 9/11,'' plaintiff's lawyer Carl Mayer said in a telephone interview. ``This undermines that assertion.''</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1371086738654</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 21:25:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371086968839-197</Id><Topic><Title>Progressive Liberals Silent on NSA Violations !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1371059259575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 13:47:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chris, anonymous political speech is as old as US.

Describing the “whistleblower” who apparently came forward to Beck and TheBlaze, he said, “this guy is so afraid for his life” that he has said he will only tell his story on live television in front of Congress. Beck stated that the one document from the source that his team has seen would take down pretty much the whole power structure, pretty much everything.” He added, “It will take down the GOP, it will take down the Democrats, it will take down many members of Congress… the American people, you haven’t even begun to be outraged.” Of course, the last time Beck promised a revelation that would change the course of history, it concerns the mysterious Saudi Arabian man who was questioned and released after the Boston Marathon bombings. That theory has apparently since taken a back seat to more pressing matters. If Beck does manage to “take down” the entire U.S. power structure tomorrow, we will be sure to let you know.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1371087657818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 21:40:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371089731449-200</Id><Topic><Title>Bush started NSA call database seven months before 9/11</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1371086738654</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 21:25:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It took a tech worker named Snowdon to bring to light a secret NSA operation that has been trampled over our civil liberities.

It’s not clear if he has more top-secret documents in his possession on top of the slideshow that revealed the PRISM program and a copy of an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Are there other documents that he’s in possession of as well? And if he does have other documents, what do they contain? Cyber directives and an NSA surveillance PowerPoint are likely the tip of the classified iceberg. Snowden might have had access to nuclear weapons plans or infrastructure vulnerability reports. He might have documents revealing the location of missile sites, or lists of CIA officers. He’s claimed as much, telling Greenwald he had “full access to the rosters of everyone working at the NSA, the entire intelligence community, and undercover assets all around the world, the locations of every station we have, what their missions are and so forth.” Administration and intelligence officials are downplaying these claims, telling the Washington Post that they doubt his claims of widespread access. But if Snowden does have more sensitive information he has yet to leak, he could join other defense contractors who stole documents and changed history. Right now, Snowden has few good options. It’s possible he’s already been captured. It’s possible that he’s on the run. Without a fake passport, he can’t leave China: The electronic dragnet he felt obligated to expose would identify him immediately. This backs him into a corner. He could ask for asylum at an embassy of a country that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. He could take refuge at the Russian embassy, a country that has already offered him asylum and is very interested in the documents he has. He could also approach the Chinese government to try to trade the secrets he has for a safe home there. Colluding with the Russians or the Chinese would end the debate about his status as a whistleblower. It would make him a spy. But maybe Snowden has a fake identity and is already off the grid.</Msg><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1371090723017</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 22:32:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371090943414-204</Id><Topic><Title>Glenn Beck: Whistleblower Revelation That Will ‘Take Down’ GOP, Democrats, ‘Whole Power Structure’</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1371087657818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 21:40:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Dems in Congress are so wacko right now It would not surprise me.

One of their major concerns was that they didn't think Boeing had provided enough proof that the 787 would be safe to fly if the batteries failed. They also expressed concern that the warning indicator for a battery malfunction didn't indicate the severity of the problem. More recently, the pilots' group expressed concern that Boeing didn't figure out what caused the problems with the batteries in the first place and is now downplaying the battery's necessity for flight. Consequently, the group challenged Boeing to conduct flight tests without the lithium-ion battery to prove its safety.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371094750958</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 23:39:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371094863643-212</Id><Title>what do battery experts say about being fix on teh 787 lithium battery, here it is</Title><Msg>Battery experts and scientists have also publicly questioned the safety of Boeing's battery. Elton Cairns, a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory professor and battery technology expert, said: "I'm shocked that Boeing was willing to stake its reputation on these batteries. Even with the modifications, the individual cells of the battery are crammed too closely together and feature an internal chemistry that's far too volatile." More pointedly, Michel Armand, a professor of chemistry at the University of Picardie and a research director at the French government's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, told Barron's: "Using these batteries in planes makes no sense, with all the lives potentially at stake. These batteries are unpredictable and prone to thermal runaway and fires."</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371094863643</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 23:41:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371095260275-213</Id><Title>combining both Pilots concerns on flying a 787 lithium battery and battery experts 787 opinion , result the stock price</Title><Msg>Separately, these incidents are scary but manageable. But when you combine these accidents and factor in the pilots' concerns, you get the feeling that lithium-ion batteries are anything but safe. Underscoring this point is the decision by EADS' Airbus to pull the plug on putting lithium-ion batteries in its A350 plane, citing "immaturity of lithium-ion-battery technology." If the Dreamliner's battery really is fixed, this plane could prove to be quite profitable for Boeing. However, given all the issues it's had in the past, and the uncertainty of the battery, investors would do well to keep an eye on the Dreamliner -- especially considering Boeing's stock has fallen right along with the Dreamliner. Airbus stock is up for the five years plu that Boeing 787 has failed and now the new Airbus plane without lithium is taking to the sky. Airbus stock is up 174% in the five years Boeing stock up a pathetic 36%in 5 years !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371095260275</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 23:47:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371095896719-214</Id><Topic><Title>Glenn Beck: Whistleblower Revelation That Will ‘Take Down’ GOP, Democrats, ‘Whole Power Structure’</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1371087657818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 21:40:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Leon Penetta leaked Osama Ben Laden killing to Hollywood, so whats the problem?</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1371095896719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 23:58:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
