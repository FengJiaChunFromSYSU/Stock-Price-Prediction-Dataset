"i think boeing is hoping they spend it during the holidays and wont be prepared for long strike,if any at all." Aint gonna happen ... Talk about wishful thinking. Jesus. We're MUCH smarter than Boeing believes. We saw this coming YEARS AGO and are prepared for a long strike like nobody's business. One engineer I work with told me she and her family have over 30 grand sitting in a strike fund. I've heard similar stories from several other engineers and I can strike indefinitely. The strike in 2000 lasted 40 days. This one will be longer and it will be Boeing that will eventually cave. As in 2000, the financial losses and pressure on Boeing from Wall Street, stockholders, the airlines and other customers will rapidly mount until it reaches a point where the company can't withstand it any longer. All we have to do is have a way to pay the bills for a few months, which is a piece of cake when you've spent the last several years preparing. Go ahead Boeing, make our day.

Proving once again, our problem is not caused by George Bush's tax cuts......its spending and promising people things to buy votes. Housing problem - Democrats policy of forcing banks to finance mortgages to people who couldn't pay them back. Banking catastrophe - Barney Frank, Chris Dod and Maxine Waters, all Democrats in charge of regulating our banking system. All charged with ethics violations. Misuse of stimulus - Obama, gave tax payer's money to cronies under the disguise of green energy companies that would file bankruptcies after collecting millions of your money in bonuses. Don't forget he bailed out pensions of union thugs who supported him - and used taxes paid by hard working non-union folks. Oh, I know some government educated ignoramus is going to cry, "but the wars caused the recession." The center for Economic and Policy Research says under Bush the war costs were roughly 1% of GDP.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1354803790617</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 09:23:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354804106503-9</Id><Topic><Title>787 can not stay in the air.</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1354731866865</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 13:24:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The fuel line issue is now confirmed that it is an assembly issue that has been corrected on teh assembly line.

(In case you're keeping score at home, this was the surreal proposal that induced McConnell to laugh out loud as it was outlined by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner). Harry Reid quickly objected and shut the whole thing down, labeling the suggestion a "stunt." Think about that. The President of the United States, a Democrat, crafted a fiscal cliff package that would give him everything he wants. It has tax hikes on the rich. It has huge tax hikes on investments and estates. It has more stimulus spending. It has no meaningful, specific, or guaranteed spending cuts. And it compels Congress to cede control of the debt ceiling to him. This is "fairness" on steroids. The Senate's top Republican proposed an up-or-down vote on everything the president wants, yet Democrats, who control the upper chamber, instantly blocked it. By what definition is it a "stunt" to hold a vote on the president's full, public plan? The White House has insisted it's a serious document, yet Hill Democrats don't want it to see the light of day.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1354804371351</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 09:32:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354806349106-11</Id><Title>Why did Obama Want to Hang Out With Marxists in College?</Title><Msg>""To avoid being mistaken for a sellout,I chose my friends carefully.

They sell their vote for Santa Bama so he can guide their miserable meaningless lives. They are simply put, a drain on society, which America can no longer afford! If you want to be an American Patriot here are simple steps you can take: 1) When the fiscal cliff appears, take two LibDim acquaintances in the guise of a “green” nature walk to the edge of the cliff. 2) Then push them over the cliff. 3) Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 as often as possible.

Thatcher advisor Lord Monckton evicted from UN climate summit after challenging global warming -- 'Escorted from the hall and security officers stripped him of his UN credentials' After the news conference, and as diplomats gathered for the climate conference president's assessment of how close countries are to agreement, Monckton quietly slipped into the seat reserved for the delegation of Myanmar and clicked the button to speak. "In the 16 years we have been coming to these conferences, there has been no global warming," Monckton said as confused murmurs filled the hall and then turned into a chorus of boos. The stunt infuriated negotiators and activists here who gather every year to address what they believe is one of the world's top threats, the steady rise of man-made global warming. As Monckton was escorted from the hall and security officers stripped him of his U.N. credentials, several people noted that just a few hours earlier a group of young activists had been thrown out of the convention center and deported. Their crime: unfurling an unauthorized banner calling for the Qatari hosts to lead the negotiations to a strong conclusion. By late today, several activists attending the conference had posted calls to "deport Monckton" on their Twitter feeds. Monckton was referring to the latest temerature data showing a 16 year stall in global warming. UK Daily Mail: 'Global warming stopped 16 years ago' according to UK Met Office 'quietly released' report -- 'Pause' in warming lasted about same time as when temps rose, 1980 to 1996' -- 'The new data, compiled from more than 3,000 measuring points on land &amp; sea, was issued quietly on internet, without any media fanfare, &amp; , until today, it has not been reported. This stands in sharp contrast to release of previous figures 6 months ago, which went only to end of 2010 – a very warm year...From beginning of 1997 until August 2012 there was no discernible rise in aggregate global temps.' UK Daily Mail: 'Claim that there has been any statistically significant warming for past 16 years is therefore unsustainable' -- Reaffirms 'a 16-year 'pause' in rising temps' -- 'Two new separate peer-reviewed studies, published in prestigious academic journals last week [challenged 'Hockey Stick'] -- 'The level of warmth during the peak of the MWP in the second half of the 10th Century, equaled or slightly exceeded the mid-20th Century warming.' There was also a pronounced warming period in Roman times'</Msg><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1354825121234</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 15:18:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354825223194-56</Id><Topic><Title>Why Can't Democrats Produce a Budget</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1354812250367</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 11:44:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The right-fringers are posting like it really matters, like they won the election (or at least didn't LOSE it :-) like if they can just be NASTY and ARROGANT enough, they can lead the Repugnantcon party out of Mirkwood and into the light, like their elected reps might NOT cave into the will of the people and increase taxes on their wealth demigods.
