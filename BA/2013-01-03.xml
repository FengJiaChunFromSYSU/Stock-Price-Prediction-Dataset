Boeing is still proving it can not make or deliver any Chicago MD outsourced Managed planes after the Boeing purchase of MD. . Sadly, Airbus only shows how bad Boeing Management is at messing up a once great Boeing Seattle based Company. So moving on SPEEA contract negotiations begin on January 9th ,round two, and ifChicago continues to tuff talk Boeing workers into a strike , then the stockholders of Boeing are the losers. How bad, lets look for one year Boeing stock is now up 3.8% not counting dividends, ok better than a bank savings account. But compared to less risk the overall DJ is up 9.7%, NASDAQ up 19.4%, and S &amp; P up 16.2% so a ETF is better and much less risky. Key points on Airbus and Boeing for 2012 - Merger between EADS and BAE Systems collapses, The 787 program's problems have become legendary in the industry and Boeing won't make money on it for years, Airbus delays A350,Boeing dithers on 777X,Airbus A380 kind of like the 787 delay and fail only not as bad as the 787. Airbus and Boeing both should have stayed with aluminum, as carbon fiber does not change performance same speed , with many unknown manufacturing and flight safety risks. Since so far only BA and Airbus are in the business of large aircraft production they should not be killing their stock holders with experimental materials in such large jumps from parts to the whole material change.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357198950093</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 02:42:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357199471541-17</Id><Topic><Title>What is president Obama up to the Hawaiian White-House</Title><Username>fats_marty</Username><Timestamp>1357193771937</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 01:16:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"...writing thank you notes, riding the waves ..."

His stoney faced demeanor, extreme viewpoints, non-compromising attitude, arsenal of guns and misanthropic disposition fit exactly into the model picture that has evolved in criminology science as being ‘the lone gunman’ persona. RIGHT: Every press conference and public appearance since last Friday, LaPierre has been accompanied by his “friend”, Mildred. He has offered no explanation and refuses to answer questions about it. “We are worried in that Mr. LaPierre fits to a ‘T’ the textbook characterization of the ‘lone gunman’ that has caused a lot of the violent mayhem and mass shootings of the last twenty years.” stated Howler Fitz of the serial killer unit of the FBI Investigations branch. “He has the look, the arrogance and the armament to be the exact sort of person that we have been bracing ourselves against. He is the Darth Vader of Star Wars, the Lee Harvey Oswald of JFK, the Great White Whale of Moby #$%$, the Elmer Fudd of Bugs Bunny. He is the one we need to be watching.” Investigators studying Mr. LaPierre are alarmed by attitudes and activities that seem consistent with mass murders. These include his seeming callousness towards victims of mass shootings and their families, his abrasiveness with those who don’t agree with his beliefs, his desire to be superior to those around him by having more firepower, a non-human disregard for the lives of others, and a deep seated need to be surrounded by an organization that will offer him a cocoon against a world that he feels wants to devour him. “He is somewhat that we are definitely going to have to keep our eye on.” stated local State Trooper chief John Ballbreaker. “He is a loner, angry, bitter at a world that doesn’t understand him. His only love in life are pieces of metal and wood constructed in ways to make them machines that can kill anyone who he doesn’t like. Now people want to take those constructed pieces of wood and metal away from him. It makes for an explosive mixture.” “What he has is a pathological tendency that we find often in small children when they want to build a castle around them to protect them from a world they don’t understand. It is just unusual finding it in a 50 year old man.”</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357224530484</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 09:48:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357224617302-31</Id><Topic><Title>FBI Fears NRA’s Wayne LaPierre Fits Profile of Lone Gunman</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357224530484</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 09:48:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... typical neocon freak... aka sparty !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357224617302</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 09:50:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357225662029-32</Id><Topic><Title>LOL Guess who bought Current TV?

Laws mandating a minimum age for gun ownership reduce gun fatalities, but firearms still pass easily from legal owners to juveniles and other legally proscribed individuals, such as felons or persons with mental illness. Because ready access to guns in the home increases, rather than reduces, a family's risk of homicide in the home, safe storage of guns might save lives.2 Nevertheless, many gun owners, including gun-owning parents, still keep at least one firearm loaded and readily available for self-defense.3 The nation might be in a better position to act if medical and public health researchers had continued to study these issues as diligently as some of us did between 1985 and 1997. But in 1996, pro-gun members of Congress mounted an all-out effort to eliminate the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although they failed to defund the center, the House of Representatives removed $2.6 million from the CDC's budget—precisely the amount the agency had spent on firearm injury research the previous year. Funding was restored in joint conference committee, but the money was earmarked for traumatic brain injury. The effect was sharply reduced support for firearm injury research. To ensure that the CDC and its grantees got the message, the following language was added to the final appropriation: “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.”4 Precisely what was or was not permitted under the clause was unclear. But no federal employee was willing to risk his or her career or the agency's funding to find out. Extramural support for firearm injury prevention research quickly dried up. Even today, 17 years after this legislative action, the CDC's website lacks specific links to information about preventing firearm-related violence. When other agencies funded high-quality research, similar action was taken. In 2009, Branas et al5 published the results of a case-control study that examined whether carrying a gun increases or decreases the risk of firearm assault. In contrast to earlier research, this particular study was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Two years later, Congress extended the restrictive language it had previously applied to the CDC to all Department of Health and Human Services agencies, including the National Institutes of Health.6 These are not the only efforts to keep important health information from the public and patients. For example, in 1997, Cummings et al7 used state-level data from Washington to study the association between purchase of a handgun and the subsequent risk of homicide or suicide. Similar studies could not be conducted today because Washington State's firearm registration files are no longer accessible.8 In 2011, Florida's legislature passed and Governor Scott signed HB 155, which subjects the state's health care practitioners to possible sanctions, including loss of license, if they discuss or record information about firearm safety that a medical board later determines was not “relevant” or was “unnecessarily harassing.” A US district judge has since issued a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of this law, but the matter is still in litigation. Similar bills have been proposed in 7 other states. The US military is grappling with an increase in suicides within its ranks. Earlier this month, an article by 2 retired generals—a former chief and a vice chief of staff of the US Army— asked Congress to lift a little-noticed provision in the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act that prevents military commanders and noncommissioned officers from being able to talk to service members about their private weapons, even in cases in which a leader believes that a service member may be suicidal.9 Health researchers are ethically bound to conduct, analyze, and report studies as objectively as possible and communicate the findings in a transparent manner. Policy makers, health care practitioners, and the public have the final decision regarding whether they will accept, much less act on, those data. Criticizing research is fair game; suppressing research by targeting its sources of funding is not. Efforts to place legal restrictions on what physicians and other health care practitioners can and cannot say to their patients crosses an even more important line. Yet this is precisely what Florida and some other states are seeking to do. Physicians may disagree on many issues, including the pros and cons of gun control, but are united in opposing government efforts to undermine the sanctity of the patient-physician relationship, as defined by the Hippocratic oath. While it is reasonable to acknowledge and accept the Supreme Court's recent decision regarding the meaning of the Second Amendment, it is just as important to uphold physicians' First Amendment rights. Injury prevention research can have real and lasting effects. Over the last 20 years, the number of Americans dying in motor vehicle crashes has decreased by 31%.1 Deaths from fires and drowning have been reduced even more, by 38% and 52%, respectively.1 This progress was achieved without banning automobiles, swimming pools, or matches. Instead, it came from translating research findings into effective interventions. Given the chance, could researchers achieve similar progress with firearm violence? It will not be possible to find out unless Congress rescinds its moratorium on firearm injury prevention research. Since Congress took this action in 1997, at least 427 000 people have died of gunshot wounds in the United States, including more than 165 000 who were victims of homicide.1 To put these numbers in context, during the same time period, 4586 Americans lost their lives in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.10 The United States has long relied on public health science to improve the safety, health, and lives of its citizens. Perhaps the same straightforward, problem-solving approach that worked well in other circumstances can help the nation meet the challenge of firearm violence. Otherwise, the heartache that the nation and perhaps the world is feeling over the senseless gun violence in Newtown will likely be repeated, again and again.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357228283836</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 10:51:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357228938990-37</Id><Topic><Title>NRA Silencing Gun Research</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357228283836</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 10:51:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More leftist BS.

Time magazine has released its issue, which comes to a shocking conclusion. The cover article makes the case that the pro-abortion side is losing the abortion debate, saying, “40 Years Ago, Abortion Rights Activists Won an Epic Victory With Roe v. Wade. They’re been losing ever since.” The article makes the pro-abortion case that, while abortion is still legal, it is increasingly difficult to access thanks to the closing of so many abortion clinics and pro-life laws that help women by giving them additional information and alternatives. The magazine also contains an article from Emily Buchanan of the pro-life women’s group Susan B. Anthony List that rebuts what has become the modern talking point for Planned Parenthood and other abortion defenders — that abortion is about protecting women’s health, some excerpts of which appear below: From its early beginnings, feminism was a young women’s movement. Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Alice Paul, Charlotte Lozier and so many others began their suffragist work in their 20s. These women — the original feminists — understood that the rights of women cannot be built on the broken backs of unborn children. Anthony called abortion “child murder.” Paul, author of the original 1923 Equal Rights Amendment, said that “abortion is the ultimate exploitation of women.” So the pro-life movement hasn’t changed the meaning of feminism, as has been suggested. It was the neo-feminists of the 1960s and ’70s who asked women to prize abortion as the pathway to equality. Pro-life feminism has captivated a new generation of young women who reject the illusion that to be pro-woman is to be pro-choice. Gallup polling showed that among 18-to-29-year-olds, there was a 5% increase in those labeling themselves “pro-life” between 2007–08 and 2009–10. The past few years have seen the emergence of young leaders like Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life of America, who is responsible for organizing more than 675 pro-life groups on college campuses across the nation, and Lila Rose of Live Action, whose undercover video work has forced the abortion industry to confront and amend practices it cannot defend, as well as dozens of other future leaders who have assisted our organization as staff members and interns. Not only does this young generation of pro-life women shun the notion that abortion somehow liberates women; it views abortion as the civil- and human-rights cause of our day. Abortion is an injustice that permeates our society. Forty years after Roe v. Wade, we realize that a third of our peers are not here to share our progress and our hopes. It is our loss as well as theirs. Our fight transcends elections and legislative battles because our fight is in our hearts. This is why, 40 years after Roe, our movement is still growing. We won’t give up; we can’t give up. Our fight is for life.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1357242776257</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:52:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357243778436-58</Id><Topic><Title>The New repubBagger Obstructionists</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1357239904438</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:05:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>time for the useless Boehner and his crew of cretins to pack their bags !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357243778436</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 15:09:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357243908108-59</Id><Title>The Endangered American Beast of Burden</Title><Msg>There are 112 million private sector workers in the U.S., who must carry 22 million government workers, 66 million welfare recipients, and 62 million Social Security and Medicare recipients.

Not one single Senator who voted for this bill had read it.” This should trouble every American. I mean, if Senators aren’t reading a bill that will pretty much impact every single working American, what else aren’t they reading? An important question to ponder, it seems. Still, this isn’t the first time members of Congress have passed sweeping legislation without understanding the details of a bill, let alone the consequences of voting “aye.” Nancy Pelosi infamously said in 2010 we need to pass Obamacare to “find out what is in it.” Just look at how that turned out. Is it really surprising, then, that about half the country is not feeling optimistic about the future, and thus probably believes that the American Century has already come and gone? An exceedingly chilling thought, if you ask me. Above all, we need leadership in Washington, something this Congress -- as well as the last one -- seems incapable of providing.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1357260072468</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 19:41:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357260339992-93</Id><Topic><Title>Marine Afgan Veteran/Hero Writes letter to Feinstein.

None of these structures will survive a CAT5 hurricane and 25 foot ocean surges in the future. Scientists have determined that if the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 were to happen now there would be $170 billion in damage. Also check out the paleoclimate history specifically where it shows that the land that Manhattan was built on was 70 feet under water during one of the more recent interglacial periods similar to what we are in now. There is also the land subsidence problems on much of the coast partially caused by overpopulation and there is the beach erosion issue in part due to humans having removed natural protections such as mangroves. Population density and wealth density in these areas are also a major reasons why disasters will continue to get worse in the future.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1357261989897</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 20:13:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357262088700-105</Id><Topic><Title>Oregon versus Kansas St. Tonight</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1357260584504</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 19:49:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ducks are pretty tough...you'll see and then will go off into the night silent</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1357262088700</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 20:14:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357262200857-106</Id><Topic><Title>Defense spending cuts</Title><Username>fortuneking1</Username><Timestamp>1357236085154</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 13:01:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ALL Spending is on the table, correct??

If several states are passing "nullification" legislation , What then..? Also some local cities are proposing legislation that would nullify the Feds draconian gun laws.....we should obey THOSE cities ordinances and Governments under your logic...then should we not ? If disregarding the second amendment and following ORDERS of corrupt government officials in Washington is so important you cant have it both ways. The following story is prescient. -The town is small, but the message is clear: do not infringe. A police chief in Gilberton, Pennsylvania, a small burough in Schuylkill County with a population of only 867 people, is proposing a ’2nd Amendment Preservation’ Ordinance that he plans to present to the city council during its January 24, 2013 meeting. The ordinance, if adopted, would formally require the city to “enact any and all measures as may be necessary” to prevent the violation of the 2nd Amendment by any federal, state or local entity. In addition to formally recognizing the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees the right to keep and bear arms, Chief of Police Mark Kessler, who wrote the proposal, also pointed out the additional protection under the Pennsylvania constitution which specifically recognizes the “Right to Bear Arms” under Sections 21. That section reads, in full, “The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned.” The proposal would further require the local government to nullify “all federal, state or local acts in violation of the 2nd Amendment” and declare them to be invalid within Gilberton Borough limits. The right to nullify unconstitutional laws is granted under the 10th Amendment to Constitution, which further reserves powers not explicitly granted to the (limited) federal government to the states and the people. Police chief Mark Kessler confirmed an e-mail detailing his proposal by phone, indicating that he didn’t expect the ordinance would “do much” beyond sending a message to those in the media and Washington, yet he stated he felt the need to stand up to those demanding gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting tragedy.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357263991578</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 20:46:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357265652306-115</Id><Topic><Title>Judicial Watch: 10 most corrupt politicians</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1357261476965</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 20:04:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>People who talk smack about a whole class of people with no stats to back them up have MAJOR bowel infarctions.

Harry Reid (D-NV): A July 30, 2012, headline in the Las Vegas Review-Journal alerted Nevadans to Sen. Harry Reid’s latest influence-peddling scandal – this one involving ENN Energy Group, a Chinese “green energy” client of the Nevada law firm of which Reid’s son, Rory, is a principal. As Reuter’s reported on August 31, 2012, “Reid has been one of the project’s most prominent advocates, helping recruit the company during a 2011 trip to China and applying his political muscle on behalf of the project in Nevada. His son, a lawyer with a prominent Las Vegas firm that is representing ENN, helped it locate a 9,000-acre (3,600-hectare) desert site that it is buying well below appraised value from Clark County, where Rory Reid formerly chaired the county commission.” “Well below appraised value” is a considerable understatement. The deal Rory Reid put together for the firm his dad brought to town saw ENN purchase the site for just $4.5 million – a mere fraction of separate appraisals that valued the property at $29.6 million and $38.6 million. Even with all of that, however, the project has failed to move forward as rapidly as Harry and Rory Reid would like – for the simple reason that there is currently no market in Nevada for the green energy ENN claims it could produce. But, of course, funneling money to the Reid family is nothing new for the Senate Majority Leader. As the Washington Post reported in a February 7, 2012, story titled “Public projects, private interests:” In 2004 and 2005, the Senate majority leader secured $21.5 million to build a bridge over the Colorado River, linking the gambling resort town of Laughlin, Nev., with Bullhead City, Ariz. Reid owns 160 acres of undeveloped land in Bullhead City. And according to Peter Schweizer, writing for Fox News on December 12, 2012, “Sen. Reid has sponsored at least $47 million in earmarks that directly benefitted organizations that one of his sons, Key Reid, [RW1] either lobbies for or is affiliated with. Needless to say, the well-entrenched Sen. Reid has been a repeat Top Ten offender.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1357269387443</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:16:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357269953143-125</Id><Topic><Title>Marine Afgan Veteran/Hero Writes letter to Feinstein.

He is an unrepentant and evil person. Jackson, Jr., on the other hand, and unlike the President, who intoned "I take responsibility" and meaning nothing relative to Benghazi, Jackson, after having shamed the family name, said, "I take responsibility" and did just that - he resigned. I believe that we have to accept his statement. At this point I think it was sincere.

Those Governments in the last 100 years have been responsible for more deaths then all OTHER Governments in all recorded history. Its called Democide !!!!! From Mao in Communist China, Stalin in the U.S.S.R., Hitler in Nazi Germany, Pol Pot under the Khmer Rouge and so many others, governments have killed more than 260 million people in just the last one hundred years.
