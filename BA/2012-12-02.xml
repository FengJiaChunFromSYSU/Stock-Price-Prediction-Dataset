As far as your speil about Boeing I agree with you and consider it well written. I too am more than a little dissatisfied with Boeing's mgt and and compensation packages. As far as stock investing, I am the one and only proven stock board champion on this board making over 60% on my picks in an open contest on this board. I also said back in 2008, before the big crash that I'm out and going cash heavy. Then two years ago I proclaimed I'm back in and have been doing fairly well but always keeping my finger on the buy/sell button. In other words I'm more of a trader now days than an investor. This may change in the near future. Not only am I leaning bearish again I don't think trading is going to be as profitable especially if the short term capital gain tax is imposed.

The company must invariably layoff workers to balance its books. So as a result of union cannibalism some get to keep their jobs others are gone. Boeing is coping with this situation while at the same time a more major danger exists by Congress inaction that could cause the economy to go over the fiscal cliff. On 1/2/13 Boeing could be hit by the gov't's across the board spending cuts. This double punch from union pressure and the defense spending cuts could likely result in massive layoffs at the company.

As for the Investigation of the Illegal Alien in the Whitehouse: An angry statement just sworn by the lead investigator of a team assigned to review Barack Obama’s birth certificate says Hawaii officials – who are Democrats like Obama – are using “elaborate non-cooperation” to conceal birth records from law enforcement and the public. The sworn affidavit comes from Cold Case Posse lead Mike Zullo just a week after the publication of a sworn mathematical analysis demonstrating the near-zero probability that the White House “birth certificate” is genuine. Also, a math professor from Louisiana State University, Charles Delzell, has confirmed and endorsed the mathematical conclusions in yet another sworn statement. Zullo, a seasoned sleuth who heads the team deputized by Joe Arpaio, recently re-elected sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., fingers Hawaii’s governor, deputy attorney general and health department chiefs as obstructing justice. Zullo’s affidavit charges these officials are “hiding” original birth records, thwarting the posse’s hunt for those who forged the document at the White House website. His detailed catalog of Hawaii’s misfeasance is shocking. After two visits to the islands in the past six months, he has “chronicled a series of inconsistent and misleading representations” that various officials of the government of Hawaii have made since he was assigned to the case when 250 voters petitioned their sheriff to investigate the dodgy document more than a year ago. Those statements have come since 2007 and are on the question of what original birth records, if any, are held by the Hawaii Department of Health. The department, Zullo said, “has engaged in what the sheriff’s investigators believe is a systematic effort to hide from law enforcement and the public whatever original 1961 birth records the Hawaii Department of Health may have in its possession.” Officials “changed their policies and procedures in a manner calculated to hinder our law-enforcement investigation,” he continued.</Msg><Username>spartacus8463</Username><Timestamp>1354474238172</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 13:50:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354474378006-30</Id><Topic><Title>LMAO at the WHINEY Loser republican RUBES!

This is part of Mr. Rooney’s apology for one of his less trivial, non whimsical, sarcastic comments ”There was never a writer who didn't hope that in some small way he was doing good with the words he put down on paper and, while I know it's presumptuous, I've always had in my mind that I was doing some little bit of good. Now, I was to be known for having done, not good, but bad.”…. I'd be known for the rest of my life as … someone who had made life more difficult ….. I felt terrible about that and I've learned . Seems to me you are more sarcastic than you are whimsical, more braggadocios’ than you are really the best stock trader, and slightly too self centered for me .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1354479646458</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 15:20:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354480185088-34</Id><Topic><Title>Union Cannibalism.</Title><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1354472489345</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 13:21:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Union cannabalism is a lot like the bird that flew in ever decreasing circles.

A better question is why are you unable or unwilling to search for it? cbx6cylinder, many sources have listed costs for the 787 and over the 3 year delay. . The Seattletimes newspaper at delivery of the first 787 made that point.Here is the title of the Seattletimes article many years ago by the reporter assigned to areospace Dominic Gates ,"Boeing is set to deliver the first 787 Dreamliner to All Nippon Airways (ANA) of Japan on Sunday in Everett, but it's far from the end of the journey for a jet that has reshaped the company. "To reach this milestone, the company has spent a staggering amount: A conservative estimate by The Seattle Times puts Boeing's total investment on the program so far at more than $32 billion." "That massive sum, half spent on development costs and half on manufacturing the jets already built, means profitability for the plane won't come before well into the 2020s — if ever.” cbx6cylinder, several other newspapers have used this figure based upon airplane experts opinions. Next, Boeing has said so indirectly based upon the extended break even point themselves ". Next KAUFMAN(NPR): "That's a pretty universal sentiment. Boeing has invested a staggering sum, the estimates $32 billion on this airplane program. That's far more than the company ever expected to spend. And while there are more than 800 orders on the books, it is not clear when or even if the 787 will be ever be profitable".. Wendy Kaufman, NPR News, Next The most influential man in the world of commercial aviation, aircraft lessor Steven Udvar-Hazy, Because of all the delays, "the break-even point on the 787 has moved far, far to the right," Udvar-Hazy said in an interview with reporters huddled around him. "The research-and-development cost has skyrocketed." Udvar-Hazy said his guess is that Boeing will have to deliver 1,500 Dreamliners just to break even. That's almost twice the current tally of firm orders, at 843. Range A typical initial assumption for break-even on a new jet program is more like 400 or 500 airplanes. Suggesting a break-even of 1,500 indicates the financial impact of the jet program's delays has been catastrophic.( at least 30 billion) Udvar-Hazy is famous in aerospace for his invention of the aircraft-leasing business, which made him a billionaire with his former company International Lease Finance Corp. (ILFC). He has personally bought more than 800 planes from Boeing over 30 years, granting him regular access to Boeing's leadership and to their latest thinking. Boeing's extreme appetite for outsourcing ended the regimes of Harry Stonecipher and Alan Mulally. who left the Boeing Company next a Boeing engineer, on why the 787 is overbudget, . The merged company appeared to prize short-term profits over the development of its engineering expertise, and began to view outsourcing too myopically as a cost-saving process. "Speaking as an engineer here... if you're working on a state-of-the-art *anything* and you're trying to figure out how it's all going to come together, you don't outsource it *UNTIL* you've mastered the product yourself. The more complex the new product is, the more true this becomes. There's a reason that the majority of the managers that made the decision to outsource the whole thing aren't with the company any more. There's a reason why a lot of the senior engineers that knew how to build an airplane told those managers that it was a bad idea. It had NOTHING to do with unions and EVERYTHING to do with how you actually build something brand new/cutting edge." Next Boeing can't say it wasn't warned. As early as 2001, L.J. Hart-Smith, a Boeing senior technical fellow, produced report projecting that excessive outsourcing would raise Boeing's costs and steer profits to nothing. cby6cylinder the world knows that the 787 is over 3 years late and at least 30 billion over budget so now you know too.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1354485016066</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:50:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354489509347-40</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing should take a lesson from Ford</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1354326122934</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 20:42:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tough!</Msg><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1354489509347</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 18:05:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354494215756-41</Id><Title>Storm recovery</Title><Msg>Remember when Obama showed up on the EastCoast after the hurricane damage, and you libs raved about the great job Obama was doing directing, promising a quick recovery?

It would give them the opportunity to fire the deadwood." Answer, Boeing keeps the deadwood, they are promoted to managment. .. What in your knowledge base ( au.kingfish) gives you the idea that SPEEA or the IAM has gone on or would go on a wildcat strike? Are you aware as long as they are operating under a contract they agree not to go on a wildcat strike? Even during a strike the AOG workers to help the airlines with flying planes continue to work by contract. The IAM and SPEEA workers are some of the smartest workers in the world. They have been sent all over the world to train and fix all the outsourced factory problems on the cheap outsourcing failed business plan for the 787. No Boeing Union has ever been on a wildcat strike. The Union's only strikes occur, after Boeing Managment has refused to negotiate in good faith . . First, the loyal Union workers vote on a strike authorization by a vote of the membership,after the contract they were working under has expired and after they review the Boeing new labor contract offer. Many times the Boeing Company, in a less than honorable way, allows a contract expire and then deliberately do not negotiate a new contract in good faith . Reason, . Boeing has an agreement with its airline customers that during a labor strike, no late fees on airplane delivery will be granted to the airlines. .So the Boeing Company deliberately does not negotiate in good faith using take aways and rediculous offers to promote a Union strike. Boeing then does not have to pay the workers unemployment insurance. During this forced strike, Boeing and can allow Boeing contractors time to catch up with out of stock airplane parts. For Boeing , this is standard operating procedure and this is unethical and is what is wrong with Boeing. Boeing should lay off employee's who should be collecting unemployment compensation when their cheap outsourced contractors have held up the production and need time to catch up with parts production. . Instead Boeing Company Executives scapegoat the workers with the standard complaint that Boeing needs to compete with Airbus . Sadly, Airbus workers have more vacation, better wages and the Airbus workers get a better government retirement and medical coverage than any american Boeing union worker , all while Airbus workers have a lower production rate . au.kingfish as usual and par for the coarse you constantly spew misinformation .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1354506694872</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 22:51:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354506949227-54</Id><Topic><Title>LMAO at the WHINEY Loser republican RUBES!
