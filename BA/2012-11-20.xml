Nothing useful or good. McCain was calling for a Watergate like investigation over Benghazi that he could lead, but that got shot down since his accusations were based on McCain logic (also known as being wrong). Now, McCain is showing his “foreign policy” power by stomping his feet and declaring that until he gets answers from Susan Rice, he will not only refuse to confirm her, but he will refuse to confirm any Secretary of State. In other words, since he didn’t get his committee, he’ll leave America without a Secretary of State. Never mind that Rice was only repeating what the intelligence community approved as talking points on the Benghazi attacks, McCain wants her to go on TV and say she was “wrong.” Luckily no one is taking McCain too seriously, as even Joe Lieberman has abandoned McCain on his Benghazi jihad. As McCain makes the media rounds to hold Rice’s feet to the fire over properly repeating talking points that were kept vague for national security purposes, it’s worth remembering that he has a record of being mostly wrong and clearly incompetent on this very issue. Only a fool would suggest that we compromise our ongoing investigation by showing our hand to the terrorists before we knew who they were.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353441989432</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:06:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353442160251-34</Id><Title>Crisis at Cargolux could affect 747 freighter orders</Title><Msg>Qatar Airways is divesting its 35 percent stake in Cargolux, leaving the launch customer for Boeing’s 747-8 freighter jet to face an uncertain future. Boeing has admitted to a year over year drop of 6% in revenue. One has to wonder whether Qatar/Cargolux are also deferring delivery of the 747-8F's due to Boeings' inability to focus upon this airplanes many problems, -just as Boeing has been unable to focus upon the catastrophic collapse of the 787 program. Boeing apparently has lost the ability to design, manufacture and deliver new aircraft, or even complex derivatives such as the 747-8. Deliveries for United Parcel Service (UPS) has also suffered. Last month, UPS disclosed it is cutting air capacity out of Asia by about 10 percent – largely by reducing flight frequencies on routes – on top of a 10 percent cut last October. Most of the 777 orders have been pushed to 2018 or later, but FedEx hasn't disclosed a precise delivery schedule. Counting existing 777s and orders, FedEx still has 43 in its plans, compared with 45 a year ago. The undelivered jets are worth $2.5 billion at list prices, though based on discounted actual prices, market data from aircraft-valuation firm Avitas, is about $1.3 billion. . Boeing declined to discuss details of its customer’s business, since it is not good. With the global cargo market depressed, Cargolux has been bleeding money. It lost $18 million in 2011, the third annual loss in four years. “ Analyst, Hamilton said a source told him Qatar wanted Cargolux to cancel its remaining 747-8 orders. Cargolux said Albert Wildgen, who was brought in as company chairman at the time of the Qatari investment, has resigned.

The effort to curtail carbon emissions involved the sale of 23.1 million permits — each allowing for the release of one ton of carbon — for $10.09 apiece, the California Air Resources Board said. The permit sales last week opened the largest carbon marketplace in the nation and the second-biggest in the world after the European Union. The California air board will hold four such auctions a year. "By putting a price on carbon, we know we are beginning the process of breaking our dependence on fossil fuels," Mary Nichols, board chairman, said during a conference call with reporters. The board would not divulge specific figures on how many permits were bought by individual polluters covered under newly instituted caps on carbon emissions. The board does not comment on bidding activity to protect each polluter's strategy regarding use of the carbon market, Nichols said. However, a sampling of the more than 300 companies that are covered include utilities such as Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., petroleum refiners such as Phillips 66 Co. and even food processing companies such as Saputo Cheese USA Inc. Blair Jones, a spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, said the company is "satisfied with the process based on what we've observed." He said he couldn't comment on whether PG&amp;E participated in the auction due to restrictions in the cap and trade regulations. The board said participation in the auction was robust, with three times more bids submitted than allowances available for sale. Robert Day, a partner at Boston-based clean tech investment firm Black Coral Capital, said the high number of bids showed that California's carbon market is legitimate. "As an investor, I take a lot of comfort that this was for real, was done right and will continue into the future," Day said The permits are part of California's so-called "cap-and-trade" program — a central piece of the state's 2006 global warming regulations seeking to dramatically reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases. Businesses are required to either cut emissions to cap levels annually, or buy pollution permits called "allowances" from other companies for each extra ton of emissions discharged annually. The cap and number of allowances will decline over time in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions year-by-year. The final price for 2013 allowances was just nine cents above the $10 minimum price set by regulators. "The fact that the prices are clearing a little above the reserve is a good sign that people's fears about out of control costs for cleanup are not justified by the way the market actually worked," Nichols said. About 97 percent of the allowances were bought by companies regulated under the program, and another 3 percent were bought by financial traders for later sale.</Msg><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1353445608137</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 16:06:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353446162968-39</Id><Title>Four more years in your Face !!</Title><Msg>... ha ha ha ha !!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353446162968</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 16:16:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353447264546-40</Id><Topic><Title>libdem dumbness</Title><Username>harrydokes</Username><Timestamp>1353444636826</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:50:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Eighty percent of the people who call themselves Democrats don’t have a clue as to political reality."

These pieces leave no doubt that Boeing corporate forgets that the engineers and technical workers played a major part in turning the company around after executives took us to the brink of disaster with 787 outsourcing and a litany of bad decisions. These proposals remain in stark contrast to the double-digit raises and bonuses Boeing lavished onto executives earlier this year. . As proposed, Profs' salary raise pools are cut to 4.5%, 4%, 4.5% and 4%. Also , salary pools for Techs' are cut to 3.5%, 3%, 3.5% and 3%. Minimum salary increases are reduced to 1.5% for each unit, each year of the proposed four-year contract. In addition, Boeing’s medical proposal would shift significant costs onto the 23,500 employees in our Professional and Technical bargaining units. Finally, the company still insists upon eliminating the defined benefit pension for future hires and substituting a 401(k) that its own figures show is worth 40% less. By all measures, this would decrease the stability of the pension plan for current employees. In recent weeks leaders resorted to scare tactics by mentioning layoffs and threatening discipline to employees who talk about these important issues. To stop these tactics, SPEEA this week filed a new unfair labor practice (ULP) charge against Boeing.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1353472000606</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 23:26:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353473546182-61</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing partially responsible for CIA and Ambassador loss in Benghazi</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1353386325351</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 23:38:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It would seem that a fair question by the oversight committees to ask Penetta would be.
