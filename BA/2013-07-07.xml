I was pointing out your stupidity. You say, "This is will be the first large body crash in over ten years", and I counter your stupid statement by pointing out out that an Airbus widebody A-330 crashed a little over 4 years ago resulting in 228 deaths. Now whether you meant "large body" meant a widebody aircraft or body count makes no difference being that it was a widebody aircraft that crashed resulting in a large loss of life. And the real irony is it has been proven that the Airbus 330 crashed because of mechanical failure do to icicing which you blame for this S.F. Boeing 777 crash which has no basis in fact at this time. And just to let you know, your frothing at the mouth, as you always do when proven to be the fool you are, doesn't change the fact either it only enhances it.</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1373178747413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 02:32:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373182307341-6</Id><Title>WALL STREET SICKOS WILL RALLY THIS STOCK 5% ON MONDAY</Title><Msg>THAT IS HOW SICK THIS MARKET IS.</Msg><Username>keepshorting</Username><Timestamp>1373182307341</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 03:31:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373188166315-7</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like pilot error</Title><Username>america_wants_change</Username><Timestamp>1373164165731</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 22:29:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Probably the same story than in London.</Msg><Username>jackrip_eu</Username><Timestamp>1373188166315</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 05:09:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373195021392-8</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like pilot error</Title><Username>america_wants_change</Username><Timestamp>1373164165731</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 22:29:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was about ready to say the same thing.

The thing about it was that Airbus knew about this problem, had a fix, but was never concern enough to tell authorities that the A-330s should be grounded and fixed immediately. Didn't happen until 228 people died. Airbus was afraid of what this would do to the reputation of their A330.

National Transportation Safety Board chief Deborah Hersman said at a news conference Sunday the recorder also showed there was a call to increase airspeed roughly two seconds before impact. Before that, she said, there was no indication in the recordings that the aircraft was having any problems before it crashed Saturday, killing two passengers and injuring scores of others. Investigators took the flight data recorder to Washington, D.C., overnight to begin examining its contents for clues to the last moments of the flight, officials said. They also plan to interview the pilots, the crew and passengers. âI think weâre very thankful that the numbers were not worse when it came to fatalities and injuries,â Hersman told NBCâs âMeet the Press.â âIt could have been much worse.â</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1373232501476</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 17:28:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373232936149-57</Id><Title>Neither plane or engines at fault in Asiana crash says Asiana Airlines CEO</Title><Msg>The 777 has more than five million flights, according to Boeing, and it remains one of the industry's solid workhorses</Msg><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1373232936149</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 17:35:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373233634899-58</Id><Topic><Title>It's pilot's error</Title><Username>android_junk</Username><Timestamp>1373218305842</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 13:31:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Below target airspeed, by the time the pilot and first officer commented more power from the engines, it was too late to recover. 4 seconds before touch down the stick shaker went off.

Really.</Title><Msg>Conventional wisdom holds that the Republicans will hold the House in 2014, and there is nothing unreasonable with that view. Democrats won the House national popular vote by one point in 2012, and yet still suffer a 32-seat minority. In fact, Republicans have been so effective at gerrymandering the House, that estimates suggest Democrats would have to win the House generic popular vote by 7-8 points to get the 17 seats they'd need for the majority. Crazy, huh? That's not all. The president's party has averaged a loss of 26 seats in the House in the sixth year of his term since WWII, and of course, Democratic base groups are far less likely to turn out in an off-year election. So while conventional wisdom can be misguided, in this case, it's the safe bet for next year's elections. And yet new polling from Democracy Corps suggests that Republicans are so incompetent that they genuinely risk losing control of the House. In the polling, which featured an electorate shaped like 2010 (to give Dems a worst-case scenario), people prefer the Democratic Party over the teabaggers ... in Republican-held seats: In seats held by Republicans, almost half rate the Republican Congress and Tea Party negatively. The Democratic Party enjoys a net 6-point favorability advantage over the Republican Party in these Republican seats. Obamacare is not hurting Democrats, even in GOP-held seats: Republicansâ obsession with repeal is out-of-step with voters in even these Republican-held districts. In the most competitive seats, voters favor implementing the law over repealing it by 8 points. In 2010, seniors broke 59-38 for Republicans, buying into GOP claims that it was Democrats who wanted to kill Medicare. That GOP advantage appears to be gone: Seniors broke heavily for Republicans in 2010, and they are a disproportionate voice in off-year elections. This survey shows the race tied with them, which would be a huge turnaround. The toplines: The Republicans overall are only winning in these 49 seats by 47 to 42 percent â the same result that they achieved in the first poll in 2007 when Democrats ultimately gained 21 seats. Much more importantly, the race is dead even in the 24 seats that form the top tier (42 to 43 percent). And even more broadly speaking, look at the chart at the top of the page. a five-point lead is definitely getting close to that magical 7-8-point mark we need for the majority. Hilariously, Rasmussen showed a 5-point Democratic edge (43-38) in both February and March, at which point he magically stopped polling the congressional generic ballot. I wonder why ... It's still an uphill fight, no doubt. But we're in the game, and victory is within reach.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373243749429</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 20:35:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373243888612-88</Id><Topic><Title>NO MATTER WHAT, TAIL SHOULD NOT HAVE COME OFF!</Title><Username>hayzeuschrist</Username><Timestamp>1373240205036</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 19:36:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>2 Questions.
