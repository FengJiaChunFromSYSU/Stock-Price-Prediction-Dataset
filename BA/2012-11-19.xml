Whether you like it or not, and I know that you do not, basically that is too bad, but I have uniquely shared a biblical perspective. Hooz, Obama's undying and unquestioning worshiper, on the other hand, and his "collective ilk" (apologies for the seeming redundancy) write posts day in and day out for the past two weeks of everything that is wrong with Romney and the Republicans. Now, let's consider a moment of silence while we contemplate what Obama has done recently that anyone can rave about. It is deafening, the vacuum of silence, isn't it? Constant badgering the Republicans and conservatives is all that you can do because you have nothing to say about Obama that demonstrates why he was worthy of being re-elected - save for his current Asian junket. Thus, it is better to make a lot of noise - that no one will notice. And, so, that no one is lost on this: the Middle East may be about to blow up into full scale violence, but Obama must meet with the folks from Burma.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1353305755581</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 01:15:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353305784590-9</Id><Title>Sheriff joe sure took you RUBES to the cleaner didn't he.</Title><Msg>Just like the rest of the republifreaks did.</Msg><Username>needmorevacation</Username><Timestamp>1353305784590</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 01:16:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353306572939-10</Id><Topic><Title>Why Rove Failed to Deliver Ohio on Election Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_72</Username><Timestamp>1353116536134</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 20:42:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"We work without remuneration."

The vultures blame the workers. The vultures blame the union. And vapid media outlets report the lie as “news.” That’s what’s happening with the meltdown of Hostess Brands Inc. Americans are being told that they won’t get their Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos because the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union ran the company into the ground. But the union and the 5,600 Hostess workers represented by the union did not create the crisis that led the company’s incompetent managers to announce plans to shutter it. The BCTGM workers did not ask for more pay. The BCTGM workers did not ask for more benefits. The BCTGM workers did not ask for better pensions. The union and its members had a long history of working with the company to try to keep it viable. They had made wage and benefit concessions to keep the company viable. They adjusted to new technologies, new demands. They took deep layoffs—20 percent of the workforce—and kept showing up for work even as plants were closed. They kept working even as the company stopped making payment to their pension fund more than a year ago. The workers did not squeeze the filling out of Hostess. Hostess was smashed by vulture capitalists—“a management team that,” in the words of economist Dean Baker, “shows little competence and is rapidly stuffing its pockets at the company’s expense.” Even as the company struggled, the ten top Hostes executives pocketed increasingly lavish compensation packages. The Hostess CEO who demanded some of the deepest cuts from workers engineered a 300 percent increase in his compensation package. “Wall Street investors first came onto the scene with Hostess about a decade ago, purchasing the company and then loading it with debt. All the while, its executives talked of investments in new equipment, new research and new delivery trucks, but those improvements never materialized,” explains AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka. “Instead, the executives planned to give themselves bonuses and demanded pay cuts and benefit cuts from the workers, who haven’t had a raise in eight years,” said the AFL-CIO head. “In 2011, Hostess earned profits of more than $2.5 billion but ended the year with a loss of $341 million as it struggled to pay the interest on $1 billion in debt. This year, the company sought bankruptcy protection, the second time in eight years. Still, the CEO who brought on the latest bankruptcy got a raise while Hostess demanded that its workers accept a 30 percent pay and benefits cut.”</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353341403784</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 11:10:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353341546593-20</Id><Topic><Title>Rasmussen Poll: America Loves Obama !!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353340445400</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 10:54:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you're a Homosexual... be happy !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353341546593</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 11:12:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353341981823-21</Id><Topic><Title>Why Rove Failed to Deliver Ohio on Election Day</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_72</Username><Timestamp>1353116536134</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 20:42:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Didn't say I liked Anonlymous all that much, but it's absolutely hilarious to see turds like Rove hoist on their own pertard.

Burger, It is pretty clear that we all need to get off this board. As long as the liberal side pushes the absurd posts that everyone else is to blame for what happens on Obama's watch, there needs to be some balance to point out that error in thinking. I don't hate Obama; nor do I hate anyone. Hate is always the "talking points" of the liberal point of view that cannot justify Obama's behavior or refute charges against his actions and policies. Frankly, I think that he is evil, or at least what he is doing is evil.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1353347781026</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 12:56:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353348325280-30</Id><Topic><Title>Rasmussen Poll: America Loves Obama !!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1353340445400</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 10:54:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The public schools are failing because of parents like checkn.

You all like to invoke the Bible when using (misusing) the word "judge" as if you understand its meaning or context. And you simply do not. Go back to the account of the "woman caught in adultery" in which a crowd of those who were equally guilty of the same or similar sins as she, may have even slept with her, and sought to stone her to death. Jesus, after writing something on the ground (believed to be a list of the crowd's sins), said, "he who is without sin cast the first stone". The "judging" was about taking the accusation beyond statement of fact and implementing "justice", without a trial. Even Jesus told the woman "I do not accuse you. Go and SIN NO MORE". Thus, Jesus acknowledged and spoke to her sinful behavior. If our leaders are engaged in sinful behavior and we do not speak up against it, and instead demand of them different behavior, then we deserve what we get. When I speak of what Obama is doing, I am pointing out what are the facts of his behavior. And I am pointing out what the Bible says about such behavior - lying (Proverbs 12:22) , undermining Israel (Genesis 12:3), promotes same-sex marriage (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4), etc., supports unrestricted abortion (Jeremiah 1:4-5, Job 31:14-15). And, to be clear, Christians are required to speak out against evil, not be mute: Proverb 29:12, “If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.”</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1353355943080</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 15:12:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353356007834-47</Id><Title>Army contract</Title><Msg>The Boeing Co. was awarded a $59.6 million fixed-price contract by the U.S. Army Contracting Command.

I know that's what Boeing wants us all to believe, but the data I've seen doesn't support that assertion. I think it's much more likely that they're seeking pay and benefit reductions because they want to use that money to fund a stock buy-back program for the stock holders. Nice. In a conference call with Wall Street analysts a few months ago, BCA's CEO supposedly told the analysts exactly that.

The delusion is not the fact of Obama's winning the election but that folks believed that he merited being elected. In other words, those people that do not care about his lies as well as the evil of some of his agenda, will vote for him - no matter what he does. Others, as evidenced by exit poll interviews, were certainly swayed by his "heroic" and "presidential" help for the Sandy ravaged area. As we all know, FEMA will do its work, having learned from Katrina, whether Obama is there for a "photo-op" or not. Obama did really nothing and yet those that are willing to believe his lies voted for him - i.e., whatever they thought he did for Sandy victims was what swayed their votes. And it is interesting that a rare four pronged attack on Jersey/New York occurred one week before the election. The simultaneous four prongs: Hurricane Sandy itself, the high pressure over the mid-atlantic forcing Sandy on-shore, the winter storm (which Sandy collided with), and the concurrent high tide - all resulting in a massively destructive storm surge. Both Chris Matthews and Michael Moore, in different ways, praised the destruction of Sandy for helping Obama get re-elected. So, these guys see it. Why don't you?</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1353363551116</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:19:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353363878234-71</Id><Topic><Title>Valley Medical sues UW Medicine to reverse merger</Title><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1353304151693</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 00:49:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like complaining about losing in a shell came</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1353363878234</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:24:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353364089855-72</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary</Title><Username>harrydokes</Username><Timestamp>1353353402612</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 14:30:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I heard those 4 Americans murdered in Benghazi by Al Qiada were also democrat supporters.
