Lying is a core competency for Boeing leadership. Noticed that yesterdays news article on the "small fire" also mentioned that JAL had a previous 787 failure where Boeing and JAL hid it from the public and apparently FAA and NTSB. Since Boeing is essentially using the public to be passengers on an airplane that is still in the test faze. It would seem some discloser would be in order.</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1357794426298</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 00:07:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357794751238-2</Id><Title>787 , has a 3rd failure in 3 days , the 787 is not like the great 777</Title><Msg>A brake problem today has forced an All Nippon Airways flight to be cancelled in Japan - the third glitch in as many days involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It was scheduled to fly from the Yamaguchi prefecture in western Japan to Tokyo's Haneda Airport. But the domestic flight was grounded by Japan's ANA because brake parts to the rear left undercarriage needed replacing, a spokesman at Yamaguchi Ube Airport said. On Tuesday, a Japan Airlines jet was grounded at Boston Logan International Airport in the US following a fuel leak, a day after another plane of the same type suffered a fire. About 40 gallons (150 litres) of fuel spilled from the jet that was supposed to be bound for Tokyo from Boston last night. On Monday, a fire broke out in a battery pack in the belly of a different Boeing 787 operated by JAL at the same airport. Just minutes after all 173 passengers and 11 crew disembarked, the aircraft's cabin and cockpit filled with smoke. It had just landed at Boston, following a non-stop flight from Tokyo. All three episodes have heightened safety concerns about the aircraft, which has been beset with problems. Electrical faults have affected flights and delayed deliveries of the new jet to operators. The latest episode comes after the Federal Aviation Administration - the US aviation watchdog - had already launched a probe and discovered fuel line assembly errors. It said that the faults could result in fire risk from leaks dripping on hot engine parts or causing the aircraft to run out of fuel. Boeing Company officials are doing damage control by comparing the 787 to the 777, not a good comparison. the 787 has had 3.5 years extra time to test, fix and then deliver the 787 since the plane was delivered 3.5 years late and the cost to the shareholder for outsourcing the design and parts building is an extra 30 billion dollars over the budget. Each sold 787 plane cost the shareholder 400 million to make and with discounts is sold at 100 million so a loss of 300 million per delivered 787 plane. The 787 does not have Boeing engineering control as it was engineered outside the great Boeing SPEEA represented workers. The same SPEEA represented engineers had 100% control over the design of the 777, the result, it was built on schedule and delivered per budget, and did not get one day extra to sort out problems of birthing, and , in my opinion, the 777 is one of the best Boeing airplanes that the Boeing company made. Phil Grande , the number 1 USA rated stock chart trader today , on his radio show, discussed the BA stock and showed the chart, he said BA is in the "kill zone" and the major investment houses are selling their shares and it is not a buy. Perhaps Boeing is buying their own shares back today, that would be the Boeing stockholders money.

The Chief engineer of the 787 tells a true fact , but then said there are multiple systems in place to keep lithium batteries ?- safe?, well then, since any man made machine can fail, and the 787 is birthing to put it politically correct, what happens if those systems fail and the battery does catch on fire. It took 15 fire vechiles and 40 trained airplane firefighters on the ground to supress a small fire of 2 foot flames with all the firefighting suits and special equipment to contain a fire that only had a 3 minute start and burn. So if the 787 was 30 minutes or an hour from an airport and over water, , once the battery is on fire, the plane Blankets are good for about zero seconds of protection, and if the fire gets going then the plane will burn down like a fiberglass boat sitting on water , only the 787 will crash and all passengers will die. Mr Sinnett mentioned he could divert the smoke away from the passenger area, what he does not say is, the fire can not be put out, and just about everthing in the plane will catch on fire when in contact with a hot battery.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357818640730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 06:50:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357819259392-15</Id><Topic><Title>*****Gun Control Advocates are Racists*****</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357785826270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 21:43:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read history: Gun confiscation leads to mass murder by government (“democide”) As firearms instructor Paul Howe wrote recently, history teaches us harsh lessons about government disarmament of citizens: In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated. China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million educated people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million. Those are 56 million deaths that fall onto the hands of people like Obama, Biden, Morgan, Bloomberg, Cuomo and anyone who calls for gun confiscation. YOU are the mass murderers who make the Sandy Hook shooting look like nothing in comparison. It now appears Obama is going to go down in history as the U.S. President who brought us to a second civil war, where the goal of the radical left is to exterminate anyone who believes in liberty.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357819259392</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:00:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357819461986-16</Id><Topic><Title>*****Gun Control Advocates are Racists*****</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357785826270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 21:43:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Martin Luther King owned an arsenal of guns and often carried a concealed handgun.

With a duopoly of plane makers , it seems both are playing music to the customer. The plane is not ready , the technology is not ready, Boeing managment has a fiduciary duty to not experiment with shareholder money. Or gamble with shareholder money, doing both a new material and going with non Boeing Engineering to design the plane at the same time is not being responsible with shareholder money. It is a slap in the face of every past , present and future Boeing retiree, this 30 billion dollar mistake could cripple Boeing. Now Boeing is repeating history, this 787 is the Boeing version of the Comet of BOAC. The first jet with big window crashed and eventually BOAC fixed the problem but the customers would not fly on it. Boeing took over, Boeing studied the failure of the comet and learned just like airbus is now watching Boeing mistakes and will take advantage of it. Most companies last about 100 years until weak managment starts taking excessive bonus and the company goes out of business. Notice Steve Jobs took a dollar in wages per year and made his money on stock appreciation and the shareholders made at least 500% if they held until he died. The new CEO of Apple has a huge wage package and the stock has been going down since he tool over.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357819538248</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:05:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357819669102-18</Id><Topic><Title>This is NOT the Airplanes R us Board.</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1357755337122</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 13:15:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>are you the monitor of the Boeing message board then? or just a rude critic with no power or position to decide anything on the message board. ?</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357819669102</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:07:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357820069884-19</Id><Topic><Title>Here's the Best Argument Ever for Gun Control</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1357776639185</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 19:10:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, Kris Goebbels, such descriptive and graphic writing in your propaganda post!

This is because our Dear Ruler is not advocating (at least not yet) the government ownership and control of the means of production. No, what Barack Obama is doing with our economy makes him more of an economic fascist: Where the control of businesses is still in private hands, but the government is pretty much running the show with excessive rules and regulations. But that’s our economy. What about other aspects of fascism? Take for example, your right to bear arms. Historically, fascist regimes aren’t too fond of an individual citizen’s right to bear arms. They believe in a strong police state where if the military and the police aren’t the only ones with guns, and if private citizen does happen to own a firearm the government must absolutely know about it. Sounding a bit familiar? Do you see where we are heading here? Just remember what I’ve been saying on the air: The Supreme Court ruled that police – the government – has no duty to protect you. Your personal protection is ultimately up to you. Think about that. Think about how comfortable you would be, knowing that only the government and those working for it would be able to carry a firearm … a firearm that is not there for your protection, but for theirs. This is exactly where the 2nd Amendment comes into play. Owning a firearm is about as individualist an act as you can imagine – the act of protecting your life, liberty or property – and liberals can’t stand that. Our Founding Fathers recognized this sacred right. I have two excellent articles I want you to read on the subject of gun control – or victim disarmament. This is a crucial issue, and reading these two articles will help you to calm your emotions over this leftist anti-Second Amendment agenda, and prepare you to deal more effectively with those who view you as nothing but a “gun-nut.” The first article is Raging Against Self-Defense, A Psychiatrist Examines the Anti-Gun Mentality” by Sarah Thompson, M.D. This article is the best I’ve ever read when it comes to explaining the mindset of those who are determined to either take away or severely limit your right and ability to defend yourself from an armed predator. The second article is actually a letter; an Open letter to the American Psychiatric Association from Gene Flick, MD, another psychiatrist. This letter protests the efforts of the American Psychiatric Association to get involved in the victim disarmament movement. Please --- read the two articles. This is a crucial issue. There have been several stories of guns being used in self-defense this week. There are people out there who are determined to see that these people do not have the means to defend themselves in the future. You need to understand their mindset. These articles will help.

It was uttered by Valerie Jarrett. Jarrett was the head of Obama’s transition team during the period from his election in 2008 to his inauguration in 2009. Now she is Obama’s chief advisor in the White House. It is said that no decision is made without input from Valerie Jarrett. As she was heading Obama’s transition team Jarrett famously said: “We will be ready to rule from day one.” Not “lead” …. RULE. Funny, isn’t it … all this time people thought they were electing a leader. Now we have Obama’s point man on gun control telling us that that Barack Obama can take executive action to deal with gun control that “we believe is required." Of course he will. To hell with the Bill of Rights. Fascist dictators, by the way, are generally well-liked by the population. Hitler was loved.

Feinstein’s bill will prohibit the “sale, transfer, the importation and the possession, not retroactively, but prospectively,” of assault weapons that hold more than 10 bullets. President Obama indicated that he will support the proposed legislation. There are many other proposals that are under consideration by the White House that Feinstein’s bill would not address. According to the Washington Post, the administration is contemplating a set of proposals that would seek to tackle the gun issue in a more comprehensive manner. The proposals are as follows: require universal background checks for gun buyers; create a national database that would include information about gun sales; make it more difficult for those who suffer from a mental illness to acquire a gun by toughening the mental health background checks; and impose stiff penalties on those who provide guns to minors or possessing firearms close to a school. The Second Amendment and the strong influence that the National Rifle Association exerts on lawmakers make it harder to put in place stronger gun regulations. Despite such constraints, those broad measures that the Obama administration is considering, coupled with Feinstein's bill, would make it less likely that guns would end up in the wrong hands. Hence, those proposals could help reduce gun violence that is still plaguing many communities across the country. Those measures, however, would not infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens to acquire guns. Therefore, gun aficionados and gun control advocates alike could come together to support these “common-sense” measures.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357830362531</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:06:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357830409702-36</Id><Topic><Title>Quality Issues with Boeing Airlines - My opinion</Title><Username>pvemul</Username><Timestamp>1357751310946</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 12:08:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No Thanks I have SIRI-MGM-LXP-NLY-SAN and GE and doing great on them and will buy the Boeing Dips$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1357830409702</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:06:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357830516625-37</Id><Title>At this rate, it will take at least six years for the unemployment rate to reach 6.5%</Title><Msg>The most important part of the Federal Reserve-watching game is now this: figuring out how long it will take for the unemployment rate to drop to 6.5 percent.

COLUMBUS, Ohio - A Columbus man said that he fought back when a man tried to rob him at gunpoint in west Columbus Monday night. Kelby Smith, 34, told police he was in the driveway of the home on Crescent Drive just before 9 p.m. when he was approached by a robber. Smith said that he had his 2-month-old in a car carrier and had to shield him from the robber who held a gun at Smith's head. The suspect took Smith's money and started to flee the scene as he pointed the gun back at Smith and his child. That's when Smith pulled out his own gun and fired at the robber. The robber continued to run, but police said that a man fitting his description arrived at Mount Carmel West a short time later with a gunshot wound. Authorities said Smith does have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, and they believe he was trying to defend himself. Police are continuing to investigate, but the man at the hospital could face charges if it's determined he is the robbery suspect. Smith and his child were uninjured in the robbery.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1357830787108</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:13:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357831049627-40</Id><Title>One in four children in America is on food stamps.

One in four children in America participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, in fiscal year 2011, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture and U.S. Census Bureau. The USDA’s “Characteristics of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Households: Fiscal Year 2011” shows that in 2011, 19.9 million children, or people under 18, received food stamp benefits. The Census estimates there were 73.9 million children living in the United States in 2011, meaning that 26.9 percent of children, or approximately one in four, were on food stamps in 2011. The USDA notes that children constituted 45 percent of SNAP participants in 2011. Some philanthropists and policy experts believe efforts to reform SNAP because of high youth enrollment are misguided, arguing that the program ultimately helps the economy and improve kids’ health. But Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions — one of the most vocal critics of the recent skyrocketing SNAP enrollment numbers and USDA’s promotion of the benefit — contends that something must be done about government policies and a USDA that he says is more interested in enrolling Americans in the program than finding real solutions.</Msg><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1357831049627</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:17:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357831379822-41</Id><Topic><Title>One in four children in America is on food stamps.

This will probably come as a total shock to most of my Western readers, but at one point, Russia was one of the most heavily armed societies on earth. This was, of course, when we were free under the Tsar. Weapons, from swords and spears to pistols, rifles and shotguns were everywhere, common items. People carried them concealed, they carried them holstered. Fighting knives were a prominent part of many traditional attires and those little tubes criss crossing on the costumes of Cossacks and various Caucasian peoples? Well those are bullet holders for rifles. Various armies, such as the Poles, during the Смута (Times of Troubles), or Napoleon, or the Germans even as the Tsarist state collapsed under the weight of WW1 and Wall Street monies, found that holding Russian lands was much much harder than taking them and taking was no easy walk in the park but a blood bath all its own. In holding, one faced an extremely well armed and aggressive population Hell bent on exterminating or driving out the aggressor. Print version + - Font Size Send to friend This well armed population was what allowed the various White factions to rise up, no matter how disorganized politically and militarily they were in 1918 and wage a savage civil war against the Reds. It should be noted that many of these armies were armed peasants, villagers, farmers and merchants, protecting their own. If it had not been for Washington's clandestine support of and for the Reds, history would have gone quite differently. Moscow fell, for example, not from a lack of weapons to defend it, but from the lying guile of the Reds. Ten thousand Reds took Moscow and were opposed only by some few hundreds of officer cadets and their instructors. Even then the battle was fierce and losses high. However, in the city alone, at that time, lived over 30,000 military officers (both active and retired), all with their own issued weapons and ammunition, plus tens of thousands of other citizens who were armed. The Soviets promised to leave them all alone if they did not intervene. They did not and for that were asked afterwards to come register themselves and their weapons: where they were promptly shot. Of course being savages, murderers and liars does not mean being stupid and the Reds learned from their Civil War experience. One of the first things they did was to disarm the population. From that point, mass repression, mass arrests, mass deportations, mass murder, mass starvation were all a safe game for the powers that were. The worst they had to fear was a pitchfork in the guts or a knife in the back or the occasional hunting rifle. Not much for soldiers. To this day, with the Soviet Union now dead 21 years, with a whole generation born and raised to adulthood without the SU, we are still denied our basic and traditional rights to self defense. Why? We are told that everyone would just start shooting each other and crime would be everywhere....but criminals are still armed and still murdering and too often, especially in the far regions, those criminals wear the uniforms of the police. The fact that everyone would start shooting is also laughable when statistics are examined. While President Putin pushes through reforms, the local authorities, especially in our vast hinterland, do not feel they need to act like they work for the people. They do as they please, a tyrannical class who knows they have absolutely nothing to fear from a relatively unarmed population. This in turn breeds not respect but absolute contempt and often enough, criminal abuse.

We should be asking ourselves why so many of our fellow Americans are firmly against banning even assault weapons. Does anyone honestly want to live in a society in which M-16s are sold as easily as dinnerware? While there are some who would surely love that sort of thing, I do not believe that they are a national majority. I am a Republican. I voted for Mitt Romney. I hope that John Boehner remains House Speaker for years to come. In spite of all this, it is clear to see that Obama sincerely wants to protect the public from the horrors of gun violence. He deserves our full support, even if he has to do what is best through an executive order, or a series of them. Sometimes, leadership requires such decisive action. The President should not be faulted for tending to the business of America.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357836685504</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 11:51:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357836928352-58</Id><Topic><Title>'THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED'</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1357832444251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:40:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>did someone violate your stink hole..?</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1357836928352</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 11:55:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357837060386-59</Id><Topic><Title>The Second Amendment</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357828311603</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 09:31:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So you went to private school?</Msg><Username>burger_barn</Username><Timestamp>1357837060386</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 11:57:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357837226117-60</Id><Topic><Title>The Second Amendment</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357828311603</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 09:31:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are correct when you say I missed the quotation marks.

In an email to supporters yesterday, White House Senior Adviser David Plouffe wrote: Hello -- I'll tell you what keeps driving me every day: the knowledge that people like you have our backs. When President Obama asked you to make your voices heard to keep taxes from going up on the middle class, people from all over the country, folks in every state spoke out. More than 130,000 of you sent in stories to the White House website. There were times these past few weeks when our Twitter feeds were positively overwhelmed by people joining the debate using the #My2k hashtag. So we put your stories on the front page of the White House website. We asked you to stand behind the President when he laid out his position on this debate at the White House. The President went and met with one family who had shared their story. The Vice President sat down with another for lunch. And people took notice. Reporters wrote stories about the way that you were adding your voices to this debate, and it became impossible to ignore your perspective. The White House also released a video which like Plouffe's email, says middle class taxes haven't gone up and points out that the fiscal cliff requires "the wealthy to pay their fair share." The stories Plouffe won't be putting on the front page of WhiteHouse.gov are those of angry voters wondering why their paychecks are less, after all, the President promised he'd take care of them by only soaking the rich.

I wish I could also congratulate you on your conduct of international affairs. I do thank you for killing Osama bin Laden. It was a creditable action for which you deserve some of the credit you've been given. Of course the intelligence was gathered, and the mission was undertaken, by men and women who, although they answer to your command, answer to duty first. And it is difficult to imagine any president of the United States who, under the circumstances, wouldn't have ordered the strike against bin Laden. Although there is Jimmy Carter. Thank you for not being Jimmy Carter. the worst thing that you've done internationally is what you've done domestically. You sent a message to America in your re-election campaign. Therefore you sent a message to the world. The message is that we live in a zero-sum universe. There is a fixed amount of good things. Life is a pizza. If some people have too many slices, other people have to eat the pizza box. You had no answer to Mitt Romney's argument for more pizza parlors baking more pizzas. The solution to our problems, you said, is redistribution of the pizzas we've got—with low-cost, government-subsidized pepperoni somehow materializing as the result of higher taxes on pizza-parlor owners. In this zero-sum universe there is only so much happiness. The idea is that if we wipe the smile off the faces of people with prosperous businesses and successful careers, that will make the rest of us grin. There is only so much money. The people who have money are hogging it. The way for the rest of us to get money is to turn the hogs into bacon. Mr. President, your entire campaign platform was redistribution. Take from the rich and give to the . . . Well, actually, you didn't mention the poor. What you talked and talked about was the middle class, something most well-off Americans consider themselves to be members of. So your plan is to take from the more rich and the more or less rich and give to the less rich, more or less. It is as if Robin Hood stole treasure from the Sheriff of Nottingham and bestowed it on the Deputy Sheriff. But never mind. The evil of zero-sum thinking and redistributive politics has nothing to do with which things are taken or to whom those things are given or what the sum of zero things is supposed to be. The evil lies in denying people the right, the means, and, indeed, the duty to make more things. Or maybe you just find it easier to pursue a political policy of sneaking in America's back door, swiping a laptop, going around to the front door, ringing the bell, and announcing, "Free computer equipment for all school children!" However, domestic politics aren't my first concern here. The question is whether you want to convince the international community that zero-sum is the American premise and redistribution is the logical conclusion. I would argue that the world doesn't need more encouragement to think in zero-sum terms or act in redistributive ways. Western Europe has done such a good job redistributing its assets that the European Union now has a Spanish economy, a Swedish foreign policy, an Italian army, and Irish gigolos. Redistributionist political ideologies, in decline since the fall of the Soviet bloc, are on the rise again. Will you help the neo-Marxists of Latin America redistribute stupidity to their continent? The Janjaweed are trying to redistribute themselves in Darfur. The Serbs would like to do the same in Kosovo. The Chinese have already done it in Tibet. Al Qaeda offshoots are doing their best to redistribute violence to places that didn't have enough. And Russia and China would like the global balance of power to be redistributed. Since China has plenty of money to lend and Russia has plenty of oil to sell, your debt and energy policies should go a long way toward making the balance of power fairer for the Russians and Chinese. While redistribution—or "plagiarism," as we writers call it—is a bad idea, zero-sum is even worse. Zero-sum assumptions mean that a country that doesn't pursue a policy of taking things from other countries is letting its citizens down. That's pretty much the story of all recorded history, none of which needs to be repeated. It has taken mankind millennia to learn that trade is more profitable than pillage. And we don't have to carry our plunder home in sacks and saddlebags when we're willing to accept a certified check. The Chinese don't seem to understand this yet. They think trade is a one-way enterprise, the object of which is for China to have all the world's money. They've got most of ours already. Mr. President, validating China's economic notions isn't a good thing. A zero-sum faith in getting what's wanted by taking it can extend to faith itself. In some places there is only one religion. If other people have a religion of their own they must be taking away from my religion. Give up that faith, infidels. Speaking of infidel faiths, Mr. President, please consider the message of this Christmas week—a message of giving, not taking. And consider your prominent position as a messenger of peace on earth and goodwill toward men. When you embrace a belief in the zero-sum nature of what's under the Christmas tree and propose to redistribute everything that's in our Christmas stockings, you're asking the world to go sit on the Grinch's lap instead of Santa's.

The more unreasoning anger you show, the more liklely it is someone will limit your magazine capacity. :-) As I've been saying since the Newtown massacre, you can participate in the discussion or you can let other people decide, but it seems some reasonable restrictions are inevitable. No one but a few zealots seriously wants to take your guns away; no one but a few zealots think the 2nd Amendment gives you unqualified rights. There's that little indroductory adverbial phrase in there about "well regulated," and only a loon like sparty thinks the comma makes any meaningful difference to the meaning. No right is unqualified or unlimited. Perhaps your anger comes from knowing that this is TRUE. Not freedom of speech, not freedom of assembly, not habeas corpus. Yelling fire in a crowded theater is not protected speech. Every time a KKK Klavern wants to march, they need to get a PERMIT from the government. Abe Lincoln, FDR and George W. Bush all allowed people to be detained/incarcerated without charge or trial. Try to wrap your mind around the idea that when enough people get fed up with the gun violence, they'll pass regulations.

Clearly, with the Fed in stimulus mode, the rate calculations will work against companies for the next few years, possibly forcing them to dip into earnings and cash to keep up with liabilities. Boeing already said earlier this year that its pension costs are expected to rise 63% this year, The new system, termed "mark-to-market" accounting, would calculate the value of Boeing's pension fund, and its pension obligations, based on the value of the securities in said fund on a date certain, once per year. Because the value of such securities -- such as stocks -- can swing wildly over the course of a year, mark-to-market accounting introduces the risk of sudden, significant changes in the value of the pension fund, potentially distorting the view of Boeing's overall profits and losses. Opponents of mark-to-market accounting say the GAAP approach spreads changes in pension obligations over time, smoothing out results and avoiding wide swings in the supposed value of these obligations. Boeing says it will make a final decision on the move in January. Don't know if Boeing went to marke to market? I bet the pension contract issue is due to the law that makes Boeing keep up with its pension fund now</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1357870893091</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:21:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357871148535-183</Id><Title>Got To Love The Longhorn State</Title><Msg>Assisted suicide for Liberals is the current rage in Texas!</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1357871148535</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:25:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357871267074-184</Id><Topic><Title>On the Negotiation front re SPEEA</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1357869000025</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 20:50:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I believe that Boeing should at least fund their pension obligations 100% instead of a stock buyback. They are looking after their stockholders and "profits on the books" before the people that worked for their retirement as an incentive to dedicate themselves to the ups and downs the company has gone thru. It only seems like the right thing for Boeing to do instead of "hoping" their pension investments make up for any shortfall and obligations. Their obligation to the retirement fund should be prioritized over the stockholders instead of trying to get their bonuses based on the stock price(although they still seem to get bonuses regardless of the stock price).</Msg><Username>cbx6cylinder</Username><Timestamp>1357871267074</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:27:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357872634563-185</Id><Title>Genna pay your Fair Share</Title><Msg>Genna loves taxes so he can pay his fair share and mine too.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357872634563</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:50:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357872968077-186</Id><Topic><Title>RWNJ's believe giving guns to unstables like the Zimmerman security-guard wannabe</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357863290803</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:14:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Every neighborhood ever lived in has had a neighborhood-watch even watching the 'bad neighbors' like trying to keep the RWNJ's in-control amd not self-destructing us all... black mariah is/was a poker game where the queen of spades gets half the pot and the best poker hand the other half or about 777 also a BA plane your excuse, dolt... ?</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357872968077</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:56:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357873062755-187</Id><Title>Arms, Well Regulated and Militias</Title><Msg>Buuuuurp......that 24oz grilled over mesquit Porterhouse brushed with butter with lump crab meat piled high on it sure was good.

One of the things that bothers me is that all the statements from Boeing seem to be tilted toward all the things they have done to prevent battery fires but no unambiguous statements that if a battery fire occured that it could be contained safely in flight (anybody listen to M Sinnett's briefing, could you verify?). From what I read in the FAA requirements the batteries were certified based on the assumption that the design would prevent any fire from occuring. Again, if anyone can verify it would be appreciated.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1357874527258</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 22:22:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357874641903-194</Id><Topic><Title>Arms, Well Regulated and Militias</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357873062755</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:57:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Liberals want to re-write the dictionary, having fixed meanings for words sucks for them, and their lawyer friends .

I know him personally and he would make a fine president. Bobby Jindal says he wants to eliminate all Louisiana personal and corporate income taxes to simplify the state's tax code and make it more friendly for business and us rich guys. I told him long ago, if Texas can do it so can Louisiana. It was my honor to get to read Bobby's announcement tonight at the petroleum club. Jindal's Statement read: Our goal is to eliminate all personal income tax and all corporate income tax in a revenue neutral mannert. Simple and sweet. Course that required a toast to Bobby even though he wasn't actually there. After a few moments Red Adams (lLocal Billionaire) proposed another toast to Bobby. Then John McDermott (another Billionaire) proposed another toast. If Bobby pulls this off, he's gonna have all the money he needs if he wants to jump in the 2016 race. That'll excite the racist Democrats. God Bless Bobby Jindal and his no income tax for the rich proposal.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1357874673992</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 22:24:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357875285152-196</Id><Title>Four fingers fell off a tankers hand...</Title><Msg>trying to change a tread in below 0 degree weather if wee had a tank during the Battle of the Bulge ..so we ate mir-roguns instead tough chew</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357875285152</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 22:34:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357875584739-197</Id><Topic><Title>On the Negotiation front re SPEEA</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1357869000025</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 20:50:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing could have just taken Jim Mc nerney's bonus and put it towards all the take aways they want to give speea,and they still would have came out ahead.But heck speea only designed the 787.Boeing just took #1 spot from Airbus, is giving shareholders a 10% dividend increase,and doing a 3 Billion dollar stock buy back starting next month.Speea needs to take some consessions so the company can remain competitive.Engineers add little value to the plane,so you and your families and future generations need to get on board and help the Boeing family out.</Msg><Username>seebustos</Username><Timestamp>1357875584739</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 22:39:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357876465220-198</Id><Title>What will the NRA say to Biden</Title><Msg>here's a check for another $5M sorry for the chump change E.O. says otterwise ?</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1357876465220</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 22:54:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357876775073-199</Id><Topic><Title>What Boeing can learn from SPACEX!</Title><Username>boulmichone</Username><Timestamp>1357863794510</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:23:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When SpaceX's "Dragon" capsule docked with the International Space Station last week there was a lot of interest. One angle was surprisingly underplayed: The SpaceX success is also a success for the Obama administration's space policy. Since Barack Obama took office in 2008, U.S. space policy has shifted in a surprisingly free-market direction. Despite the Obama crowd's general enthusiasm for big government, where space policy is concerned they've taken a decidedly different approach: Instead of building its own rockets as a replacement for the now-retired space shuttle, the federal government is now buying launch services from private companies that are largely free to build their own rockets and choose their own approaches. But now that it's happening under the Obama administration, some conservatives are criticizing them. This led space expert (and former congressional staffer) Jim Muncy to comment "Democrats don't think that capitalism works within the atmosphere, and Republicans apparently don't think it works above it."</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1357876775073</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 22:59:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357877097204-200</Id><Title>The Boeing 787 flaps</Title><Msg>likes a bird with wings...</Msg><Username>here_comes_old_flatop</Username><Timestamp>1357877097204</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 23:04:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357878528648-201</Id><Topic><Title>On the Negotiation front re SPEEA</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1357869000025</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 20:50:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As usual - only partly right.

And back in May 09 the Seattle times reported: OLYMPIA, Wash. — Gov. Chris Gregoire has approved a tax break for the state's troubled newspaper industry. The new law gives newspaper printers and publishers a 40 percent cut in the state's main business tax. The discounted rate mirrors breaks given in years past to the Boeing Co. and the timber industry. Newspapers across the country have resorted to layoffs and other cost-cutting moves to deal with a wounded business model and a recession-fueled drop in advertising. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer printed its final edition earlier this year and was converted to an Internet-only publication with a much-reduced staff.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1357880044980</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 23:54:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
