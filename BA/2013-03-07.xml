The 787 entered service approx 18 mos.ago, and only in very limited numbers and flown infrequently. The 777 after 18 months had many more airplanes in service, they were being flown thousands of more hours per month. Boeing is technically correct in stating that the 7787 has experienced nearly the same level of in-service problems as the 777. But, their comparison is OVER TIME since into into service , not over problems PER THOUSAND FLIGHT HOURS. If you look at the number of problems per thousand flight hours, the 787 is an unmitigated catastrophy. Never accept a Boeing statement at face value. There is ALWAYS a spin.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362632913129</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 00:08:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362644922651-2</Id><Topic><Title>Socialist Vermin Hugo Chavez Has Died</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1362540768265</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 22:32:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This has already been commented on I am sure, but ....

This move is on fumes. As soon as the definitive test announcement I mde I expect a tanking in price as this rise in sympathy with the market will then appear to be a sell the news event. The best thing about shorting this stock is if it goes up its only like 1% , it never has like a 10% up move in a day ever in its history, but the downside a 10% move down could come at any moment in seconds. Someone before mentioned it is a dangerous short because they might announce a buy back...........yeah that's what companies do, is buy at the 52 week high, lol.</Msg><Username>genesisautos</Username><Timestamp>1362663625362</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 08:40:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362664209656-10</Id><Topic><Title>You have to love ted cruz</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362244478187</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 12:14:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the alinskyite vilification of McCarthy instilled fear in others tempted to blow the whistle on the enemy within, the foil used by marxists to pour into gov't and classrooms. half a century later we got a good for nothing marxist occupying the whitehouse</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362664209656</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 08:50:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362666351429-11</Id><Topic><Title>You have to love ted cruz</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362244478187</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 12:14:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound like a blithering fool, because you are.</Msg><Username>norivit</Username><Timestamp>1362666351429</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 09:25:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362666475110-12</Id><Topic><Title>You have to love ted cruz</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362244478187</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 12:14:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, come on, really...</Msg><Username>uncle_albert_01</Username><Timestamp>1362666475110</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 09:27:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362666581777-13</Id><Topic><Title>Radical Right On The Rise</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362591928810</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 12:45:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"making up your own history again?"

(The Republican Party of Florida pointed us to this event when we asked them for evidence for Curry’s statement.) Here’s what Obama said at the meeting on Feb. 23, 2009: "Today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office," Obama said. "Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.""</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362674021971</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 11:33:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362674207672-69</Id><Title>February delivery numbers</Title><Msg>43 planes delivered. 34 737's. 2 767's. 7 777's.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362674207672</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 11:36:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362674574347-70</Id><Topic><Title>February delivery numbers</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362674207672</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 11:36:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Defense deliveries: 4 Apache (new) 4 Apache (remanufactured) 1 C-17 globemaster 5 Chinook (new) 2 Chinook (remanufactured) 1 F-15 Eagle 4 F-18's 1 Harpoon</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362674574347</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 11:42:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362674589205-71</Id><Topic><Title>ntsb report</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1362673988340</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 11:33:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I tried to get on there site but they didn't have nothing available had to read form ruters post That sucks but they should let them test this Fix.</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1362674589205</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 11:43:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362674772865-72</Id><Topic><Title>81.50!!!!</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1362670252684</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 10:30:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Be careful.

Lott Jr., assesses the presidency of Barack Obama and recalls conversations regarding gun laws they had while working at the University of Chicago. In Chapter Three, Mr. Lott discusses gun-control and takes the reader back to his time at the University of Chicago, where he and then-professor Barack Obama spoke on numerous occasions about guns in America. "I don't believe people should be able to own guns," Obama told Lott one day at the University of Chicago Law School. Lott explains that he first met Obama shortly after completing his research on concealed handgun laws and crime. "He did not come across as a moderate who wanted to bring people together," Lott writes. After he introduced himself to Obama, Lott suggested that they have lunch one day to discuss their views on guns. According to Lott, Obama "grimaced and turned away." That was the way many conversations with Obama ended, Lott says.

The NTSB's 39-page "interim factual report" provides extensive detail on the testing performed on the battery that burned on a parked jet shortly after landing at Boston's Logan International Airpoprt. But it also made clear that investigators remain a long way from understanding why it happened in the first place. Among the reports findings: a system designed to vent smoke outside the plane during a battery fire failed to function because it lacked power after the battery caught fire. The system's auxiliary power unit (APU), a gas-driven engine in the tail of the plane, also was shut off at the time, and the battery is used to start that system. "As a result, smoke generated by the APU battery could not be effectively redirected outside the cabin and aft (electrical equipment) bay," located in the fuselage behind the right wing of the 787. Boeing had said that the venting system failed because the plane was on the ground and lacked cabin pressure to use in expelling fumes from the cabin. The NTSB report marks a milestone in the agency's probe into one of two lithium-ion batteries that burned on 787 jets in January. However, the report signaled that the NTSB has signficant additional work to do in its investigation. Japanese regulators are investigating the second incident.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1362681420345</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 13:37:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362681462008-123</Id><Topic><Title>Sparty, Chrissie, n Contard</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362677501795</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 12:31:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gotta go, bump in recognition of the three stooges and the dumbo / mobro msg board jihad their equivalent, publicly financed multi ID jihad janes, exist on most heavily trafficked msg boards in case you haven't noticed dumbos have carved out a sizable advertising/propaganda budget from public monies</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1362681462008</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 13:37:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362681914677-124</Id><Topic><Title>Radical Right On The Rise</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1362591928810</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 12:45:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this is why drones are required !!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1362681914677</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 13:45:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362682592889-125</Id><Title>Radical left and radical right all controlled by Israel and Mossad.</Title><Msg>USS Liberty, never forget.

In particular: &#1048707; In 2010, Boeing reported $4.4 billion in pre-tax profits, and paid just 0.3 percent of its pre-tax income in federal income taxes. &#1048707; In 2009, Boeing reported $1.5 billion in pre-tax profits, but didn’t pay any federal income tax at all on those profits. Instead, the company claimed an outright tax rebate of $132 million. &#1048707; In 2008, the company reported $3.77 billion in pre-tax profits, and paid a paltry 1.2 percent federal income tax rate on those profits. &#1048707; Over the three-year period from 2008 to 2010, the company didn’t pay a dime of its profits in federal taxes, and actually received a rebate of $75 million.

Follow Us Like Us RSS Feed Blue-chip aerospace concern The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) ascended to a four-year high of $81.95 earlier today, attracting a crop of fresh option bulls. As of 11:20 a.m. ET, the equity had seen around 27,000 calls cross the tape -- about six times its average intraday call activity, and close to twice the number of BA puts exchanged. Garnering the most attention is the April 82.50 call, which has seen roughly 5,000 contracts change hands on open interest of just 2,001 contracts, pointing to a slew of new initiations. Plus, 83% of the calls crossed on the ask side, suggesting they were bought. By purchasing the calls to open, the buyers expect BA to muscle north of $82.50 within the next several weeks. More specifically, the calls traded at a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of $1.50, meaning the investors will begin to profit if BA conquers the $84 marker (strike price plus VWAP) -- a feat not accomplished since mid-2008. Should the equity remain south of the strike, though, the buyers' maximum risk is the initial premium paid for the calls. However, this morning's preference for bullish bets marks a change of pace in the options arena. On the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), the equity's 10-day put/call volume ratio of 0.71 ranks in the 87th percentile of its annual range, suggesting options players have bought to open BA puts over calls at a faster-than-usual clip during the past couple of weeks. Sparking today's appetite for calls were signs of regulatory headway on the horizon, with the FAA expected to soon clear flight tests for repaired models of the 787 Dreamliner.</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1362693409888</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 16:56:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362693514454-187</Id><Topic><Title>45% approve vs. 46% disapprove of Barry's job performance in latest Quinapiac Poll.</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1362682626472</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 13:57:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I and a few others on another website were just having a conversation about a hypothetical situation where this president has perhaps committed high crimes and misdemeanors against the United States through Fast and Furious and Benghazigate that could possibly bring charges of treason and a possible death sentence against this president and head of the Department of Justice for their involvement in treasonous acts against the United States which eventually caused the death of 5 americans.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1362693514454</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 16:58:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362694582358-188</Id><Title>Forbes on Boeing stock price today and for Domerrrrrr45 who is still in denial</Title><Msg>domerrrrr45, your minutia is so demeaning to you, along with abusing my name and making false claims about me, just know this, I will quit pointing out your cow pcukie about one minute after you stop, So that means I will be pointing out your crud and your Boeing hack misleading stuff forever it appears . domerrrrr45, are you ever going to stay on topic once more, with feeling , in response to your demeaning attack to me I gave it back and then pointed out your false story about Boeing stock today.

Domerrrrr45 read it get it good, “Boeing has received orders worth about $4 billion over the past few weeks for other aircraft including the 737 and the 777, AP reported, which in turn pushed up the company’s stock price. During the same time, major airlines like Jet Blue, Southwest, United Continental, and Delta have gained between 10% and 35%. Beyond the 787 blunder, shares in Boeing are up about 2.6% in 2013, having gained 5.5% over the past five trading sessions” Forbes 3-7-2013 1:32 pm You still have not responded to that article, why?

The Jan. 7 fire at Boston's Logan International Airport is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety board, which released laboratory analyses, interviews and other data it has gathered so far. It still hasn't been able to pinpoint the cause. Federal Aviation Administration officials are expected to make a decision in the next few days on whether to approve a plan by Boeing to revamp the 787's lithium ion batteries to prevent or contain future fires. Once the plan is approved, Boeing hopes to swiftly test the reconfigured batteries and get the planes back in the air. Dreamliners worldwide have been grounded since a second battery incident led to an emergency landing in Japan nine days after the Boston fire. The incidents have raised questions about the safety of using lithium ion batteries, which are more susceptible to igniting if they short-circuit or overheat than other types of batteries. The episodes also have called into question the FAA's process for certifying the safety of new aircraft designs. The Boston fire occurred aboard a Japan Airlines plane that had just landed after an overseas flight and was parked. A cleaning crew discovered smoke near a kitchen in the rear of the plane six minutes after the last of the 184 passengers walked off the plane, and one minute after the pilots left. A mechanic investigating the source of the smoke in an electronics bay found intense smoke and three-inch flames in two places on the housing covering the battery. Attempts to put out the flames with a dry chemical fire extinguisher were unsuccessful. The first firefighter to enter the plane reported seeing "a white glow about the size of a softball" through the smoke using his hand-held heat-imaging camera. He applied another type of fire extinguishing agent, which somewhat reduced the glow. An airport security camera video showed white smoke billowing from the underside of the plane. Another firefighter entering the electronics bay reported "no visibility" because of the smoke and directed another burst from a fire extinguisher at a hot spot, but the battery seemed to rekindle. A fire captain applied the extinguisher again for about five minutes, reducing the fire. But the battery was still emitting heavy smoke and hissing loudly. Liquid was flowing down its side. Lithium ion batteries contain a flammable electrolyte. Firefighters finally decided to remove the battery from the plane, but its "quick-disconnect #$%$" was melted, hampering the process. Investigators later found little balls of melted and cooled stainless steel, apparently from the cases of the battery's eight cells. That type of steel melts at 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, one document noted. The bottom of the battery box was bent from where firefighters pried it out. In all, it took an hour and forty minutes to quell the fire.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362695907501</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 17:38:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362695942132-195</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes on Boeing stock price today and for Domerrrrrr45 who is still in denial</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362694582358</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 17:16:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Waynedick......whast wrong with you?

Outsourcing the testing is called having the fox guard the hen house. I suspect the oversight was not the fault of Boeing engineers but by the the upper management more concerned about the bottom line. I wonder how they are going to fare in their Performance Management evaluation? Its it going to be "met" or "exceeded expectation"? When and how are they going to be punished? Boeing: "Gee - look at all the money we saved by outsourcing the testing and development of the 787 batteries!" And how much did you save, Boeing by outsourcing something as vital to the safety and integrity of the 787 aircraft? And how much did you lose in worldwide image as a result of the battery failures? Penny wise, pound foolish. If the powers-that-be who authorized the outsourcing received bonuses and other rewards, then they should all return their ill-gotten gains. Never happen...BAU. No heads will roll. The only plausible "fix" to this mess, is to abandon the lithium ion battery until it is deemed safe Yeah, not flying on that thing. Boeing wants to put a big box around it to contain the fire. I want no part of flying on a plane that might catch fire, no matter how large or safe the box. The 787 has taught Boeing that it cannot outsource risk and this is a company that has become risk averse while upper management watches the bonus rewards. Boeing outsourced its integrity to the McD and GE bean counters The FireBird should be abandoned, and a SAFE airplane should be designed as a replacement I would not fly on a DC-10! As passengers line up against the FireBird perhaps Boeing of Chicago will realize their mistake, And, to that point, how did risk management address this outsourced testing? Li-ion battery technology was not only new for Boeing commercial airplanes, but it was known to be dangerous (restricted by prior regulation from flights) To fail to "integration test" the battery with its safety components suggests "risk management</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362700450515</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 18:54:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362700880743-214</Id><Topic><Title>the 787 firebird a spontaneously combustable airplane and the passengers will go for a box nota fix ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1362700450515</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 18:54:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Firebird"?

Maybe he's moved on to other endeavors, or has a new nick (I wonder), or maybe he just lurks and doesn't care to respond. Anyway, after 2 full years of his challenge that his 10 stock picks would beat BA going forward, here are the ongoing results. Yeah, I know it's only 2 years and the challenge is for some long term period of time (undefined?). ---------- Base----------Today -----------3/7/11------3/7/13 BA-------70.88---------81.05---------up 14.35 percent AAPL---355.36-----430.58-----up 21.17 percent SLW-----45.02--------31.02----down 31.10 percent PCAR---48.43-------49.40--------up 2.00 percent SSN-------4.53---------0.68----down 84.99 percent (a real winner!!)

Same total of $100,000 invested in BA would have shown a gain of $14,350 over the same time for a difference of $10,479 better for Boeing after 2 full years. On to year 3. Refresher of Dell's postings on 3/7/2011: 1. "every stock I compared with Boeing will beat Boeing going forward" 2. "so when and if you can prove me wrong go for it" 3.
