Only with Obonzo as the goofy uncle he then tells you that the Methane release was your fault and it will destroy the planet. Who can take Obonzo seriously on thus issue? How can anyone who believes that global warming is dangerous, spew so much CO2 as Obonzo does? First of all scientists have calculated the carbon footprints of pets and a dog that is the size of Bo has a carbon footprint that is equal to an SUV driven 10,000 miles/year. So Obonzo is fine with having a pet that emits as much carbon as an SUV while telling you that you're evil for driving an SUV. Adding insult to injury, Obonzo has the audacity to then use aircraft to then transport his carbon emitting pet thus releasing even more Earth destroying carbon into the air. Obonzo is like a 700 pound morbidly obese glutton preaching to you that it is a sin to eat so much. lol</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1376397178510</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 08:32:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376400117121-13</Id><Topic><Title>Limbaugh: Christians ‘cannot believe in manmade global warming’</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1376350103171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-12 19:28:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooz - You Obonzo and Limbaugh are clueless about understanding climate science. Science requires a statement of falsification to be tested. Unless you can offer a better scientific method, the best way to test the theory of global warming is to test the climate models on which Obonzo is basing his assertions. This is being done and there is mounting evidence that the models are wrong. Until scientists can generate accurate climate models at the global and regional levels that greatly reduce uncertainty in distinguishing natural from man made climate contributions, Obonzo is no better than the a Mayan cultist who believed that his actions displeased the gods. Here is but one of many studies indicating that the models are wrong at a 95% level of significance. ________________________________________ 'Can climate models explain the recent stagnation in global warming?' In recent years, the increase in near-surface global annual mean temperatures has emerged as considerably smaller than many had expected. We investigate whether this can be explained by contemporary climate change scenarios. In contrast to earlier analyses for a ten-year period that indicated consistency between models and observations at the 5% confidence level, we find that the continued warming stagnation over fifteen years, from 1998 -2012, is no longer consistent with model projections even at the 2% confidence level. Of the possible causes of the inconsistency, the underestimation of internal natural climate variability on decadal time scales is a plausible candidate, but the influence of unaccounted external forcing factors or an over estimation of the model sensitivity to elevated greenhouse gas concentrations cannot be ruled out. The first cause would have little impact of the expectations of longer term anthropogenic climate change, but the second and particularly the third would.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1376400117121</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 09:21:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376400126955-14</Id><Topic><Title>Global warming is nothing but a tax money grab from acedemia.especially when you consider the facts.</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1376359009871</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-12 21:56:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And when Obama couldn't get even his democrats to pass it in congress once it was discovered to be a tax scam Obama is now trying to circumvent congress, and the constitution, and backdoor the tax through the liberal EPA.</Msg><Username>doublehaul32</Username><Timestamp>1376400126955</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 09:22:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376402931330-15</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus 346 profitable deliveries compared with Boeing profitable deliveries 322 which is better</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376371003382</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 01:16:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh shut up you dumphuc...every crate airbutt ever delivered has been illegally subsidized by the phrench-euro government</Msg><Username>jeepcreep111</Username><Timestamp>1376402931330</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 10:08:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376402959456-16</Id><Topic><Title>Global warming is nothing but a tax money grab from acedemia.especially when you consider the facts.</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1376359009871</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-12 21:56:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intelligent people have actually calculated the amount of future warming that would be offset with a carbon tax in the USA, and it is roughly 0.1 degreesC by the year 2100. Backdooring through the EPA was made significantly harder as Dems made concessions in reducing EPA powers in order to get Repubs to vote Gina McCarthy as head of the EPA. McCarrthy will have to make the calculations public under new guidelines and open up the books on all past dealings that the EPA has hidden from the public and refused to provide under FOIA requests. Another sign that Obonzo's all smoke and mirrors is that all the work Hillary did to get world commitment on reductions of Methane leaks, Ozone reduction and black carbon reduction, have fallen apart under Kerry. These were the global warming reduction measures that were the EASIEST to implement with the least economic damage so what does that tell you about the rest of the world's concern? As usual Obonzo is insincere (just look at his actions and his lack of scientific knowledge) about climate change and is pretending to care NOW because he wants to try to erase the blemish of not doing or saying squat about climate change in his first 4 years. Obonzo has done nothing to alter the BRICS growing emissions of GHGs and the reality is that he has no ability to lower GHG emissions. The USA emissions are increasingly meaningless on a global basis as the USA emits only 5.299Gt of the world's 36.0Gt CO2. If you study the data you find that the EU Kyoto countries are now increasing CO2 emissions as are the BRICS. The only country that has lowered CO2 emissions since 2010 is the USA and only an idiot would expect the USA to punish itself while the rest of the world continues to expand fossil fuel use. The rational thing for Obonzo to do if he was sincere would be to focus research on carbon capture as then he could offer the world the means of reducing their emissions.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1376402959456</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 10:09:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376403286024-17</Id><Topic><Title>Limbaugh: Christians ‘cannot believe in manmade global warming’</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1376350103171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-12 19:28:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>@ censored I present scientific information that is peer reviewed and in this case provided by IPCC scientists, that question Obonzo's assertions and you see this as being a shill for the Dems?

Other than L Ron Hubbard who nearly got runnover by a Martian train, there seem to be little evidence of steam or oil powered trains, SUV's, coal fired power plants, and other precursors to global warming such as large populations on Mars. Since we are closer to sun than Mars, I'll bet the sun has a greater than 99.999 percent effect on our weather such as climate change as compared to the hot air merchants in Congress, and the Goreacle.

We know your background in welching on bets you lose! Meanwhile, your bible-thumping philandering draft-dodging repube Rush Limpballs pandering to the low IQ right-wing dittoheads disproves all your 'scientific claims' because the Bible says the earth is only 5000 years old. Earth's Energy Budget Remained Out of Balance Despite Unusually Low Solar Activity Jan. 30, 2012 A new NASA study underscores the fact that greenhouse gases generated by human activity — not changes in solar activity — are the primary force driving global warming. The study offers an updated calculation of the Earth's energy imbalance, the difference between the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth's surface and the amount returned to space as heat. The researchers' calculations show that, despite unusually low solar activity between 2005 and 2010, the planet continued to absorb more energy than it returned to space. James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York City, led the research. Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics published the study last December. Pinpointing the magnitude of Earth's energy imbalance is fundamental to climate science because it offers a direct measure of the state of the climate. Energy imbalance calculations also serve as the foundation for projections of future climate change. If the imbalance is positive and more energy enters the system than exits, Earth grows warmer. If the imbalance is negative, the planet grows cooler. Hansen's team concluded that Earth has absorbed more than half a Watt more solar energy per square meter than it let off throughout the six year study period. The calculated value of the imbalance (0.58 Watts of excess energy per square meter) is more than twice as much as the reduction in the amount of solar energy supplied to the planet between maximum and minimum solar activity (0.25 Watts per square meter). "The fact that we still see a positive imbalance despite the prolonged solar minimum isn't a surprise given what we've learned about the climate system, but it's worth noting because this provides unequivocal evidence that the sun is not the dominant driver of global warming," Hansen said. According to calculations conducted by Hansen and his colleagues, the 0.58 Watts per square meter imbalance implies that carbon dioxide levels need to be reduced to about 350 parts per million to restore the energy budget to equilibrium. The most recent measurements show that carbon dioxide levels are currently 392 parts per million and scientists expect that concentration to continue to rise in the future.</Msg><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1376412454320</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 12:47:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376412748247-39</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing is going to the show!</Title><Username>d_proch</Username><Timestamp>1376412084986</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 12:41:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh did I forget AirBus, Not!</Msg><Username>d_proch</Username><Timestamp>1376412748247</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 12:52:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376412819215-40</Id><Topic><Title>Why do Liberals hate rodeo clowns?</Title><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1376386588484</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 05:36:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speak for yourself.</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1376412819215</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 12:53:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376413322985-41</Id><Topic><Title>PAID BASHER= WAYNE #$%$?</Title><Username>private.nguyen</Username><Timestamp>1376372590891</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 01:43:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the waynerdick is imploding along with tsla</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1376413322985</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 13:02:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376413648085-42</Id><Topic><Title>Limbaugh: Christians ‘cannot believe in manmade global warming’</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1376350103171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-12 19:28:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess that you didn't notice that you information is from January 2012 and that the study I referenced, showing Hansen's model being in error is from July 2013.

Then there was the delay of the law’s employer mandate. Then there was the announcement, buried in the Federal Register, that the administration would delay enforcement of a number of key eligibility requirements for the law’s health insurance subsidies, relying on the “honor system” instead. Now comes word that another costly provision of the health law—its caps on out-of-pocket insurance costs—will be delayed for one more year. According to the Congressional Research Service, as of November 2011, the Obama administration had missed as many as one-third of the deadlines, specified by law, under the Affordable Care Act. Here are the details on the latest one. Obamacare contains a blizzard of mandates and regulations that will make health insurance more costly. One of the most significant is its caps on out-of-pocket insurance costs, such as co-pays and deductibles. Section 2707(b) of the Public Health Service Act, as added by Obamacare, requires that “a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for the any participant or beneficiary.” Annual limits on cost-sharing are specified by Section 1302(c) of the Affordable Care Act; in addition, starting in 2014, deductibles are limited to $2,000 per year for individual plans, and $4,000 per year for family plans.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1376423794065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 15:56:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376423902032-71</Id><Title>Why the Anger?</Title><Msg>Monday, August 12, 2013 Why is the nation more bitterly divided today than it’s been in eighty years? Why is there more anger, vituperation, and political polarization now than even during Joe McCarthy’s anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s, the tempestuous struggle for civil rights in the 1960s, the divisive Vietnam war, or the Watergate scandal? If anything, you’d think this would be an era of relative calm. The Soviet Union has disappeared and the Cold War is over. The Civil Rights struggle continues, but at least we now have a black middle class and even a black President. While the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been controversial, the all-volunteer army means young Americans aren’t being dragged off to war against their will. And although politicians continue to generate scandals, the transgressions don’t threaten the integrity of our government as did Watergate. And yet, by almost every measure, Americans are angrier today. They’re more contemptuous of almost every major institution — government, business, the media. They’re more convinced the nation is on the wrong track. And they are far more polarized. Political scientists say the gap between the median Republican voter and the median Democrat is wider today on a whole host of issues than it’s been since the 1920s. Undoubedly, social media play a part — allowing people to pop off without bearing much responsibility for what they say. And most of us can cocoon within virtual or real communities whose members confirm all our biases and assumptions. Meanwhile, cable news and yell radio compete for viewers and listeners by being ever more strident. Not long ago I debated a Republican economic advisor on a cable TV program. During the brief station-break, the show’s producer told me to “be angrier.” I told her I didn’t want to be angrier. “You have to,” she said. “Viewers are surfing through hundreds of channels and will stop for a gladiator contest.” Within this cacophony, we’ve lost trusted arbiters of truth — the Edward Murrows and Walter Cronkites who could explain what was happening in ways most Americans found convincing. We’ve also lost most living memory of an era in which we were all in it together — the Great Depression and World War II — when we succeeded or failed together. In those years we were palpably dependent on one another, and understood how much we owed each other as members of the same society. But I think the deeper explanation for what has happened has economic roots. From the end of World War II through the late 1970s, the economy doubled in size — as did almost everyone’s income. Almost all Americans grew together. In fact, those in the bottom fifth of the income ladder saw their incomes more than double. Americans experienced upward mobility on a grand scale. Yet for the last three and a half decades, the middle class has been losing ground. The median wage of male workers is now lower than it was in 1980, adjusted for inflation.Yet for the last three and a half decades, the middle class has been losing ground. The median wage of male workers is now lower than it was in 1980, adjusted for inflation. In addition, all the mechanisms we’ve used over the last three decades to minimize the effects of this descent — young mothers streaming into paid work in the late 1970s and 1980s, everyone working longer hours in the 1990s, and then borrowing against the rising values of our homes — are now exhausted. And wages are still dropping — the median is now 4 percent below what it was at the start of the so-called recovery. Meanwhile, income, wealth, and power have become more concentrated at the top than they’ve been in ninety years. As a result, many have come to believe that the deck is stacked against them. Importantly, both the Tea Party and the Occupier movements began with the bailouts of Wall Street — when both groups concluded that big government and big finance had plotted against the rest of us. The former blamed government; the latter blamed Wall Street. Political scientists have also discovered a high correlation between inequality and political divisiveness. The last time America was this bitterly divided was in the 1920s, which was the last time income, wealth, and power were this concentrated. When average people feel the game is rigged, they get angry. And that anger can easily find its way into deep resentments — of the poor, of blacks, of immigrants, of unions, of the well-educated, of government. This shouldn’t be surprising. Demagogues throughout history have used anger to target scapegoats — thereby dividing and conquering, and distracting people from the real sources of their frustrations. Make no mistake: The savage inequality America is experiencing today is deeply dangerous.</Msg><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1376423902032</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 15:58:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376423908188-72</Id><Topic><Title>Progressives do not consider the facts.

Oprah Winfrey recently told the media about a day this summer when she was faced with racism in Switzerland. The Swiss sales associate, however, says Oprah allegations are all lies. Oprah traveled to Switzerland to attend Tina Turner’s wedding. In her downtime, she shopped at Trois Pommes, a boutique in the nation’s capital. Advertisement Oprah claimed the sales associate refused to show her a $35,000 crocodile leather bag because of Oprah’s skin color. Oprah claims the associate said, “No, no, that’s too expensive. Look at these [bags] here.” The associate is telling a vastly different story. “That is not true, this is absurd. I would never say something like that to a customer. Good manners and politeness are the Alpha and Omega in this business,” the sales associate said. The woman explained that when Oprah came into the store, she behaved exactly as she would with any customer. “I explained to her the bags came in different sizes and materials, like I always do,” the woman said. “It is absolutely not true that I declined to show her the bag on racist grounds. I even asked her if she wanted to look at the bag,” the woman added. RELATED: Oprah: Nobody in Their Right Mind is Gonna’ Call ME the N-word “I don’t know why she is making these accusations.

Now the horde is going to suffer from this thug and loses. $10.50 per hr job pays $144 a month on this 30k pays 244 and now this second delay. We've already seen the Obamacare administration put the breaks on the employer mandate until after the 2014 midterm elections while individuals continue to suffer with insurance loss, fewer working hours and uncertainty but now, Forbes is reporting the Obamacare cost caps will also be delayed for at least a year. First, there was the delay of Obamacare’s Medicare cuts until after the election. Then there was the delay of the law’s employer mandate. Then there was the announcement, buried in the Federal Register, that the administration would delay enforcement of a number of key eligibility requirements for the law’s health insurance subsidies, relying on the “honor system” instead. Now comes word that another costly provision of the health law—its caps on out-of-pocket insurance costs—will be delayed for one more year. Obamacare contains a blizzard of mandates and regulations that will make health insurance more costly. One of the most significant is its caps on out-of-pocket insurance costs, such as co-pays and deductibles. Section 2707(b) of the Public Health Service Act, as added by Obamacare, requires that “a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for the any participant or beneficiary.” Annual limits on cost-sharing are specified by Section 1302(c) of the Affordable Care Act; in addition, starting in 2014, deductibles are limited to $2,000 per year for individual plans, and $4,000 per year for family plans Nobody can afford it. Lets go back to Romney suggestion, very similar to Congress health care. Open completion among insurance companies. This Obambo care is a failure.</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1376442664689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 21:11:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376442786782-151</Id><Title>On the Rosa Weekend 7 day rail pass we stopped off in Copenhagen</Title><Msg>for the marriage license and promised to stay in-country for 7 days to make it official then jumped on the train to stockholm for the sweedish models convention at the Grand Hotel the future mrs. bibee-angler was already pregnanty'd for another couple of day then we angled on over to Norway and some fjord-cruising i/we ended in up in hamburg with 100's of fine aryian type gals dancing to the music in the dark about noon on sunday in bikinis but god told me to keep on going with this one needless to say she hit me with my last kroner in the form a reindeerskin instead of a taxi ride i was so stupid back then and nice in Bergen =walter white</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1376442786782</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 21:13:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376443767463-152</Id><Topic><Title>On the Rosa Weekend 7 day rail pass we stopped off in Copenhagen</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1376442786782</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 21:13:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really?? ╔╗╦╔╔╗ ║╦║╠║║ ╚╝║║╚╝ oh really, so what's my number me and the pregnant future bis_beeangler was doing the deed when the ticket taker burst into our cabin "und said" Your pre-paid Rosa-woken carten ran out about 2 hours ago,, zo... what i said halb-pfennings were flung</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1376443767463</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 21:29:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376444149512-153</Id><Topic><Title>Wouldn't it be a lot better to just pay cash for most of our healthcare and buy coverage against catastrophic loses loses</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1376441697107</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 20:54:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>paid in chickens + bushels pf corn = ? the bisbee_angler in 2016 wouldn't it be nice...</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1376444149512</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 21:35:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376444278947-154</Id><Topic><Title>Limbaugh: Christians ‘cannot believe in manmade global warming’</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1376350103171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-12 19:28:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i have never read the word "eccoside" in VN before... i wonder what that e means</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1376444278947</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 21:37:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376444386840-155</Id><Topic><Title>Limbaugh: Christians ‘cannot believe in manmade global warming’</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1376350103171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-12 19:28:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Never" is an absolute term. never say "Never" exccept in this case...</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1376444386840</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 21:39:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376444782828-156</Id><Topic><Title>why do NASCAR and rodeo fans share a lot in common</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1376422240702</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 15:30:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>me and mikey double-dare you pick your teams The specialist and I did the most ROTC exams that weekend, for no extra pay,,,luck of the draw..or about three minutes with a tongue-compressor and an ordinary pen-flashlight</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1376444782828</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 21:46:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376445108372-157</Id><Title>We promise that GLBT community going to Soschi will not be subterfuging</Title><Msg>OR ELSE! you will have to keep Snowden</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1376445108372</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 21:51:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376446765015-158</Id><Topic><Title>I will tell you under the Cone of Silence</Title><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1376440342070</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 20:32:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Verrry interesting .

"Boeing on Monday delivered a 737-800 to Iraqi Airways, the first of 30 Next-Generation 737s that the airline ordered in 2008, marking a milestone in the company's relationship with the airline. “The Next-Generation 737-800 will play a key role in helping us modernize our fleet and integrate into the regional and international commercial aviation system,” said Hadi al-Ameri, Iraq's minister of transportation. “Boeing has played a pivotal role in our growth plan, and the Next-Generation 737 has earned an excellent reputation for reliability and operational efficiency.” With the delivery, Iraqi Airways has a backlog of 39 Boeing airplanes on order, including 29 Next-Generation 737-800s and 10 787 Dreamliners. “This is a historic milestone in our relationship with Iraqi Airways and a testament to the value that the Next-Generation 737-800 will bring to the airline’s fleet,” said Marty Bentrott, Commercial Airplanes vice president for Sales in the Middle East, Russia and Central Asia. “Boeing is proud of the confidence that Iraqi Airways has in its products, and we look forward to further strengthening this relationship to fulfill the airline’s future commercial aviation needs.” By Saffana Michael " Y.T.

The high-power, solid-state laser system output reached more than 30 kilowatts – nearly 30 percent more power than RELI requirements – while simultaneously measuring excellent efficiency. A high-power, solid-state, directed energy weapon can provide pinpoint accuracy to precisely destroy or disable a target with little to no collateral damage. Directed energy weapons such as the Thin Disk Laser system will provide military customers with precision targeting for a variety of tactical missions. "These demonstrations prove the military utility of laser systems," said Michael Rinn, Boeing Directed Energy Systems vice president and program director. "In order to be truly viable as a weapons-class system, a laser must achieve high brightness while simultaneously remaining efficient at higher power. Our team has shown that we have the necessary power, the beam quality, and the efficiency to deliver such a system to the battlefield." The demonstrations were the first time the Boeing system simultaneously achieved high beam quality at high power. Combining these two factors results in a measure of brightness, and the brightness measured by the Boeing system is among the best measured to-date by anyone in the industry.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1376447860065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 22:37:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376448876362-161</Id><Topic><Title>Forrest fires - let them burn or put them out</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1376431048128</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 17:57:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some poor soul assumes goonishly and jackassingly that there is a strong correlation between fire status and ownership.
