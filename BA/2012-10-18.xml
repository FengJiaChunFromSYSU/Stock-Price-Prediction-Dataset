He just has no idea what to do about it, since it is the result of his positions on abortion, contraception, health services and many other issues. On Tuesday night, he bumbled his way through a cringe-inducing attempt to graft what he thinks should be 2012 talking points onto his 1952 sensibility. In the midst of their rancorous encounter at Hofstra University, President Obama attacked Mr. Romney for vowing he would end federal support of Planned Parenthood and for criticizing the provision in the health care law that requires employers — except churches and religiously affiliated institutions — to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives. Clearly agitated, Mr. Romney said in response, “I’d just note that I don’t believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don’t believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.” Perhaps Mr. Romney forgot that he vetoed a bill as Massachusetts governor in 2005 that would have given women who were raped access to emergency contraception, or that he supported an amendment this year that would have allowed any business to opt out of the contraceptive mandate, or that he has said he would support a state constitutional amendment that would declare that life begins at conception — potentially making some kinds of contraceptives illegal. Perhaps Mr. Romney was trying to say that the issue is who pays for contraceptives, not whether women can use them. But all those possibilities are just reminders of how hard it must be for him to remember where he stands at any given moment. In any case, you cannot untangle access and money. Mr. Romney’s stated zeal to “defund” Planned Parenthood is either a rote ideological posture or a belief that it is right to end the federal support that gives many poor women access to mammograms, cervical cancer screening, family planning and other services. As Mr. Obama said: “That’s a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country. And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.” Having fumbled that one, Mr. Romney made things worse when he tried to talk about equal opportunity for women, which was made much harder by his opposition to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. He told a strange tale of his early days as governor of Massachusetts when he “had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.” He said he went to his staff about it and was told that “these are the people that have the qualifications.” So far, not so terribly bad. But then he started a slow, painful slide into one of the most bizarre comments on this issue we’ve ever heard, which became an instant Internet sensation. “We took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet,” Mr. Romney said, sounding as if that were a herculean task. An appeal to women’s groups, he said, “brought us whole binders full of women.” This was important, he said, because “I recognized that if you’re going to have women in the work force that sometimes they need to be more flexible. My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.” At this point we could practically hear his political consultants yelling “Stop!” But Mr. Romney did not. “She said, I can’t be here until 7 or 8 o’clock at night. I need to be able to get home at 5 o’clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.” Flexibility is a good policy. But what if a woman had wanted to go home to study Spanish? Or rebuild an old car? Or spend time with her lesbian partner? Would Mr. Romney have been flexible about that? Or if a man wanted similar treatment? True equality is not satisfied by allowing the little lady to go home early and tend to her children. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NYT October 17, 2012</Msg><Username>corned_beef_dude</Username><Timestamp>1350551484939</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 05:11:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350554976851-13</Id><Title>Dems need to cheat during debates.....</Title><Msg>They get more time and also have biased moderators.

They aren’t permitted to ask each other questions, propose pledges to each other, or walk outside a “predesignated area.” And for the town-hall-style debate tomorrow night, the audience members posing questions aren’t allowed to ask follow-ups (their mics will be cut off as soon as they get their questions out). Nor will moderator Candy Crowley. Glenn Greenwald notes: The moderators were selected to ensure that nothing unexpected is asked and that only the most staid and establishment views are heard. As journalism professor Jay Rosen put it when the names of the moderators were unveiled, using terms to describe those views that are acceptable in Washington media circles and those which are “fringe”: “In order to be considered as a candidate for moderator you have to be soaked in the sphere of consensus, likely to stay within the predictable inner rings of the sphere of legitimate controversy, and unlikely in the extreme to select any questions from the sphere of deviance.” Here then, within this one process of structuring the presidential debates, we have every active ingredient that typically defines, and degrades, US democracy. The two parties collude in secret. The have the same interests and goals. Everything is done to ensure that the political process is completely scripted and devoid of any spontaneity or reality. All views that reside outside the narrow confines of the two parties are rigidly excluded. Anyone who might challenge or subvert the two-party duopoly is rendered invisible. Lobbyists who enrich themselves by peddling their influence run everything behind the scenes. Corporations pay for the process, which they exploit and is then run to bolster rather than threaten their interests. The media’s role is to keep the discourse as restrictive and unthreatening as possible while peddling the delusion that it’s all vibrant and free and independent and unrestrained. And it all ends up distorting political realities far more than illuminating them while wildly exaggerating the choices available to citizens and concealing the similarities between the two parties. To understand the US political process, one can just look to how these sham debates are organized and how they function. This is the same process that repeats itself endlessly in virtually every other political realm. Indeed, the Republican and Democratic parties have long formed Gentlemen’s agreements – through the “Presidential Debate Commission” – on what topics are “off-limits” (and which journalists can even ask questions) during presidential debates:</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1350560776953</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 07:46:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350562511781-22</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe bulky-blob, imacon, tedlovesmax etc. would like to join The Marines</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1350512433255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:20:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Maybe Obama can join the Marines" He would have to show a real Birth Certificate</Msg><Username>slingensam</Username><Timestamp>1350562511781</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 08:15:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350562956865-23</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe bulky-blob, imacon, tedlovesmax etc. would like to join The Marines</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1350512433255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:20:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ahkmed, err spart, claims to have served, if truthful (a big if), i think he's confusing served with burdened.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1350562956865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 08:22:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350563530481-24</Id><Title>Racical issues at Charleson plant is send it to the unions.</Title><Msg>Due to racial issues the plant is going union.

The increase represents a rebound from the previous week's sharp drop. Both swings were largely due to technical factors. Last week, California reported a large drop in applications, pushing down the overall figure to the lowest since February 2008. This week, it reported a significant increase as it processed applications delayed from the previous week. Applications are a proxy for layoffs. When they decline, it suggests hiring is improving. The prior week's figure was revised up to show 3,000 more applications than previously reported to 342,000...The economy is not growing fast enough to generate much hiring. Growth slowed to a tepid annual rate of 1.3 percent in the April-June quarter, down from 2 percent in the previous quarter. Most economists see growth staying at or below 2 percent in the second half of the year.</Msg><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1350569650200</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:14:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350570182352-42</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt the Jerk: a Woman’s View of the Debate</Title><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1350490767908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:19:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mitt is the Jerk !!!!</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350570182352</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:23:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350570297115-43</Id><Title>Women Who Worked for Romney: Faux Binder Controversy Ridiculous</Title><Msg>Women who worked under Mitt Romney when he was Governor of Massachusetts are speaking out against the latest "binders full of women" faux controversy. As Romney said during the presidential debate Tuesday night, he had more women in high power positions during his time as governor than any other governor in the country, yet liberals are desperately trying to continue their pathetic "war on women" meme. “He totally gets working women, especially working women like myself who had two young kids,” Ellen Roy Herzfelder, a former state secretary of environmental affairs, says in the 30-second ad. Kerry Healey, Romney’s former lieutenant governor, said 10 of the 20 top positions in the administration were filled by women -- more than any other state in the nation. “Mitt Romney had a commitment to making sure women were properly represented in his administration,” Healey, now a Romney campaign adviser, told Fox News.

I am not sure that this rings true. In the case of the Libyan embassy, the mother of Sean Smith (a State Department "Information" Officer) said that her son was on the scene to destroy the paperwork and other classified material. She said that her son was killed first. Of course, there were no marines, but the two of those that died were former Seals. The news is ambiguous as to their status but they were probably "contract" employees as a security detachment (as late as 2011, one of them, Tyrone Woods, owned and operated a bar). It would be the State or CIA employees that have the responsibility to destroy classified material. The marines would certainly take up positions to protect personnel as their primary duties before they would concern themselves with sensitive material - as the former is the essence of their training.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1350572986284</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:09:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350573016935-57</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing compared to BAC year to date loser by 70% to zero</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1350531172159</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:32:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey thumbs down guys BAC up 1% today JRCC up 12% today take those thumbs and put them where the sun does not shine eh!</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1350573016935</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:10:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350573197277-58</Id><Topic><Title>SPEEA lays groundwork for "federally protected" strike</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1350572555467</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:02:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so au. kingfishy smeller guy, as I have posted for two weeks now , and it continues jrcc is up another 12% today you need your mommies skirt loser boy , eh so remember where you heard it and go eat some dead fish</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1350573197277</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:13:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350574088375-59</Id><Topic><Title>What's the deal?</Title><Username>au.kingfish</Username><Timestamp>1265851801000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2010-02-10 20:30:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>au.kingfish you need a three year hiatus get lost</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1350574088375</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:28:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350574218489-60</Id><Topic><Title>SPEEA lays groundwork for "federally protected" strike</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1350572555467</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:02:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing and SPEEA should negotiate there own deal amoungst themselves.

The record is set straight here. (I hope the good folks at Think Progress do not mind me quoting Zack Beauchamp's article in full): During the past several weeks of campaigning, Mitt Romney has argued that President Obama’s supposed failure to label the killing of Benghazi “terrorism” for two weeks was evidence that he had failed to lead on the issue. After Candy Crowley debunked Romney’s claim during the Tuesday debate, the right doubled down on Romney’s argument, suggesting Obama only used the term “act of terror” generally despite clear references to Benghazi on September 12 and 13. Setting aside the dubious propriety of this semantic standard for leadership, it turns out Romney himself has failed on these terms: Obama managed to label the attacks terrorism twice in the two days following the attacks before Romney used the term once. The first unmistakable reference to terrorism from the Romney campaign came on September 20, after top counterterrorism officials had publicly described the attacks as terrorism. The first clear statement from Romney himself was on September 25, when he told Fox News that the Benghazi attack was “an act of terror. … But the White House doesn't want to admit it.” Here is a timeline of the relevant events, starting the day after the September 11th attack: SEPTEMBER 12: Romney gives a press conference to clarify his initial press release accusing Obama of sympathizing with the attackers.The full transcript of the event shows that he never used the words “terror,” “terrorism,” or “al-Qaeda.” That was Romney’s first statement on the event since the initial release the night before. Roughly 30 minutes afterwards, Obama used the phrase “acts of terror” to describe Benghazi in his Rose Garden remarks. SEPTEMBER 13: The President used the same phrase to describe the attacks at a September 13 at a campaign event. Romney also addressed the tragedy in Libya at a campaign event, but the on-site reporting (the campaign does not appear to have provided a transcript) does not mention him referring to the attacks as terrorism and, moreover, suggests that Romney did not directly challenge the administration’s approach (semantic or otherwise) to the events. SEPTEMBER 19: Matt Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, says “[Americans] were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy.” SEPTEMBER 20: Romney spokesperson Ryan Williams says “Governor Romney believes our immediate priority in Libya is to track down and bring to justice those terrorists who brutally murdered our diplomats. The attack is a clear reminder that terrorists, particularly those linked to Al Qaeda, remain a grave threat and one that is growing in North Africa.” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said “It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack.” SEPTEMBER 25: Romney tells Fox that “That’s an act of terror. But the White House doesn’t want to admit it.” You see, folks, Romney isn't just flat out lying; HE'S THE ONE WHO FAILED AS A LEADER--NOT BARACK OBAMA! Oh... and just a reminder. This is Willard smirking right after he had issued his vile statement saying the Obama administration was in sympathy with the attackers. You know...the one Willard gave BEFORE ALL THE FAMILIES OF THOSE KILLED IN THE ATTACK HAD EVEN BEEN NOTIFIED:</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1350575094327</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:44:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350575518892-64</Id><Title>WOW!

But there should be a nice improvement in the balance sheet now that a number of delivered 787's are no longer work in progress. Since the contract with the Engineers is not completed, it is unlikely that there will be any huge jumps in earnings. Once that labor issue is not on the horizon, things can move forward. The increase in production rates of 737 and 787 will help lower the cost to build each plane but will be partially offset by an increase in capital expenditure to set up the additional equipment to allow those increases. They have spent cash for those improvements, some of which they cant bring to the financial statements but will have to spread those over time via depreciation. Given that the labor issues get resolved this quarter, next quater earnings should be good or great depending on who wins the white house and the senate.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1350579378254</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 12:56:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350579924350-70</Id><Topic><Title>WOW!

The steady rise in welfare spending, which covers more than 80 programs primarily designed to help low-income Americans, got a big boost from the 2009 stimulus and has grown, albeit somewhat more slowly, in 2010 and 2011. One reason is that more people are qualifying in the weak economy, but the federal government also has broadened eligibility so that more people qualify for programs. Sen. Jeff Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, who requested the Congressional Research Service report, said it underscores a fundamental shift in welfare, moving away from a Band-Aid and toward a more permanent crutch. “No longer should we measure compassion by how much money the government spends but by how many people we help to rise out of poverty,” the Alabama conservative said. “Welfare assistance should be seen as temporary whenever possible and the goal must be to help more of our fellow citizens attain gainful employment and financial independence.” Overall, welfare spending as measured by obligations has grown from $563 billion in fiscal 2008 to $746 billion in fiscal 2011, or a jump of 32 p Follow us: @washtimes on Twitter</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350585718230</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:41:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350586057744-80</Id><Title>Surprise, Surprise, Surprise...

The increase represents a rebound from the previous week's sharp drop. Both swings were largely due to technical factors. The Labor Department says the four-week average of applications, a less volatile measure, fell slightly to 365,500, a level consistent with modest hiring. Last week, California reported a large drop in applications, pushing down the overall figure to the lowest since February 2008. This week, it reported a significant increase as it processed applications delayed from the previous week. (Read More: Why Jobless Claims May Not Be as Good as Market Thinks.) A department spokesman says the seasonally adjusted numbers "are being distorted ... by an issue of timing." Many economists believe a reading below 400,000 points to an improving labor market.

Thanks, Obama.</Title><Msg>Violent crime jumps 18 percent in 2011, first rise in nearly 20 years Published October 18, 2012 Associated Press WASHINGTON – Violent crimes unexpectedly jumped 18 percent last year, the first rise in nearly 20 years, and property crimes rose for first time in a decade. But academic experts said the new government data fall short of signaling a reversal of the long decline in crime. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported Wednesday that the increase in the number of violent crimes was the result of an upward swing in simple assaults, which rose 22 percent, from 4 million in 2010 to 5 million last year. The incidence of rape, sexual assault and robbery remained largely unchanged, as did serious violent crime involving weapons or injury. Property crimes were up 11 percent in 2011, from 15.4 million in 2010 to 17 million, according to the bureau's annual national crime victimization survey. Household burglaries rose 14 percent, from 3.2 million to 3.6 million. The number of thefts jumped by 10 percent, from 11.6 million to 12.8 million. The statistics bureau said the percentage increases last year were so large primarily because the 2011 crime totals were compared to historically low levels of crime in 2010. Violent crime has fallen by 65 percent since 1993, from 16.8 million to 5.8 million last year. "2011 may be worse than 2010, but it was also the second-best in recent history," said Northeastern University criminology professor James Alan Fox. "These simple assaults are so low-level in severity that they are not even included in the FBI counts of serious crime," Fox said. FBI crime data only counts aggravated assaults. The growth in violent crime experienced by whites, Hispanics, younger people and men accounted for the majority of the increase. Chris Melde, an assistant professor at Michigan State University's school of criminal justice, said: "you can have percentage changes that seem quite large but unless you put them in a longer-term perspective you can sometimes misinterpret the overall seriousness of the problem. I would caution against forecasting future crime trends based on a one-year fluctuation." A retired police chief says the growing number of assaults last year may reflect a need by law enforcement to spend more time and attention on what's happening in the nation's schools</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350586391227</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:53:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350586668100-83</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe bulky-blob, imacon, tedlovesmax etc. would like to join The Marines</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1350512433255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:20:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like you said there were no Marines at the 'Consulate' and most likely no/little classified data is kept at a 'Consulate'.

American Crossroads, taking exception to Obama’s announcement last night that he really had declared Benghazi to be an act of terrorism, has sent out a memo, which reads: The President clearly misled the American people with this claim, because if Obama’s Rose Garden speech was indeed the White House position, it did not inform any subsequent statement by the White House press office — and was even directly contradicted by his own spokesman several days later. On September 20 — eight days after Obama claims to have called the Benghazi attack an “act of terror” — Jay Carney affirmed to reporters that the White House had never called it “a terrorist attack.” From the gaggle on Air Force One, en route to Miami, 9/20/2012: Q: Can you — have you called it a terrorist attack before? Have you said that? MR. CARNEY: I haven’t, but — I mean, people attacked our embassy. It’s an act of terror by definition. Q: Yes, I just hadn’t heard you — MR. CARNEY: It doesn’t have to do with what date it occurred. Q: No, I just hadn’t heard the White House say that this was an act of terrorism or a terrorist attack. And I just — MR. CARNEY: I don’t think the fact that we hadn’t is not — as our NCTC Director testified yesterday, a number of different elements appear to have been involved in the attack, including individuals connected to militant groups that are prevalent in eastern Libya, particularly in the Benghazi area. We are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to al Qaeda or al Qaeda’s affiliates, in particular al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Here, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney actually affirmed Gov. Romney’s position that the White House did not call the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism. Carney also said the now infamous video “precipitated some of the unrest in Benghazi” the day before. The memo goes on to argue that Obama’s position on Libya is “untenable.” That’s about the shape of things. Did he call it an act of terror and go around misleading the country for two weeks that it was a spontaneous reaction to the anti-Muslim movie? Or did he not call it terror on Sept. 12 and lie to the voters last night? There is another problem with Obama’s response. Recall this part of his answer: “So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi Consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team, and I gave them three instructions. Number one, beef up our security and — and — and procedures not just in Libya but every embassy and consulate in the region. Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure that folks are held accountable and it doesn’t happen again. And number three, we are going to find out who did this, and we are going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I’ve said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them” So there was no actual meeting of the National Security Council at which everyone could share information and get on the same page? (David Axelrod has refused to say.) It doesn’t sound like it. But you know Obama was busy that day — flying to Las Vegas for a campaign event. So really, why have a meeting? Well, the weeks of confusion and dissembling that followed should answer that. Moreover, if he actually did instruct his team to heighten protection for the Libya Consulate, why was the consulate left unsecured so that CNN could waltz in to grab Ambassador Chris Stevens’s diary? Did Obama not make himself clear, or were his instructions not followed? The more we learn the more we see how both dishonest and incompetent has been the handling of this entire incident. The Obama White House may be out spinning the press to buy into the Obama-Crowley line, but no one is buying it. As the rest of the information comes to light, the president retains less and less credibility. Like a fish on a line he flops this way and that, trying to break free of his self-created trap. And finally, this Reuters report suggests the administration was entirely unprepared for the 9-11 attacks.: In the months before the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, U.S. and allied intelligence agencies warned the White House and State Department repeatedly that the region was becoming an increasingly dangerous vortex for jihadist groups loosely linked or sympathetic to al Qaeda, according to U.S. officials. Despite those warnings, and bold public displays by Islamist militants around Benghazi, embassies in the region were advised to project a sense of calm and normalcy in the run-up to the anniversary of the September 11 attacks in the United States. In short, it appears that the Obama administration didn’t take 9-11 all that seriously, and when tragedy hit, it went into spin mode. Now the president is caught in a tangle of contradictions. Not even Candy Crowley can get him out.</Msg><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1350586912117</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:01:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350587038451-86</Id><Title>Does Anyone Know Who has the Fork?.......</Title><Msg>.....that's going to be stuck in the Obama campaign......it's ready.</Msg><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1350587038451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:03:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350587340878-87</Id><Title>CNN Orders Staff Members to Support Candy's Biased Debate Debacle!</Title><Msg>CNN puts out talking points to staff defending 'superb' debate moderator Candy Crowley and her Benghazi 'point of fact' By TOBY HARNDEN IN WASHINGTON PUBLISHED: 22:06 EST, 17 October 2012 | UPDATED: 08:00 EST, 18 October 2012 Comments (0) Share CNN has sent out talking points to its staff, directing them to say that Candy Crowley was merely 'stating a point of fact' about the Libya 'terror' row and insisting that Barack Obama only got more time than Mitt Romney because he speaks slowly. In an email to all CNN staff, the network's managing editor Mark Whitaker congratulated his anchoron her role as moderator and washing over the controversy over her effectively siding with Obama over Romney on a question concerning the U.S. Consulate attack in Libya last month. Whitaker wrote: 'Let's start with a big round of applause for Candy Crowley for a superb job under the most difficult circumstances imaginable.' Show of support: Moderator Candy Crowley had the backing of CNN despite what her critics said According to the internal email, obtained by TMZ, Whitaker continued: 'The reviews on Candy's performance have been overwhelmingly positive but Romney supporters are going after her on two points, no doubt because their man did not have as good a night as he had in Denver.' The moderator's dramatic intervention, in which she cut Romney short when he claimed that Obama had failed to say the attack was the work of terrorists in the his Rose Garden statement the following day, has been met with outrage.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350587340878</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:09:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350587427078-88</Id><Topic><Title>America is safer today</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350586229199</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:50:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey buttlicker i see your fat butt sitting at the computer feeling unsafe... come to me and i'll defend you from the big bad liberals</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350587427078</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:10:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350587483437-89</Id><Title>Obama DOES Have Investments In Cayman Islands Trust...</Title><Msg>Romney says Obama also has investments in Chinese companies and through a Cayman Islands trust. One of the many tense moments in the second presidential debate turned on a new topic in the race: President Barack Obama’s pension account. Here’s how it came up: Early in the face-off, Obama scoffed at Mitt Romney’s pledge to crack down on unfair trading practices by China, saying Romney is currently invested in companies "that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks." Romney later explained that, yes, he understands that his blind trust has invested in foreign firms, including companies in China. Then he confronted Obama. Romney: "Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? Have you looked at your pension?" Obama: "You know, I don’t look at my pension. It’s not as big as yours so it doesn’t take as long. I don’t check it that often." Romney: "Let me give you some advice. Look at your pension. You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Caymans trust."</Msg><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1350587483437</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:11:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350590024577-90</Id><Title>TADF NEWS,BIG SUPPORT.TADF 2000% GAINS POSSIBLE ON ACQUISITIONS ANNOUNCED.

Now ome of the pumsp are making liar statements about the earnings going to help Boeing wow here is the truth about the upcoming earnings "is all set to report its third quarter 2012 results before the start of trading on October 24, 2012. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2012 is $1.12 (year-over-year decrease of 23.1%) Wow how is a 23.1% loss going to help Boeing share stock price? Next the Company Executives too their ability to fire and replace all the SPEEA workers when they harassed the SPEEA workers by filming them on a lunch hour rally, go figure the same managers who gave the shareholders the "cheap outsourcing" 787 30 billion over budget and 4 year late. Now these same executive like James McNerney who is on the list of employee's who made more than the company paid in taxes is now going to have to come to terms with the SPEEA union, he could have fired all of them but no he told his minions to harass the workers with video harassment. So the union would have been fired this time except for Boeing management or it should be Miss Managment the failing ship of fools in Chicago sunk themselves as usual and par for the coarse au.kingfish to answer your question all Boeing had to do is not harass the workers and they could have fired all of them but now it is not a economic strike so too bad for the people who gave the shareholders the cheap creamliner outsourced 787 failure they did it to the shareholder</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1350591801986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:23:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350593198776-94</Id><Topic><Title>America is safer today</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1350586229199</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:50:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stick it Little man....</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1350593198776</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:46:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350594162769-95</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Takes First Lead in the Electoral College...
