Now you and some stupid reporter want to call a 1.3% reduction hollowing out...oh the humanity, You may also want to factor in businesses going out of business due to obamas anti business policies, there is less for OSHA to police. If the plant blew due to some safety violation by the business it is also due to the ineptitude of government not a whooping 1.3% reduction in budget. And another news flash - Since 2006 the libs have been driving the boat, so if OSHA is suffering with only 1/2 a billion &amp; change dollars you might want to talk to Nancy, Harry and the pimp in the WH.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1367900346683</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 00:19:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367901753091-2</Id><Topic><Title>The Cancer of Unregulated Capitalism</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1367887383001</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 20:43:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hooz, The violin concerto that you are playing is breath taking. On your first point ("Attacking the Hungry"): "The uncontrolled growth of investment wealth is diverting resources away from vital programs, effectively smothering them." (totally speculative assumption) "The average Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipient received about $1,500 for food for the entire year." (and they should be very, extremely thankful. Are they?) "At least ten Americans each made that much in under ten seconds from their investment gains in 2012, about the time it took each one to fluff his pillow and roll over in bed." (while the vast majority of SNAP recipients likely fail to get out of bed until lunch time, but that is my own speculative assumption) "Under capitalism, fortunes accrue to a few while 47 million Americans, or one out of seven, need foodassistance. Almost half of the hungry are children. For every food bank we had in 1980, we now have 200." (get a job, pay your own way, provide for the children that you decided to have; as you can imagine I am straining to not cite a Bible verse, but for Genna's sake I hold back ...) "Yet just 20 people made more from their investment income in one year than the entire 2011 food assistance budget. That's $73 billion, taxed at the capital gains rate. Meanwhile, President Obama couldn't get the $1 billion per year he needed to improve childhood nutrition in schools." (OK, I get the distortion issue, but it really did not occur until we moved manufacturing jobs overseas. Fix that first. Let me make this clear: industry and business, with the right incentives, should fix that, not the government.) "Most recently, the House proposed a farm bill that would cut another $2 billion a year from the food stamps account." (get a job and feed yourself, once again ....)

By the way, do your own research on which Democrats voted for the resolution - not a pretty picture for the liberal purist. It was 29 of 50 Dems in the Senate that voted FOR invasion and 82 out of 208 Dems in the House also voted yes. Hopefully, you are able to handle the truth. The Dems, if they had been so inclined, were completely in control of saying no, having a majority in the Senate. Place the blame where it belongs. They were equally to blame. They were complicit.

If you must know, I am in favor of drones - only that they be used in a judicious and sparing manner. The facts are these: 1) Obama ramped up their use by a factor of 10 in terms of missions and kills over Bush (Obama's kill is almost 2800) and 2) Obama expanded their use from two countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan) to six (add Yemen, Somalia, Mali, and Libya). So the question is this: are we winning or losing? If lots of kills is the determinant factor, then we are, by definition, winning. If stopping al Qaeda is the measure of success, then we are obviously losing, as Bengahzi and Syria have demonstrated.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1367937057058</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:30:57

I am sure that this is not lost on you or anybody. We are in a quagmire with Islamic extremism. If we consider WW2, it was a war in which we utterly decimated the enemy, beating the armies and the peoples into subjection. Once they were truly defeated, we were able to remold them into great nations and great allies. This so-called "precision" method of drone warring is not winning anything, but instead is creating seething hatred for the United States - across the world. We had the high road when we first invaded Afghanistan, then we "lost our way" starting in Iraq. The first war with Iraq in 1991 was also the high road, taking the folks and leadership of Iraq to a position of subjection. However, these "surgical" wars are simply not working because they are not the "high road" and do not utterly destroy the leaders and people that are causing the problems. We are not creating the object lessons through drones that are necessary to get the results that we want - long lasting good behavior. Instead of trying to police the world, we should simply let people do to themselves and others what they desire - however the blackness in their hearts lead them. Now, should they cross over into our territory or those of our allies, then pounce on them without mercy. That results in a long lasting object lesson that is not lost on anyone.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1367943837074</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 12:23:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367943891020-56</Id><Topic><Title>Winning the War against M uslim Made Disasters</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367938778423</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:59:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nope, i'm not talking about their useful idiots, i'm talking bout the head of the snake(s)...hit Ahmadinejad and the Grand Ayatollah same as we assassinate their foot soldiers, hit those who are most powerful, those who use and preach terror as a means to end. i expect word would get passed to knock if off pretty quicky, if their own names neared top of the hit list. could even kick it up a notch using methods employed by gen black jack pershing</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1367943891020</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 12:24:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367944043254-57</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary, Hillary Wherefore art thou Hillary?</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1367863285805</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 14:01:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>x6xxx has already shown us how any fool can pull a line from Shakespeare, whether or not he has any grasp of what it means.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1367944043254</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 12:27:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367944135172-58</Id><Topic><Title>Come On Boeing one step back THREE steps forward$$</Title><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1367938071787</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:47:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>going back 10 years one can see how Airbus has outperformed Boeing 10 to 1 Boeing management the biggest problem. 787 mitakes pending likely to be more, just keept those pension checks coming stupid company.

Two of the b most powerful liberals that have gained power telling folks they are more compassionate towards the downtrodden than the GOP, and we see that they cared less about the folks that were murdered because of their lack of concern.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1367946429540</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:07:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367947372504-66</Id><Topic><Title>New High $94.04!!!!</Title><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1367946086733</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:01:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Make that 95.04.

The FBI said "the lives of several local residents were potentially saved" with the arrest of Buford Rogers, 24, who made his first appearance Monday in U.S. District Court in St. Paul on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Rogers, of Montevideo, was arrested Friday after authorities searched a mobile home he's associated with and found Molotov cocktails, suspected pipe bombs and firearms, according to a court affidavit. "The FBI believed there was a terror attack in its planning stages, and we believe there would have been a localized terror attack, and that's why law enforcement moved quickly to execute the search warrant on Friday to arrest Mr. Rogers," FBI spokesman Kyle Loven said Monday. He said the investigation is ongoing, and agents are looking at the case as one of domestic terrorism.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1367952301272</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 14:45:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367952638172-79</Id><Title>Praying for a Benghazi Cover Up</Title><Msg>John Bolton saying on Neil Cavuto's Fox News program...

Repugnantcons are quick to tell us no thousand foreigners are worth ONE American (They last said that with the Libyan support operation) -- but they change their tune fast when they see a political advantage like making Obama look soft.
