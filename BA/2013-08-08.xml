Almost as important as the constitutional violations is that revelations of a gun-running operation would put the lie to the Obama administration’s reports on Benghazi. A petulant December 2012 report by the U.S. State Department’s Accountability Review Board (under then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton) investigating Benghazi put all the blame on Congress for the deaths: “One overall conclusion in this report is that Congress must do its part to meet this challenge and provide necessary resources to the State Department to address security risks and meet mission imperatives.” The report also concluded that “the Board did not find that any individual U.S. Government employee engaged in misconduct or willfully ignored his or her responsibilities, and, therefore did not find reasonable cause to believe that an individual breached his or her duty so as to be the subject of a recommendation for disciplinary action.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1375940683958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 01:44:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375940781639-11</Id><Topic><Title>I saw a movie once where only the police and military had guns.</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1375908734506</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 16:52:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It didn't work out too well for 6 million other people though !</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1375940781639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 01:46:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375942589931-12</Id><Topic><Title>Which stock is better?

"Starting in the first quarter 2014, we expect to take delivery of our first of 37 Boeing 787 aircraft, comprised of 15 787-8s and 22 787-9s," Rousseau tells analysts. "We're excited about the international growth opportunities in front of us and the industry-leading unit cost that this aircraft provides." Rousseau adds that the carrier will now expect six 787 aircraft deliveries in 2014 instead of seven as previously indicated. One aircraft delivery has been moved from December 2014 to January 2015. It is unclear whether Air Canada has converted part of its 787-8 orders to the 22 787-9 variants. The airline declines to elaborate further on this detail. Boeing's orders and deliveries table now shows that Air Canada has ordered 37 787-8s. Air Canada is also planning to receive four additional high-density Boeing 777-300ER aircraft in August, November and December of 2013, with the last aircraft delivery planned for February 2014. The airline received its first of the 458-seat aircraft in the second quarter. "These new Boeing 777s arriving over the next several months will overlap with the delivery of the first of our 37 Boeing 787 deliveries," says Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada's chief executive officer during his opening remarks on the earnings call.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1375970612773</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 10:03:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375970864530-32</Id><Topic><Title>How Low Will the U.S. Sink Before Obama is Through?</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1375881057293</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 09:10:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WSJ identified the FEC was in on the Obama scandal.

A response I get, "well they all do that". No they don't. Obama will be remembered for generations, the next two generations will be burdened with this debt. Even Bernanke said Obama's policies do not support a recovery, but who was listening. Job creation has never been a top priority, now he is talking about supporting the Middle Class, but if the policies do not support a recovery. Americans stand mesmerized by his empty speeches. Now the price of Obamacare is coming to light....more expensive as small business maneuver around it.

"Haven't you heard about Medi-Share?" a pitchwoman asks a friend complaining about insurance costs in a commercial for the plan. "It isn't insurance; it's a nationwide network of Christians who save money by sharing each other's medical bills. We get to pick our own doctors, and our share is almost 40 percent less than our old premium. ... Medi-Share is a health-sharing ministry, which makes it exempt from the health reform laws." It's gotten little attention, but it's true: The individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act requires all Americans to have health insurance or face penalties, but members of medical-sharing ministries are exempt from the individual mandate that will be enforced beginning in 2015. Here's how it works: To join Medi-Share, members must pledge their Christian faith and promise not to drink, take drugs or have sex outside of a traditional marriage. A reference from a minister may also be requested. Certain pre-existing conditions render applicants ineligible, while chronic issues such as obesity sometimes lead to acceptance into the program contingent on undergoing wellness counseling. The coverage doesn't include products of "un-Biblical lifestyles," such as contraception or substance rehab, or some preventive medicine, including colonoscopies and annual mammograms. Those policies lead to lower costs for all members, Meggs said. (Read more: Obamacare's big win on health-care exchanges ) When you have a medical bill, you submit it to the organization. If it meets the eligibility requirements and your annual medical expenses have exceeded the threshold in the plan you signed up for, the bill is "shared"-that is, covered. If your submission is rejected, you have the right to file an appeal. A randomly selected jury of seven of your Medi-Share peers will consider the facts of the case and determine whether to cover the expense. Sound good? The catch comes in the disclosure at the bottom of the website. "Medi-Share is not insurance. It is a not-for-profit ministry and is not guaranteed in any way. Medi-Share is exempt from regulation." Members of Medi-Share who forgo health insurance send in hundreds of dollars each month in exchange for no guarantee of anything and a service that isn't subject to regulation. Some experts aren't fans. "The whole goal of health-care reform is to ensure that people are protected against risk and illness, and this violates that fundamental goal," said John Gruber, an MIT economics professor and the director of the health care program at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He also served as a technical consultant to the Obama administration on the Affordable Care Act. "One big set of issues is that they're not regulated for solvency," said I. Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School and co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics. "They can go bankrupt. If it gets too many claims and they can't pay them, [it's] 'too bad, so sad.'

And what can she be, if we reclaim a vision for the things that made her great in the first place? Now Dr. Ben Carson reveals his vision for retaking America in his New York Times best-seller America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great. In America the Beautiful, Dr. Carson offers Americans a stark alternative to the vision President Barack Obama has put forth. Dr. Carson argues that we must learn from our past in order to chart a better course for our future. Carson uses his own American success story — detailing his ascent from inner-city poverty to international medical and humanitarian acclaim — as the launching point for a journey of rediscovery of the fundamental truths and principles that made America such a great nation. Written by a man who has experienced America's best and worst firsthand, America the Beautiful is at once alarming, convincing, and inspiring. After reading this book, you will find out why Dr. Carson's remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast so angered President Obama and alarmed the national media. In America the Beautiful Carson shares his perspectives on our nation's origins, why our Judeo-Christian heritage remains so relevant and needed today, our failing educational system, and the great threat posed by Obama's socialism and healthcare plan. There is much more in this book, including: •Dr. Carson's take on the tea party and why it has emerged as such a force •Why the Republican and Democratic parties have done "consistent" harm to the country •The founders' fear of "abuse of power" and why it's so relevant today •How slavery that occurred over a hundred years ago should not be used "to tip the scales forever" •His 1997 Prayer Breakfast remarks that jolted President Bill Clinton and led to Carson receiving a standing ovation •Why he chose to become a neurosurgeon •The truth about the Bible and its opp</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1375973825972</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 10:57:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375974394135-40</Id><Topic><Title>Obama trying to stop 35 agents in Benghazi</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1375972161270</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 10:29:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's pretty good, because Obama is getting the CIA to encourage the 35 agents in Benghazi to come forward and testify/co-operate.

I agree with you, move to Airbus to make more money now .or I am in tsla not Boeing and if you have to go with a Airplane manufacturer since you know my invention is most likely , going to Airbus, you need to sell your Boeing stock and invest with Airbus now if you support my plans .

Those steps include what Musk described as a "bullet-proof warranty program" when it was announced earlier this year. Tesla is also in the midst of setting up a nationwide network of high-speed "supercharger" stations and has demonstrated plans to permit rapid battery swaps. and lets not forget domerrrrr45 who thinks that it is bad to invest in better companies than Boeing and mention that they are better than Boeing and to suggest other investors consider them instead of Boeing FEB FEB FEB realy, REALLT how about nyuck , nyuck Nyuck domerrrrrr45.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1375984647591</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 13:57:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375985403087-65</Id><Title>WayneMyDick, you wasted a month of bash for nothing..</Title><Msg>except pumping TSLA..</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1375985403087</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-08 14:10:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375985519773-66</Id><Title>TSLA and the Galápagos and gloating ,could be congratulations depending on your decisions domerrrrr45</Title><Msg>domerrrrr45, your so mad at me now your spelling is getting sloppy, remember galapgos is Galápagos, wow your so angry still TSLA is up 363% year to date and Boeing, your stock, is up only 41% and I told you months ago and several hundred percent of gains ago to move to TSLA that is a fact, domerrrrr45, not a gloat, if you moved to TSLA then I would be able to congratulate you .

So, I looked at this polling organization's numbers relative to the demograhics for Georgia. Whites = 59.7%. Blacks = 30.5%. Dems = 45.4% and Reps = 53.4%. The numbers of favorable of MLK are then normalized on two assumptions: 1) that 5% (very generous) of reps (or non-Dems) are black; and 2) that 100% of blacks (regardless of party affiliations) are favorable towards Dr. King. That leaves only 54% of White Democrats favorable to Dr. King. By calculation, "white democrat MLK favorable" = "83%" (total favorable MLK democrats per PPP) - 95% (assumed black dems, 5% are non-democrats) of 100% MLK favorable (assumed black perception) of 30.5% population (blacks). 54% is hardly a profound affirmation of his value on the part of white Dems and more of a reflection of a convenient marriage of blacks to the Democrat Party. Aren't numbers fun?
