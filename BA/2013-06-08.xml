Thursday's report by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that individual premiums would have been $1.9 billion higher in 2012 without the requirements in the federal Affordable Care Act. In addition, the nonprofit group said individual policyholders nationwide should receive $241 million in rebates this summer. Insurers must issue rebates to individuals and small businesses if they don't spend at least 80% of their annual premiums on medical care. QUIZ: How much do you know about healthcare? This week, The Times reported that Blue Shield of California owes $24.5 million in rebates to thousands of small firms, and Anthem Blue Cross owes $12 million to some small businesses in the state. These rebates and additional amounts coming from other insurers must be paid by Aug. 1.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1370702540636</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 10:42:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370703330204-13</Id><Title>Cheapest Commie Care Plan will cost 20K for Family of /Four or Five</Title><Msg>The cheapest Obamacare health insurance plan will cost a family $20,000 per year. Americans will be forced to purchase the plan or face the Obama IRS. CNS News reported: In a final regulation issued Wednesday, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assumed that under Obamacare the cheapest health insurance plan available in 2016 for a family will cost $20,000 for the year. Under Obamacare, Americans will be required to buy health insurance or pay a penalty to the IRS. The IRS’s assumption that the cheapest plan for a family will cost $20,000 per year is found in examples the IRS gives to help people understand how to calculate the penalty they will need to pay the government if they do not buy a mandated health plan. The examples point to families of four and families of five, both of which the IRS expects in its assumptions to pay a minimum of $20,000 per year for a bronze plan. “The annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children) is $20,000,” the regulation says.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1370703330204</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 10:55:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370703717374-14</Id><Topic><Title>ACLU now saying Obonzo worse than Bush</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1370575902625</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 23:31:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The ACLU may have no reason to lie, but Obama certainly has reasons to lie.

Average selling price is $115M. Production costs have not been coming down like they were supposed to and it isn't clear that Boeing will ever get them down to less than $115M which isn't surprising given the way they were designed and the higher than expected tolerance variations with the composite parts. Breakeven is going to be a long way down the road. I've got a buy on the stock because of the technical action of the stock and the high profit margins on the 737, 777, and government programs but eventually Boeing is going to have to deal with their inability to make a profit on composite airplanes.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1370721967084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 16:06:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370726772068-46</Id><Topic><Title>787 cost 30 billion, profit margin is 5% what is the break even point ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370672455985</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 02:20:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even at $7.5 million, that is alot of planes to recoup $30B(if the $30B is correct which would be nearly impossible to verify or how they ammoritize it).
