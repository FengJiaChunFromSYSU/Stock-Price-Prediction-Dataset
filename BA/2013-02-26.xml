Over the weekend, members of Local District 751 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers rejected a contract offer from Hytek Finishes. Union members also authorized a strike of the Kent-based manufacturer. The union has not yet set a date for when the strike will start, said Kevin Cummings, the union's lead negotiator. Cummings said he has offered to hold one more bargaining session with Hytek management before the union sets a date for the strike. "We want to give management one last chance," he said in a statement. Hytek's 180 Machinists do metal coating and finishing on aircraft parts for all of Boeing's widebody jets: the 787, 747-8, 777 and 767. All four are built in Everett. A second 787 assembly line is in North Charleston, S.C. Hytek is a subsidiary of Bellevue-based Esterline Technologies, which also owns Everett-based Korry. The union says a strike at Hytek would be disruptive not only to Boeing but throughout the aerospace industry. "There are very few companies in the world certified to do this kind of work, and fewer still in the United States," the Machinists' Cummings said. Besides Boeing, Hytek's customers include BAE, Bell Helicopters, Gulfstream, Triumph Aerostructures and United Technologies. Hytek workers also supply parts for the Pentagon's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Workers at Hytek voted to join the Machinists union in 2011. The union says the key sticking point has been Hytek's unwillingness to negotiate fairly. The National Labor Relations Board in November ruled that Hytek had committed eight violations of the National Labor Relations Act. The Machinists said Monday that they are going forward with strike plans and conducted training on Saturday. The union has 33,000 other members nearby to support the Hytek workers during the walkout, many of whom work at Boeing. Boeing already faces a potential strike by 7,400 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. After nearly a year of negotiating, the technical workers represented by SPEEA rejected Boeing's second contract offer last week and granted negotiators approval to call a strike. SPEEA-represented engineers approved the contract. Boeing and SPEEA are to resume talks Wednesday with the help of federal mediators and with hopes of avoiding a strike by technical workers.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361871029610</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 04:30:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361871500644-7</Id><Topic><Title>why is Boeing going with a fire proof box instead of a mature battery solution?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361740303567</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 16:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>juz too foot</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361871500644</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 04:38:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361871844317-8</Id><Topic><Title>why is Boeing going with a fire proof box instead of a mature battery solution?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361740303567</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 16:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>26% and out today or 1% down and stay chart better than opinion</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361871844317</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 04:44:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361874575046-9</Id><Topic><Title>Supplier for Everett-built Boeing jets faces possible strike !</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361871029610</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 04:30:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>for the anti worker rights thumbs down guy, remember this is a protected strike , 5 NLRA violations by Hyteck were committed , so no terminations , and no outsourcing , negotiation , and very few certified contractors can be used to scab on the IAM union here.

Without a clear cause for the battery problems and based on the same broad facts that are available to its arch-competitor Airbus, Boeing would need to demonstrate the risks are minimal. Both Airbus and Boeing insist the new battery technology is safe. But beyond any debate over safety, questions have arisen over its "maturity" or predictability. . Switching to the heavier nickel-cadmium will mean adding 60-80 kg to the weight of the A350 ' reducing its payload capacity by the equivalent of an adult male passenger. That is usually more than enough for plane makers to fight over when marketing the fuel savings of their jets, but Airbus has decided it is outweighed by the risks of further delay. Boeing said last week it had selected lithium-ion batteries because they best met the performance and design objectives of the 787, ". So Nuclear energy is the cleanest form of manmade energy in the world, Nuclear power plants do not emit carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen oxides as part of the power generation process and at Hanford the radioactive waste is stored in tanks or boxes the engineers said it was a fool proof containment system but they are leaking ? Boeing is making a containment box for the lithium batteries, and they are the best man made containment boxes in the world that man can make , hummmm Boeing , stands for safety last , and get the plane in the air per the boss’ orders !</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1361878747066</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 06:39:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361879702492-15</Id><Title>As our Government continues to Arm Alqaeda .... the beat goes on</Title><Msg>Quoth Engel: “I will be introducing legislation to allow the president to arm the rebels,” Rep.

So the headache you offer is strictly a BS statement . . Union's are great for workers and companies if the company will work with their employees. How to prove this to you phantomfield, Pull a stock comparison of LUV to BA from 1 day to max on the Yahoo financial chart, if you are a stock market investor( an investor in Boeing or Southwest) you will note that from the max at 6000% better stock price appreciation for LUV over Boeing to the year to day, BA is down about a 1% to LUV up almost 11% Boeing has made the company owners nothing compared to a much more unionized Company namely Southwest airlines, and yes Southwest Airlines uses the same unions at Boeing in many cases.

The Budget Control Act, which was signed into law by Obama in 2011, will take affect on March 1st. The President will be exempt from the effects of the sequestration, which he has threatened will be devastating. A report published last month by the Congressional Research Service--“Budget Sequestration and Selected Program Exemptions and Special Rules"--identifies certain programs that are exempt from sequestration and lays out special rules that govern the sequestration of others. Section 255 of the Budget Control Act includes “Compensation for the President” as one of those exemptions (Page 19). “Most exempt programs are mandatory, and include Social Security and Medicaid; refundable tax credits to individuals; and low-income programs such as the Children’s Health Insurance Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Supplemental Security Income,” the report states. “Some discretionary programs also are exempt, notably all programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs,” it said. “Also, subject to notification of Congress by the president, military personnel accounts may either be exempt or reduced by a lower percentage,” the report states. (The report states in a footnote that the White House notified Congress last year of President Obama's intention to exempt military personnel accounts from sequestration.) Pensions for former presidents are also exempt, according to the report. It is good to know that the President’s income is safe, when thousands of Americans could be forced out of work. He preaches about how the sequestration could be devastating to many people, but how worried can he really be when his livelihood is safe.

Without the usual ETOPS 180 approval which allows a twin engine airliner to fly as far as three hours at single engine speed from a diversionary airport in the event of an engine failure the 787 is useless for the purposes for which Qantas ordered it way back in December 2005 for deliveries starting in August 2008.

Banks have a powerful incentive to get big and unwieldy. The larger they are, the more disastrous their failure would be and the more certain they can be of a government bailout in an emergency. The result is an implicit subsidy: The banks that are potentially the most dangerous can borrow at lower rates, because creditors perceive them as too big to fail. Lately, economists have tried to pin down exactly how much the subsidy lowers big banks’ borrowing costs. In one relatively thorough effort, two researchers -- Kenichi Ueda of the International Monetary Fund and Beatrice Weder di Mauro of the University of Mainz -- put the number at about 0.8 percentage point. The discount applies to all their liabilities, including bonds and customer deposits. Big Difference Small as it might sound, 0.8 percentage point makes a big difference. Multiplied by the total liabilities of the 10 largest U.S. banks by assets, it amounts to a taxpayer subsidy of $83 billion a year. To put the figure in perspective, it’s tantamount to the government giving the banks about 3 cents of every tax dollar collected. The top five banks -- JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. - - account for $64 billion of the total subsidy, an amount roughly equal to their typical annual profits (see tables for data on individual banks). In other words, the banks occupying the commanding heights of the U.S. financial industry -- with almost $9 trillion in assets, more than half the size of the U.S. economy -- would just about break even in the absence of corporate welfare. In large part, the profits they report are essentially transfers from taxpayers to their shareholders. Neither bank executives nor shareholders have much incentive to change the situation. On the contrary, the financial industry spends hundreds of millions of dollars every election cycle on campaign donations and lobbying, much of which is aimed at maintaining the subsidy. The result is a bloated financial sector and recurring credit gluts. Left unchecked, the superbanks could ultimately require bailouts that exceed the government’s resources.

Feds Hiring Thousands As Sequestration Looms</Title><Msg>If politicians are gonna scream about how everyone’s gonna lose jobs if the budget is cut, they might want to quit hiring. Instead, thousands more employees are being added to government payrolls around the country. The sequester is apparently no problem for a federal government being run by people who seem to think solving unemployment means hiring everyone to do jobs. The Examiner pointed out the contradiction: Administration officials warn sequestration would mean furloughing border patrol agents, air traffic controllers, food inspectors and other critical employees to deal with what they bill as drastic spending cuts. But a quick search on usajobs.gov turns up a raft of open government positions ranging from cooks to mechanics to statisticians. According to a Politico/GWU/Battleground poll taken in December, 76% of Americans surveyed favored across-the-board spending cuts. Meanwhile, the government was responsible for 73% of new jobs created between June and December. The automatic budget cuts March 1st known as “sequestration” were President Obama’s idea. They would cut $44 billion from the $3.6 trillion federal budget, or roughly $1.25 out of every $100 spent. The United States borrows roughly 40% of the money it spends. The Congress has not passed a budget in four years; and during that time, the GOP has submitted 40 job-creation bills to the Senate, which blocked them. In order for the federal government to increase tax receipts to close the nearly $1 trillion projected budget deficit, the government should concentrate on encouraging private sector job creation by lowering taxes and deregulation. Outrageous? It should be pointed out that the historical average in the U.S. for unemployment is about 5%. America needs to be more competitive in the world market, not less productive and government-dependent. It would be nice to finally return to an economy where the government isn’t doomsaying about the latest economic disaster that would result from the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling, the sequester or whatever. Americans could get back to work and finally get some peace and quiet.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1361898367886</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 12:06:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361898420138-57</Id><Topic><Title>Losers still posting on BA board</Title><Username>wutangbk2</Username><Timestamp>1361894940661</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 11:09:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They, the (R) losers like the sobbing Boehner and being held hostage by and giving pledges to Grover Norquist, etc. Kinda like the #$%$ heirarchy...</Msg><Username>repugsrwimps</Username><Timestamp>1361898420138</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 12:07:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361898579983-58</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Plan to Torpedo Economy With Sequester</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1361896685315</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 11:38:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is the leader.

The U.N.

"The United States, as the world's leading arms supplier, has a special responsibility to provide the leadership needed for an ATT (arms trade treaty) with the highest possible standards for the transfer of conventional arms and ammunition," the groups wrote to Obama in a letter delivered late on Friday. "The Arms Trade Treaty can provide a key tool to help reduce enormous human suffering caused by irresponsible international arms transfers and arms brokering," the letter said. The 36 groups that co-authored the letter include Amnesty International USA, Arms Control Association, Friends Committee on National Legislation, Oxfam America, National Association of Evangelicals and other groups. The point of the treaty is to set standards for all cross-border transfers of any type of conventional weapon - light and heavy. It also would set binding requirements for nations to review all cross-border arms contracts to ensure the munitions will not be used in human rights abuses, do not violate embargoes and are not illegally diverted. Deputy U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden confirmed the White House had received the letter, saying it "raises a number of important issues." She said Washington would support a treaty under certain conditions.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1361899947130</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 12:32:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361900029986-63</Id><Topic><Title>Why are Democrats so Attracted to Socialisim and Marxism?</Title><Username>marxbouncers</Username><Timestamp>1361830452316</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 17:14:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mostly a hatred of freedom.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1361900029986</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 12:33:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361900042845-64</Id><Topic><Title>Who will Bear the Burden of Obama’s Lying?</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1361892724479</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 10:32:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bet those coughing up 500K for quarterly meetings with obungles won't be hurt.

But even among those who favor a “balanced approach” of tax hikes and spending cuts instead, half want more emphasis on spending cuts. Forty-five percent (45%) of Likely U.S. Voters think, generally speaking, that the long-term federal budget deficit should be reduced by cutting spending, according to the latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey. Thirty-six percent (36%) think the better way to reduce the deficit is through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. However, this includes 18% who want the combination to include more tax increases than cuts and 18% who want more spending cuts than tax hikes. Only six percent (6%) feel the deficit should be reduced by raising taxes alone. Thirteen percent (13%) are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.) The president fervently believes he has a mandate to impose “the people’s will” through government action. Indeed, in a tight presidential election cycle, the public narrowly chose Mr. Obama to lead the nation for another four years, and therefore feels emboldened to move forward with his progressive, left-wing agenda as outlined in his second inaugural address. But what’s striking to me is that his “balanced approach” to long-term deficit reduction is not shared by almost half the voting public. Forty-five percent, according to this sample, believe cutting spending is the “best” -- and perhaps only -- way to achieve meaningful deficit reduction; they don’t believe tax hikes should even be on the table."</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1361905949049</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:12:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361905986311-77</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Tops GOP on Unifying the Nation</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_567</Username><Timestamp>1361904918242</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 13:55:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>only an idiot would have looked upon the stars/night sky that way or a RWNJ</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1361905986311</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:13:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361906023500-78</Id><Topic><Title>Considerable Upgrade for The Boeing Company. **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>jacksonvan87</Username><Timestamp>1361889440343</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 09:37:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes they do good work</Msg><Username>malonecbobby</Username><Timestamp>1361906023500</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:13:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361906063166-79</Id><Topic><Title>Is there an antidote to laughing gas?</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1361902324623</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 13:12:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmmm conversation sounds almost like a repeat of the famous question by Dan Blather in an interview with Anwar Sadat - Why are you (all) anti-semitic ?

I oppose Dubya's War by: Chris_Genna (M/Kent, WA) 03/16/03 02:48 am Msg: 218294 A U.S.-only pre-emptive invasion of Iraq will result in hundreds of Americans being killed, if we're lucky and if the Vultures' wishful thinking is correct. Each is as good as person as anyone posting here, with hopes for the future as good and valid as any of ours. I know some of them; some are the kids of guys I flew with. I support them and I honor them for their loyalty and their dedication to doing the job they are ordered to do. I wish their leaders were as commendable. It will result in the deaths of thousands of innocent Iraqis and each will have a couple of relatives who will decide it will be worth his life to kill a few dozen Americans. But cowards die many times," and this would not deter me if there was any chance such a war would bring peace or even stability (a stable level of turmoil) to the region. It will not, not unless we are prepared to remain there for years and turn Iraq into a military/police state. If you do not believe this, check out the history of ANY region at ANY time that was "pacified" by a superpower -- Afghanistan (or even India) under the Brits, Northwest Africa (or Lebanon) under the French, etc. The weaponry has changed but human nature has not. So why do it? Like Epistemophile, I have lost track of which rationalizations have been justified by which lies. It has been said Saddam has weapons of mass destruction; no one believes this. So it became that he was developing weapons of mass destruction. Drones have turned out to be toy airplanes; attempts to purchase plutonium have turned out to be forgeries. Every other nation (and there are a score or more) who have developed weapons of mass detruction have learned pretty quickly that ownership beings a kind of responsibility. That includes China back when it was OK to call them "Red China." Career diplomats have quit in disgust at our gunslinging, simplistic view of the path to "peace." The Vultures say Saddam has to go. Fine. Does it take an Army and Navy and Air Force to get that done? Those who complain loud and often that I'm a Democrat take note: When Ronald Reagan decided Moammar Gadhafi had to go (and the French wouldn't agree, by the way) Reagan had the good sense to launch an air strike aimed at Gadhafi. He missed (too bad) but Gadhafi sure was quiet after that. Maybe it would work with Saddam. We don't know because we aren't going to try it. It does not fit with our administration's plans to get control of those Iraqi oil well heads. Now that the strike force is in position, we could retaliate against any attack on our jets in the no-fly zones. This too is dismissed. It's as if we need to show the world we don't need a reason. A pre-emptive strike will establish the principle as legitimate (just as an attack using poison gas would legitimize that tactic -- and why do you think no one tried it in WW2?) Do we want to set an example for the rest of the unpleasant people in the world that pre-emption is a valid reason to fire missiles? Can't you think of any other regimes paranoid enough and capable enough to do this? How about North Korea? Oh, right, we're going after them next, right? Or is it after Iran? Or the French or the U.N. (in N.Y.)? No one should want to establish the principle of pre-emption. Even the state terrorism-supported Stalin regime would not open hostilities with Hitler! When the Israelis used pre-emption in the 1967 war, they had to spend the next two years tring to justify it, and had so little success at it that they had to get caught with their pants down in 1973. Most important to me: Going into Iraq alone or largely alone negates the best credit this nation ever had in the world, and perhaps the only credit we have left -- that we're the good guys; that we don't start wars, but finish them. We show the world what it means to be free; what it means to be *SELF*-determinant. We whupped the Russians without ever firing a shot because our way was superior. Conquerors are a dime a dozen and go back to the Hittites before recorded history. None ever last long, and when they are gone they are unlamented. This war will be over pretty quickly. But even before it is, there will a great body of people who view us as conquerors, possibly including the Chinese, whose leadership is squirly enough anyway that there pilots make unsuccessful suicide attacks against our intelligence planes. We've talked here about schoolyard bullies and older brothers and cousins. Can none of you warmongers accept the fact that having friends in the world is as much help to us as another couple trillion dollars in the defense budget? If we go this alone, that is how we will be for the rest of our time. Sure, we can make *EVERY* nation a vassal state -- it worked for Napoleon for about 18 years. I'd like to leave my daughter a country that lasts a tad longer than that. Now, I expect to be shouted down by the dozen or so people I have recently put on ignore. I expect them to make every laughable and unsupported claim or supposition imaginable about me, from my parenthood to whether I worry about cruelty to chickens or was the victim of bullies in school.

Senator Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), who requested the report, revealed the findings this morning at a Senate Budget Committee hearing. The report, he said, “confirms everything critics and Republicans were saying about the faults of this bill,” and “dramatically proves that the promises made assuring the nation that the largest new entitlement program in history would not add one dime to the deficit were false.” President Obama and other Democrats attempted to win support for the health-care bill by touting it as a fiscally responsible enterprise. “I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits — either now or in the future,” Obama told a joint-session of Congress in September 2009. “I will not sign it if it adds one dime to the deficit, now or in the future, period.” The new report exposes the “lack of honesty” surrounding such claims, Sessions argued. “The big-government crowd in Washington manipulated the numbers in order to get the financial score they wanted, in order to get their bill passed and to increase power and influence,” he said. “The goal was not truth or financial responsibility, but to pass the bill. This is how a country goes broke.”</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1361907579392</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:39:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361907609900-94</Id><Topic><Title>Is there an antidote to laughing gas?</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1361902324623</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 13:12:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes. it is not a lethal-gas unless forecable given with O2 ven with no O2 unless lit on fire Unless lit on fire...</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1361907609900</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:40:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361907692737-95</Id><Topic><Title>Is there an antidote to laughing gas?</Title><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1361902324623</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 13:12:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Me too, bapsycho.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1361907692737</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:41:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361907869980-96</Id><Topic><Title>Government Report: Obamacare to Add $6.2 Trillion to Deficit...</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1361907579392</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:39:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh great.

Figures suggested that attacks from 2011 to 2012 had seen reductions of 7%, but the numbers were later corrected to 0%: “The 7 percent figure had been included in a report posted on the coalition's website in late January as part of its monthly update on trends in security and violence. It was removed from the website recently without explanation. “[C]oalition officials said they were correcting the data and would re-publish the report in coming days.” ISAF spokesperson Jamie Graybeal couldn’t identify when the errors in data began or who discovered them, when asked about the coalition’s mistakes: "During a quality control check, ISAF recently became aware that some data was incorrectly entered into the database that is used for tracking security-related incidents across Afghanistan.”</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1361917708496</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 17:28:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361917816792-148</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is telling the Truth About Sequestration</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1361911536683</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 15:45:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe O could compromise an inch and cut some of his goofy spending.

BA +0.83%the green light for airborne tests of proposed battery fixes for its 787 Dreamliner as early as next week, according to people familiar with the details, though the actual flights aren't likely to come that quickly. If the Federal Aviation Administration gives the go-ahead for testing in early March, these people said, Boeing has told some airline customers the grounded jets could resume carrying passengers in a matter of weeks, perhaps even by the end of the month. In submitting its package of proposed changes for the malfunctioning lithium-ion batteries, Boeing initially asked the FAA to get the go-ahead for flight tests to commence around March 1, these people said. But the FAA has balked at moving that fast, according to some knowledgeable people, and the timetable for flight tests remains fluid. Boeing's aggressive timetable for resuming regular flights also could be upset if the FAA has any major questions or concerns about the package of battery enhancements before or after the flight tests. Some industry officials project the Dreamliner won't be able to resume commercial service until April or later in the year.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1361924078010</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 19:14:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361924090441-168</Id><Topic><Title>Filibuster Broken: Senate Overwhelmingly Advances Hagel to Final Vote</Title><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1361908718032</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:58:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Perhaps you should make an appointment?</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1361924090441</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 19:14:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361924329377-169</Id><Topic><Title>BA continues to walk on water--too bad shorties</Title><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1361911457147</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 15:44:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing's engineering union has decided to drop its demand that its labor contract include a pension for new workers, a move that could hasten a deal as the two sides resume bargaining on Wednesday.

The decision comes after one bargaining unit last week narrowly accepted Boeing's (BA.N) contract offer without the pension for new hires. The other unit narrowly rejected the contract, sending them back to the bargaining table. "The pension is dead," said Tom McCarty, president of the executive board of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), in an interview with Reuters. "We're not going to try to breathe new life into it." The pension became the key flash point in talks between SPEEA and Boeing that began in April. Boeing is now reeling from the grounding of its 787 Dreamliner nearly six weeks ago, a rare event that has halted delivery of the new plane to customers and is costing Boeing an estimated $200 million a month in lost income and potential compensation to airlines. SPEEA's technicians and Boeing will resume bargaining Wednesday to replace a four-year agreement for 23,000 workers that expired in October.

The party has also confirmed that it operates a network of nearly 1,000 "public opinion shapers". They are assigned with the task of spreading the party line. The tactic is similar to China's model of internet moderators who aim to control news and manipulate opinion. 'Political opportunists' Hanoi Propaganda and Education Department head Ho Quang Loi said that the authorities had hired hundreds of so-called "internet polemists" in the fight against "online hostile forces". While the exact number of these activists is unknown, Mr Loi revealed that his organisation is running at least 400 online accounts and 20 microblogs. Regular visitors on popular social media networks in Vietnam such as Facebook have long noticed the existence of a number of pro-regime bloggers, who frequently post comments and articles supportive of the Communist Party. The bloggers also take part in online discussions, where they fiercely attack anybody who they see as critical of the regime. On a recent BBC Vietnamese Facebook wall - linked to a story about measures to clamp down on dissent - one such blogger asked why it was that the US "gave themselves the right to criticise other nations on human rights". "They should have a look at their own record!" the blogger stated. Another post criticises pro-democracy campaigners. "The so-called democracy activists and intellectuals are becoming more and more ridiculous. They have shown their true colour as political opportunists. Their despicability has no bounds," it says. Mr Loi said such bloggers helped a great deal in stopping negative rumours and had blocked online calls for mass gatherings in the city. Vietnam's capital saw at least dozen public protests in 2011, but the number was greatly reduced last year. The authorities also employ a force of 900 "public opinion shapers" who help talk up government policies and promote the party line across the country. It is not clear whether these operatives, and the bloggers, are on official payrolls. But they are being praised by officials as a sophisticated and effective tool in controlling public opinion.</Msg><Username>vendetta35000</Username><Timestamp>1361925584575</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 19:39:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361925678247-174</Id><Topic><Title>did anybody ask you - boz scaggs on the leno show</Title><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1361924487123</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 19:21:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bah Boz Scaggs!

"Reports that we are close to allowing 787 test flights are completely inaccurate," spokeswoman Laura Brown said on Tuesday in an email to Reuters. Boeing declined to comment. Batteries overheated on two jets last month, prompting regulators to ground the 50 Dreamliners in service worldwide. The grounding saddled Boeing (BA.N) with mounting costs and airlines with expensive planes that cannot be flown and in some cases are stranded far from their home airports. Boeing proposed a multi-faceted fix for the battery system in a meeting with the FAA last week. The proposal included a stronger containment box, a battery with greater cooling capacity and other changes.

"Reports that we are close to allowing 787 test flights are completely inaccurate," spokeswoman Laura Brown said on Tuesday in an email to Reuters. Boeing declined to comment. Batteries overheated on two jets last month, prompting regulators to ground the 50 Dreamliners in service worldwide. The grounding saddled Boeing with mounting costs and airlines with expensive planes that cannot be flown and in some cases are stranded far from their home airports. Boeing proposed a multi-faceted fix for the battery system in a meeting with the FAA last week.

The FAA just condemned those hacks for their false and misleading comments. Frankly a containment vessel for a battery fire instead of a fix for the problem is just another indication of a wholesale termination of the Boeing Board of Directors and the CEO is needed a house cleaning must occur to restore the faith in a once great company and the headquarters needs to be returned to Seattle . A battery containment vessel instead of a battery fix is up battery is a insane solution that can come to no good end. .A 787 plane would never be allowed to fly 3 hours from land until the cause is found and fixed, this flawed fix , well It may fly in the Boeing Board room but it will not fly in the real world !
