E. Cupp and New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin discussed the obstructionist Republican Congress and its mission to take down the president by taking down the country. Moore opined that the Republican Party is a “squealing dinosaur” whose time has come. Maher began the segment by talking about how prices among top health insurers are falling since the implementation of Obamacare. “They did a test and they put, you know, what insurance would cost if you were a 40-year-old, non-smoker and instantly, the two highest priced insurers went down,” Maher said. “This is the heart of Obama,” he said. “This is the heart of capitalism. I’m wondering why the people who love the free market so much are not for this.” “And what about trying to repeal it for the 37th time?” he went on. “Is that a wise use of our time and resources? At some point, obstruction becomes, um, I dunno, treason.” He went on to list how Republicans are blocking the nominations of a new head for the EPA, a chief circuit court judge for the city of Washington, D.C. and dozens of other government posts that are going unfilled because Republicans won’t let any of Obama’s nominees get voted on in Congress. “At some point,” Maher said, “it becomes more about hating him than loving our country.” “No, they hate America,” said Moore. “I think that’s really what it is.” He went on to say that “conservatives and right-wingers,” as much as they profess to love this country, “they hate it. They hate the government, they hate the people.” He went on to say, however, to Maher, “I’m not as depressed about this as you are.” Young people, he said, are retreating from the Republican Party and abandoning its principles as outdated and overly moralistic. Young people today, he said, “they’re not bigots, they’re not haters.” The Republican Party is a “squealing dinosaur” that is coming face-to-face with its own extinction.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368966110214</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 08:21:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>15</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368967069760-19</Id><Title>HOOZDIKs post on obstruction of Obamacare is one big LIE !!!</Title><Msg>Hoozdik posted a whopper about how Bil Maher and Michael Moore are whining about the GOP trying to repeal Obama care...Why...cause the premiums would go down...total whopper and 17 different studies show premiums would GO UP under Obamas new plan and the only winners are health insurance companies.

Not because it lasted a grueling three hours and fifty minutes, but because of what was announced. With every new product update, every new feature, every new virtual service, it became more and more clear that Google isn’t just a search company that makes loads of cash by showing you ads. It’s creeping into every aspect of our digital, physical, and private lives at an exponential rate. I’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. Google isn’t just the backbone of the Internet anymore. It’s rapidly becoming the backbone of your entire life, all thanks to data you’re voluntarily giving up to a private company based on your Web searches, photos, Gmail messages, and more. After spending three days at I/O this week, it became more apparent than ever that unless millions (billions?) of people suddenly change their mind and start using alternative tech tools, or unless the government steps in waving the anti-trust banner, our lives, our history, and our personal wealth could be managed by one company –– Google. It’s the most apparent in Google Now, a voice-powered personal assistant that launched on Android phones last year. At I/O, it became even more clear that Google no longer sees search as returning a list of 10 or 20 relevant links when you type in a query. Google Now is much more than that. It’s the embodiment of that geeky dream of a “Star Trek Computer,” an intelligent machine that understands natural language and real-world context to assist you before you even know you need assistance.

It is the first detailed look at how health insurance premiums could change under President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2014. Covered California, the agency charged with creating the state’s new health insurance marketplace, commissioned the analysis. The report looked at the individual market only and did not examine the small or large group market. Under the ACA people with incomes up to four times the federal poverty level (about $94,000 for a family of four; $46,000 for an individual) will be eligible for subsidies from the federal government. That’s about 570,000 people, Covered California said. Major findings from the study include: •Individuals with incomes less than four times the poverty level are “likely to pay” 47 to 84 percent less for their monthly premium compared to this year •Premiums would have increased 9 percent in 2014 because of health care inflation, even without the ACA The analysis was conducted by Milliman, a large actuarial firm. According to the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, just over 2 million Californians buy insurance on the individual market. About 85 percent of Californians get insurance from their employer. Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the foundation, called the report a “complete and well done analysis.” “Probably the most important thing this analysis did,” Levitt said, “was to help people understand that not everyone is going to be faced with higher premiums as a result of the Affordable Care Act.” Still, some people will see higher premiums, in particular, people with incomes above 400 percent of the poverty level. More than a million of these middle and upper-income earners will likely experience an increase of 20 percent, the report found. The Milliman analysis comes on the heels of another actuarial review completed this week. That one, from the Society of Actuaries, concluded costs would go up 32 percent under the ACA. But Levitt said that report was flawed, in part because it did not look across the ACA as a whole — or at the two primary ways people pay for health care: through premiums and through direct out-or-pocket costs such as deductibles and co-pays. The Milliman report looked at both these fees to consumers. Because of anticipated benefits of the ACA, increased premium rates that some will pay could be partially offset by reduced out-of-pocket costs for health care, the study found. In a release, Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee called the study “an important step in determining strategies to help protect” individuals from cost increases. In California, people buying insurance on the individual market have experienced dramatic premium rate hikes over the last several years. “Our top priority is to provide Californians with affordable health insurance options,” Lee said. “We are pleased that most individuals will pay lower rates and receive better coverage.” The report also found that people in their 20s are likely to experience the biggest increase in monthly premiums (roughly 25 percent higher than the average increase for all ages), but in its release Covered California said many of these younger Californians are likely to be eligible for subsidies. Levitt credited the study for estimating cost reductions due to competition expected under the Affordable Care Act. Right now on the individual market in California, it is very difficult for consumers to comparison shop. Often they cannot even find out what their premium will be until they fill out a detailed health questionnaire, Levitt said. The goal of the new insurance marketplace is to allow a more straightforward comparison of health insurance plans. “Insurers will respond to that price competition by changing their cost structure,” Levitt said. The analysis found that this competition should bring costs down an average 6 percent. The California Association of Health Plans reiterated the group’s overall support for the Affordable Care Act, but acknowledged the new competitive marketplace coming. “These are completely different products in the individual market than what is sold today,” said Charles Bacchi, vice president of the group told KQED’s Mina Kim. “Health plans are going through the process of changing the way they provide coverage to this portion of the population, all on top of trying to price the products, deal with underlying health care costs and still remain competitive in the marketplace.” Insurance companies are expected to submit plans to Covered California next month, to determine eligibility for the marketplace. Plans — and premiums — will be announced this summer. But this study is well-timed, Levitt said. “People are forming impressions now about how this law will work and what it means to them,” he said. “So having accurate information out there about how people may be affected is really important.” The new health insurance marketplace is scheduled to open to consumers on Oct. 1. Individuals will be able to shop for insurance that will take effect Jan. 1, 2014.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368968450921</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 09:00:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368968503368-24</Id><Topic><Title>Google’s Plan To Take Over The World</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368968306322</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 08:58:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>(continued) on the companies you search for. It scans your calendar and reminds you when to leave to make your appointment on time. And all that data is delivered to you without you having to ask. Following I/O, Google Now is more prevalent than before. Google recently launched the app on iPhones and iPads, and it’s coming to the desktop soon if you use the Chrome Web browser. Next year, you’ll be wearing Google Now on your face if you buy Google Glass. Then there are photos, arguably the most personal things you share online. Now, Google scans every single one you upload to Google+. It can learn what your family members look like and group photos of them into albums automatically. It can tell if your subjects are smiling. If they’re not smiling, it can stitch their faces in from other images where they are and create the perfect photo for you. It knows if you’re taking pictures of mountains or puppies or buildings or famous landmarks and group your photo albums together accordingly. It’s creepy and magical at the same time. Google Glass didn’t get any stage time during the I/O keynote, but it was still a significant part of the event. You couldn’t go anywhere –– the press room, the cafeteria, the restroom –– without someone’s computerized headgear staring back at you. It was oddly discomforting knowing that thousands of people had the ability to take a photo or video of you just by winking at their Glass. It’s far too early to tell if Glass will take off when it’s ready for the general public, but if it does, then it’ll be just another example of how Google has reached into the physical space to take over everything we see and do. I could go on and on, but this week I learned that Google has its hand in almost every aspect day-to-day life and its penetration is only accelerating.

So the 787 is a flying fire bomb. , Cessna at Boeing's suggestion BTW changed out their lithium battery and went with nicad, , Boeing did not walk the talk and just put a box around the lithium batteries. Any fire in a box or not is an emergency landing ASAP. Remember Boeing said concerning the lithium batteries, "sometimes we don't know what we don't know. Already a 787 has had one electrical problem in flight. Remember that as you consider flying or owning Boeing stock. Flying jobs are the third most dangerous in the world behind fishing and logging. Remember statistics do not lie, but those who tell you flying is safer than cars or trains are making the story up with statistics. the truth is if a 787 catches on fired in a box or not you need to be around land and get down right away. 1.

It is not commercial airline pilots who suffer high rates of on-the-job fatalities, it is the bush pilots, the air taxi operators and the small commercial flyers who make piloting one of the nations most dangerous jobs.

This, as well as strict government control, will lead to extensive rationing.

Obama works – if we agree that reading a teleprompter is work – not for the American people, but for Goldman Sachs, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, UBS, Morgan Stanley, General Electric, and other bankers and monopolists and warmongering transnational corporations (see the entire list here). The CFR and Trilateralists turnstile continued to work after the 2008 election as it has for decades. Soon after the election, Obama staffed his new administration with CFR and Trilateral members and other globalist insiders. “Barack Obama appointed eleven members of the Trilateral Commission to top-level and key positions in his administration within his first ten days in office,” Patrick Wood wrote in early 2009. “This represents a very narrow source of international leadership inside the Obama administration, with a core agenda that is not necessarily in support of working people in the United States.” Moore, Maher and the liberals who love government never talk about this. And they don’t have to because it is never reported by the New York Times and the establishment media. That’s why Patrick Wood’s article, “Obama’s Trilateral Commission Team,” was Project Censored’s number 22 pick for 2010. Moore and Maher can safely play their especially vicious version of the false left-right paradigm game because millions of Americans who consider themselves liberal remain blissfully ignorant of political reality. Serious political issues are now stand-up comic routines for ill-mannered operatives like Bill Maher. Studio audiences are cued when to applaud and laugh.

Gary Pruitt, in his first television interviews since it was revealed the Justice Department subpoenaed phone records of AP reporters and editors, said the move already has had a chilling effect on journalism. Pruitt said the seizure has made sources less willing to talk to AP journalists and, in the long term, could limit Americans' information from all news outlets. Pruitt told CBS' "Face the Nation" that the government has no business monitoring the AP's newsgathering activities. "And if they restrict that apparatus ... the people of the United States will only know what the government wants them to know and that's not what the framers of the Constitution had in mind when they wrote the First Amendment," he said.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369004824857</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 19:07:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369005116830-93</Id><Topic><Title>Associated Press CEO Gary Pruitt: DOJ's Seizure Of Phone Records Was 'Unconstitutional'</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369004824857</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 19:07:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Marxism, Americans should be demanding impeachment but are too ignorant to know better.</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1369005116830</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 19:11:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369006151317-94</Id><Topic><Title>Associated Press CEO Gary Pruitt: DOJ's Seizure Of Phone Records Was 'Unconstitutional'</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369004824857</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 19:07:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obozo is the anti-American liar who continues to commit treason by disregarding the Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold.

That disclosure has prompted a debate over whether the president should have been notified at that time. In the week of April 22, the Office of the White House Counsel and its head, Kathryn Ruemmler, were told by Treasury Department attorneys that an inspector general's report was nearing completion, the White House official said. In that conversation, Ms. Ruemmler learned that "a small number of line IRS employees had improperly scrutinized certain…organizations by using words like 'tea party' and 'patriot,' " the official said. President Barack Obama said last week he learned about the controversy at the same time as the public, on May 10, when an IRS official revealed it to a conference of lawyers. The president's statement drew criticism, focusing attention on his management style and whether he has kept himself sufficiently informed about the agencies under his authority. . . . +++++ Now of course there is the lawyer client relationship - so she cannot reveal what or when of if ( she told him ) standard bcratic Bovine stuff Insulate the boss the lower types were " just following orders "</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1369012697570</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 21:18:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369012709636-109</Id><Title>New poll reveals half of Americans wants Obama impeached</Title><Msg>WND EXCLUSIVE Half of America wants Obama impeached Editor’s note: This is another in a series of “WND/WENZEL POLLS” conducted exclusively for WND by the public-opinion research and media consulting company Wenzel Strategies.

Nixon. That was confirmed by no less than Bob Woodward of the Washington Post, whose reporting on Watergate eventually snared the sitting president. Woodward said recently, “If you read through all these emails, you see that everyone in the government is saying, ‘Oh, let’s not tell the public that terrorists were involved, people connected to al Qaeda. Let’s not tell the public that there were warnings.’ And I have to go back 40 years to Watergate when Nixon put out his edited transcripts to the conversations, and he personally went through them and said, ‘Oh, let’s not tell this, let’s not show this.’ I would not dismiss Benghazi. It’s a very serious issue.” A Republican congressman recently brought up the subject. “I would say yes. I’m not willing to take it [impeachment] off to take it off the table, but that’s certainly not what we’re striving for,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told CNN. “We want truth, we want to bring the people who perpetrated the terrorism in Benghazi to be brought to justice, and we want to have the president do what he has said he would always do. And that is be open and transparent. Thus far, the White House has not done that.”</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369013434110</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 21:30:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369013733174-114</Id><Topic><Title>Maher: GOP has moved beyond obstruction to treason</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1368966110214</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 08:21:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>too bad spart, such as shame dem fascists, err yahoos, don't allow links anymore, most links of any value aren't very supportive of their dumb messiahs...they also shut down their political boards, they backfired, liberals were getting stomped, hence no more political boards</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1369013733174</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 21:35:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369013837513-115</Id><Topic><Title>New poll reveals half of Americans wants Obama impeached</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369012709636</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 21:18:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks.

It is entirely possible that Obama has an arrangement with his staff of "hear no evil, see no evil" (AKA, "plausible deniability"). In other words, do not bring him any bad news and do not bring him any news that will make him look bad. Then, when the gullible press asks what and when he knew, he can say, "I found out just now like you!". Stepping back for a moment, a substantial amount of our taxes goes towards facilitating the President being armed with whatever tools are necessary for him to effectively lead and protect the nation. Maybe the money is not well spent. Or, maybe someone is lying.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1369017720865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 22:42:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369018371503-124</Id><Topic><Title>instead of economy economy its scandle scandle and there all Obama's doing</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1368895154427</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 12:39:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>do you think Obama will sic the IRS or FBI after MSNBC?</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1369018371503</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 22:52:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369018692013-125</Id><Topic><Title>Even Piers Morgan is now saying the Governments actions border on Tyranny</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1368878541738</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 08:02:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very subtle, maramwp.

Investors, it’s a ten day comparison of Boeing stock price gain to my 4 better swing trade stock suggestions .. How did I do?. The facts and the results tesla TSLA was $54.55 on May 3 when I called it, and on May 17 TSLA Friday, the stock closed at $91.50 you missed a gain of 68% I said, then I do not mind giving Boeing hacks and trolls, the tail of the dog. I had been mentioning these stock for days prior to my call on May 3 read on for why. Boeing Investors, I was in TSLA already, go back to April 3 it was then $41.10 that is a gain of 123% one month and ten days. Boeing in five years is up 16% get it now? I do not like giving Boeing hacks and trolls ways to get rich. But another tip, if you place your curser on each of the 4 stocks I traded from May 3 to May 17 notice they all opened higher the next day than they closed the previous day, in a trend , very easy if you know how to trade a stock . Unfortunately most people get bogged down in technicals or cannot read a stock chart. It is not completely that simple but for this discussion, that is how, even a Boeing hack or a troll can figure out if the stock is going higher. Get it now? I also made some 40% day trades I but could not give the Boeing Hacks two weeks to get in so I just mentioned it. My point, if you’re a Boeing investor get out, get better stocks. NO MATTER HOW GOOD BOEING DOES YOU WILL NEVER MAKE 123% IN 10 DYAS LIKE I JUST DID OR 302% IN 1 MONTH AND 10 DAYS. Next if your a Boeing Hack, your gibberish is not working and for trolls you show your ignorance with each word you post. Next I pointed out 3 other stocks , AMD was $3.60 Friday closed at $4.07 gain is 13% but I was in a month earlier then it was $2.39 on April 3 so a gain of 70% , get it now. Next , I pointed out on May3 that JRCC was a stock to consider, in 10 days it went from $1.96 to $ $2.44 a gain of 25% for a month and 10 days it went from $1.55 to $2.44 a gain of 58%. Next DDD on May 3 my suggestion, the weekly report it was then $39.88 and closed Friday May 17 at $46.66 a gain of 17% and going back for a month and 10 days it was $30.85 to May 17 that is a gain of 51% so combined I have made so far in 10 days I made 123% you made 5.5% in Boeing for 10 days . Going back 1 month and 10 days I made 302% you made on Boeing 17%.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369019850594</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 23:17:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369021574908-128</Id><Topic><Title>hear no evil- see no evil - speak evil</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1369012697570</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 21:18:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Somebody whose initials are B.B. could use a bulky dose of plausible deniability of his own.

In your post, you mock God's Word with your attempt at humor. You need to turn your life over to Jesus. Unless you do, you are subject to the principles of 2 Thess 2:11 and you are lost.
