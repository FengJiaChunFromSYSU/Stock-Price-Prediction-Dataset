Once all the loans were granted and the commissions are paid, the money makers had their money, then they sell the paper to other suckers, this is a Ponzi scheme. To cover the Ponzi scheme the FED is printing money our of thin air nothing to back it up. , now I am making money on the QE stock market pump I don't care if its real as long as I get in and out and not caught holding the tulip. So I pretty much short term trade only apple when it was hot and Starbux as I got in on the IPO and added with each split, but I will dump any stock as soon as it turns, no sentimental, just make money. If airbus was not 100% better than Boeing over the last 3 years and it was the another company then I would be doing that . I like to make money and limit my loss. This is what I mean be careful of the barkers they tell you a story, look at the stock chart it does not fib to you. Next look who is the CEO that is a good way to handicap a stock , Elon Musk, is a serial billionaire, James McNerney , is a serial average CEO. This new guy for Airbus in the USA sure looks good, so that is a big plus for Airbus. He is not a Musk, but much more disciplined , with better skill set , related to aerospace than James McNerney. The Airbus CEO for the Americas is a military fighter jet pilot, a engineer, he ran a airline, was head of the FAA and a real American military hero . Plus this man as wants to eat Boeings lunch , All McNerney wants to do is hate unions and export American jobs with a failed and bankrupt MD out source share the cost plan . This has never worked in a hard money job only for government cost plus, does it work.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371881250440</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 02:07:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371882428648-8</Id><Topic><Title>Second United Dreamliner diverted with oil-related problem</Title><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1371777915699</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 21:25:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don, if you own Boeing stock, then, since Boeing is responsible for any late delivery, fire, oil filter issue, false warning light, not meeting specifications of a clean not reworked plane like the 787, or , , smoke in the flight deck or fire on the tarmac, or failure of a 787 product , then you as a stockholder and your investment is held liable, it causes stock value depreciation . For the last 3 years Airbus stock has bettered Boeing stock in share increase of value, by more than 100% than Boeing stock. So if Airbus was held up with all the problems of the 787 then Airbus shareholder's would be responsible or if you prefer their stock value would not be as good as Airbus. That is what that means . If you own Boeing stock you are responsible , you are a owner of Boeing , Mr McNerney , like you or me is an employee of Boeing or a retired employee. Also he is a owner of Boeing if he and you have stock in Boeing. So if you have a cost basis as you have said so low your happy to own Boeing that is your choice. As a shareholder you are the owner and your are responsible for any failure of a Boeing product. Apple was great until Steve jobs died I owned Apple until it was about 700 per share then watched it start to slide and when Steve Jobs died I got out and waited as I did not want to be responsible as a owner of the company stock for what might happen with a new leader, glad I did that too. Steve jobs I liked , he paid himself 1 dollar per year and the rrest he made on stock price appreciation. James Mcnerney I do not like he has so much pay and benefits he does not care if boeing makes it or not. Don remember how wel all complained that McNerney got so much money before he set foot at Boeing there was zero incentive for the mane to produce any good result and he has not been good , go figure . I sold my shares at over $90 during the 747-400 when Frank said he would bury airbus by selling 747-400 at less than cost.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371882428648</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 02:27:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371882447213-9</Id><Topic><Title>QE1 started 11/25/2008 ,&amp; still going , so how did that work for BA ,Airbus, Disney,TSLA which is better</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1371855782279</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 19:03:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Green Energy and Obama care is and will be a waste of taxpayers money."

In a letter penned by the Treasury, James Underwood of the Rights Unit, provides answers to three questions penned by Alexander Baron of the Digital Journal. In his May 7th letter, Baron asked whether George Osborne, Britain’s head finance minister, would attend the Bilderberg meeting held in Watford from 6-9 June. He also asked in what capacity Osborne would be attending and who would be paying for his expenses. The Treasury responded AFTER the conclusion of the conference to confirm that Osborne did indeed attend, and that his expenses would be paid for by the Treasury – ie the taxpayer.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371904008350</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 08:26:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371905583064-19</Id><Topic><Title>Paula Deen Fired By The Food Network for Racism</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371852761478</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 18:12:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't suppose that Hooz and the Kent Kook are the same guy do you ?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371905583064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 08:53:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371905728390-20</Id><Topic><Title>NSA Whistleblower: NSA Spying On – and Blackmailing – Top Government Officials</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371812236542</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 06:57:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Central banks have all the resources....now have the intelligence organization collecting the data...YES...they have the power and the will to control our politicians</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371905728390</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 08:55:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371905856203-21</Id><Topic><Title>Soldiers Died for Freedom</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1371776881654</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 21:08:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right ...and exactly WHERE does it claim that in order to keep us safe that Government will spy on us ?

"It's just what they are—they're jokes ... most jokes are about Je wish people, rednecks, black folks. ... I can't determine what offends another person." And this is alleged but, by this time, most people seem to believe it: "According to the court documents, the plaintiff stated that she was appointed by Deen to handle the catering and staff for Bubba's wedding in 2007, and she asked Deen what the servers should wear; "Well what I would really like is a bunch of little n***ers to wear long-sleeve white shirts, black shorts and black bow ties, you know in the Shirley Temple days, they used to tap dance around," the plaintiff alleged Deen told her. "Now, that would be a true Southern wedding wouldn't it? But we can't do that because the media would be on me about that." Roughly 50% to 60% of the American people would voluntarily boycott her show because of this. That's why people are distancing themselves from her. It was a business decision, and you are in favor of free enterprise, correct? She will hurt their business by losing customers... likely over half of them.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371920067824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 12:54:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371920608723-63</Id><Topic><Title>Paula Deen Fired By The Food Network for Racism</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371852761478</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 18:12:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i'm not convinced chrissie (you) n spart aren't one in the same person...though i think your character has a tougher time expressing a coherent thought, whether it be ridiculous or not. your IDs are both used to cut n paste the worst from the yellow journalist society, when left to your own thoughts you have more trouble spitting out more than a line or two...unless it's incoherent worship / drool about "sir paul" or barack n moochelle.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1371920608723</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 13:03:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371921083283-64</Id><Topic><Title>Paula Deen Fired By The Food Network for Racism</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371852761478</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 18:12:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Regardless, doesn't a business have a right to distance itself from a polarizing figure who might cost that business a tremendous amount of customers?

Are you against the freedom to not wish to be associated with Deen?</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371921083283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 13:11:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371921179187-65</Id><Topic><Title>Paula Deen Fired By The Food Network for Racism</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371852761478</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 18:12:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are you promoting your racism???</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1371921179187</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 13:12:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371921233952-66</Id><Topic><Title>Bulky Bob ...........................

By David Bauder A finger-pointing political argument on Fox News Channel boiled over when a male conservative talk show host shouted at a woman to “know your role and shut your mouth.” The man, Bill Cunningham, later asked Fox contributor Tamara Holder, “Are you going to cry?” Fox on-air personalities on Friday were talking about the exchange on Sean Hannity’s prime-time show the night before. Commentator Juan Williams concluded that Cunningham “obliterated the line” of civil discourse in his argument with Holder. The two had been brought on by Hannity to discuss whether Attorney General Eric Holder — no relation to Tamara — had committed perjury. Cunningham, sitting next to Tamara Holder in a New York studio, called her “one of the stooges of the left that will always be there to excuse away criminal behavior.” He said she had the “incurable fatal condition of liberalism that caused people like Eric Holder to be the consulary of Barack Hussein Obama.” He was jabbing a finger at Holder, who returned the favor. “I really hope that when you speak to a judge, you don’t point your finger in the person’s face the entire time,” she said. “Your finger does not make your point.” Cunningham is a former assistant attorney general in Ohio whose wife is on the Ohio Court of Appeals. He hosts radio and television talk shows. “Whose finger is in my face right now?” Cunningham asked. Replied Holder: “Mine, because I’m telling you to shut up.” “You shut up!” Cunningham said. “Know your role and shut your mouth.” Cunningham could not be reached for comment Friday. It was only three weeks after another exchange on Fox, where daytime host Megyn Kelly said she was offended by a male colleague’s suggestion that children of working mothers don’t fare as well as children with stay-at-home moms. One Fox contributor, Erick Erickson, said that in nature, males were traditionally dominant. Later, Cunningham repeated his assertion that Holder was a “liberal stooge and an excuse-monger for the Obama administration.” After Holder paused, Cunningham asked, “What, are you going to cry?” “No, I’m not going to cry,” Holder said. Admonished by Hannity at the end of their segment to shake hands, they refused. “I don’t shake hands with trolls,” Holder said. Things were still smoldering on Friday when Fox returned to the argument. Daytime host Martha McCollum hosted a segment with Williams and Fox contributor Mary Katherine Ham on whether the combatants had gone too far. “The merits of the argument might be on the Cunningham side,” Ham said, “but I’m on Team Tamara on the comment of knowing your role.”</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371930465659</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 15:47:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371930728380-75</Id><Topic><Title>It's Nice To Be Fair and Balanced</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371930465659</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 15:47:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody cares about your DFC propaganda and made up "cry me a river " stories...............now run along dipstick.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1371930728380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 15:52:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371931111089-76</Id><Topic><Title>It's Nice To Be Fair and Balanced</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1371930465659</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 15:47:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I never know what you are talking about.

There may have been a claim to whistle blower status early on, but when the secrets about other countries started, it changed to something else. So what is espionage? Webster and other have definitions that a team of lawyers could debate. It stealing secrets for sure. Wikipedia has a more complete and probably usable description. {{{{Espionage or spying involves a government or individual obtaining information considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as it is taken for granted that it is unwelcome and, in many cases illegal and punishable by law. It is a subset of intelligence gathering, which otherwise may be conducted from public sources and using perfectly legal and ethical means. It is crucial to distinguish espionage from intelligence gathering, as the latter does not necessarily involve espionage, but often collates open-source information.}}}} Using this definition Snowden did it. Using this definition the NSA also did it. Sure NSA with try to hide in the last half of the def. and claim intelligence gathering. That dog won"t hunt. Does any informed citizen think the NSA was amassing information on them for national security reasons? Or were they a organization out of control. One the could operated without regards or constraints. Take Puget Sound or any other area or even nationally. If this Snowden could have any info he desired simply by a couple of keyboard strokes. Lets say he was a political activist, who wanted to help is party or desired candidates succeed. Or say he was criminally inclined who wanted improve his financial success in the markets and a number of other ways. Perhaps a blackmailer, or into using his position for mischief or harm to people. There is just unlimited opportunity for misdeeds.
