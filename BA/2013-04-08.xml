An AVERAGE recession lasts 6-9 months, the one we had was not average, it was just short of a depression, and the worst downturn since The Great Depression. Rebound time is typically proportional to the length and depth of the recession. The things that usually move you out of recession are new industries, the 40's had WW2, the 60's had the space race, the 80's had both the PC industry (brand new) and the software industry it spawned, the 90's had the internet, the 2k's had the housing boom (which turned out to be a house of cards).

Sharing a common architecture, flight software and simplified payload integration options, the satellites could perform missions ranging from intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance to planetary science. “Our customers need greater mission flexibility from smaller satellites that can be built more affordably, and delivered more quickly, without sacrificing quality,” said Boeing Phantom Works President Darryl Davis. “Building upon the success Boeing has had with expanding our 702 satellite family, we’ve rapidly developed a line of satellites to address the market between large geosynchronous spacecraft and nanosatellites.”</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1365451636376</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 16:07:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365451660021-78</Id><Title>New high After hours$$</Title><Msg>Boeing is going to blast off when the 787 starts up$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1365451660021</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 16:07:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365452879439-79</Id><Topic><Title>Skyscraper totally engulfed by fire...does not collapse !!!!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365112172703</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 17:49:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Four aliases!</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1365452879439</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 16:27:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365453971693-80</Id><Topic><Title>The Republican Party is officially broken</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_765</Username><Timestamp>1365285220227</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 17:53:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are one funny fascist facehole.</Msg><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1365453971693</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 16:46:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365454467564-81</Id><Topic><Title>The Kent Raven is orly taint and hooz</Title><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1365395848946</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 00:37:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Names!

Let's get rid of Republican party. They are wimps. One party system is the best - it's much easier to pass 50B bailouts to bankers, raise taxes on evil rich people and subsidize socially responsible but unprofitable business. Remember the German federal elections of March 1933 ? One party won, others were too weak and broken. How about Italy general elections 1924 ? The majority party got 64.9%! Of course, it was the problem with other parties, not the one that won election . Have you seen life size cardboard cut outs of The Great President in school libraries ? It's only a visual aid for the pledge of allegiance . How about an amazing shot of The Great President holding a baby - it was during one of his campaign stops last fall. The future is bright and if some rich people are having second thoughts and doubts they will be helped.</Msg><Username>surrealskiller</Username><Timestamp>1365454772344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 16:59:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365454956211-84</Id><Topic><Title>None Dare Call it Treason</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1365095629698</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 13:13:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://finance.yahoo.com/mbview/threadview/?&amp;bn=7d8d92d6-c287-340e-8126-be6d06b3eecf&amp;tid=1365095629698-bd41def7-85f8-4099-a418-a9c5f1a369d6&amp;tls=la%2Cd%2C8%2C3#mbt=Posts%2520by%2520randroids&amp;mbl=http%253A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fmbview%2Fuserview%2F%253B_ylt%253DAgqlz9mb8nGqM2F934V4wIfeAohG%253B_ylu%253DX3oDMTB1dXVjdG40BHBvcwMxBHNlYwNNZWRpYU1zZ0JvYXJkc1hIUlVsdA--%253B_ylg%253DX3oDMTBhYWM1a2sxBGxhbmcDZW4tVVM-%253B_ylv%253D3%253F_media.modules.msgboards.switches._enable_mbv2%253D1%2526u%253Drandroids%2526bn%253D7d8d92d6-c287-340e-8126-be6d06b3eecf&amp;mbtc=mb-tab-user</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1365454956211</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 17:02:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365455532784-85</Id><Topic><Title>please , please , please , is t here a Boeing Hack that can tell us if the decertified 787 is flying today</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365434660083</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 11:24:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>can we get an update on the decertified outsourced 787 next test flight this is crucial to any investor wanting to know about the 4% return on his money in the past 5 years , while Airbus is expanding into the cheap workforce in the USA Boeing is laying off in Washington lets hear it for over 100% return with Airbus stock inthe last 5 years and not worry about when the Airbus will be flying its next 787 beater planes</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365455532784</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 17:12:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365455737200-86</Id><Topic><Title>Red Flag alert Boeing is a laggard stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365194780135</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 16:46:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>is the decertified 787 flying today</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365455737200</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 17:15:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365455805531-87</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus relocating to Alabama , stock up over 100% in 5 years Boeing stock up 4% in 5 years relocated to chicago</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365434332654</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 11:18:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>can a Boeing hack let us know if the de certified cheap made 3 year late 787 is flying today? we all can't figure it out on our own</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365455805531</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 17:16:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365455853933-88</Id><Topic><Title>Airbus return for 5 years is 114% Boeing return on investment for 5 years is 4% dead cat bounce red flag</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365231092292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 02:51:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow Boing is a 4% return for 5 years lets hear it for the Boeing Hacks</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1365455853933</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 17:17:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365455985282-89</Id><Topic><Title>Skyscraper totally engulfed by fire...does not collapse !!!!!</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1365112172703</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 17:49:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Molten or melted steel was testified to by 5 PhDs and a FDNY Captain. 2 of the PhDs were engineering professors (Berkeley and MIT).

New York Times April 6, 2013 Taping of Farm Cruelty Is Becoming the Crime By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. On one covert video, farm workers illegally burn the ankles of Tennessee walking horses with chemicals. Another captures workers in Wyoming punching and kicking pigs and flinging piglets into the air. And at one of the country’s largest egg suppliers, a video shows hens caged alongside rotting bird corpses, while workers burn and snap off the beaks of young chicks. Each video — all shot in the last two years by undercover animal rights activists — drew a swift response: Federal prosecutors in Tennessee charged the horse trainer and other workers, who have pleaded guilty, with violating the Horse Protection Act. Local authorities in Wyoming charged nine farm employees with cruelty to animals. And the egg supplier, which operates in Iowa and other states, lost one of its biggest customers, McDonald’s, which said the video played a part in its decision. But a dozen or so state legislatures have had a different reaction: They proposed or enacted bills that would make it illegal to covertly videotape livestock farms, or apply for a job at one without disclosing ties to animal rights groups. They have also drafted measures to require such videos to be given to the authorities almost immediately, which activists say would thwart any meaningful undercover investigation of large factory farms. Critics call them “Ag-Gag” bills. Some of the legislation appears inspired by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a business advocacy group with hundreds of state representatives from farm states as members. The group creates model bills, drafted by lobbyists and lawmakers, that in the past have included such things as “stand your ground” gun laws and tighter voter identification rules. One of the group’s model bills, “The Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act,” prohibits filming or taking pictures on livestock farms to “defame the facility or its own</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1365467750042</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 20:35:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365467862916-117</Id><Topic><Title>You just CAN'T make this $hit up....</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1365467750042</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 20:35:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of the group’s model bills, “The Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act,” prohibits filming or taking pictures on livestock farms to “defame the facility or its owner.” Violators would be placed on a “terrorist registry.” Officials from the group did not respond to a request for comment. Animal rights activists say they have not seen legislation that would require them to register as terrorists, but they say other measures — including laws passed last year in Iowa, Utah and Missouri — make it nearly impossible to produce similar undercover exposés. Some groups say that they have curtailed activism in those states. “It definitely has had a chilling effect on our ability to conduct undercover investigations,” said Vandhana Bala, general counsel for Mercy for Animals, which has shot many videos, including the egg-farm investigation in 2011. (McDonald’s said that video showed “disturbing and completely unacceptable” behavior, but that none of the online clips were from the Iowa farm that supplied its eggs. Ms. Bala, though, said that some video showing bird carcasses in cages did come from that facility.) The American Farm Bureau Federation, which lobbies for the agricultural and meat industries, criticized the mistreatment seen on some videos. But the group cautions that some methods represent best practices endorsed by animal-care experts. The videos may seem troubling to someone unfamiliar with farming, said Kelli Ludlum, the group’s director of Congressional relations, but they can be like seeing open-heart surgery for the first time. “They could be performing a perfect procedure, but you would consider it abhorrent that they were cutting a person open,” she said. In coming weeks, Indiana and Tennessee are expected to vote on similar measures, while states from California to Pennsylvania continue to debate them. Opponents have scored some recent victories, as a handful of bills have died, including those in New Mexico and New Hampshire.
