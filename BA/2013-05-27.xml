It's doubtful if America can ever recover from 16 years of their destructive leadership. The dems have been totally taken over by mindless fanatics. The Bush fanatics are making good progress in taking over the republican party, but at least there, people are still fignting back. They can't always win against this evil. Romney was proof of that. but the struggle continues. Unfortunately our election process is not secure. That is the obvious weak point that America has, and it is being exploted by our enemys in addition to entrenched politicians who just want to stay in power and are willing to ignore the problem if it means they can keep their positions of power. America will rapidly become weaker as the economy is looted and the population is flooded with immigrants who can't understand american democracy. At some point the destructive policies will be too obvious to ignore. Then things will change!

Really, joe? I never noticed that. Did you ever read the story of Medgar Evers? As spartacus would say, Google it. Or how about the Mississippi civil rights workers' murders? Or the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing? I could go on... and on and on and on but, suffice to say, a lot of murders took place and nobody ever seemed to see anything. Devout Christians would place their hands on a bible and swear to tell the truth... and then lie repeatedly. How hard could it have been to solve these horrendous crimes? Turns out, very hard. But that's just how Christians are. They are natural born liars. I saw a history-oriented story on television about a mother and son who were the last surviving members of a family of five. The dad and two other sons were killed, dismembered, and found at the bottom of a lake... after church, of course; it would be immoral to blow a guy's head off and dismember the body if you miss church. Let's assume that 86.73% of a Christians are murderous thugs. Now assume that the other 13.27% are too cowardly to turn them in. That doesn't make the 13.27% immoral. Do I have that about right?</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369669833043</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 11:50:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369670611883-21</Id><Topic><Title>Some thoughts on religion</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369584007954</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 12:00:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can read all kinds of examples hooz.

While each circumstance is different, cops should be better trained to avoid the immediate reaction of the use of deadly force" Whan i lived in the SF bay area (some would incorrectly refer to it as liberalsville) trigger happy dirty harry wonna be's cops always shot to kill and asked no questions later. Those cops took they're paid administrative leave, went golfing, and returned to duty shortly. As it has been said leave no wounded or maimed suspect alive that could turn around sue the city, or explain how the cop shot them in the back face down on the ground. Cops have at their disposal an arsenal of non-lethal weapons that continues to grow and kevlar. Life is cheap in this over crowd society of mediocrity. Yes, I concur that "cops should be better trained to avoid the immediate reaction of the use of deadly force". However, I see cops like bears. Once a bear has had the taste of human blood the only way to deal with that bear is to either move they so far away from civilization they're never seen again or in the alternative remove their teeth. I realize cops have tough jobs. However, I know many cops that voluntarily left the vocation of engineering to become cops because of all the benies. Cops today see themselves as judge, jury and executioner and that needs to come out and society needs to demand suspects taken alive.</Msg><Username>paul_revere_patriotsssssssss</Username><Timestamp>1369683629669</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 15:40:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369683656727-47</Id><Topic><Title>TO THOSE WHO SERVED</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1369581575195</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 11:19:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My name fits me better than you know.
