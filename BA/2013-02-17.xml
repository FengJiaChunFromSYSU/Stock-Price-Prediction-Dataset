The pilots got 50% of what they were promissed after a career of work .UAL Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2002 and the ESOP was terminated.The losers in United's bankruptcy are those employees who have dedicated themselves and who have built United Airlines into a great company.

Despite our advancements over the last tens or even hundreds of years, some ‘experts’ believe that humans are losing cognitive capabilities and becoming more emotionally unstable. One Stanford University researcher and geneticist, Dr. Gerald Crabtree, believes that our intellectual decline as a race has much to do with adverse genetic mutations. According to Crabtree, our cognitive and emotional capabilities are fueled and determined by the combined effort of thousands of genes. If a mutation occurred in any of of these genes, which is quite likely, then intelligence or emotional stability can be negatively impacted. “I would wager that if an average citizen from Athens of 1000 BC were to appear suddenly among us, he or she would be among the brightest and most intellectually alive of our colleagues and companions, with a good memory, a broad range of ideas, and a clear-sighted view of important issues. Furthermore, I would guess that he or she would be among the most emotionally stable of our friends and colleagues,” the geneticist began his article in the scientific journal Trends in Genetics. Further, the geneticist explains that people with specific adverse genetic mutations are more likely than ever to survive and live amongst the ‘strong.’ Darwin’s theory of ‘survival of the fittest’ is less applicable in today’s society, therefore those with better genes will not necessarily dominate in society as they would have in the past. While this hypothesis does have some merit: are genes really the primary reason for the overall cognitive decline of the human race? If humans really are lacking in intelligence more than before, it’s important to recognize other possible causes. Let’s take a look at how our food system plays a role in all of this. It’s sad, but true; our food system today is contributing to lower intelligence across the board. The Water Supply, Fluoride is Lowering Your IQ Researchers from Harvard have found that a substance rampant in the nation’s water supply, fluoride, is lowering IQ and dumbing down the population. The researchers, who had their findings published in the prominent journal Environmental Health Perspectives, a federal government medical journal stemming from the U.S National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, concluded that ”our results support the possibility of adverse effects of fluoride exposures on children’s neurodevelopment”. “In this study we found a significant dose-response relation between fluoride level in serum and children’s IQ…This is the 24th study that has found this association”. One attorney, Paul Beeber, NYSCOF President, weighs in on the research by saying: “It’s senseless to keep subjecting our children to this ongoing fluoridation experiment to satisfy the political agenda of special-interest groups. Even if fluoridation reduced cavities, is tooth health more important than brain health? It’s time to put politics aside and stop artificial fluoridation everywhere”. Pesticides are Diminishing Intelligence One study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that pesticides, which are rampant among the food supply, are creating lasting changes in overall brain structure — changes that have been linked to lower intelligence levels and decreased cognitive function. Specifically, the researchers found that a pesticide known as chlorpyrifos (CPF) has been linked to ”significant abnormalities”. Further, the negative impact was found to occur even at low levels of exposure. Lead researcher Virginia Rauh, a professor at the Mailman School of Public Health, summarized the findings: “Toxic exposure during this critical period can have far-reaching effects on brain development and behavioral functioning.” Processed Foods, High Fructose Corn Syrup Making People ‘Stupid’ Following 14,000 children, British researchers uncovered the connection between processed foods and reduced IQ. After recording the children’s’ diets and analyzing questionnaires submitting by the parents, the researchers found that if children were consuming a processed diet at age 3, IQ decline could begin over the next five years. The study found that by age 8, the children had suffered the IQ decline. On the contrary, children who ate a nutrient-rich diet including fruit and vegetables were found to increase their IQ over the 3 year period. The foods considered nutrient-rich by the researchers were most likely conventional fruits and vegetables. Interestingly, one particular ingredient ubiquitous in processed foods and sugary beverages across the globe -high fructose corn syrup – has been tied to reduced IQ. The UCLA researchers coming to these findings found that HFCS may be damaging the brain functions of consumers worldwide, sabotaging learning and memory. In fact, the official release goes as far to say that high-fructose corn syrup can make you ‘stupid’. Gene mutations may have something to do with our ongoing decline in intelligence, but let’s stop to think for a moment what we’re doing to ourselves to make this decline even more prominent.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361108902670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 08:48:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361110507862-10</Id><Topic><Title>Leading Geneticist: Human Intelligence is Slowly Declining</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361108902670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 08:48:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well considering the advent of baggers and RWNJs its not surprising to hear about the gradual decline of the human intellect from scientists.

The facts are what they are, try dealing with them in a rational manner w/o tthrowing race bomb of PC driven insults. Maslov identified the behavior posted here very well. He was exactly correct and most blacks do behaive at the lowest level in the triangle. Also noted is the complete failure of the education system to accomplish any kind of turnaround. In fact the real message is, the lower the standards get set, in order to accomodate the lower performance, the lower the bar has to be reset again. There is no evidence that lowering academic standards to imrpove self esteem ever accomplished acceptable results in the long run.This is also a result predicted by Dr. Peter Senge , "The Fifth Discipline", in the archetype he calls.."Fixes that Fail". In other words, this is all predicted and will only change when the standards are reset. When failures are called failures and must tbe dealt with in consequnce then,. gradually, the system capable of repairing itself. This can only start by abandoning the PC attidtudes which accuse rationale behaivor as bigoted. It is what it is, political correctness, and it does not help a thing.</Msg><Username>nidan7500</Username><Timestamp>1361114639333</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 10:23:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361116620466-19</Id><Topic><Title>Dumb as a Doorknob: Academic Performance of Blacks Continues to Decline</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1361038855951</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 13:20:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More and more of the right wingers are racist, bigoted, intolerant, uncompromising and uncaring people.

(February 16, 2013, by Colombo) MORE Read all 35 comments Post a comment advertising Boeing will propose to regulators as early as this week a short-term fix to bolster the 787’s defenses in case of battery fires like those that have kept the jet grounded for the past month. The goal is to get the planes flying passengers again, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the matter, while Boeing works on a comprehensive redesign of the lithium-ion battery system that could take nine months or more to implement. The interim fix includes a heavy-duty titanium or steel containment box around the battery cells, and high-pressure evacuation tubes that, in the event of a battery fire, would vent any gases directly to the outside of the jet. Boeing's approach implicitly acknowledges that four weeks after two batteries overheated — one catching fire on the ground, the other smoldering in flight — investigators have still not pinpointed the cause. That leaves Boeing little option for now but to engineer a solution that will better contain any such incident and protect the airplane. However, it’s unclear if the FAA is ready yet to accept containment of an overheated battery cell rather than prevention. “We’re not there yet,” said a government official with knowledge of the ongoing discussions, who asked for anonymity. “It wouldn’t surprise me if we’re still talking weeks before everyone is comfortable.” Even if the FAA agrees, the short-term fix will take at least three months to design, test, certify and retrofit, said an Everett source who knows details of Boeing’s proposed solutions. That would mean the earliest the Dreamliners could fly passengers again would be May. If it’s much longer than that, assembly of the jets in Everett will probably have to be slowed and Boeing’s plan to ramp up production will be severely disrupted, he said.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1361117004765</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 11:03:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361117862959-21</Id><Topic><Title>Tim Tebow's Positive Message</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1361053082407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 17:18:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wise to prepare for the End Times.

An additional thought. There are the “end times” which contemporary so-called “survivalists” anticipate and prepare for and then there are the “end times” which Jesus spoke of in Matthew chapter 24. Some may think of them as being one and the same, but that may be an error. It is possible for our society to degenerate into chaos bringing on a “proverbial” end-times, and, thus, shelter/bunkers and storehouses of food may temporarily stave off one’s demise. For that which Jesus was speaking of preceding the final judgment, there is only one method of preparation: believe on Jesus as Savior.

D. Heyes NaturalNews February 17, 2013 Is chronic, slow economic growth and rising poverty the new normal for America and Americans? Unfortunately, for an increasing number of people, the answer is yes. According to recent reports, a large and growing portion of American workers who are having trouble making ends meet because of rising costs are being forced to raid their retirement accounts for non-retirement needs, “raising broad questions about the effectiveness of one of the most important savings vehicles for old age,” The Boston Globe said. In fact, more than one in four – a staggering 25 percent of workers – with 401(k) and similar retirement savings accounts are now using them to pay current bills, new data indicates. The monetary figure is alarming: A quarter of the $293 billion deposited in such accounts each year is now being drained via loans, withdrawals and out-right cash-outs, “undermining already shaky retirement security for millions of Americans,” the paper said. The new normal – Faltering finances What’s worse is that the federal government is broke, too; the country is already trillions of dollars in debt and tens of trillions in the hole for unfunded promises made over the years by pandering politicians who have mortgaged the future of generations of Americans to buy votes today. Because of their irresponsibility, policymakers will now have to cut the Social Security and Medicare benefits at some point – benefits that millions of Americans who paid into both systems were counting on to make it through retirement. Couple this eventuality with sustained low economic growth, poor employment prospects, stagnating pay scales and rising costs of food, fuel and utilities, and it is easy to see how more Americans will eventually be forced to mortgage their future. “We’re going from bad to worse,” Diane Oakley, executive director of the National Institute on Retirement Security, told the Globe. “Already, fewer private-sector workers have access to stable pension plans. And the savings in individual retirement savings accounts like 401(k) plans – which already are severely underfunded – continue to leak out at a high rate.” Financial advisory firm HelloWallet released a report in January stating that more than one in four workers has been forced to dip into retirement funds to make house payments, settle credit card debt and other bills. The firm said workers in their 40s were most likely to dip; of that group, one-third are raiding retirement funds. New data from Vanguard, one of the country’s biggest 401(k) managers, show an increase of 12 percent in the number for working Americans who either took out loans against their retirement accounts or withdrew money from them outright since 2008. Firms say the most common way Americans raid is through loans which must then be repaid with interest. Also, anyone who withdraws money from accounts early pays a significant penalty; in most cases, that is in the form of a 10 percent federal tax penalty, but those workers will also pay capital gains taxes, which are substantial. “The costs are financially harmful to families, but money-management firms reap massive fees,” the Globe reported. What’s more, employers are getting shafted in a sense: Those who subsidize worker contributions with matching funds are doing so under the assumption they are helping workers secure their retirements. You may not know it yet, but your future has already been mortgaged “I don’t think this can be ignored. Employers are dramatically overpaying for retirement, but it is not benefiting the employee,” Matt Fellowes, a former Brookings Institution researcher who is now chief executive of HelloWallet, told the Globe. “In many cases, the only one benefiting is the vendor.” Since 401(k) retirement accounts were created by Congress in 1978, traditional employer-provided pensions have declined, leaving the former as the primary retirement funding vehicle. But as the economy continues to under-perform and inflationary pressures grow, more workers will be forced to raid retirement funds for their future in order to make ends meet today. “401(k)s are not being used for retirement by a large and growing share of workers because they are misaligned with the very basic financial problems most workers face and must address,” Fellowes added. Welcome to America in collapse, brought to you by a self-serving political class and paid for with your future.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361146603209</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 19:16:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361149215440-44</Id><Topic><Title>Citizens now desperately raiding 401(k) plans to pay bills long before retirement</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361146603209</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 19:16:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The worst raider of all...Obama wants to raid your 401 (K) plan !!!!</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1361149215440</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 20:00:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361149408960-45</Id><Topic><Title>Tim Tebow's Positive Message</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1361053082407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 17:18:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I'm fine with your right to choose and say whatever your wish, but isn't that also stating that roughly 80% of the world's population isn't preparing correctly?"

I have to wonder if BA in the first place had considered a containment system like they are now proposing, but for cost and weight reasons decided against it. Next will be to find a solution to keep the batteries from having catastrophic failures, and keep them working safely through there intended lifespans. Which will likely center around a new BMS (battery management system), which from some of what I have heard, I suspect it lacked the sophistication needed to protect the battery fully to the cell level such a powerful battery needs for safe reliable operation. After all one item BA already said they are considering is adding temperature monitoring for the individual cells, something that should have been there from day one. As a mater of fact I think if they had had that in the first place the LI batteries may have never become the issue they have become. The fact is most of the time one of the time a single cell starting to overheat will be the first sign something is going wrong, and if you are monitoring it the BMS can shut down the charger to let it cool down before it melts down. You have to in hindsight ask why they didn't do this in the first place?</Msg><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1361159387207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 22:49:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361159398316-55</Id><Topic><Title>Leading Geneticist: Human Intelligence is Slowly Declining</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1361108902670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 08:48:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>perverts, child molestors, drug addicts, felons, deadbeats those would be your baggers and ignorant racist rednecks hawfaeces</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1361159398316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 22:49:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361159698616-56</Id><Topic><Title>Battery Fix As I Predicted</Title><Username>stocksentinel</Username><Timestamp>1361159387207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 22:49:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh they had HIND sight OK.

Hooz, that is an interesting question and a trap. You and I only know what is in our own heads and not each other – or Chris and Spartacus, for that matter. We guess and surmise based upon information, things said, and biases. We think we know, but we do not – whether that person is in the room with us or is ten thousand miles away. I believe that God is a just God and I am not inclined to judge Him relative to how He executes on His judgment. But it is incumbent upon me, as well as you, to decide individually what we will believe and then later give an account at that time of final judgment - where there will no longer be any doubt or debate as to what is true and what was false. Just for one moment, center your thoughts on yourself and eternity. Ignore the distraction of what you might “think” is going on with others, then focus on what it meant for the Father to give His only Son to suffer and die on the cross for your sins – in order to reconcile you to God. In order to fix the “sin problem”. First things first. Get your relationship set with God, then go about to understand God’s mercies and His judgments. I have shared this with you before: “Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker, to him who is but a potsherd among the potsherds on the ground. Does the clay say to the potter, 'What are you making?' Does your work say, 'He has no hands'?” (Isaiah 45:9). And, yes, Jesus makes it very clear, salvation is only through Him (John 3:18 and John 14:6).</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1361160284988</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 23:04:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
