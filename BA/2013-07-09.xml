Rick Perry announced yesterday that he would not seek reëlection, telling supporters, “The time has come to pass the mantle of leadership to a new generation of boneheads.” “I’ve had a good run,” he said. “But after twelve years, someone else who isn’t playing with a full deck should take a turn at the wheel.” Reflecting on his twelve years as governor, Mr. Perry said that he had “no regrets” except for being incoherent the entire time. Before leaving office, Gov. Perry said that he would propose three signature bills “just to let future Texans know how Rick Perry marked his territory.” The first bill would require all voters in the state to have an I.D. with a photo of a white person; the second would force anyone filibustering an anti-abortion bill to ride a mechanical bull; and the third he could not remember.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373376406300</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:26:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373376481224-49</Id><Topic><Title>Freedom and ‘Our Sacred Honor’</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373307662378</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 14:21:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This from a guy who thinks Sarah Palin has anything of value to say.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373376481224</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:28:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373376524442-50</Id><Title>Thank You President Obama</Title><Msg>Another green day n the markets</Msg><Username>andse2003</Username><Timestamp>1373376524442</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:28:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373377237932-51</Id><Topic><Title>Thank You President Obama</Title><Username>andse2003</Username><Timestamp>1373376524442</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:28:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hear-hear!</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1373377237932</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:40:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373377786939-52</Id><Title>PREDICTION INTACT...</Title><Msg>$ 108-110 by earnings...$ 120+++++ by year's end.

I have shared this before, and will again: "They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness." (1 Thess 2:10-12) This verse has a different intended meaning than simply being related to that people want to forsake their constitutional rights, but the principle is the same. Too many people these days do not love the truth and are consequently "slavish", as you put it, to "charming" leaders. Hence, when that day comes that the wicked one appears (verse 9) these same folks will stand in line to shake his hand. On a related note, recall that Justice Ginsberg suggested to the Egyptians that they do not use the United States Constitution as a model but use a "modern constitution". To wit, she said, "I would not look to the U.S. Constitution, if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012." Apparently, the liberal group-think of Ginsberg discounted the unprecedented stability of nearly 250 years under the same foundation of law. And then, following Ginsberg's advice, Egypt's government falls apart less than one year later.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1373384495662</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 11:41:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373384865471-66</Id><Topic><Title>Odds are the GOP will keep the house and win the Senate</Title><Username>franknsteinx</Username><Timestamp>1373252991020</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 23:09:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lets see, Senator McCain wants to immediately cut off a billion dollars of aid to the Egyptian military.

Today, courtesy of the monthly JOLTS survey we got just the confirmation we needed that, indeed, the official non-farm payroll number as per the Establishment Survey has been substantially off to the tune of a whopping 40% above what is quantitatively happening in reality.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373387139294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 12:25:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373387464688-71</Id><Topic><Title>Exposing The Lie Behind The Nonfarm Payroll Numbers...much to the dismay of hooz#$%$</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373387139294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 12:25:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who is "Tyler Durden" and how do we know he's not a liar?</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1373387464688</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 12:31:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373387693128-72</Id><Topic><Title>Exposing The Lie Behind The Nonfarm Payroll Numbers...much to the dismay of hooz#$%$</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373387139294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 12:25:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i don't, all I know is I trust him more than i trust the barack hussein and his dumb party, whom i KNOW are liars...just like you</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373387693128</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 12:34:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373387832429-73</Id><Topic><Title>Obama supporters sign petition asking to REPEAL THE BILL OF RIGHTS</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1373369917046</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 07:38:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It would be racist to oppose your president's assaults on the Bill of Rights, Sparticus.

The largest tax cuts for the rich came from Democrat JFK, the second biggest cuts for the rich were during the Reagan administration and the third was during the George W. Bush presidency. Each time unemployment dropped below 4% - considered full employment - and government revenue increased. Low information and low IQ people will ask why deficits and the debt soared? It's simple take a look at a graph of the spending and if you're capable of rational thought (in other words, not a liberal) you'll be able to see spending far out paced the growth of revenue. So, cut taxes for rich people like myself, cut spending and welfare for societal leaches like Genna/Hoozdik and reduce burdensome and unnecessary rules and regulations on businesses and people will have jobs, the deficit will and the economy will be fundamentally transformed into one that works..... unlike the one we have today.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1373389665809</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:07:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373389819905-84</Id><Topic><Title>Exposing The Lie Behind The Nonfarm Payroll Numbers...much to the dismay of hooz#$%$</Title><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1373387139294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 12:25:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" I for one have my job seeker account at Worksource in Washington state continuously deleted."

The pilots are being debriefed, and are sequestered until that is finished. Debriefing is not an interrogation, it is more like a round table that may include other pilots: the object being to gain as much information as possible, not to cause the withholding of information. The exchange of information before the investigation is complete is more of a hindrance than helpful, as it can contaminate participants in the incident's memory of what happened. There is still a lot to analyze. While many are happy to settle on pilot error, there is still the possibility of systemic error involving computers or gages. It will all come out in the near future. The object of the investigation is to design in more added safety next time. Aside from the possibility of some sort of systemic failure, for all us 20/20 hindsighters, coming in over water is distorting to judgement.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1373391355994</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:35:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373391681846-98</Id><Topic><Title>You Want Job - Cut the Taxes of Rich People</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1373389665809</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:07:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Tinkle-down economics was discredited decades ago."

"Anyone who has been a judge will tell you a judge needs to hear both sides of a case," said James Robertson, a former federal district judge based in Washington who served on the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for 3 years between 2002 and 2005. Robertson spoke during a Tuesday hearing of a federal oversight board directed by President Barack Obama to scrutinize government spying. Robertson questioned whether the secret FISA court should provide legal approval for the surveillance programs, saying the court "has turned into something like an administrative agency." Much of the NSA's surveillance is overseen by the FISA court, which meets in secret and renders rulings that are classified.

Under normal circumstances, this could be a healthy, informed debate on a matter of overwhelming importance — the debate President Obama said he welcomed in the days after the revelations of the surveillance programs. But this is a debate in which almost none of us know what we’re talking about. As Eric Lichtblau reported in The Times on Sunday, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has for years been developing what is effectively a secret and unchallenged body of law on core Fourth Amendment issues, producing lengthy classified rulings based on the arguments of the federal government — the only party allowed in the courtroom. In recent years, the court, originally established by Congress to approve wiretap orders, has extended its reach to consider requests related to nuclear proliferation, espionage and cyberattacks. Its rulings, some of which approach 100 pages, have established the court as a final arbiter in these matters. But the court is as opaque as it is powerful. Every attempt to understand the court’s rulings devolves into a fog of hypothesis and speculation. The few public officials with knowledge of the surveillance court’s work either censor themselves as required by law, as Senator Ron Wyden has done in his valiant efforts to draw attention to the full scope of these programs, or they offer murky, even misleading statements, as the director of national intelligence, James Clapper Jr., did before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in March.

But when we think about government spending, and the taxes needed to finance its spending, we should also think of the effects of taxation. Suppose I hire you to repair my computer. The job is worth $200 to me and doing the job is worth $200 to you. The transaction will occur because we have a meeting of the mind. Now suppose there's the imposition of a 30 percent income tax on you. That means you won't receive $200 but instead $140. You might say the heck with working for me - spending the day with your family is worth more than $140. You might then offer that you'll do the job if I pay you $285. That way your after-tax earnings will be $200 - what the job was worth to you. There's a problem. The repair job was worth $200 to me not $285. So it's my turn to say the heck with it. This simple example demonstrates that one effect of taxes is that of eliminating transactions and hence jobs. But politicians have what we economists call a zero elasticity vision of the world. They think people will behave after taxes just as they behaved before taxes and the only effect of a tax is to bring in more revenue. Here's a question for you: would we and society be better off if you and I agreed to the repair job but not tell anybody?

The government in 2012 made 1,789 requests to conduct electronic surveillance; the court approved 1,788 (the government withdrew the other). It is possible that not a single one of these 1,788 requests violated established law, but the public will never know because no one was allowed to make a counterargument. When judicial secrecy is coupled with a one-sided presentation of the issues, the result is a court whose reach is expanding far beyond its original mandate and without any substantive check. This is a perversion of the American justice system, and it is not necessary. Even before the latest revelations of government snooping, some members of Congress were trying to provide that check. In a letter to the court in February, Senator Dianne Feinstein and three others asked that any rulings with a “significant interpretation of the law” be declassified. In response, the court’s presiding judge, Reggie Walton, wrote that the court could provide only summaries of its rulings, because the full opinions contained classified information. But he balked at releasing summaries, which he feared would create “misunderstanding or confusion.” It is difficult to imagine how releasing information would make the confusion worse. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, recently reintroduced a bill that would require declassification. It was defeated in December. In light of the national uproar over the most recent revelations, the leadership in Congress should push to pass it and begin to shine some light on this dark corner of the judicial system. We don’t know what we’ll find. The surveillance court may be strictly adhering to the limits of the Fourth Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Or not. And that’s the problem: This court has morphed into an odd hybrid that seems to exist outside the justice system, even as its power grows in ways that we can’t see.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373393096501</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 14:04:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373393180398-111</Id><Title>Trickle Down Theory' and 'Tax Cuts for the Rich</Title><Msg>Dr. Thomas Sowell’s “‘Trickle Down Theory' and 'Tax Cuts for the Rich’” has just been published by the Hoover Institution. Having read this short paper, the conclusion you must reach is that the term "trickle down theory" is simply a tool of charlatans and political hustlers. Sowell states that “no such theory has been found in even the most voluminous and learned histories of economic theories.” That’s from a scholar who has published extensively in the history of economic thought. Several years ago, Sowell, in his syndicated column, challenged anyone to name an economist from any economic school of thought who had actually advocated a “trickle down” theory. To date, no one has quoted any economist who ever advocated such a theory. Trickle down is a nonexistent theory. Those who use it simply argue against a caricature rather than confront an argument actually made. President Barack Obama recently criticized Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan for trying to sell a tax plan, which he called “trickledown snake oil.” Criticizing tax cuts as trickle down is a way not to confront the argument; however, there’s empirical evidence about the effects of tax cuts. Sowell shows that during the Warren Harding administration, in 1921, Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon advocated tax rate cuts, which were enacted into law by Congress. Afterward, there was rising output; unemployment plummeted; and the resulting higher income produced greater federal tax revenues, even though the tax rate had been lowered. There were somewhat similar results in later years after high tax rates were cut during the John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush administrations. The facts about the 1920s tax rate cuts are unmistakably clear for those who bother to check the facts. In 1921, when the tax rate on people earning more than $100,000 a year was 73 percent, the federal government collected a little more than $700 million in income taxes, of which 30 percent was paid by those earning more than $100,000. By 1929, after the tax rate had been cut to 24 percent on incomes higher than $100,000, the federal government collected more than $1 billion in income taxes, of which 65 percent was collected from those with incomes higher than $100,000. In 1962, Democratic President John F. Kennedy pointed out that “it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now.” Both Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush made similar arguments, and the tax rate cuts had the effect of stimulating economic growth while increasing federal tax revenue and shifting a greater percentage of the tax burden on to wealthier individuals. One very insightful part of Sowell’s paper is the discussion about what Mellon called the “gesture of taxing the rich” -- namely, tax-exempt securities that he tried unsuccessfully to put an end to. Tax-exempt securities and other tax breaks are valuable tools in the politics of class warfare and envy. Politicians have it both ways. They get votes by raising taxes on the wealthy -- or threatening to do so -- and at the same time provide the wealthy with a way out of high taxes through tax-exempt securities. This explains how President Obama can raise tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions from Hollywood millionaires and Wall Street’s rich and powerful. "Tax cuts for the rich" demagoguery is simply the height of deceit perpetrated on the gullible people and useful idiots. You can bet that the White House has people reading every bit of the news, including this column and Dr. Sowell’s article. You can bet some people in the news media will read it, as well. Despite the facts that Sowell has marshaled, they will continue to use trickle down theory and "tax cuts for the rich" demagoguery, even though they now have hard evidence to the contrary, because they can count on widespread gullibility and inability to do critical thinking.

I doubt this aircraft ran out of fuel but nonetheless this possibility must be investigated (it is the number one cause of plane crashes!). "They powered -up the engines" a few seconds before impact?

All I hope for is that we are told the truth about why this plane got busted-up. Thank God so many people escaped uninjured. A miracle by any measure!" That having been said, there's a very strong leaning towards that the pilots were attempting to consume as little fuel as possible during this descent/approach. We'll know this in a year.

(FOREIGN POLICY) -- The offices of a Dallas law firm representing a high-profile State Department whistleblower were broken into last weekend. Burglars stole three computers and broke into the firm's file cabinets. But silver bars, video equipment and other valuables were left untouched, according to local Fox affiliate KDFW, which aired security camera footage of the suspected burglars entering and leaving the offices around the time of the incident. The firm Schulman &amp; Mathias represents Aurelia Fedenisn, a former investigator at the State Department's Office of the Inspector General. In recent weeks, she raised a slew of explosive allegations against the department and its contractors ranging from illicit drug use, soliciting sexual favors from minors and prostitutes and sexual harassment. "It's a crazy, strange and suspicious situation," attorney Cary Schulman told The Cable. "It's clear to me that it was somebody looking for information and not money. My most high-profile case right now is the Aurelia Fedenisn case, and I can't think of any other case where someone would go to these great lengths to get our information. and to thing Hillary might be next.</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1373397182085</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 15:13:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373397237821-140</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden: Hero, Knave or Fool?</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373392716386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>say meouw again eventually they will lock-on to your location using out-dated technology for leaking bushco-era documents</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1373397237821</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 15:13:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373397729707-141</Id><Title>lets' get ahead of ouselves</Title><Msg>and say you ain;t seen nothing yet</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1373397729707</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 15:22:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373397872515-142</Id><Title>gregjanetommax - will the zimmerman thug take the stand</Title><Msg>in his own defence in the self-f\defence stand your ground trial law if not....</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1373397872515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 15:24:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373398098346-143</Id><Topic><Title>You Want Job - Cut the Taxes of Rich People</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1373389665809</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:07:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you have a knowledge of economics which must rival that of most cretins and idiots--Kennedy tax cuts were essentially for the middle class, Raygun did indeed cut taxes for the wealthy- and he ran the national debt up 4 trillion dollars- Clinton raised taxes a nominal amount and produced a boom and 3 budget surpluses after which GHW Bushes idiot son cut taxes running the debt up another 4.5 trillion dollars and now you and your republican butt kissers are advocating paying off the national debt--maybe you ought to get it straight once just what you want to do--BTW Rayguns economy barely got moving until after he got out of office</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1373398098346</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 15:28:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373398465866-144</Id><Topic><Title>The Economics of Liberal's Zero Elasticity Vision of the World</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1373392815223</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 14:00:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you aren't an economist- lets get that very straight- you don't know anymore about economics than my #$%$</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1373398465866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 15:34:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373398498917-145</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden: Hero, Knave or Fool?</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373392716386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am not Snowden.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1373398498917</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 15:34:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373398698517-146</Id><Title>Seeking Profiles of Courage</Title><Msg>There are members of Congress who now sharply criticize the NSA by calling for scrutiny of the secret agency in light of Snowden revelations.

There ain't nuth'n in no such trust funds. All that's in the trust funds are IOUs from the government. An unfunded liability is the amount owed minus the amount of liquid funds you actually have right now to pay for the liability. The current unfunded liability for Social Security is $16.5 Trillion (what's our total national debt? That's right $17 Trillion.) The unfunded liability for medicare is $86.5 Trillion. The Drug Prescription Program has an unfunded liability of $22 Trillion. Since there is no (nada, zilch, zero) money in the mythical trust funds, the money that is supposed to be there is replaced by payments from the general fund and funds borrowed from the Chinese and others.

Same at 70% And when they lower it to 28% and take away most of the deductions you used to get the amount you actually pay didn't change much at all. The one thing you can be sure of is the tyranny of the special interests who will make sure politician can always use the tax code to bestow favors that allow some people to make a lot of money and pay little or no taxes. You mediocre class guys will always get stuck with the bill no matter what the top marginal rate is.

The record suggests that you shouldn’t believe them, either. It pains me to sound like some Rand Paul acolyte. I promise I’m not wearing a tinfoil hat or scanning the leaden sky for black helicopters. I just wish our government would start treating us like adults — more important, like participants in a democracy — and stop lying. We can handle the truth. The starkest lie came in March at a Senate intelligence committee hearing, when Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked Director of National Intelligence James Clapper a simple question: “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?” Clapper replied, “No, sir.” As we’ve learned from Edward Snowden, a former analyst for an NSA contractor, Clapper’s answer was patently false. The agency collects metadata — essentially, a detailed log — of many and perhaps all of our domestic phone calls. Lying to Congress is a serious offense; baseball legend Roger Clemens was tried — and acquitted — on criminal charges for allegedly lying about steroid use at a congressional hearing. The chance that Clapper will face similar peril, however, is approximately zero. Following Snowden’s revelations, Clapper said that an honest answer to Wyden’s question would have required him to divulge highly classified secrets, so he gave the “least untruthful” answer he could come up with. Clapper apparently believes that “least” is a synonym for “most.” In a recent letter to the Senate intelligence committee, Clapper said he thought Wyden was asking about the content of domestic communications — which the NSA says it does not collect “wittingly,” for what that’s worth — rather than about the metadata. “Thus, my response was clearly erroneous,” Clapper wrote, “for which I apologize.” He sou</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373407101053</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 17:58:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373407253833-182</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden: Hero, Knave or Fool?</Title><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373392716386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 13:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He sounded like the cheating husband, caught in flagrante by his wife, who feigns surprise and says, “What mistress? Oh, you mean that mistress.” Clapper’s defenders say Wyden unfairly asked a question that he knew the director could not answer. But Wyden says he sent the question to Clapper’s office a day in advance — and gave him the chance to amend his answer afterward. Also untrue is President Obama’s assertion that the NSA surveillance programs are “transparent.” They are, in fact, completely opaque — or were, until Snowden started leaking the agency’s secrets. By what authority does the government collect data on our private communications? We don’t know. More accurately, we’re not permitted to know. A provision of the Patriot Act allows the FBI to seek warrants “requiring the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.” Seizing records that pertain to an investigation is not the same thing as compiling a comprehensive log of billions of domestic phone calls. How has the law been stretched — I mean, interpreted — to accommodate the NSA’s wish to compile a record of our contacts, associations and movements? The government refuses to tell us. We know that permission for this surveillance was granted by one or more judges of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. But the court’s proceedings and rulings are secret. We don’t know what argument the government made in seeking permission to conduct this kind of vacuum-cleaner surveillance. We don’t know what the court’s legal reasoning was in granting the authority. We don’t know whether the court considers other laws so elastic. We do know that the court’s secret hearings are not adversarial, meaning that there is no push-back from advocates of civil liberties. And we know that since its inception the court has approved more than 30,000 government requests for surveillance warrants and refused only 11. I accept that the administration officials, Justice Department lawyers, federal judges, FBI agents and NSA analysts involved in the phone surveillance and other programs are acting in good faith. The same is true of members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, who are supposed to be providing oversight. But honorable intentions are not enough — especially when we know that much of what these honorable officials have told us is false. The biggest lie of all? That the American people don’t even deserve to be told what their laws mean, much less how those laws are being used.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373407253833</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 18:00:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373407698145-183</Id><Title>mir_roguns must think five figures...</Title><Msg>constitutes being "rich".

The trial was dismissed in 1973 after evidence of government misconduct, including illegal wiretapping, was introduced in court. Many people compare Edward Snowden to me unfavorably for leaving the country and seeking asylum, rather than facing trial as I did. I don’t agree. The country I stayed in was a different America, a long time ago. After the New York Times had been enjoined from publishing the Pentagon Papers — on June 15, 1971, the first prior restraint on a newspaper in U.S. history — and I had given another copy to The Post (which would also be enjoined), I went underground with my wife, Patricia, for 13 days. My purpose (quite like Snowden’s in flying to Hong Kong) was to elude surveillance while I was arranging — with the crucial help of a number of others, still unknown to the FBI — to distribute the Pentagon Papers sequentially to 17 other newspapers, in the face of two more injunctions. The last three days of that period was in defiance of an arrest order: I was, like Snowden now, a “fugitive from justice.” Yet when I surrendered to arrest in Boston, having given out my last copies of the papers the night before, I was released on personal recognizance bond the same day. Later, when my charges were increased from the original three counts to 12, carrying a possible 115-year sentence, my bond was increased to $50,000. But for the whole two years I was under indictment, I was free to speak to the media and at rallies and public lectures. I was, after all, part of a movement against an ongoing war. Helping to end that war was my preeminent concern. I couldn’t have done that abroad, and leaving the country never entered my mind.

I hope Snowden’s revelations will spark a movement to rescue our democracy, but he could not be part of that movement had he stayed here. There is zero chance that he would be allowed out on bail if he returned now and close to no chance that, had he not left the country, he would have been granted bail. Instead, he would be in a prison cell like Bradley Manning, incommunicado. He would almost certainly be confined in total isolation, even longer than the more than eight months Manning suffered during his three years of imprisonment before his trial began recently. The United Nations Special Rapporteur for Torture described Manning’s conditions as “cruel, inhuman and degrading.” (That realistic prospect, by itself, is grounds for most countries granting Snowden asylum, if they could withstand bullying and bribery from the United States.) Snowden believes that he has done nothing wrong. I agree wholeheartedly. More than 40 years after my unauthorized disclosure of the Pentagon Papers, such leaks remain the lifeblood of a free press and our republic. One lesson of the Pentagon Papers and Snowden’s leaks is simple: secrecy corrupts, just as power corrupts. In my case, my authorized access in the Pentagon and the Rand Corp. to top-secret documents — which became known as the Pentagon Papers after I disclosed them — taught me that Congress and the American people had been lied to by successive presidents and dragged into a hopelessly stalemated war that was illegitimate from the start.

He found that he was working for a surveillance organization whose all-consuming intent, he told the Guardian’s Glenn Greenwald, was “on making every conversation and every form of behavior in the world known to them.” It was, in effect, a global expansion of the Stasi, the Ministry for State Security in the Stalinist “German Democratic Republic,” whose goal was “to know everything.” But the cellphones, fiber-optic cables, personal computers and Internet traffic the NSA accesses did not exist in the Stasi’s heyday. As Snowden told the Guardian, “This country is worth dying for.” And, if necessary, going to prison for — for life. But Snowden’s contribution to the noble cause of restoring the First, Fourth and Fifth amendments to the Constitution is in his documents. It depends in no way on his reputation or estimates of his character or motives — still less, on his presence in a courtroom arguing the current charges, or his living the rest of his life in prison. Nothing worthwhile would be served, in my opinion, by Snowden voluntarily surrendering to U.S. authorities given the current state of the law. I hope that he finds a haven, as safe as possible from kidnapping or assassination by U.S. Special Operations forces, preferably where he can speak freely. What he has given us is our best chance — if we respond to his information and his challenge — to rescue ourselves from out-of-control surveillance that shifts all practical power to the executive branch and its intelligence agencies: a United Stasi of America.</Msg><Username>general_melee</Username><Timestamp>1373408012676</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 18:13:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373408043574-188</Id><Title>FY 2014 U.S. Federal Budget Budget</Title><Msg>Defense 23% Education 3% Healthcare 24% Pensions 24% Welfare 12% Interest 6% Other 8%</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1373408043574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 18:14:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373408548354-189</Id><Topic><Title>mir_roguns must think five figures...</Title><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1373407698145</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 18:08:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I only had an AGI of $16,328.

All great democracies have committed financial suicide somewhere between 200 and 250 years after being founded. The reason? The voters figured out they could vote themselves money from the treasury by electing people who promised to give them money from the treasury in exchange for electing them. The United States officially became a Republic in 1776 , 236 years ago. The number of people now getting free stuff outnumbers the people paying for the free stuff .

All of the # 2's could not have come up with this on their own. The #2's are trying to play it as they are doing it for us, sorry that dog won't hunt. They say they have prevented 50 terrorist actions, a nice round number. The ones that happened were ones that the NSA and cohorts engineered by using some half witted persons, sort of a sting type thing. All of the real terrorist attempts have been citizen exposed. If these jokers had actually found out real terrorist attempts, it would have been blabbed on the evening news, by BO, Biden, Hillary and Axelrod. Meanwhile the data is used for other activities. Here in Puget Sound by the Black underground, and by the reelect BO bunch, and the get even bunch, and others, the VA under the UW's control.</Msg><Username>h_iamiam1</Username><Timestamp>1373426255976</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:17:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373426261042-228</Id><Topic><Title>it is a fact...</Title><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373425492479</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:04:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One nut cast several times is nuts.</Msg><Username>floydianslips</Username><Timestamp>1373426261042</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:17:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373426373795-229</Id><Title>The eagles nest</Title><Msg>2nd weekend PROOF whaqt a bunch of...</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373426373795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:19:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373427572823-230</Id><Title>AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL</Title><Msg>ROGER, THAT...</Msg><Username>bisbee_angler</Username><Timestamp>1373427572823</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 23:39:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
