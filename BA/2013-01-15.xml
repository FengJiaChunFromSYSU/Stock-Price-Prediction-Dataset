With the poverty level in the U.S. reaching record highs, some have called for a higher minimum wage as an anti-poverty measure. But the EPI study found “no statistically significant evidence that a higher minimum wage helped reduce hardship” with things like housing, health, financial and food insecurity. “The reality is that fewer than 20% of people who earn the minimum wage are poor, and most poor people already earn more than the minimum wage,” Jason Riley notes in the Wall Street Journal. “[Minimum wage] not a cure-all to poverty,” Bob Pollin of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst told Marketplace.org. “In fact, the biggest source of low-income poverty is that people don’t have jobs at all.” A separate EPI study suggests the minimum wage is disproportionately harmful to minorities. “Among white males in this group [age 16-24], the authors find that each 10 percent increase in a federal or state minimum wage decreased employment by 2.5 percent…But among black males in this group, each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage decreased employment by 6.5 percent,” the study finds. “This new study demonstrates the faulty empirical methods used in defense of minimum wage increases, and thoroughly debunks the irresponsible rhetoric pushed by wage hike advocacy groups,” Saltsman said in a statement.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358258917657</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 09:08:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358259141839-35</Id><Topic><Title>Rectal-cranial inversion of the day</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358258615897</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 09:03:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So the guy that sells you the hammer, and the guy that makes the hammer gets sued, and their business' shutdown because some idiot beat someone to death with a hammer.

Most people do not realise that state handouts (£207 billion a year) mop up every penny we pay in income tax (£155 billion a year). Everything else, the NHS, schools, transport, police, defence, interest on the debt (nearly £50 billion a year, by the way) must be paid for by other taxes, including the vast sums raked in by so-called ‘National Insurance’, or by more borrowing. As we are more or less bankrupt as a country, such generosity is not noble but plain idiotic. Yet we will not stop doing it. Change is politically impossible. Last week’s fuss about supposed cuts in benefits was a sign of the swamp we are in. There were, as usual, no actual cuts. A hesitant plan to cap future increases was met with angry hostility by many in politics and the media. Emotions were immediately engaged and slammed into top gear. That is because this immense and unaffordable attempt to substitute the State for the married family is at the heart of the political revolution which began 50 years ago and is now reaching its sad and bankrupt end. The very idea that people should provide for themselves has become a horrible heresy, a barbaric view that no civilised person can hold. We’ll see. My own guess is that a hurricane of inflation will, over the next ten years, rip the welfare state up by the roots and leave us impoverished, diminished and baffled, wondering what happened to us. Here’s what we spend. One wholly justifiable payment is the old-age pension, which is startlingly mean but still takes up almost £80 billion a year, more than a third of the welfare budget. Disability Living Allowance (3.38 million recipients) costs £13.43 billion. Housing Benefit (5.04 million recipients) costs £23 billion; its close cousin Council Tax Benefit (5.9 million recipients) costs £4.92 billion. Incapacity Benefit costs £3.22 billion; Income Support costs £5.3 billion. Jobseeker’s Allowance costs £5.26 billion. I might add, because I continue to believe that this particular form of welfare very often hurts those to whom it is offered, that there are now 567,000 fatherless households being subsidised by the taxpayer. Look at these figures and gasp. Where is the cash to come from? Think what else we might do with it. I am sure a lot of welfare money goes to people who need and deserve it, whose problems are no fault of their own. But I am just as sure that a lot of it goes to people who do not deserve it. And on top of that, I know from my letters and emails how many people there are who have worked and saved all their lives, and who are therefore excluded from the most important benefits, when they need them most. The working poor, who live next door to people whom they know to be cheating, are the most outraged by these abuses, and the most powerless to change them. The new political elite, who hope to buy votes and power through handing out other people’s money, will not stop doing so until that money runs out. And so we ramble merrily towards the edge of the abyss, making lemmings look responsible and far-sighted.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358259919720</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 09:25:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358260456265-38</Id><Title>Obama’s EPA forced a Wisconsin power company to cut jobs</Title><Msg>Obama EPA Forces Company to Cut Jobs, Spend $6 million on Green Agenda A settlement forced by the Obama Administration’s Environmental Protection Agency on a Wisconsin power company has forced an employer to prepare to cut jobs and spend millions paying for the Obama Administration’s green energy agenda. The EPA has entered into a consent decree with the Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPS) after federal regulators alleged that two of the company’s coal-fired power plants were in violation of the Clean Air Act. The company disputes the claim. Under the leadership of Obama appointed EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, the federal agency has been on a crusade to fundamentally reshape portions of the economy. In addition to using its regulatory power to wage war on coal fired power plants, the EPA has pushed an aggressive green energy agenda that has been criticized by some experts as long on politics but short on science. In Wisconsin, that dual thrust has collided as Wisconsin Public Service Corporation prepares to spend $300 million to upgrade two power plants, pay a $1.2 million fine to the EPA, and spend no less than $6 million on specific green energy projects outlined by the Obama EPA. The company has already indicated they are likely to lay off workers and possibly shutter the two power plants. Ironically, in making their case to the EPA, company officials noted that fulfillment of a large part of the EPA’s regulatory imposition would be accomplished by plant upgrades they were already working on. Administrator Jackson has used the Clean Air Act as justification for her war on coal fired power plants. But at least one former EPA administrator believes the Act is being used today for something it was never intended for. William Reilly, who led the EPA under President George H.W. Bush, told The New York Times in 2011, that Jackson is trying to use “the Clean Air Act to try to accomplish something for which it was never designed, the control of carbon dioxide.” Jackson has said herself that she views her role and the EPA’s role as an activist one, focused on changing the way Americans get their energy. The EPA seeks to use its position to “level the playing field,” to quote Administrator Jackson, between green energy sources and traditional energy sources. Many forms of green energy are not completely commercially viable at this time with cost savings and reliability issues dogging them. To help pay for imposing the green energy agenda on local governments, individual consumers, and communities, the EPA appears to be using settlements with power companies to force power suppliers to underwrite the cost of green energy projects. The Wisconsin case is not alone, although it stands as a stark example of the agenda-driven approach adopted by the EPA.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358260456265</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 09:34:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358260897780-39</Id><Topic><Title>Obama’s EPA forced a Wisconsin power company to cut jobs</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358260456265</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 09:34:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The EPA is a far leftists organization that is an arm of the liberal elites that are in power.

GHEI: A land less free America continues to lose ground in economic liberty. The United States is no longer a beacon of freedom to the world. Countries once looked to America for inspiration on how to escape poverty and embrace prosperity, but now they can find better examples to follow. The Heritage Foundation on Thursday noted our fifth consecutive decline in its annual Index of Economic Freedom. It's a sad day when countries such as Chile and Mauritius can outdo the red-white-and-blue when it comes to opportunity. U.S. economic policy has broken faith with the Founding Fathers, who preached the value of property rights, sound money and the rule of law. Our government has traded the frugality of Benjamin Franklin for a habit of spending $1 trillion more than it takes in each year. Profligate lawmakers use public funds to bail out Wall Street banks and Detroit labor unions. Our currency has become so debased that economist Paul Krugman on Tuesday wrote it would be "economically harmless" for the government to mint a $1 trillion coin as a way to avoid spending cuts. The New Year's "fiscal cliff" deal was chock-full of crony handouts and economic rent-seeking. The nation is $16.4 trillion in debt, yet Congress and the president approved spending $57 billion more in 2013 and a total of $330 billion in additional outlays over the rest of the decade, by the Congressional Budget Office's reckoning. The deal raises taxes by $620 billion on Americans who are about to see nationalized health insurance imposed, forcing companies to underwrite the cost of abortions against their moral principles. This is not what America stands for. Instead, we're being outperformed by the economic growth of our neighbor to the north, Canada, where Conservative Party Prime Minister Stephen Harper has held public spending in check while cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. At the top of the Heritage list is Hong Kong, which prospers despite the increasing control exerted from Beijing. Hong Kong's low-tax, low-regulation philosophy has delivered solid economic growth, 3.4 percent unemployment and a commendably low public debt ratio of 34 percent (compared with the U.S. figure of 104 percent). These countries succeed because they live up to the fundamental principles that made America great. President Obama is moving us even further in the wrong direction with his intention to use executive orders to bypass the legislative process and enact an unpopular agenda. History suggests he will take advantage of the upcoming debt-ceiling deal to boost government spending to new heights. We're already on an unsustainable path, as the accountants at the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office have been warning. There is no way for America to maintain her position in the world while the public sector swallows more and more resources from the private sector. Instead of following countries such as Greece and France in spending our way toward financial ruin, it's time to re-embrace the limited-government, free-market philosophy that works.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358261113259</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 09:45:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358261198015-41</Id><Topic><Title>Britain can no long afford to pay the extortionate cost of the welfare state</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1358259919720</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 09:25:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Remember the beginning years of "Progressivism", and the strategy of bringing our govt to its knees, and then better serve the govt to be in a position to impliment total socialism....sign up everyone you can onto the welfare rolls.

Senate Pass Stricter Gun Control Law</Title><Msg>the shape of things to come ************************ ALBANY, N.Y. — New York lawmakers agreed to pass the toughest gun control law in the nation and the first since the Newtown, Conn., school shooting, calling for a stricter assault weapons ban and provisions to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill who make threats. "This is a scourge on society," Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday night, six days after making gun control a centerpiece of his agenda in his State of the State address. The bipartisan effort was fueled by the Newtown tragedy that took the lives of 20 first graders and six educators. "At what point do you say, `No more innocent loss of life'?" The measure also calls for restrictions on ammunition and the sale of guns. It is expected to pass Tuesday. "This is not about taking anyone's rights away," said Sen. Jeffrey Klein, a Bronx Democrat. "It's about a safe society ... today we are setting the mark for the rest of the county to do what's right." Under current state law, assault weapons are defined by having two "military rifle" features, such as folding stock, muzzle flash suppressor or bayonet mount. The proposal would reduce that to one feature, including the popular pistol grip. The language specifically targeted the military-style rifle used in the Newtown shootings. Current owners of those guns will have to register them. Private sales of assault weapons to someone other than an immediate family would be subject to a background check through a dealer. New Yorkers also would be barred from buying assault weapons over the Internet, and failing to safely store a weapon could lead to a misdemeanor charge. Ammunition magazines would be restricted to seven bullets, from the current 10, and current owners of higher-capacity magazines would have a year to sell them out of state. An owner caught at home with eight or more bullets in a magazine could face a misdemeanor charge. Stores that sell ammunition will have to register with the state, run background checks on buyers of bullets and keep an electronic database of bullet sales. In another provision, a therapist who believes a mental health patient made a credible threat to use a gun illegally would be required to report it to a mental health director who would have to notify the state. A patient's gun could be taken from him or her. The legislation also increases sentences for gun crimes including the shooting of a first responder that Cuomo called the "Webster provision." Last month in the western New York town of Webster, two firefighters were killed after responding to a fire set by the shooter, who eventually killed himself. The measure passed the Senate 43-18 on the strength of support from Democrats, many of whom previously sponsored bills that were once blocked by Republicans. The Democrat-led Assembly gaveled out before midnight and planned to take the issue up at 10 a.m. Tuesday. It is expected to pass easily. The governor confirmed the proposal, previously worked out in closed session, also would mandate a police registry of assault weapons, grandfathering in assault weapons already in private hands. It was agreed upon exactly a month since the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. "It is well-balanced, it protects the Second Amendment," said Senate Republican leader Dean Skelos of Long Island.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358265203036</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 10:53:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358265539327-48</Id><Topic><Title>N.Y.

Obama is a "riddler". Instead of using "cornerstone" ("a basic element: foundation") as is done normally to clearly indicate that he WOULD be transparent and he WOULD follow the rule of law, he instead used the word "touchstone". Obviously sounds similar but different in meaning. You come away thinking he meant "cornerstone", that transparency and the rule of law would be the "hallmark" or clearly identifiable feature of how his administration would behave - and we know, after four years in office, that that clearly is NOT the case. "Touchstone" has many meanings, including a lesser meaning of "something like" what you think he meant. Its physical implementation, with its flint like fine gained surface, was used to evaluate precious metals that would deposit onto the stone's surface when the item in question was rubbed against it. Or it means "a test or criterion for determining the quality or genuineness of a thing". In other words, had he used the word "cornerstone", in order for him to then remain truthful, it would have been an obligation on his part - to be transparent and lawful. However, "touchstone" means that YOU (not HE) can evaluate his “transparency” or “rule of lawfulness” or lack thereof. He didn't say that he was going to be transparent and follow the rule of law (or obligated to do so), he “simply” said that, as a “touchstone”, you can evaluate whether or not that defined the quality of his administration. And that is because he is clever with words. And he said what he meant. Thus, he had no intention of being transparent and follow the rule of law, which those, in the negative, became the “hallmark” or “cornerstone” of his presidency. Kind of reminds me of Daniel 8.

Most people's support for the 2d Amendment is based on tradition and acceptance of the right of individuals to keep handguns for their own protection, and rifles and shotguns for hunting. Few people understand the need for homeowners to maintain semi-automatic assault rifles--at least not until armies of Walking Dead are on their lawns. All I hear from the gun community is that assault rifles are fun to shoot on the range. Well, not everything that is fun is sanctioned by the Constitution. And what the gun community is not discussing is the ideologically-based principle that the presence of hundreds of thousands of military-grade weapons in the hands of peace-and freedom-loving citizens provides an inhibition to domestic fascism and helps to keep the peace. The gun-keepers have their work cut out for them to try to convince know-it-all and knee-jerk liberals that these weapons help to defend their peace and freedom, but they'd better get started. Unfortunately, conspiracy theories about false-flag shootings make a poor start.</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1358275286196</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 13:41:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358275422635-71</Id><Topic><Title>Another Idiot Republican Threatens the President</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358271655956</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 12:40:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which district from TX does Stockman(R) reperesent: the oliy district, the cattle/rancher district (with a name like Stockman), the big money district, the pro-NRA district, or the pea-brained RWNJ district ? zzz</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1358275422635</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 13:43:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358275650353-72</Id><Topic><Title>Another Idiot Republican Threatens the President</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1358271655956</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 12:40:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why does Texas have an overabundance of nutcases?</Msg><Username>oldbuck56</Username><Timestamp>1358275650353</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 13:47:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358275702776-73</Id><Title>TGI Boeing Playing Games</Title><Msg>TGI, has been notified that we have gone from a 8 to 12 to 20 day span on 747.

Project SALVO Weapons from Vietnam and Desert Storm at the National Firearms Museum.[21] In 1948, the U.S. Army organized the civilian Operations Research Office, mirroring similar operations research organizations in the United Kingdom. One of their first efforts, Project ALCLAD, studied body armor and the conclusion was that they would need to know more about battlefield injuries in order to make reasonable suggestions.[22] Over 3 million battlefield reports from World War I and World War II were analyzed and over the next few years they released a series of reports on their findings.[22] The conclusion was that most combat takes place at short range. In a highly mobile war, combat teams ran into each other largely by surprise; and the team with the higher firepower tended to win. They also found that the chance of being hit in combat was essentially random; accurate "aiming" made little difference because the targets no longer sat still. The number one predictor of casualties was the total number of bullets fired.[22] Other studies of behavior in battle revealed that many U.S. infantrymen (as many as 2/3) never actually fired their rifles in combat. By contrast, soldiers armed with rapid fire weapons were much more likely to have fired their weapons in battle.[23] These conclusions suggested that infantry should be equipped with a fully automatic rifle of some sort in order to increase the actual firepower of regular soldiers. It was also clear, however, that such weapons dramatically increased ammunition use and in order for a rifleman to be able to carry enough ammunition for a firefight he would have to carry something much lighter.

Yet something obviously went wrong. So the Federal Aviation Administration, which must certify new planes as safe to fly, is now conducting an unusual "comprehensive review" of the 787 to make sure it meets all safety standards, a development that sent Boeing's stock down about 2.5 percent the day the government announced it. Boeing has staunchly defended the plane's safety and says it is cooperating with the FAA probe. There are three possible outcomes, says analyst Richard Tortoriello of Standard &amp; Poor's. The most draconian result would be for the FAA to order a major design change in the 787, which could require costly and significant modifications to the 50 or so jets already in service and a major revamping of the whole program. Since the FAA oversaw the development of the entire jet--including development of the lithium-ion battery packs--Tortoriello sees this outcome as "very unlikely. For the flying public this point should be remembered if considering flying on any 787 for a few more years , wait and see.</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358284144879</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 16:09:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358284278827-100</Id><Topic><Title>787 batteries</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358233433080</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 02:03:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boeing so how's those cheap batteries working for you now , plane gets lighter after the battery is tossed on the tarmac and the 40 firefighters leave the airplane, but the revenue is not good for the cancel of the flight</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1358284278827</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 16:11:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358286458318-101</Id><Topic><Title>Unhinged "Load Your Damn Mags and Get Ready to Fight" Guy May Have Gone Just A Wee Bit Too Far</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_333</Username><Timestamp>1358212355270</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 20:12:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Darn it, Spartacus, you're always right!

Alexander Xavier Shaw, of 733 71 Ave. N., died about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday as he was showing the weapon to family and friends, police said. Police were called to the home to investigate a shooting and they found Shaw behind the house with a gunshot wound to the head. He was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Witness told officers that Shaw, his uncle, grandparents and some friends were on the back patio talking when he showed them a .38-caliber revolver, police said. Shaw told them that he kept one round out of the firing chamber to prevent an accidental shooting, according to police. Witnesses then said Shaw tried to prove the gun was safe by placing it to his head and pulling the trigger, which is when the gun fired, fatally wounding him, police said. The case is still under investigation by homicide detectives and the Medical Examiner's Office.

Below, Congressman Stockman has pledged to move for impeachment against Obama. I am standing up against Obama right beside him, will you? “The President’s actions are an existential threat to this nation,” reads a statement by Rep. Steve Stockman. “The right of the people to keep and bear arms is what has kept this nation free and secure for over 200 years. The very purpose of the Second Amendment is to stop the government from disallowing people the means to defend themselves against tyranny. Any proposal to abuse executive power and infringe upon gun rights must be repelled with the stiffest legislative force possible.” - He has aided America’s enemies, violating his oath, by sending funds to insurgents in Syria who are being commanded by Al-Qaeda terrorists. - He has violated federal law by overseeing a cover-up surrounding Operation Fast and Furious, the transfer of guns to Mexican drug cartels direct from the federal government. - He has lied to the American people by overseeing a cover-up of the Benghazi attack which directly led to the deaths of four American citizens. The cover-up has been called “Obama’s Watergate,” yet four months after the incident, no one in the administration has been held accountable. - He has brazenly undermined the power of Congress by insisting his authority came from the United Nations Security Council prior to the attack on Libya and that Congressional approval was not necessary. “I don’t even have to get to the Constitutional question,” said Obama. This is an act that “constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution,” according to Congressman Walter Jones. - He has ignored Congressional rejection of the cybersecurity bill and instead indicated he will pursue an unconstitutional executive order. - He has signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act which includes provisions that permit the abduction and military detention without trial of U.S. citizens, violating Habeas Corpus. Despite Obama claiming he would not use the provisions to incarcerate U.S. citizens, it was his administration that specifically demanded these powers be included in the final NDAA bill. - He has enacted universal health care mandates that force Americans to buy health insurance, a clear violation of the Constitution in exceeding congressional power to regulate interstate commerce. Obama has also handed outpreferential waivers to corporations friendly to his administration. - He has declared war on America’s coal industry by promising to bankrupt any company that attempts to build a new coal plant while using unconstitutional EPA regulations to strangle competition, ensuring Americans see their energy costs rise year after year. - He has violated the Constitution’s Takings and Due Process Clauses when he bullied the secured creditors of automaker Chrysler into accepting 30 cents on the dollar while politically connected labor unions and preferential others received better deals. - He has violated Article II of the Constitution by using signing statements as part of his executive usurpation of power. “I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including but not limited to eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even filing articles of impeachment.” Rep. Steve Stockman, Texas.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358297302069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 19:48:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358297498234-138</Id><Title>Boeing 787 makes emergency landing, smoke seen – NHK</Title><Msg>*****Boeing 787 makes emergency landing, smoke seen – NHK***** Transport Ministry admits ‘enormous’ worry over Boeing 787 malfunctions Travellers 'worried' by Boeing glitches "OH #$%$"!!!!!!!!!!

The establishment Democrat think tank presented its recommendations on Monday, including both legislative proposals and executive orders. “The Center for American Progress is recommending 13 new gun policies to the White House — some of them executive actions that would not require the approval of Congress — in what amounts to the progressive community’s wish list,” the Washington Post reported last week. Obama and the Democrats at CAP know any executive action or order by Obama would be a direct violation of Article I Section I of the Constitution stating that all legislative powers reside with Congress. If Congress allows Obama to issue executive orders they are violating their oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Despite this, Congress will undoubtedly allow any attack on the Constitution issued by executive order to stand as it has done in the past. Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas has declared that he will protect the Constitution and file articles of impeachment against Obama if he attacks the Second Amendment with an executive order. “I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including but not limited to eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even filing articles of impeachment,” Stockman said in a statement on Monday after Democrats revealed their strategy to dismantle the Second Amendment. “The President’s actions are an existential threat to this nation,” the statement reads. “The right of the people to keep and bear arms is what has kept this nation free and secure for over 200 years. The very purpose of the Second Amendment is to stop the government from disallowing people the means to defend themselves against tyranny. Any proposal to abuse executive power and infringe upon gun rights must be repelled with the stiffest legislative force possible.” Obama’s executive orders present “an existential threat to this nation” because the purpose of the Second Amendment is to empower the people to resist a tyrannical government, as Walter Williams explains (see video below). Article I gives the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments. Conviction and removal from office requires a two-thirds vote. If Obama indeed attempts to undermine the Second Amendment through executive actions or orders, impeachment proceedings must begin immediately. “The President’s actions are not just an attack on the Constitution and a violation of his sworn oath of office – they are a direct attack on Americans that place all of us in danger. If the President is allowed to suspend constitutional rights on his own personal whims, our free republic has effectively ceased to exist,” Rep. Stockman’s statement explains.</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358299134846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 20:18:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358299232510-151</Id><Topic><Title>Articles of Impeachment Against Barack Hussein Obama</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358297302069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 19:48:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>breibart was actually 1/3 the negative cube-rooted george harrison-ed whoever breibart was</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1358299232510</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 20:20:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358299338121-152</Id><Topic><Title>Articles of Impeachment Against Barack Hussein Obama</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358297302069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 19:48:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Without even looking, I had a hunch this idiot was from Texas.</Msg><Username>oldbuck56</Username><Timestamp>1358299338121</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 20:22:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358299495214-153</Id><Topic><Title>Articles of Impeachment Against Barack Hussein Obama</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1358297302069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 19:48:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Before we start any impeachment proceedings I want to see Rep Stockman's tax returns for the last 10 years.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1358299495214</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 20:24:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358299500084-154</Id><Title>Boeing Employees</Title><Msg>How embarrassing for an American company to release such a shabby product.

The local fire department confirmed that all passengers and crew had been evacuated from the smoking aircraft Yet another blow to Boeing, which in the past month or so has seen way too many mishaps leading to canceled flights and review by NTSB,FAA, and several other enforcement agencies. The stock for Boeing shareholders could get ugly on Wednesday.

So all you boeing mangment enablers are as usual wrong. the 787 is a unsave plane at any speed .
