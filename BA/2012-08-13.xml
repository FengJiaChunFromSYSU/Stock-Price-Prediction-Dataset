Ryan's extreme anti-government radical ideas make Ron Paul look like a right wing conservative. But, here's a shocker: In spite of Ryan's criticism of the "bail Out" and "stimulus" packages, Paul Ryan took $45 million of stimulus taxpayer money to build infrastructure and create jobs in Wisconsin. We read in today's news that Paul Ryan voted against aid to farmers suffering under the worst drought in American history. Why would Congressman Ryan risk his political career to run on the presidential ticket of Mitt Romney, a man who won't agree to show his income tax records going back 5 years? Try telling the IRS: "I'm sorry, but I can't show you my income tax returns for the past 5 years." The IRS would sue you and seize your assets. Is Mitt Romney above the law? No! My guess, Paul Ryan probably took a big payoff, a few million, to run on Romney's presidential ticket. No wonder they hate big government. They're a couple of crooks!</Msg><Username>maramwp</Username><Timestamp>1344897945000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 18:45:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344900078000-40</Id><Title>Paul Ryan hunts &amp; kills animals for sport!</Title><Msg>Ryan certainly won't get the Humane Society or the ASPCA endorsement.

Boeing called upon its workforce to pull together to save the company. SPEEA members put personal and family obligations aside to toil endless hours to save the 787, stop the 747-8 from collapsing, secure the 767 tanker, and squeeze out increasing rates and efficiencies on the 737 and 777 programs. On the defense side, SPEEA members found new and innovative ways to deliver ever greater value for the customer in a climate of shrinking defense budgets. Boeing asked much of you and you delivered. Today, The Boeing Company is reporting record sales and income to Wall Street. There is a 4,000 plane backlog on the commercial side and even BDS turned a profit. The shareholder dividend just went up (again); the machinists’ union secured a contract leaving their salaries about 18% over market; and corporate executives are receiving double-digit pay increases (Boeing CEO Jim McNerney received a 16% pay increase in 2012) and bonuses reported to be as large as a full year’s salary. It is at this time, in this environment, that Boeing corporate has decided that the engineers and techs should be the ones to not share in the prosperity that you helped to create. Negotiations The SPEEA negotiating team opened this process by proposing that we simply extend the existing collective bargaining agreement for another three or four years. Members are generally happy with it, so it seemed reasonable to simply extend it and focus upon turning that 4,000 plane order backlog into products for the customers. The Boeing negotiating team rejected this proposal because it wanted pay and benefit cuts. The SPEEA negotiating team then provided Boeing a complete successor contract proposal on June 15 ... and waited. Every negotiating session since has begun with SPEEA asking for Boeing’s proposal and every session ends with SPEEA asking for Boeing’s proposal. Boeing refuses to provide one. At the Aug. 9th negotiations session, all Boeing would commit to do is providing a proposal “sometime” before the Oct. 6th contract expiration date. The level of disrespect being shown to your negotiating team is truly appalling. It’s become painfully clear that the Boeing negotiating team has essentially abandoned the idea of reaching a negotiated solution with SPEEA. Instead, they’re going to conduct a public relations campaign directly to the membership and then drop a bad offer at the last minute to give you as little time as possible to study it. Think about that. Boeing is afraid to let you see their contract offer until after they’ve spent a couple months selling the individual components to you. Boeing corporate believes that it can use the economic hardship created by the recession to force through pay and benefit cuts that are completely unrelated to the health of the company. They’re going to gesture at struggling companies to try and distract you from Boeing’s success. Your negotiating team already caught the Boeing negotiating team polluting the comparative market datasets with bankrupt companies and others, like Walmart, that provide little if any benefits to their employees. Trickery and marketing has replaced rational discourse. When Boeing sends you a slick email or posts something on their negotiations website, ask to see the predicate data. When your negotiation team is able to look under the hood, more often than not we find bad or misrepresented data. Several negotiating sessions ago, the Boeing team abandoned trying to even explain the charts they were showing us after your negotiating team found multiple apples-to-oranges errors. It was embarrassing ... and telling. It was obvious that they had cobbled together data to support a predetermined conclusion and they didn’t believe we would be smart enough to figure that out.</Msg><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1344913224000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:00:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>19</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344913287000-49</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Boeing Picking a Fight with Engineers and Techs?</Title><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1344913224000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:00:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What do we know about the proposal Boeing refuses to show us? • Eliminate the pension for new hires and replace it with a 401(k) that provides 40% less retirement dollars. This is a first step to freezing the pension for all employees. • Eliminate NON-IND and PERBUS (for partial day absences) • Reduce the rate of salary growth to 2-3% a year (a 40% to 60% reduction in the rate of salary growth). Boeing admits that your current 5% wage pools only raised you to the 50th percentile of the engineering/technical wage market. Boeing’s idea of driving your wages below the rate of inflation will hit the newest employees hardest as salary growth (or lack thereof) early in one’s career compounds for life and impacts one’s ability to negotiate higher salaries even if one leaves Boeing employment. For a historical reference, the average raise pool going back to the 1980s has been 4%. • Cost-shifting in medical. Boeing acknowledged during the July 26th negotiation session that their goal on medical benefits is to shift costs onto employees. Let me repeat that. Cost shifting isn’t a means to achieve a goal. Cost shifting IS the goal. • Freeze pay rates for engineering interns. • Salary cuts when an employee takes a downgrade. All of this comes in a time of record profits ... because Boeing corporate believes that they can sell you on the "need" for these cuts. This is a challenge to the membership. All of the other stakeholders have been rewarded but they’re coming to you for cuts ... because they don’t believe that you will stand up for yourselves. We need your help now Boeing corporate is counting upon the engineers and techs being passive. It’s time to prove them wrong. We need every member informed on these important negotiations. Your participation in SPEEA in the past has made a difference, whether it was wearing a red shirt for the team, or serving in a specific role. Please help us build solidarity around these 2012 negotiations: • Take ticket orders for SPEEA Solidarity Night at the Mariners game - SPEEA is planning a Solidarity Night at the Mariners on Sept. 8. We are offering two free tickets to every SPEEA member who asks. You can help by talking to members and taking ticket orders. • Join the Contract Action Network (CAN) – To keep 22,000 members updated on negotiations and involved in the effort to secure a great contract, SPEEA needs members to work as area and building focals, sharing responsibility for communicating with members on a regular basis. CAN members are among the first to receive information, and then help spread the word to members. If you have questions, you can contact: • South End, Bellevue , OR and UT– April Rebollo at aprilr@speea.org • North End – Carrie Blackwood at carrieb@speea.org or Susanne Murphy at susannem@speea.org In solidarity, Ray Ray Goforth SPEEA executive director</Msg><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1344913287000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:01:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344914171000-50</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Boeing Picking a Fight with Engineers and Techs?</Title><Username>lasertech_3d</Username><Timestamp>1344913224000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:00:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simply strike</Msg><Username>JunksExpert</Username><Timestamp>1344914171000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:16:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
