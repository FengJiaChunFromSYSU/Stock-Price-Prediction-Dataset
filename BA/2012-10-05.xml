However, Goforth said removing three objectionable items from a contract that he described as “awful” is not enough. “They don’t get a Scooby Snack for that,” said Goforth. Tom McCarty, SPEEA president, also addressing the Times board, said he wants the current contract, not the rejected contract offer, to be used as the benchmark for further discussions. “If we go back to talks and the company insists on fluffing up that proposal, I see a bad outcome,” said McCarty. “This is not the direction we want to go.” Goforth said the confrontational negotiations so far can lead only to conflict, in which both sides could not gain anything they want .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1349430235794</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 05:43:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349434972391-4</Id><Topic><Title>Time to Put Libs on Suicide Watch</Title><Username>jetstream_2010</Username><Timestamp>1349407628363</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 23:27:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nope. They'll be fine. I'm an Independent, but barring some kind of huge calamity will definitely be voting for Obama. The list of things "wrong" with Romney is long, but distinguished. One debate a campaign does not make and Romney has a lot of ground to make up, especially after the last several weeks which, by any measure, have been a disaster for him. Also, history has shown that the incumbent president almost always loses the first debate. It happened to Ford, Reagan, Bush, Bush jr. as well as Carter. Obama has a significant lead in virtually every poll in almost every swing state. If Romney can find a way to close the gap, especially in Ohio where he's currently trailing by eight points, then he's got a chance. If he can't, he'll almost certainly lose. The electoral college map favors Obama and Obama is well known for playing long-ball. All the glee you guys are feeling after Wednesday's debate will quickly disappear, never to return, if Obama is re-elected. : )</Msg><Username>vierzig_nachten</Username><Timestamp>1349434972391</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 07:02:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349438260234-5</Id><Topic><Title>Time to Put Libs on Suicide Watch</Title><Username>jetstream_2010</Username><Timestamp>1349407628363</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 23:27:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>:) indeed.

The rate declined because more people found work, a trend that could have an impact on undecided voters in the final month before the presidential election. The Labor Department said Friday that employers added 114,000 jobs in September. The economy also created 86,000 more jobs in July and August than first estimated. Wages rose in September and more people started looking for work. The revisions show employers added 146,000 jobs per month from July through September, up from 67,000 in the previous three months. The unemployment rate fell from 8.1 percent in August, matching its level in January 2009 when President Barack Obama took office. The decline could help Obama, who is coming off a disappointing debate performance against GOP challenger Mitt Romney. Stock futures rose modestly after the report. Dow Jones industrial average futures, up 30 points just before the report came out, were up 45 points after it was released.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1349441700719</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 08:55:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349442352176-8</Id><Topic><Title>US jobless rate falls to 7.8 pct., 44-month low</Title><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1349441700719</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 08:55:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The economy must create at least 125,000 jobs a month just to keep pace with population growth.

It's a standard Obama talking point. But it's not true. Bush's tax cuts did not cause the last recession. In fact, once they were fully in effect in 2003, they sparked stronger growth — generating more than 8 million new jobs over the next four years, and GDP growth averaging close to 3%. Those tax cuts didn't explode the deficit, either, as Obama frequently claims. Deficits steadily declined after 2003, until the recession hit. 2 I stopped a second Great Depression. Another frequent Obama claim is that "we did all the right things to prevent a Great Depression." But this, too, is false. The economy had pretty much hit bottom by the time Obama took office, and long before his policies were in place. The worst declines in monthly GDP and employment, in fact, occurred before he was even sworn in. What's more, the recovery officially started less than four months after Obama signed the stimulus into effect, when only a small fraction of the stimulus money was actually in the economy. Plus, other Obama economic interventions came either after the recession had ended — including his GM (GM) bailout — or have been widely judged to be failures.

Obama leads Romney by 78 to 17 percent with Nevada's Hispanic voters, a huge gap that outpaces the 76-to-22 percent edge he had over Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) four years ago in the state. In Florida, where the Republican-leaning Cuban population bolsters Latino GOP support, Obama leads Romney by a 30-point margin, at 61 percent to 31. That's double the 15-point edge he had with the state's Hispanics four years ago, when he carried the demographic group by 57 percent to 42. If Romney can't close these gaps it will be very difficult for him to win Nevada, and complicate his path to victory in Florida. The group will release polling results in Colorado, another swing state with a large Hispanic population, next week. These new results mirror national polling by this and other groups that show Obama outpacing his 2008 performance with Latino voters and Romney struggling mightily. Two recent national polls of Hispanic voters show Obama cracking 70 percent, with Romney pulling between one-fifth and one-quarter of Latino voters. A senior Romney Hispanic strategist told The Hill this summer that the campaign's goal was to win 38 percent of the national Hispanic vote. Romney's campaign has made a recent push for more Latino support, and argued earlier this week that it was doing better than national polling indicated with swing-state Hispanics. But these polls, the only ones so far to conduct polling in Spanish as well as English and have large enough sample sizes to be trusted, indicate the opposite.</Msg><Username>skunked.again</Username><Timestamp>1349451818060</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 11:43:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349452153491-42</Id><Title>Total Un-Employment Rises to 873K Highest Since 2008! Obama is Proud! Ugh!</Title><Msg>Total Employment Rises 873,000 To Highest Level Since December 2008 By Noel Sheppard | October 05, 2012 | 08:45 The unemployment rate decreased to 7.8 percent in September, a number certain to impact the presidential race. Pundits have been saying for months this number had to drop below 8 percent for it not to be a hindrance to President Obama's reelection chances. The economy added 114,000 nonfarm payrolls in the month according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics with gains in healthcare, transportation and warehousing. Truly shocking in the report was that the number of unemployed people dropped by 456,000 to 12.1 million. Maybe more shocking, total employment, as measured by the Household Survey, rose by 873,000 in September to 142,974,000, the biggest one month jump since June 1983. As such, total employment now stands at the highest level it's been since December 2008 before Obama was inaugurated. But even more mysterious is the divergence in the two surveys done by the Labor Department. The Household Survey showed a gain of 873,000 people employed in September - resulting in the surprise drop in the unemployment rate - while the Establishment Survey only showed a rise of 114,000. Hmmm.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349452153491</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 11:49:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349452574218-43</Id><Title>Voters Will Vote for Winners</Title><Msg>Americans Saw First Hand how Inept and Incompetent Obama Truly Is!

Just watch Greece, Spain and Italy for a preview of what's coming here......and they will only be the first dominoes to fall. When you tell the millenniums they have to work two job to pay for the Boomer's Social Security they ain't goon be happy especially if they can't even find one job. The Boomer's want every thing promised to them even though it costs 10 times what they paid into the system. Government workers will throw a tizzy when PBIC tells them there ain't no money to back up what was promised to them. Of course they will print money, prices will rise and a reemergence of barter and a black market economy will take place. Mediocre achievers will not be equipped to navigate this active free market system and will be forced to liquidate their possessions to high achievers. History always repeats when government employed elitists convince the mediocre class that they they can take the money the the mediocre class has earned and give them better security and safety than if they hadn't taken their money in the first. Essentially what they are telling the mediocre class is that they are just too stupid to spend the money they earn and therefore must send more and more of it to the elitists in DC to spend spend it for them. Ever wonder why the government elitists voted their own pay and benefits to be so much higher than the military personnel who are on duty 24/7 in dirty, dusty parts of the world with people shooting at them and making every effort to kill them while the elitist in DC only work 3 days a week, have 90 days of vacation a year, have their own gym, cafeteria, transportation, secret service protection, a $4 million annual slush fund to waste on junkets and fact finding trips and to top it off retirement benefits after 6 years of service? I'm beginning to wonder if the elitists aren't right......the mediocre class is too stupid to spend their own money. And if they don't wake up it may be because they're just too stupid to live in freedom.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1349453006007</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:03:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349453062503-49</Id><Title>The Rmoney recipe for disaster</Title><Msg>-lower taxes mainly benefitting the wealthy -start a phony war i.e. invade/attack Iran -have no way to pay for any of it (except fire Big Bird from PBS) -repeal the Affordable Healthcare Act, leaving 30M vulnerable -repeal wall street regulations except the good regulations whichever those are since rmoney never provides specifics) in other words the same as Boosh for the 100% and screw the 99%</Msg><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1349453062503</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:04:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349453114110-50</Id><Topic><Title>The Rmoney recipe for disaster</Title><Username>furtherprog</Username><Timestamp>1349453062503</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:04:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All #$%$...

The unemployment rate supposedly drops from 8.1% to 7.8% for that three month period (a change of 0.3%). Hence, 63K jobs is a 0.3% change in employment. Taking that then, (63K change in number of people employed)/(0.003 change of total number of people employed) = 21 million total people employed. With the number of people in the labor force equal to about 153 million, that is off by a factor of 7.2, meaning the change in employment must be 0.3%/7.2 =.04%. Again, perhaps, the government is simply ignoring the folks that drop off of the unemployment rolls due to being discouraged or their 99 weeks of unemployment benefits have run out.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1349453551731</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:12:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349453580616-54</Id><Topic><Title>Romney’s Health Care Deception...</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1349452882130</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:01:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey moocher... don't forget to update your unemployment text to 7.8%....</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1349453580616</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:13:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349453660861-55</Id><Topic><Title>The Coming Collapse – Making American Mediocrity Sacred</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1349450223245</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 11:17:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You nailed it with that one.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1349453660861</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:14:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349453897241-56</Id><Title>Wow!

According to knowledgeable sources, a national magazine and a national web site are preparing a blockbuster donor scandal story. Sources told Secrets that the Obama campaign has been trying to block the story. But a key source said it plans to publish the story Friday or, more likely, Monday. According to the sources, a taxpayer watchdog group conducted a nine-month investigation into presidential and congressional fundraising and has uncovered thousands of cases of credit card solicitations and donations to Obama and Capitol Hill, allegedly from unsecure accounts, and many from overseas. That might be a violation of federal election laws. The Obama campaign has received hundreds of millions in small dollar donations, many via credit card donations through their website. On Thursday, the campaign announced a record September donor haul of $150 million. It's no surprise President Obama has support overseas. Billionaires like George Soros support him and considering Hollywood is partially controlled by European money, naturally Obama has foreign support. Obama's economic philosophy is also similar to European style resdistribution of wealth, which is why French President Francois Hollande supports him. We'll have to wait and see how this story plays out and whether the Obama campaign really has a problem/scandal to deal with a month away from Election Day.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1349456527957</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 13:02:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349456995631-74</Id><Topic><Title>ATTD distribution agreement announcement, 2200% GAINS POSSIBLE ,READ</Title><Username>agreenview</Username><Timestamp>1349444468465</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 09:41:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like its moving.</Msg><Username>pennystbuyer</Username><Timestamp>1349456995631</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 13:09:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349457656880-75</Id><Title>After Obama wins, will the repubes resolve the fiscal cliff...</Title><Msg>will they just kick the can down the road again or will they completely lose it, and resolve that Obama fail rather than America succeed as they have for the past 4 years???</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1349457656880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 13:20:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349458099519-76</Id><Topic><Title>The Friends of Mitt Romney..!!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1349455785159</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:49:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Myth Rmoney the worst campaign and the worst candidate from either party in 40 years!</Msg><Username>bapsycho</Username><Timestamp>1349458099519</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 13:28:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349459060009-77</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Closing in on a Four Bagger...

This is why Republicans nominated him By Tim Stanley US politics Last updated: October 5th, 2012 On Wednesday night, Romney's eloquence shocked the liberal press Mitt Romney didn’t just beat Obama on Wednesday night. He also beat the liberal media. So great was his performance that liberal journalists simply had to concede the President’s defeat – a humiliation for an industry that has spent several years setting Obama up as the wisest, most eloquent, most popular politician since FDR. No longer can Romney be dismissed with a gag about a dog strapped to the roof of his car. This uptight rich guy could be the next President of the United States. Evidence of liberal panic is everywhere. In the hours after the debate, the mood in the MSNBC bunker was near-suicidal – and it’s in tortured moments like these that all pretence of objectivity disappears. Chris Matthews (a former Democrat staffer turned TV motor mouth who undoubtedly talks in his sleep) ranted that Obama ought to watch MSNBC to learn how to fight conservatives. Ed Schultz was “stunned” and Rachel Maddow thought it might be sort of a draw (in the same way that the Titanic's encounter with an iceberg was “sort of a draw”). The New York Times ran with the vague headline, “Obama and Romney, in First Debate, Spar Over Fixing Economy” and called the evening “unhelpful.” Why? Because their guy lost. Who to blame for the President's poor show? Al Gore put it down to the high altitude of Denver, which would suggest that this was the first debate in history to be decided by topography. Whoopi Goldberg said that Obama was distracted by his wedding anniversary. Many others are pointing the finger at the moderator Jim Lehrer, whose lack of command allowed Romney to dominate. Lehrer sure was useless. At one point he announced that there was only three minutes left of the programme – and took about three minutes to do it. But blaming the referee because your side lost is a tired old excuse. And the President did lose. According to CNN, 67 per cent of viewers thought Romney won, compared to just 25 per cent for Obama. Beating the low expectations of the mainstream media is one thing, but will it translate into a tighter race? A couple of polls signify that Romney’s positives are already creeping up and that he may have leapt by a couple of points. But it will take days to see that translated into accurate state-by-state polling that gives us a better picture. A lot is made of the figure that nearly half of viewers said the debate won’t change their mind and only 35 per cent said they now preferred Romney. But, actually, those stats match what we already know about the relatively low number of undecideds. This was the most watched debate since 1980 (itself an indicator of voter indecision) and 35 per cent of 67 million is pushing 25 million viewers who are willing to give Mitt a second look – pretty much the number that Romney has always needed to win over to win. Moreover, the debate seems to have helped rally the GOP base and spike donations.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349459436091</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 13:50:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349459776139-80</Id><Topic><Title>Wow!

The report found that, from August to September, the unemployment rate dropped from just above 8 percent to 7.8 percent. In fact, when Labor Secretary Hilda Solis appeared on CNBC this morning, the first two questions for her were whether the books have been cooked: Solis called the charges insulting and "ludicrous" but they always say that before admitting the charges are accurate. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economics adviser to John McCain and the former head the Congressional Budget Office, calls the numbers "implausible." "Sept. unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent due to an extraordinary – but implausible – estimate of 873,000 #jobs in household survey,” said Holtz-Eakin on Twitter. “The report presented a slew of contradictory data points, with the total employment level soaring despite the low net number,” said CNBC's Jeff Cox. The Washington Post's Neil Irwin adds, "Weird that payrolls are exactly on forecast but household survey is far better." And the Wall Street Journal warns that these numbers should be taken "with a grain of salt."</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1349461313607</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:21:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349461449567-85</Id><Topic><Title>Jobs Report Met with Skepticism</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1349461313607</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:21:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, Can't Debate...

If that light should ever even momentarily dim again, the Cockroaches of the Dimocratic party will infest our beloved country once again!</Msg><Username>tminusten</Username><Timestamp>1349466295565</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:44:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349466531008-104</Id><Topic><Title>If Obama could manipulate numbers</Title><Username>andse2003</Username><Timestamp>1349455749260</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:49:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The RWNJ's have re-tuned their tin foil hats from receiving birther conspiracy messages to jobs numbers conspiracy messages.</Msg><Username>agent0977</Username><Timestamp>1349466531008</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:48:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349466572252-105</Id><Title>That sound you hear ...</Title><Msg>is all of the air escaping from Romney's and the Republican's post-debate party balloon as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its latest unemployment report today.

The unemployment rate goes up and the unemployment rate goes down, but there's no denying the significance of it falling into the 7's, even if briefly. Republicans, and in particular, imaccommunist, are no doubt outraged and in a state of dismay, anger and denial.

The hangover sets in.</Title><Msg>.Obama charges that his GOP rival's proposals would benefit the rich, hurt the middle class, and increase the deficit. Nonsense, says Romney. Who's right? One of the most contentious exchanges in this week's closely watched presidential debate came when Mitt Romney forcefully defended his tax plan. President Obama and independent economists have warned that Romney's promise to slash income-tax rates for everyone — including the rich — and wipe out popular deductions and loopholes so as not to increase the deficit would wind up giving the wealthiest Americans huge breaks while saddling the middle class with a higher tax burden. Romney swears his critics are simply wrong. "I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans," Romney said on Wednesday, "and... I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families." So, what, exactly, would Romney's plan mean for taxpayers? Here, a brief guide: What does Romney want to do? He plans to keep tax benefits for savings and investment, eliminate the estate and alternative minimum taxes, and slash everyone's income tax rate by 20 percent, across the board. That includes small businesses whose owners report profits on their individual returns, instead of paying corporate income taxes. As Obama and others have pointed out, the lower rates would slash nearly $5 trillion over a decade from what taxpayers would otherwise have to cough up. Obama says that will add to the federal deficit. Romney denies that, saying he'll make up for the lost revenue in other ways. SEE MORE: Romney pivots to foreign policy ahead of debates How would Romney make up for this lost revenue? Romney wants to cut back on deductions, exemptions, and credits that many Americans use to reduce their taxable income and tax bills. Romney has taken a lot of heat for not disclosing which loopholes he'd eliminate, but he said earlier this week that he would put a $17,000 cap on annual deductions — such as mortgage interest and charitable contributions. The thing is, that won't be enough to make up for the cost of the tax breaks, says Brookings Institution economist William Gale, who co-authored a study of Romney's tax plan for the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. "It doesn't come close to paying for the $5 trillion." How far does the plan fall short? The Tax Policy Center's analysis, which Romney contests, concluded that, in 2015, $86 billion of the shared national tax burden would have to be shifted onto the middle class. Otherwise, that amount would get tacked onto the federal deficit. It's just impossible, Obama said in the debate, to give everyone a huge tax rate cut and avoid increasing budget shortfalls without heaping a greater tax burden on the middle class through the closure of loopholes and deductions. "It's math," Obama said. "It's arithmetic." SEE MORE: Should Mitt Romney avoid zingers at the presidential debate? Why does Romney say the plan does add up? He says his critics are leaving out some key parts of the equation. Romney advisers, for example, say that the Tax Policy Center's calculus left out some potential savings — such as the possibility of getting rid of the tax exemption for municipal bonds. And Romney says the really big difference between his math and that of his critics is that they're not factoring in the economic growth that he says his plan will spark by cutting the taxes paid by small businesses. They'll be able to keep more of their money, Romney says, and use it to hire more workers, which will boost the economy. Then, the theory goes, everyone will make more and, therefore, pay more taxes, making up for what was lost due to the tax cuts. So... does Romney's math add up or not? It's debatable, though the majority of analysts seem to believe it doesn't add up. Regardless, there are many lingering questions about the ramifications of Romney's plan. Will non-profit organizations suffer if the wealthy can no longer write off charitable donations? Will Romney's tax cuts really trigger as much economic growth as he hopes? Probably not, say fact checkers at Bloomberg News. "Congressional budget-scoring rules are conservative about anticipated growth from tax cuts because economists disagree over how much they spur the economy. If Romney’s plan goes to Congress, where those rules apply, it wouldn't add up."</Msg><Username>i_like_ike99</Username><Timestamp>1349471854721</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 17:17:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349471967363-112</Id><Topic><Title>The high wears off.

A review of the debate tape reveals that, apparently, Mitt Romney needed a cheat sheet to keep the lies straight. The rules of the presidential debates are clear about not bringing outside notes and presidents and aspirants have followed the rule for decades. Video of the first eleven seconds of the debate available on YouTube shows Mitt Romney reaching into his pocket at the moment he is out of view of those in front of him, he used the lectern as a shield, and removing what appears to be folded papers from his pocket. We see this because the camera that was broadcasting was behind Romney. Those in the audience and the moderator may have been shielded from his sleight of hand, but not the viewers. Romney then proceeds to unfold the item in front of him. For those curious if it could have been some else, later video sheds some light on what Romney retrieves from his lectern. After the Romney and Obama families chat post-debate the President walks off stage, leaving his notes behind for an aide, no doubt. But not so for Romney. The Presidential challenger goes back to his lectern to retrieve his items. It is clear that the only thing that Romney takes is paper. Not a handkerchief. Not a white flag. Nothing but paper. So the next question is: what is Mitt Romney’s explanation for the apparent cheating?</Msg><Username>proud_2bn_atheist</Username><Timestamp>1349476275662</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 18:31:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349476640717-123</Id><Title>Welcome back Carter - Its 1979 all over again!</Title><Msg>Break out the 6 inch platform shoes and crank the disco tunes.

Paul Newman, a renowned movie star, lived in Connecticut dies of cancer possibly caused by landfill PVC. Dr. Evil victimize people for personal wealth building! So selfish! Mitt Romney has no intention to treat people equally! Did he pick up Marco Rubio as his running mate? No, he did not! He lied to Cuban American community!</Msg><Username>gm_veteran</Username><Timestamp>1349485085901</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 20:58:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349487354022-136</Id><Topic><Title>President interfer with WARN NOTICE LAWS. thousands of layoffs not counted</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1349478152779</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 19:02:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>actually the Execd office of POTUS put out a letter on sept 28 ( m-12-19 ) cannot post link here Subject Guidance on allowable contracting costs associated with WARN act Bottom line - companies get a free pass- all expenses paid for by the gubbermint if they DO NOT issue WARN notices as required by federal law 60 days in advance of a layoff search for it Reason- If sewqrestaration happens on Jan 1, noltices have to go out NOV 1- Guess who pays the attorney costs, the trial costs, and the resulting backpayments if the people who get laid off file cuz they did not get WARN Simple- charge it all to the Obuma card - whats in YOUR wallet ? send it in!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1349487354022</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:35:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349489660313-137</Id><Title>One time on the way back home from Salt Lake City, Utah...</Title><Msg>my farther parked us six kids in a coffee-shop booth in Elko with my mother during the midday sun and walked back to give us each five pure silver dollars PURE SILVER are you finnish-ed</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1349489660313</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 22:14:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349490019622-138</Id><Topic><Title>Borrow from China to sell our kids and grandkids out for Big Bird is lame thinking.
