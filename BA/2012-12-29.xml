They did that in 2000. Did not realize that they could NOT deliver planes without SPEEA DER signoff. NOw DER are called AR. Same problem. On the negative side for SPEEA, the AFL_CIO twit Trumka could not believe that a small ( then ) independant union like SPEEA could shut down BA, and neither did the then Executive Director ( Office manager ). So after Trumka throwing a few chairs around,etc BA caved and then con centrated on how to " cajole" the Office Manager, which went to his head. Most of the then grunts were somewhat unprepared for the logistics of running a strike. Not so this time. BA tried to split off the DER people or hire consultant DER types. That did not work either. So afterwords, BA tried schmoozing the FAA to make the DER a separate group. Did not work very well. And this time- since many of the grunts are still around, they are also better prepared. BA new minted power point rangers , walking FOD and Potatoe Head Bored of Directionless are again playing hardball, while trying to defend their recent many $$$$ bone-us.

I ask from a philosophical perspective because the word "normal" is best applied in math and statistics, and it is often a word that is misapplied when used outside of math and statistics. Not being normat isn't a bad thing either. For example if I rank in the top 5% of net worth in the USA, I am not normal. I'm exceptional and that is a good thing. I would argue that people of French-Canadian descent are not normal. So many of the people of French-Canadian descent suffer from dystopia. Normal people should never trust anyone of French-Canadian descent as they seldom make any sense.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1356803658704</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 12:54:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356806463311-23</Id><Title>Question about the meaning of "liberal"</Title><Msg>Here is the etymology of the word "liberal" liberal (adj.) mid-14c., "generous," also, late 14c., "selfless; noble, nobly born; abundant," and, early 15c., in a bad sense "extravagant, unrestrained," from Old French liberal "befitting free men, noble, generous, willing, zealous" (12c.), from Latin liberalis "noble, gracious, munificent, generous," lit. "of freedom, pertaining to or befitting a free man," from liber "free, unrestricted, unimpeded; unbridled, unchecked, licentious," from PIE *leudh-ero- (cf. Greek eleutheros "free"), probably originally "belonging to the people" (though the precise semantic development is obscure), and a suffixed form of the base *leudh- "people" (cf. Old Church Slavonic ljudu, Lithuanian liaudis, Old English leod, German Leute "nation, people;" Old High German liut "person, people") but literally "to mount up, to grow." With the meaning "free from restraint in speech or action," liberal was used 16c.-17c. as a term of reproach. It revived in a positive sense in the Enlightenment, with a meaning "free from prejudice, tolerant," which emerged 1776-88. Many of the people on this board who consider themselves liberal seem to me to often be the ones who are most against personal freedoms. They are the ones that want more regulations and controls over people. The liberals I grew up with never trusted government and wanted less government less laws. They were always promoting freedom from government and "Power to the people". Now it seems that liberalism has been debased by modern faux liberalism that favors more government control and less personal freedoms. Where did the modern liberal lose his way and fall victim to being a willing collectivist government controlled dupe?</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1356806463311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:41:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356809042476-24</Id><Topic><Title>National Hero: Sheriff Joe sends Posse to protect Schools</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356792813399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 09:53:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a manly man you are.

Correct David...The Dik has no answer because if he said he WOULD protect his own Children and flesh and blood with equal force of Arms to repel a home invader with guns...he is revealed for the utter hypocryte he truly is becauase he is advocating THAT for which he condemns in other REAL Americans.....AND...if he DOES NOT, and claims his children should NOT be protected and gunned down under the scenario presented to maintain some abstract principle ...then he is a miserable wretch, unworthy of being called a human being. It has been thus since the dawn of Man...and it is why the collectivist authoritarians HAVE no argument when it comes to guns .....because it is PRECISELY this argument and this REALITY that they refuse to stare in the face....WHAT WOULD THEY TRULY DO THEMSELVES when faced with a life and death decision about saving their loved ones lives ?</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356835955095</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 21:52:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356836426793-32</Id><Topic><Title>Oliver Stone: ‘US has become an Orwellian state’</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1356833577187</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 21:12:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Kent Raven thinks he's in the Inner Party.
