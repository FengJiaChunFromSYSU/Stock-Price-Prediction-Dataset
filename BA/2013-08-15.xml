International takeout taxes first. (15%) For a period of one year from today going back 1 year without dividend included in stock price gain Airbus is up 60%, Boeing is up 41% . With dividend reinvested Boeing stock price would have gained 43%, Airbus stock price gain with dividend reinvestment is 62% both companies , the duopoly, know what each other does so that dividend is not significant. So unless you want to live on $3341 off 200k from Boeing or $2616 year to date dividends then the only factor ina investment choice is stock price gain. Airbus betters Boeing over the 5 year period at a stock price gain of 172.91% that means each dollar invested in Airbus has made you $1.73 for Boeing you worse off , only made 60.82%. Airbus is executing better than Boeing they are number 1 and will be as long as the A350 delivers and Airbus knows that. FMH did a correct dividend analysis . I just put it into dollars and percentage , so investors might understand the number . Here is foulmouthharbors statement "So airbus has paid investors a total of 1.49/ share since 2009.

The problem is one of competency. Obama is not competent, has no economic experience or knowledge, is bigoted and is governing somewhat like a restrained Robert Mugabe with similar results. There were far, far more qualified Black men than Obama.....men who had actually accomplished things......men like Allen West, Charles Payne, Thomas Sowell, Clarence Thomas and Senator Tim Scott. But the one chosen was a snake oil salesman, a con artist with a sliver tongue. He would chant things like hope and change and no one would ever ask "hope for what", or "change to what." He would say things like "we are 5 days away from fundamentally transforming America.” No one would ask “fundamentally transforming from what to what?” The results have been an economy in shambles, tremendous job losses, high energy costs, massive debt, abuses of government power over citizens, nepotism and cronyism. The most vulnerable, especially blacks have suffered and the middle class has been decimated. Desperate people have turned to welfare, food stamps and disability benefits in record numbers. Even black people are catching on and realizing they have not benefited under his administration. Democrats and liberals don’t dare admit their tremendous mistake or they would never be re-reelected again and are therefore forced to continue lying and mounting rigorous defenses about the non-existent successes of this administration. These are people that are devoted to their party more than they are to their country and the ideals upon which this country was founded. They are the true bigots and have set race relations and the hope of black people back a 100 years.</Msg><Username>hope4whitepeople2</Username><Timestamp>1376574485373</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 09:48:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376574682052-16</Id><Title>Q.C. at this point must be redundant and maybe an independent electrical source independently review all electric issues</Title><Msg>This must come down from top management that the review of these planes by Boeing at this point is not finding the problems.

At around 4 a.m. Thursday, a man who does not want to be identified, said his brother was robbed by six men with guns at a Denny's off the Gulf Freeway in southeast Houston. "I don't know if it was random or someone set him up. Because he got his own label," said the victim's brother. His brother's wife was in the restroom at the time, but when she exited the restroom she saw the group of suspected robbers. Police said that's when she pulled out her gun and shot at them. "She said she came out of the restroom and saw my brother on the floor. That's when she started doing what she gotta do. She got a license and she'll do anything to protect her kids and my brother," he said. Police said there was a shootout, but it is not known how many shots were fired at the time. However, police said the gunshots did hit cars in the parking lot. No bystanders or customers were injured. The group of suspects fled the scene. The married couple said they are still shook up, but their family said they're glad they made it out alive. "Self-defense saved my brother's life," he said. According to police, the robbers got away with jewelry. If you have any information that could lead to an arrest call Crime Stoppers at (713)-222-TIPS.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1376576106157</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 10:15:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376576537010-22</Id><Topic><Title>787 issues</Title><Username>stillinshock</Username><Timestamp>1376572103594</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 09:08:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>QC ?

From the outsourcing of crucial work to vendors ill-prepared and unqualified for composite construction on such a large scale, compounded by refusal to react promptly when receiving uncompleted and late deliveries, further exacerbated by turning loose a neophyte workforce to correct those problems rather than utilize the workers that had experience working with composites from other divisions and ignoring the Engineers that told them upfront that the outsourcing was a bad idea(John Hart-Smith). Ever since the ill-fated merger with a Failed aircraft company McDonald-Douglas Boeing's Management ranks have been crowded with marketing wonks rather than it's traditional Management that had aircraft assembly experience and it shows. And the punishment for the leaders that drove Boeing to the failure? Why They have all been promoted up the ladder . And then retired with benefits.So witness the effects of 15 years of catastrophic strategic decisions made by the McDonnell clan subsequent to the merger with Boeing and the management coup that lead to the ascension of Stonecipher/ Sears to the strategic leadership positions of Boeing. .</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376584842849</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 12:40:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376584866110-36</Id><Topic><Title>Woman with concealed-carry permit breaks up robbery...</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1376576106157</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 10:15:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>like the Trevon Martin murderer rescuing people in a car wreck- its just another made up lie. likely by some Jihadist NRA MFR who doesnt have anything to live for except his guns and he just felt like spreading another bloated lie</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1376584866110</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 12:41:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376584929021-37</Id><Topic><Title>AIRBUST DIVEDEND</Title><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1376523410210</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-14 19:36:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I quess in waynes warped world divedends don't count.ROTFLMAO</Msg><Username>unposter76</Username><Timestamp>1376584929021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 12:42:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376585248464-38</Id><Title>260k sitting on the sidlines, if this falls below 100</Title><Msg>I will be all in</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1376585248464</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 12:47:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376585982458-39</Id><Topic><Title>FMH on Dividends BAcompared AB and actual money and rolled in stock gains on a 200K investmnet</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1376545258185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 01:40:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>for the dividend issue the above puts FMH statement into a easy to read and understand format .

Boeing barker cronies, its easy, the Boeing stock volume is going down from a average of 5.7 million shares to now 3.7 million shares(read a stock chart) and stock was at 107-109 a very high Boeing price. Imagine a truck going up the hill(stock price) with less engine (stock trade volume) it stalls out its is easy.

Then he would say he was going to sell in the next day or two for a dollar per share gain. He did it over and over again.

Airbus is not considering increasing their dividend payout substantially , if done that comparison will swing much more toward Airbus and now for a year to date comparison with dividends for the barker boys This is what a 200k investment dividend , year to date would pay you for Boeing it would be $3341 US dollars , for Airbus after taxes it would be $2616. International takeout taxes first. (15%) For a period of one year from today going back 1 year without dividend included in stock price gain Airbus is up 60%, Boeing is up 41% . With dividend reinvested Boeing stock price would have gained 43%, Airbus stock price gain with dividend reinvestment is 62% both companies , the duopoly, know what each other does so that dividend is not significant. So unless you want to live on $3341 off 200k from Boeing or $2616 year to date dividends then the only factor ina investment choice is stock price gain. Airbus betters Boeing over the 5 year period at a stock price gain of 172.91% that means each dollar invested in Airbus has made you $1.73 for Boeing you worse off , only made 60.82%. Airbus is executing better than Boeing they are number 1 and will be as long as the A350 delivers and Airbus knows that. FMH did a correct dividend analysis . I just put it into dollars and percentage , so investors might understand the number . Here is foulmouthharbors statement "So airbus has paid investors a total of 1.49/ share since 2009.

Such discussions by union members are protected by the National Labor Relation Act (NLRA). Employers’ efforts to curb these discussions violate federal law. In addition to this obvious violation of labor law, SPEEA has received numerous complaints from employees about managers telling them to remove and not display union material at their personal workstation. Employees also report finding union-related items removed from individual work areas when they arrive at work each day. SPEEA asks members to document any such conversations with managers or the removal of items from their desks and then relay the information to union officials. Report questionable conversations with managers or when they find union material removed from work areas. ++++ yep wayne- grab your socks and tell us the result</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1376618437089</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 22:00:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376619897359-130</Id><Title>Obama will not stop supporting terrorists</Title><Msg>at every turn</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1376619897359</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 22:24:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376621090612-131</Id><Topic><Title>What does the Bible say about homosexuality?</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1376589894248</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 14:04:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as you are making no sense, could you re-explain this one please? by gregjanetommax • Apr 14, 2013 9/11 was another Democrats failure to take action to kill Bin Laden who was also responsible for the Subprime Lending legislation that eventually wrecked our economy</Msg><Username>georgewbushisachickenhawk</Username><Timestamp>1376621090612</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 22:44:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376621897279-132</Id><Topic><Title>What does the Bible say about homosexuality?</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1376589894248</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 14:04:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I read "specious and cynical" and then it made sense: a pseudochristian sharing his vast wisdom with the world.</Msg><Username>sammy.shakedown</Username><Timestamp>1376621897279</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-08-15 22:58:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376622154926-133</Id><Topic><Title>Iraqi Airlines thrives, Takes Delivery</Title><Username>jumbojetski</Username><Timestamp>1376446966440</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-13 22:22:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one said yesterday's 737 delivery was a hallucination.

First, I am not sure what you mean by "second generation of Christians". And, second, given that the Apostle Paul wrote half of the New Testament, his demonstrated path and purpose at his conversion, even unto his death, was to spread the Gospel and further the cause of Christ - i.e., to reach out and save the world. I am not sure what you might be referring to relative to Paul trying to prevent the advent of succeeding generations of Christians.
