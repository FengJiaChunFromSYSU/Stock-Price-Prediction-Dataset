Credit: intenteffect via Flickr Credit: intenteffect via Flickr The New York Post reported today that an Obamacare grant recipient, Seedco, was sued by the federal government in 2012 for lying on government reports in order to receive additional bonus money. As reported by the New York Times last year, Seedco received more than $8 million in federal grants for operating job placement centers. According to federal prosecutors, Seedco falsely reported that it had successfully matched jobseekers with jobs by basing their claims on the positions jobseekers already had. “By reporting thousands of fake job placements, Seedco collected ‘performance payments’ totaling perhaps as much as $1.6 million over five years,” reported Michael Powell with the New York Times. The lawsuit did not stop the federal government from awarding Seedco another multi-million dollar contract, this time as a coordinator for the Obamacare Navigator program. The Navigator program provides millions of dollars to organizations such as Seedco to hire “navigators” who will advise Americans on their Obamacare health “options” based on the sensitive information provided, such as social security numbers, income levels, employment history and home addresses.

We want our chapters to organize themselves as a working model that we can then take to other veterans organizations, such as the VFW, American Legion, Marine Corps League, etc. in each town and help them establish such teams within their already existing veterans halls. And likewise, to serve as a model and training cadre to help churches, neighborhood watches, and any other civic organization organize. We are basing this on the Special Forces model, which has a twelve man “A team” of specially trained soldiers who are inserted into a community to train and lead that community in resistance to oppressive regimes (hence their motto: “De Oppresso Liber). . SF’s primary mission is to teach, organize, and lead, rather than to directly fight. They can fight, of course, but they are most dangerous as a force-multiplier by helping an entire community to fight.

SF’s primary mission is to teach, organize, and lead, rather than to directly fight. They can fight, of course, but they are most dangerous as a force-multiplier by helping an entire community to fight. We will do the same – be force multipliers to help prepare communities so they can preserve civilization by providing their own security, disaster relief, infrastructure preservation, emergency communications, strategic food reserve, and medical care. In an SF team, there are: Two communications experts. Two Medics. Two Combat Engineers (who can do more than demolitions. They can also build bridges, dig wells, install water-treatment, irrigation systems, etc. ). Two weapons experts. An Operations NCO. An Assistant Operations NCO who also does intelligence. A commanding officer, and his assistant commanding officer. Each SF soldier is first trained to be light infantry. They all go through Army Basic Training, Advanced Individual Training (AIT)(usually at the Infantry School at Ft. Benning), Airborne School, and then the SF Selection course, where they learn land navigation (including a difficult timed night land-nav course), wilderness survival (including a graded field “survival” exercise), and patrolling (including reconnaissance, ambushes, raids, reacting to ambush, movement to contact, etc), along with a timed ruck march, obstacle course, rappelling out of helicopters, and hand-to-hand. And then they learn their specialty of one of the above – medic, commo, engineer, weapons, etc. Then they put it all together in a field training final phase where they are dropped into the fictitious country of “Pineland” (in the mountains and forests of North Carolina) and have to teach and lead the indigenous people (played by other recruits waiting to enter the training) in irregular warfare against the enemy. Then, once they graduate and make it to Group, they all cross train, each specialized team of two training the others so they are all pretty good at all tasks, but experts within their chosen specialty. They bring each-other up to a high standard of capability. And by having two of each specialty, they have redundancy (two is one, and one is none) and the ability to split into two teams of six if needed. They can function as a very capable fighting squad if they need to, but their primary mission is to train and lead others in irregular warfare. Oath Keepers is using that successful model and adapting it to our mission, to form Oath Keepers “Civilization Preservation Teams”. The following is a preliminary draft of what we intend to do, to be further modified and improved with our members’ continued input. This is not written in stone – it is just a start. All who read this, please help us make it better by leaving in the comments your suggestions for improvement. What are we missing? What needs to be changed? How can we make it better? So far,we plan to have the following in each Operational “Field” Team: Two Communication Experts Two medical experts (with a special focus on grid-down emergency medical and wilderness medicine) Two Engineers To assist with fuel, shelter, emergency power, clean water, sewage, etc. build bridges, clear roads, construction, facilitate field distribution of supply and logistics, etc. Two Strategic Food Reserve (SFR) specialists (who focus on the critical need for food reserves for the whole team, dependents, and especially for the community and who distribute food aid in the field). Four to Six “Scouts.” All Scouts will train extensively in tracking, land navigation, search and rescue, reconnaissance and observation, precision rifle shooting, wilderness survival and other “bush skills,” camouflage, small unit tactics, and patrolling (and then will serve as a teaching cadre to cross-train all other team members in the basics of all of those skills). But within each Scout sub-team will be, ideally: a. Two tracking experts b. two precision shooting experts c. Two close combat and small unit tactics experts Those are the operational specialties and sub-teams within each field team at this time. Each specialty will train in-depth and become true experts in those sub-category skills. As of now, our intent is for each field team of 12-14 people to elect their team leader and assistant team leader themselves, from within their own team. But let us know if you think it should be done a different way, and if you think that once a team leader and ATL are elected, that their slots need to be filled with other people joining the team. Can they lead and still do their specialty, or is it important enough that they concentrate on leading (including intelligence functions and liaison with military, police, local government, state, other groups, etc.) that they should not be expected to perform field duties within their specialty, but instead an additional person should be added to the team to fill those slots? Let us know what you think. Within each chapter will also be a Support Team (Logistic Supply/Support Group (LSG). This will be an auxiliary to assist the Field team with supplies and transport. The people within that support team will also train extensively with the field team. Picture older veterans with extensive knowledge, but who no longer feel fit enough to go out into the field. They can serve as trainers, and then as support for operations, and as part of a field HQ to give direction and advice over the radio to the field units. They can also drive vehicles, prepare shelter and rear -recovery area for the teams, etc. For example, imagine an old Marine Scout Sniper vet with bad knees, or an old Special Forces vet with a bad back. Neither of them will likely be interested in humping a ruck up and down mountains, but they can sure train the hell out of the younger guys. Ditto for retired medics and communications/radio men. Their knowledge is priceless, and can and will save lives and could save our country, if properly applied and then amplified and spread. They can train the Field Teams, and make sure they really know what they are doing, with no bull allowed, and then they can be there as part of the Support Team, and as part of the HQ element that is likely going to be with the Support Team. Within that support team, will be critical supply and logistics personnel, such as strategic food reserve, who get the food ready to go and help deliver it to the field SFR personnel, and same for back-up and support for the other Field Team specialists. And also within that team will be general supply and logistics, motorpool, and base station and portable HQ communications experts, an intel team, and a base station medical team which may even be able to set up a mobile field hospital (presuming the expertise is available, and the supplies). Along side the support team will be a chapter headquarters unit, consisting of the local chapter leader and assistant chapter leader. We will flesh this out with more formal structure shortly. So far, that is it for the field team(s) an the support team. What are we missing? Anything need to be added, or changed? Within each chapter should also be the following sub-teams for use both during “normal” times and also during emergencies: Peace Officer Liaison and Sheriff /posse Team. Focused on making sure the local Sheriff is a “constitutional Sheriff” who understands the Constitution and the duty to defend it, and making sure there is a posse to back the sheriff up, but also reaching out to city police and deputies. This team would preferably be led by a retired peace officer, who will get to know all local police. That team will also serve as the HQ liaison between the chapter HQ and local, state, and federal law enforcement (with a focus on the locals). Military and National Guard Liaison. To communicate with and build relationships with local military and national guard units, and serve as liaisons during operations. Neighborhood Watch Team. To help form neighborhood watches throughout the local community and liaison with them. Local Government Team. To get to know the local town council, county government, judges, county attorney, etc, and observe each town and county government meeting. This is the team that will draft and introduce militia bills, posse bills, and nullification bills, among other items to support liberty at the local level, and will help liaison with them all during emergencies. Intelligence Team. To gather, analyze, and disseminate intelligence on who is doing what, where, when, and why.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380715730366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 08:08:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380715771427-13</Id><Topic><Title>Oath Keepers is Going “Operational” by Forming Special “Civilization Preservation” Teams</Title><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380715634453</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 08:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Chapters can form additional teams as needed in their own area and circumstances, but those are the basics. Like SF, all Oath Keepers will be expected to learn light infantry skills. They will all be encouraged to attend an Appleseed Rifle Program and shoot to “Rifleman” standards. Just as the Marines say that every Marine is a Rifleman (even the cooks) so will every Oath Keeper be a rifleman. After learning solid rifle marksmanship, they will learn individual movement and tactics, then buddy team, fire-team, and squad movement and tactics (shoot, move, communicate). All of you infantry veterans need to step up and teach these skills to everyone else. So, it is not just the Scouts who will learn those skills – everyone on a field team will learn them, and even the support team members should at least train in the basics so they can defend themselves. All will learn land navigation, basic wilderness survival, basic first aid and combat lifesaver skills, and basic patrolling and small unit tactics. as in SF, each will pick one (or two, if they have the time) specialty sub-categories to train in-depth in, and then each will cross train in other specialties. Ideally, all would at least be exposed to training in tracking and precision shooting. With other team members training to a high state of capability, and available to cross-train other members, the only real limitation is time to train. Each has a focus, but is encouraged to cross-train extensively. Within a chapter, when you get enough people to form more field teams, you do it. Replicate and multiply them like cells dividing and multiplying. All who are interested in each specialty will train together for two months, and then form the field teams and train as a whole team. For example, if ya chapter had four or five people interested in the medical specialty, they would all train together, to set training goals, standards, gear selection, SOPs, etc (with bonafide medics, corpsmen, and EMTs taking the lead, but anyone would be welcome to train for the team who commits to that track). They train together for two months before you set up any Field Teams, but even after they are sent into field teams, those medical track personnel still get together for ongoing training among themselves. Within each two man sub-team, the one with the most knowledge is the lead between the two. For example, a prior service medic or corpsman would be paired up with a newbie who would serve as his apprentice while the newbie gets trained up. All would be encouraged to seek formal training, such as local college EMT classes, Wilderness Medicine classes, and tactical medicine classes (which are rare, but do exist for civilians). But no one would be turned away just because they are new to the field. All who are committed to that specialty track will be welcome, but expected to train their butts off, and they will be under the direct supervision of those with more training (by the way, this is how volunteer fire departments do it. The older and wiser guys train the newbs). And the same for all the other specialties. What will be of utmost importance is that those with real-deal experience and professional training in any of the above need to step up and help train up these specialties and sub-teams within their local chapter and community. Duplicate yourself, replicate yourself! Teach others what you know, and help them form up into working teams. Even if you are too old, injured, or whatever to go out into a field situation humping a ruck, you can still teach, and help them get squared away. And remember, the primary mission is to build up a competent training cadre, as force multipliers, with a working model, to then get the local veterans groups to form up similar teams within their local veteran hall, and then to go out and help the community form similar teams in neighborhood watches, mutual aid associations, within churches, and then within the broader town and county. Therefore, all the medics, even the older guys who are not able to go into some field conditions, will be on the teaching team when they go out to teach others during “normal” times. Ditto for all the other specialties. And so, you should not just be forming these teams within your local Oath Keepers chapter and helping local veterans halls do the same, but also within your own family and circle of friends, and within your own neighborhood (who’s on your buddy team, who’s on your fire team, who’s on your squad?). Start a neighborhood watch and then build a solid field team and a support team within your own neighborhood. When the crap hits the fan, you need well-trained people around you, with complementary skills, who can help you get through. Like Kevin Reeve of Onpoint Tactical says: “training trumps gear. And community trumps both training and gear.” You can’t know it all, or do it all, and you have to sleep sometime. So build a team, build community, and preserve civilization.It starts with you, your family, your small circle of most trusted friends, then your neighborhood, your church, your veterans halls in your town, the Sheriff’s posse, the local search and rescue, volunteer fire, etc., and then out to your county and state. WHY WE ARE DOING THIS: In addition to this being part of our mission anyway, we feel like we are flat running out of time and we need to get as prepared as possible as fast as possible. The Oath Keepers national Board of Directors war-gamed what we think is the most likely move by our enemies to scrap the Constitution. On the BOD at the time were a Special Forces Major, an Army Ranger, and a Marine Scout-sniper veteran, as well as a retired Navy Commander and several Vietnam combat vets, and several other combat arms veterans. Playing devil’s advocate, and putting themselves in the enemy’s shoes, we estimated that the most effective course for “them” to follow would be to: 1. Intentionally trigger a catastrophic economic collapse as an economic “neutron bomb” (kills the people, but leaves the land intact). With the current intentional lack of a Strategic Grain Reserve, our population is in a strategic “checkmate” position where an economic collapse could be a near-extinction event for our population. During the Cold War, the U.S. government maintained three years worth of grain in a Strategic Grain Reserve for the entire US population because they knew that in the wake of a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union, it could take three years to recover and grow crops again. Without that reserve, those who survived the exchange would starve to death before they could possibly restart growing enough food. We now have no such Strategic food reserve, which means that any catastrophic interruption in food delivery could kill millions of Americans. Such a disruption could occur because of even a limited nuclear exchange, an EMP strike (either man-made, or natural, as a result of solar activity), or, an economic collapse. Currently, our economy is in such a weak state that an economic collapse could be intentionally triggered at any time. Because of the lack of a food reserve, and because few Americans store food on their own, such a collapse would lead to mass starvation, just like in the aftermath of a nuclear exchange. The US government is spending billions of dollars on ammunition, armored vehicles, and weapons for DHS and local police. It is spending nothing on food for the people. They are preparing to control and contain us, and to shoot us, but not preparing to feed us. Why is that? You know the answer. 2. Let the country descend into chaos. A national economic collapse would be like a “national Katrina” but lasting far longer, and because it is nation-wide, it would be far more intense. The cities would implode. All the government would have to do is contain them and let them implode. in the midst of that chaos, they could also do a decapitation strike on the leaders of the liberty movement, but other than that, “They” could just sit back and wait a month, two months, or three to be really sure the people are at a maximum level of starvation, weakness, and chaos, and then: 3. Ride in like the cavalry, to “save” us by means of martial law and scrapping our constitution once-and-for all. They could blame the collapse on the so-called “free market” and on not having enough government power, and they could blame delays in relief on the “extremists” in the patriot movement (i.e. “we would have gotten the food trucks in sooner, but the extremists were ambushing our safety check-points and resisting the necessary relocation to relief camps”). Their ready to go solution would be a world-wide version of the Fed, and a world wide government. People would be told to “just turn in your guns, and you’ll get food” and “just turn in the extremists, and you’ll get food.” ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS: To the above, we now add Brandon Smith’s insight that with a war in Syria, the elites can trigger an economic collapse with a war – with Russia and China using economics as a weapon in retaliation. All China would have to do is dump US treasuries and refuse to trade with US dollars. That would begin the final death-spiral of the dollar. The Chinese would be blamed for the collapse, rather than the banksters. “They” would tell the American people that the evil Chinese are to blame for the death of the dollar, and anyone who resists the “emergency measures” by the US government would be accused of aiding the enemy. They would say “domestic extremists took advantage of the Chinese economic attack on us to push their own racist and extremist anti-government agenda, making the collapse worse by attacking peace-keepers and international relief volunteers, and by attacking and resisting US officials who were trying to restore law and order.” It is because of the systemic weakness of the American people, and our strategic checkmate position of having no strategic food storage and no effective local security, that we feel the need to take Oath Keepers operational and put our focus on each chapter being a training cadre to get their communities as prepared and organized as possible in whatever time we have left. We urge you to presume the worst in the short term, and to work in three or four month sprints – assume that a collapse will be triggered this fall/winter and do all you can to get yourselves and your communities ready. If it doesn’t happen in the next four months, then do another sprint, of three or four more months of preparation. And keep going until it happens – which it will eventually, no matter what anyone does. The dollar is doomed. We encourage each individual to build a food reserve, to set aside food for their neighbors (10% of their food is for others), and to have basic communications (at least a hand-held dual band radio), basic medical, and water purification, shelter, and weapons and ammo. We will post more details on our recommendations for preparedness in a follow-up post. Everyone is encouraged to use the above team building model and template to build a team within their family, extended family, and friends, and to then do the same in their neighborhoods, and in their civic organizations. From the individual, to the family, neighborhood, civic org, town, county, and state. Bottom up. OK. Let us know how to improve the above. For the Republic, Stewart Rhodes Founder and President of Oath Keepers PS - As a reminder and clarification, from the beginning of Oath Keepers we have had two prongs to our mission:1. Reinforce the oath-keeping of the current serving. 2. Reinforce the oath-keeping of the veterans (and any citizens who want to join us in our efforts). From the start, we have been about more than just RTI to the current serving, and well over a year ago we launched our Operation Sleeping Giant, to help put more focus on waking up veterans groups and on the critical need for people to implement preparedness, security, economic independence, and local sovereignty, in their local communities as part of our effort to restore the Republic from the ground up. However, that aspect of our mission has still not gotten the attention it deserves among our members. All too often I see and hear members describing their mission as just “RTI” to the current serving and not fully implementing the other half of our strategy. So, to bring that second prong of our mission back where it belongs – with equal attention paid to it along with RTI to the current serving – we will be including the Operation Sleeping Giant mission on our main website, rather than having it on some sister-site (which is not getting it done). And, most importantly, we will be instructing our members, and our local and state chapters, to form up into operational mutual-aid and community-aid teams, just like we are asking the veterans groups to do. Some of our local chapters are already doing this, but we need to make it a nation-wide effort, and a main part of our mission. We have been asking VFW halls, Marine Corps League halls, etc. to see themselves as a unit, as a source of stability and aid to their communities, as the pool of manpower that can serve as a civil defense unit for their town and county, as the Sheriff’s Posse, and as a pool of manpower that can serve as the militia for their community (preferably established by formal act of their city or county government). Likewise for churches, neighborhood watches, etc. If we are going to ask veterans groups, and neighborhood watches, to see themselves as such a unit, then we need to do the same within our own org, and especially within our local chapters at the town and county level. That way, when we talk to veterans groups, we won’t be asking them to do anything that we are not doing ourselves, and we can also work out the bugs and have a working model for what we want them to do. The ultimate goal is not to have all the veterans join Oath Keepers and have a bunch of Oath Keepers teams doing all the work in each town and county. Instead, the ultimate goal is for us to help them get their already existing veterans orgs organized into well trained (and training), well equipped, and organized teams. And, even broader than that, the goal is to enlist their help in then establishing strong neighborhood watches throughout their community, and then strong town and county level civil-defense units, posse, and ultimately, strong town and county militia, on the way to fully restoring the state militia. As I said above, think of this as a Special Forces type mission. SF can do direct action, but their primary job, and what makes them a serious force multiplier, is to train and then lead others. An SF A team is first and foremost a cadre of teachers, who help organize and train others to take care of themselves. That is how we should see ourselves. Our primary job is not to have Oath Keepers try to be the security force in our towns and counties, but to help the entire community, and key parts of it, get their crap wired tight so they can take care of themselves. That way, we are a force multiplier, much like SF. Trust me, our enemies will not be happy about us doing this! They would much rather we try to form ourselves into some exclusive, members-only “militia” that will only get so big. They don’t want us going into already existing veterans orgs and reactivating those veterans and helping them turn their local VFW into a working unit. Nor do they want us to help folks establish effective neighborhood watches (with teeth) and effective mutual aid associations in churches, Tea Party groups, and at the town and county level. Nor do they want us to help form up a posse to back a good sheriff. So, let’s do what they don’t want us to do. And let’s lead by example for the following reasons: 1. So we walk our talk. We can say with a straight face that we are not asking anyone else to do anything we are not doing ourselves. 2. So we have a working model of what we want other groups to do, where we work out the bugs on what works, and what doesn’t, and which they can adopt as an easy, “turn-key” solution, with our recommended structure, SOPs, recommended training priorities, and equipment lists. Of course, they can adapt and modify what we do to their particular needs, but at least we can offer them a good start by our own example. 3. So we have a solid training cadre of specialists in key skills who can then work to replicate themselves both within our org and also within the broader community. And a big part of that replication will be to get other veterans orgs to realize they already have members of their halls who have unique knowledge who can serve as their own version of an operational team as well as a cadre of trainers who then go out and train others in the community.</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380715771427</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 08:09:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380717132661-14</Id><Title>GAP AT $112 THAT WHERE WE GO TODAY !!!!!!!!THE BIG FALL WILL BE WORST THAN 2009 !

I chalked it up as an isolated act of ignoring one of the administration's heavy-handed "shutdown" ploys -- one that would be overlooked by the powers-that-be for obvious reasons. Wrong. America's Big Government overlords were apparently quite displeased that these war heroes were permitted to survey a public monument to their brothers in arms who paid the ultimate price in the fight against Imperial Japan and the Nazis. Parks workers were dispatched to erect additional fencing to prevent today's crop of 'Honor Flight' vets from accessing the memorial: Amazingly, one of the park workers told reporters that she was specifically exempted from shutdown-induced furlough in order to guard the memorial against the scourge of octogenarian visitors. Surreal. As Carol wrote last night, this officious absurdity was explicitly orchestrated by the White House: The White House and the Department of the Interior rejected a request from Rep. Steven Palazzo’s office to have World War II veterans visit the World War II memorial in Washington, the Mississippi Republican told The Daily Caller Tuesday. Palazzo helped the veterans commit an act of civil disobedience against the Park Service Tuesday, when the heroes stormed through barricades around the closed memorial. Indeed, sending staffers to block access to this location actually takes more effort, and costs more money, than simply leaving it open: The White House has promised to veto House Republicans' bill that would re-open national parks, fully fund the VA, and restore the flow of money to DC's local government. The GOP is also weighing NIH funding, to neutralize this talking point. Will Democrats block that, too? So far, our president says he won't sign a bill designed to re-open this memorial, but he will release park service workers from their mandatory furlough status to go and inhibit senior citizens' access to said memorial. What lessons might Americans draw from this posture? Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) decries the whole situation as "cynical." Not the act of turning an unstaffed, open-air war memorial into a fortress, mind you -- the attempt to re-open it:</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380730942421</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 12:22:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380731428697-45</Id><Topic><Title>ROMOR IS SOME AIR LINES ARE CANCELING OR DELAYING THERE NEW ORDERS</Title><Username>americafirst739</Username><Timestamp>1380717257502</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 08:34:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That will be called a 2 for 1 split by the way ......rumor is spelled R-O-O-M-E-R......not R-O-M-O-R</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1380731428697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 12:30:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380731536314-46</Id><Title>Guess who just blinked?</Title><Msg>With his jerk move exposed for all to see, guess who just blinked?

Dear GOP, For a crowd that loves to bray about the Constitution, it seems you have misplaced your copy. How else to explain your bizarre efforts to destroy the world unless you get your way? I'm just a bill on capitol hill -- Schoolhouse rock (VERTICAL) You don't like the Affordable Care Act. You've made it obvious. But it was passed the correct way, in a Congress that generally doesn't pass #$%$. It made it through the House, and it made it through the Senate. It wasn't passed in the "dead of night", nor was it "rammed down" anyone's throat like you jokers like to claim. It passed only after an excruciating 14-months of debate and negotiations. But all your hysterical shrieking about death panels and communism couldn't stop it. Finally, the president signed it into law. Us liberals weren't thrilled when it passed. Just relieved. We didn't get anything near what we wanted. After all, we're not in the business of fighting for Heritage Foundation-created ideas championed by the likes of Newt Gingrich and first adopted by Republican governors (the guy you nominated, in fact!). If we couldn't get single payer, we at least wanted a public option—an expansion of Medicare for all. But alas, we went to D.C. with the Congress we had, not the one we wanted. And really, given the dysfunction in D.C., it's amazing we got anything at all. So now that the law is about to be fully implemented, you're still not happy. You're still shrieking about death panels and communism, and even the death of freedom! Yeah, yeah, we get it. The 42 (or whatever) votes in the House to repeal Obamacare have made it very clear. But here's the thing: If you want to truly get rid of the law, you have to do it the proper way, as specified in that Constitution you pretend to cherish. Those House votes? Those are a good start! Great job! You're a third of the way there. Because you still have to get that bill passed by the Senate.

Through August, Boeing received orders for 786 commercial airplanes compared to 902 received by Airbus. Airbus SAS booked sales valued at more than $15 billion on a single day from Asia, underscoring the region’s role in driving global demand for commercial jets. The deals, once confirmed, will bring Airbus beyond the 1,000 aircraft orders the company has predicted it can garner this year.

Last week, South Korea’s air force indicated that Boeing’s F-15SE (Silent Eagle) proposal, which had earlier been selected as sole compliant bidder by the country’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), would not be acceptable for the FX-3 fighter competition. In short, the RoKAF implied, the service wanted Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Also this month, Boeing announced that the C-17 strategic transport would end production in 2015, after the next 22 planes are delivered. Some of these last batch aircraft are being built on spec, albeit for likely customers. The short-term survival of the F-15 line isn’t a problem for Boeing. The company has just started building 84 planes for Saudi Arabia. But the RoKAF’s harsh pronouncement effectively kills the F-15SE proposal, and eliminates any hope of finding a sixth F-15 export customer (Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Korea are the sole members of this exclusive club). It also means that the current Saudi Arabian order will almost certainly be the last major sales success, and that the line will close in 2018 or 2019. But this development, and the C-17 announcement, highlight a serious military platform sunset problem. The F-15 and C-17 are the second and third most important Boeing military aircraft in terms of revenue, but the F/A-18 is first. This too is an endangered product. Unless the US Navy changes its mind (procurement is scheduled to end in the next fiscal year) or an export order arrives, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet will shut by 2016. So far, there is only one export customer, Australia. Brazil’s FX-2 competition was the best hope for an order, but given the Brazilian economy and animosity towards the US, this looks unlikely. Meanwhile the V-22 tiltrotor (built in partnership with Textron’s Bell unit) is ramping down too, along with all US military rotorcraft, including Boeing’s CH-47</Msg><Username>fred.james48</Username><Timestamp>1380733768802</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 13:09:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380734019529-64</Id><Topic><Title>Rand Paul: Obama's 'Goons' blocked WWII Memorial</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380720001707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 09:20:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Senate Democrats simply don't want to be blackmailed into revisiting LAW that has been passed, signed, and OK'ed after judicial review.

America has always carried debt going back to the Revolutionary War, and every president except Harry Truman raised the debt ceiling throughout the nation’s history. Reagan raised it 18 times, George H.W. Bush raised it 6 times, Bill Clinton raised it 4 times, and George W. Bush raised it 7 times nearly doubling the deficit to cover his two unnecessary wars, tax cuts for the rich, and the pharmaceutical industry’s gift; the Medicare prescription plan. Throughout all those increases to pay for debts incurred by Congress, Republicans never held it hostage or demanded concessions amounting to eliminating laws, defunding agencies into oblivion, or enacting the entire GOP legislative agenda for the 112th and 113th sessions of Congress. It leads one to contemplate exactly what Earth-shattering event so stunned Republicans that they abandoned their conservative opposition to change and embraced a new hostage-taking approach to paying the nation’s debt. Obviously, it cannot be because a Democrat is president because they did not demand a ransom to raise the limit when Bill Clinton was president, so it has to be because this Democratic President is African American. Republicans have refused to negotiate on a number of issues over the past four years and the most recent opposition is House Republicans’ refusal to consider or negotiate on any Senate version of a measure to keep the government open past October 1st that does not include eliminating the Affordable Care Act. Now they are criticizing the President of the United States because he rightly refuses to negotiate with Republicans over their refusal to do their constitutionally mandated job of paying their debts. It is the kind of change only a Republican could embrace. Republicans do hate change, and when Americans chose an African American man as President instead of a white Republican it was a change they could not comport so they changed into obstructionists and enemies of the people. The Republicans were never interested in governing for the entire population, but since the election of Barack Obama not only have they stopped governing, they are making it nearly impossible for anyone to govern; unless one calls holding the full faith and credit of the United States hostage governing.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1380737349840</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:09:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380737425278-82</Id><Topic><Title>More Government Mean Less Freedom</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380736463037</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 13:54:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To what authoritarian policies do you refer?</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380737425278</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:10:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380737687536-83</Id><Topic><Title>More Government Mean Less Freedom</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380736463037</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 13:54:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DHS for starters</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1380737687536</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:14:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380737833676-84</Id><Topic><Title>Guess who just blinked?</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380731536314</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 12:32:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are you #$%$ off the veterans that post here?</Msg><Username>david_aames_12</Username><Timestamp>1380737833676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:17:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380737939954-85</Id><Topic><Title>Well rockstar, What part of the Constitution am I violating?</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380736917890</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:01:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>George Bush was not an example of frugality or constitutional obedience......so you aren't exactly making sense when you say if George Bush did Something, Democrats should be able to do more of it.

The Tea Party is a joke. John McCain had a verifiable service record. In 1952, McCain's military service to America would have made him the perfect Republican candidate, as Eisenhower was at the time. Instead, they wanted Sarah Palin at the top of a ticket A #$%$ mayor of a town with more wildlife than people ( yes, I know she moved up... but it still holds true ) and who had no military experience. Ted Nugent feigned ( ? ) insanity to dodge the draft. Yet, Palin and Nugent are revered by the Tea Party while McCain is reviled. I'll admit to being too young for Vietnam, but I have spoken with veterans who still hold a bit of a grudge toward Muhammed Ali for being a conscientious objector. They didn't think it was fair to get out of service in that manner. But they would have even stronger feelings of anger toward Nugent. Limbaugh, Hannity, and so many others of the Tea Party ( types ) have not served that the Republican Party has virtually no respect for those that have. Eisenhower would be disappointed.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380738486329</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:28:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380738551867-88</Id><Topic><Title>More Government Mean Less Freedom</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380736463037</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 13:54:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm for getting rid of it.

I just think politics is one thing and military service is another. I do not think my Purple Heart makes my political views any more worthwhile than anyone else's (unlike Sparty's knee-jerk defense of our board cretin by suggesting he has a Purple Heart.) On the other hand, it riles me a bit when people disparage my love of the country and it's political processes after I *did* serve. You are correct that the MOST sanctimonious defenders of "freedom" are people who could not have been bothered to defend it with their bodies. But assuming the talk is limited to politics and not military service, then anyone's opinion is as worthwhile as mine (not necessarily as good, but as worth voicing:-). That is why I called Sparty's comment about mir's Purple Heart hypocrisy -- if his respect doesn't extend to others with a Purple Heart because he dislikes their politics, then Purple Heartness has NO PLACE is his half of any political dialog. Mir was on his way to acknowledging that in his followup post, but he snatched defeat from the jaws of victory when he tried to draw John Kerry into it.</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1380739831741</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:50:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380739852231-94</Id><Topic><Title>Will Obamacare work for You</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1380730270512</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 12:11:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When I say include office visits regardless of deductible, I mean you pay $35 for the visit, besides any treatment. Here is the purpose of insurance: Risk reduction. Everyone pays something in the hopes that they don't have a catastrophic event. In the event of a catastrophic event, their core assets are protected. Case in point: My sister was doing really well, like a lot of people in the early 2000's: small business going great guns, and a home. She turns her home into a rental and buys a nicer home. Then, not only the housing bubble bursts, but she learns she has cancer. She has insurance, but finds out it is next to useless. She learns her cancer is treatable, but requires surgery, chemotherapy and radiation: all very expensive. Everyone in her medical treatment group works to get her on usable insurance of some sort that is still very expensive, and she gets better. She gets cancelled from all but the most expensive insurance known to Man, and decides to let her second house go on a short sale, sacrificing all she had invested in it. She barely scraped by until she could get on Medicare. That is what you are guarding against when you buy insurance. Unless you already have a chronic illness, you care less about going to the doctor often and care more about protecting your assets. A $10,000 deductible beats losing a house.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1380739852231</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:50:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380739980459-95</Id><Topic><Title>Guess who just blinked?</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380731536314</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 12:32:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You just get more petty as we go along....Im begginning to think Floyd is right...you ARE Chris Genna</Msg><Username>spartacus13579</Username><Timestamp>1380739980459</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:53:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380740135419-96</Id><Topic><Title>winter weather descends on Everett</Title><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1380738864925</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:34:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It looks Cold.</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1380740135419</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 14:55:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380740223513-97</Id><Topic><Title>Guess who just blinked?</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380731536314</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 12:32:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mir, there's no reason to believe anything you say.

Certainly. But I once read an analysis of Eisenhower as being the "closest thing" to the perfect Republican candidate, in large part because of his military background. It earned him a lot of respect, and even though I don't think his vice president had much battle experience, he was photographed in a military uniform.

The delays, if they started, would likely affect the plane maker's newest models, such as the 787, and could affect development of other new models such as the stretched 787-9 derivative, the company said. Boeing said the delays depend on how long the shutdown lasts and would worsen if the budget impasse persists. It also would affect numerous programs and products in the company's defense business. "Newer airplanes and new configurations or those delivered from Charleston, those could be slowed or delayed during the shutdown." The slowdown would affect Boeing's 787 factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, because the FAA has held on to some of its airplane certification roles at that relative new factory, Dern said.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1380748245085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 17:10:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380748306782-136</Id><Topic><Title>More Government Mean Less Freedom</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1380736463037</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 13:54:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What corporations are oppressing the people?

As of Wednesday afternoon, the number of those Republicans hit 18 -- surpassing the magic 17 votes needed to pass a clean funding bill if all 200 Democrats stick together and team up with them. Of course, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) would have to be willing to put that bill on the floor in the first place. But if he did, the votes appear to be there for passage, at which point the bill would sail through the Senate and be signed by President Barack Obama, ending the shutdown. Here's who those House Republicans are, and why they say they're done with trying to force through provisions to delay or defund Obamacare in order to keep the government running. We'll update the list when, or if, more come in. ---------- Rep. Pat Meehan (R-Pa.): “At this point, I believe it’s time for the House to vote for a clean, short-term funding bill to bring the Senate to the table and negotiate a responsible compromise.” [Press Release, 10/1/13] Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.): “Time for a clean [continuing resolution].” [Official Twitter, 10/1/13] Rep. Jon Runyan (R-N.J.): “Enough is enough. Put a clean [continuing resolution] on the floor and let’s get on with the business we were sent to do." [Burlington County Times, 10/1/13] Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.): A Fitzpatrick aide tells the Philadelphia Inquirer the congressman would support a clean funding bill if it came up for a vote. [Philadelphia Inquirer, 10/1/13] Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.): Barletta said he would "absolutely" vote for a clean bill in order to avert a shut down of the government. [Bethlehem Morning Call, 10/1/13] Rep.

This is — to have someone of your intelligence to suggest such a thing maybe means you’re irresponsible and reckless BASH: I’m just asking a question. First, Reid talks about how well Obamacare is working, and how much people love it. Next, Reid callously blows off the pediatric cancer question. Finally, he insults CNN's Dana Bash for daring to ask a tough question. House Republicans are offering to fund a series of core government functions during the ongoing discussions over government funding, including the NIH. Democrats have rejected every overture. Since they've fallen in love with employing "hostage" rhetoric, why are Democrats in Washington willing to hold narrow, vital funding bills hostage to achieving full, overall funding? The president made headlines earlier today by inviting Congressional leaders to the White House this evening for a sit-down. Finally. But Jay Carney insisted during his subsequent press briefing that Obama still won't negotiate. So what's the point of this meeting, other than to lecture Republicans while claiming that he's being reasonable and coming to the bargaining table -- just not to bargain? Before you go, check this story out. It's almost as if they're capriciously trying to hurt average people: Federal officials have closed a number of popular tourist attractions in Washington, citing the government shutdown, but they've left lesser-known locations un-barricaded, as evidenced by an interactive map compiled by House Republicans. "It appears as though only the highly visible monuments and areas are being closed to the public — further proof that the Obama Administration is only playing politics and purposely choosing to make this shut down as painful as possible," House Natural Resources Committee chairman Doc Hastings, R-Wash., said. Hastings' committee staff compiled photos of high-profile, open-air sites closed by the National Park Service, including: the Georgetown Waterfront; the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial; the Sculpture Garden; parts of the National Mall; and the Lincoln Memorial.

The Country that went 589 Days Without a Government</Title><Msg>Senate leaders alleged the government freeze could stretch for several weeks, but some countries have weathered even longer deadlocks — take Belgium for instance. Between 2010-11 the democratic country of Belgium was run with no elected government official. While the United States shutdown was caused by dissent over Obamacare funding between the House and Senate, a rift between the Dutch-speaking North and the French-speaking South caused Belgium to go rogue. Given the fact, it seems rather ironic the country’s motto is "Unity Makes Strength.” State governments continued to function in Belgium during the ordeal, as they will in America. Herman Matthijs, a professor of politics at the Free University of Brussels, even said the shutdown had advantages: "A government without power can't introduce new taxes. On the other hand, a government without full powers can't take new measures concerning the outlays. The political crisis relating to the public finance saved money." According to TIME, zero government did little to alter the daily lives of Belgians and it curbed unwanted spending: “Many state functions, from education to welfare, have already been ceded over the years to regional and community governments. Belgium deftly helmed the presidency of the E.U. in the second half of 2010, and the caretaker government last month headed off market jitters over its debt levels by quickly agreeing on a tighter budget. The country is recovering well from the downturn, with growth last year at 2.1 percent (compared with the E.U. average of 1.5 percent), foreign investment doubling and unemployment at 8.5 percent, well below the E.U. average of 9.4 percent.” No one is advocating for a government shutdown in the United States. However, it is important to remember that allowing the time needed for the House and Senate to create a solution is a viable option. President Obama said Tuesday that the longer the shutdown, the worse the effects will be, and he left it to the House to cave-in: “So once again, I urge House Republicans to reopen the government, restart the services Americans depend on and allow the public servants who have been sent home to return to work. This is only going to happen when Republicans realize they don't get to hold the entire economy hostage over ideological demands.” Ideals are worth fighting for, Mr. President.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1380751119959</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 17:58:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380751157454-156</Id><Title>Republicans Hate Obamacare Because They're Afraid People Will Like It</Title><Msg>What if they called it "Cruz-care"? One of the big mysteries about the government shutdown is why Republicans are so furiously opposed to the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a., Obamacare. Yes, the Act has many problems, not the least of which are its high costs and mind-boggling complexity. But the Act's overall goal, which seems achievable, is to make health insurance more affordable for tens of millions of Americans. And although one can be frustrated about some details, it seems strange that this should cause a party to rage and howl and shut down the government. (On the contrary, it seems like the sort of thing that a certain kind of leader might justifiably be proud of — helping his or her constituents and their families gain access to something so basic and important.) So why are the Republicans so outraged about Obamacare? There are different theories. The Republicans themselves say that Obamacare will destroy the country. They rarely explain that assertion, though, so it's hard to know what they actually mean. They say that Obamacare will destroy the economy, by forcing businesses to spend more on health care costs and compliance and, in some cases, by hiring part-time workers instead of full-time ones. This may be true at the margin, but companies have long been spending more on health care and reducing health care benefits for their employees while shifting more of the costs onto them. (This is in part because our current system, in which employers pay for health care, is deeply flawed.) But the truth is that, for most companies, Obamacare just isn't that big a deal. I run a company, and that's the way I would characterize it: It's a little deal but not a big deal. It's not going to cause us to change our hiring plans or fire anyone. They say that Obamacare violates the Constitution. Lots of people said this after the government voted Obamacare into law, but the Supreme Court said that they're wrong. So this argument doesn't hold much water, either. Outside the Republican Party, there are different theories. Some say the Republicans just hate anything that Obama likes. Based on the last five years, there's seems to be plenty of evidence to support this theory. But there seems to be even more than that going on here. Another theory, popular last year, is that the Republicans don't like the tax increases that are necessary to pay for Obamacare. But the Republicans don't talk about these taxes (or the deficit) anymore when they air their objections to Obamacare. Another theory is that the Republicans are just "crazy." Although it does seem odd to be so rabidly opposed to something that will likely help so many Americans, writing a whole political party off as "crazy" seems like a throwaway. So why do the Republicans hate Obamacare? Eduardo Porter floats an interesting theory in the New York Times. The Republicans hate Obamacare, Porter suggests, because they're terrified that Americans are going to like it. Specifically, they're terrified that some of the tens of millions of Americans who will have greater access to health insurance under Obamacare will realize that the new law is actually not going to destroy the country — that, in fact, it is going to improve life for tens of millions of Americans, including, importantly, many who vote Republican. Many of the Americans who will benefit from Obamacare, Porter points out, are relatively poor red-state Republicans who are currently devout supporters of the Republican Party. For decades, the Republican pitch to these voters has been that "less government is better." If Obamacare works the way it is supposed to, however, it's possible that "more government" might actually seem to be better — and that many die-hard Republican voters might realize that. After all, even now, before Obamacare has really gotten going, Americans actually very much like the specific benefits of Obamacare — as long as you don't call it "Obamacare." As Michael Hiltzik reported in the LA Times yesterday, when Americans are asked whether they like "Obamacare," a majority say no. But when Americans are asked whether they support what Obamacare actually does, they love it: Here are figures from Kaiser's March 2013 poll: Tax credits for small businesses to buy insurance: 88% in favor. Closing the Medicare drug benefit doughnut hole: 81% in favor. Extension of dependent coverage to offspring up to age 26: 76% in favor. Expanding Medicaid: 71% in favor. Ban on exclusions for preexisting conditions: 66% in favor. Employer mandate: 57% in favor. What Americans don't like is the "individual mandate," which forces them to buy health insurance. This is understandable — no one likes to be forced to do anything. And it's true that this provision is probably what gives the Republicans their most persuasive firepower in attacking the law. But the big reason the "individual mandate" is in there is that all the other benefits would be entirely unaffordable without it. If more Americans end up liking Obamacare, including some Americans who have bought into the "less government is better" pitch, this would be bad news for the already increasingly marginalized Republican Party. So that's certainly one interesting theory about why the Republicans hate Obamacare so much — because they're worried that their constituents are actually going to like it. But throwing away old positions and embracing new ones is a big part of politics. So maybe the Republicans should stop fighting "Obamacare" and just call it "Cruz-care."

A few days ago, Lois Lerner, head of the tax-exempt division of the Internal Revenue Service, retired. But her story will go on because, as Politico’s Lauren French wrote, the thirty-year civil service veteran “is the political piñata that Congress still loves to whack months after she awkwardly acknowledged that the IRS wrongly scrutinized conservative groups for years.” Three congressional investigations are ongoing and yes, mistakes were made, as the late Republican president and conservative icon Ronald Reagan once said. But in reality, this is a story about how bureaucratic bungling was turned into scandal by right wing politicians desperate to spin gold from straw. They have sought to create a splash, to score points with their allies, make converts, seize the publicity spotlight and pull in some quick campaign cash while they’re at it. But far worse, their staged controversy has distracted from a real Washington scandal, our inability to rein in the outrageous amounts of money used by the rich and powerful to secretly broker elections and buy our government. The target of opportunity landed in the right wing’s lap, gift-wrapped and tied with a bow. After all, who doesn’t love to hate the IRS? No one likes paying taxes and an audit is about as welcome as multiple root canal. So when a chance came to go after the dreaded IRS for meddling in politics, the right jumped at it. If true, it would not have been the first time the IRS had been used for political skullduggery. When Richard Nixon was in the White House and wanted to go after his enemies – such as the Chandler family, owners of the Los Angeles Times – he picked up the phone and called Attorney General John Mitchell. “We’re going after the Chandlers,” Nixon announced. “Every one. Individually, collectively. Their income taxes... Every one of those sons of #$%$, is that clear ?” During Nixon’s reelection campaign in 1972, he had an enemies list of some 200 names that John Dean, the White House counsel, took to IRS Commissioner Johnnie Mac Walters, hinting that Walters should look for wrongdoing and even pack some of them off to jail. Wisely, Mac Walters locked the list in his safe and kept it there. Fast-forward forty years and once again the IRS is a political football. But what’s the real story? If you’re just tuning in, some basics: Among its other duties, as outlined in a tax code first passed a century ago, the IRS keeps an eye on non-profit organizations that are exempt from paying taxes. They’re called 501c’s and the groups we’re specifically concerned with are called 501c4’s. They’re defined as social welfare organizations, meant to be civic groups looking out for the common good. But – and this is key – donors to a 501c4 don’t have to reveal who they are. So along comes the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010, which in the name of free speech unleashes unlimited campaign contributions. But suppose you’re a corporation or a tycoon and want to keep all the cash you’re pouring into the election of your favorite candidates under wraps? IRS rules say that 501c4’s – those social welfare groups – can spend money on politics and campaigns, as long as it’s not their primary activity. Where that line gets drawn, however, is somewhat of a mystery – even to the IRS. So far, the general rule of thumb has been that political activities must constitute 49% or less of 501c4 activities. In the wake of Citizens United, and with the realization that 501c4’s could be used like bagmen for anonymous political bucks, applications for social welfare status at the IRS almost doubled in the years 2010 to 2012 – from 1,735 to 3,357. By the time November 2012 rolled around, those so-called social welfare organizations had poured more than $300 million into the election. According to the investigative journalism group Pro Publica, 84% of that money came from conservative groups like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS and the Koch Brothers’ Americans for Prosperity. All the applications for 501c4 tax-exempt status were sent to the Internal Revenue Service office in Cincinnati. The task was overwhelming, not only because of the sheer numbers but because the IRS regulations were so vague and contradictory. Trying to cut corners and red tape, the Cincinnati office decided to determine which groups were legit and which were covers for political mischief by implementing a keyword search – targeting words like “patriot” and “tea party.” All hell broke loose. For a week this past May, it was as if the IRS and the Obama White House had committed murder most foul, or at least the most heinous crime since the heyday of Watergate and Nixon’s dirty tricks. The Beltway media went into a feeding frenzy, the embers of suspicion and paranoia fanned by a powerful congressman who never met a photo opportunity he didn’t like: Darrell Issa, Republican of California, the richest member of Congress and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He has used that position as a political cudgel to hammer away at anything that might hurt the opposition (and consequently help his party), or, most important, elevate the visibility of Darrell Issa. “We don’t know how high it went,” he claimed to CNN. “What we know, and this is the disturbing part… it was discovered and stopped and it continued.” Similar charges were made by Issa as he rode the circuit of Washington talk shows. Not coincidentally, USA Today reported that during this time, Congressman Issa had the best fundraising quarter of his entire political career. A total of nearly $740,000 poured into his campaign chest from April 1 to June 30 , more than two and a half times what he pulled in during the first three months of the year. Issa launched an investigation into the IRS, promising the press, pundits and the rabid right that there would be blood. Yet slowly but surely, the scandal narrative began to unravel. Corruption and conspiracy started giving way to fumble-fingered reality: that the whole thing was a colossal, bureaucratic screw-up on the part of IRS employees and that in fact, their word search for BOLO’s – cop talk for “be on the lookout for” – included liberal groups as well as conservative. This was underscored by the revelation of IRS training materials that surfaced a month into Issa’s congressional investigation. In addition to conservative groups, the IRS workers had been told to be on the lookout for ACORN successors – a reference to the left-wing community-organizing group that folded under congressional pressure three years ago. Another key word was “emerge.” As The New York Times reported, Emerge Nevada, Emerge Maine, and Emerge Massachusetts were groups set up to back Democratic women candidates. All applied to the IRS for 501c4 status and all were denied because their primary work is political. Meanwhile, news of the IRS scandal that wasn’t so much of a scandal fell from the headlines into the back pages. Coverage of the IRS story by The New York Times, The Washington Post and Politico took a nosedive as the less exciting truth was revealed. The media big wheels of the right had to shift gears, too, while still insisting there was a monster hiding in the closet. Tim Graham of the conservative Media Research Center mourned the dying down of media coverage. The IRS scandal was real, he said – the press was covering it up. Back in late July, Graham told Pat Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network, “…We have a news media that’s just as corrupt as the administration, because their definition of how to cover things is, what does the president want us to do today?” When the story first broke, conservatives claimed that scrutiny of right wing non-profits by the IRS would have a chilling effect. But if anything, the purported scandal has given the Tea Party and others a new lease on life, handing them something fresh to be mad about and reenergizing their cause – witness the current crusade to defund Obamacare. The purported IRS scandal remains at the top of the right wing’s litany. In preparation for the 2014 midterm elections -- and the fundraising that goes with them – the IRS is being cast as a boogeyman. Reforms are being put in place at Internal Revenue. According to the Treasury Department, the IRS is working on new guidelines for 501c4s, including clearer information on how to measure political activity. And while it may have fallen from the front pages, stories continue to appear. USA Today has been particularly diligent obtaining internal IRS documents, including a 2011 list that flags political groups “based on the content of their literature, raising concerns specifically about ‘anti-Obama rhetoric,’ inflammatory language and ‘emotional’ statements made by non-profits seeking tax-exempt status.” Of the 162 groups cited, more than 80% were characterized as conservative. But in fact, this is roughly proportionate to the amount conservative 501c4s contributed in the 2012 elections. Far more troubling is that the current brawl over the IRS may make the agency too gun shy to properly police tax-exempt groups. (A few days ago, it was announced that the IRS has agreed to grant tax-exempt status to “True the Vote,” the organization that has gone after groups attempting to register minority votes -- although as a 501c3, rather than a c4). And much worse, the contretemps will prevent real reform; that in the rush to placate the right, the desperate need for overhaul of our campaign finance system -- the fight against “dark money” and the anonymous, deep-pocketed power and control that come with it -- will be backburnered once again.

TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: "We rate Tesla (TSLA) a SELL. This is driven by some concerns, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover.

That’s not inside the beltway, that’s in Arkansas. Thirteen Head Start programs are closing in Connecticut. That’s not inside the beltway.” Reality doesn’t support Kristol’s faith that charities can cancel out the impact of the shutdown on federal funding for pregnant women and infants at risk of undernourishment. The shutdown means no additional funds are available for federal programs that supply food to those charities, and those programs had already begun cutting back their supply efforts for food pantries prior to the shutdown. Meanwhile, food pantries said over the summer that they were already stretched beyond their capacity due to prolonged high unemployment and can’t pick up the slack. Hunger has hit alarming highs across the country since the Great Recession. Arkansas scrounged up leftover federal funds that will buy two weeks’ worth of school meals for tens of thousands of those kids, but when that money runs out no more will come from Washington unless the government reopens. There is no guarantee other states will share Arkansas’s good fortune, either. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) will not issue new payments to states, meaning that any state that has already spent all its federal food assistance money will be without recourse. Utah’s WIC program shut down suddenly on Tuesday, leaving 65,000 residents without nutrition assistance. WIC administrators in Chicago and Wisconsin told Forbes they do not know how much of a funding cushion they have and fear a surprise cutoff to services. In Tennessee, contingency funding may or may not last into next week.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_9115</Username><Timestamp>1380753413900</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 18:36:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380753759941-168</Id><Topic><Title>Reading Hoozdik's Posts are Like Reading the Onion</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1380753107116</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 18:31:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You said that when I predicted Obama would get over 300 electoral votes in both 2008 and 2012.

I have a preexisting condition (Type 1 Diabetes) and my income base was 45K-55K annually I chose tier 2 “Silver Plan” and my monthly premiums came out to $597.00 with $13,988 yearly deductible!!! There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I “opt-out” and chose to continue along with no insurance. I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me that my fine would be $4,037 and could be attached to my yearly income tax return. Then you make it to the “REPERCUSSIONS PORTION” for “non-payment” of yearly fine. First, your drivers license will be suspended until paid, and if you go 24 consecutive months with “Non-Payment” and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home. You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy “Automatically withdraw” your “penalties” weekly, bi-weekly or monthly!

But according to its website, the memorial “was funded almost entirely by private contributions, as specified in Public Law 103-32. The campaign received more than $197 million in cash and pledges. Support came from hundreds of thousands of individual Americans, hundreds of corporations and foundations, veterans groups, dozens of civic, fraternal and professional organizations, states and one territory, and students in 1,200 schools across the country.” The veterans who visited Tuesday were part of the nonprofit Honor Flight Network. They had chartered an $80,000 airplane, and their plans were too far advanced to postpone, said Wayne Lennep, spokesman for the Mississippi Gulf Coast honor flights, The Washington Post reported. U.S. Park Police allowed the bus to stop. “I’m not going to enforce the no stopping or standing sign for a group of 90 World War II veterans,” an officer said. “I’m a veteran myself.” According to the memorial’s website, the project, costing around $182 million, was paid for by donated and pledged funds. “These costs include site selection and design, construction and sculpture, a National Park Service maintenance fee required by the Commemorative Works Act, groundbreaking and dedication ceremonies, fund raising, and the 11-year administrative costs of the project from its inception in 1993 through completion in 2004,” the website reads. “Remaining funds are held on deposit with the U.S. Treasury in a National WWII Memorial Trust Fund. The funds will be used by the American Battle Monuments Commission solely to benefit the World War II Memorial.”</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1380757522189</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 19:45:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380757566813-201</Id><Topic><Title>Reading Hoozdik's Posts are Like Reading the Onion</Title><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1380753107116</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 18:31:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With humanoids like sdmiller, checkn, fascist, spartaloon, bumper, and gregjanetommax anti-campaigning, Hillary is as close to automatic as can be.

In truth, I don't see how the govt. could shutter an open-air concrete plaza, but there you go. When you shut down the federal govt., the federal govt. is going to try to make it look as dastardly as possible -- Saint Ronnie Raygun would have done the same. What you are NOT spilling ink on is bottlenecks in VA care for those same guys, the dead silence of Congress on immigration reform, the total abrogation of foreign policy (Syria WMDs) to the U.N. and PUTIN (guffaw here), the suspension of potentially life-saving medical research, space probes phoning home and getting a busy signal, etc. etc. etc. etc. But it sure was dastardly to try to keep those guys out of the memorial -- which they couldn't do and didn't do.

For the 787-9 this could delay flight testing and certification. It's interesting that the FAA is still involved with 787 production in Charleston. This could be be due there not being enough DERs there, a distinct possibility since they have banned SPEEA members from being on site and the reluctance of senior engineers to relocate and lose union protection. It takes a lot of experience and competence to be appointed a DER. Another possibility is concern over the quality control there necessitating on site monitoring. The FAA people I have worked with have been good engineers many of them recruited from Boeing and my guess is that they are getting increasingly disgusted with the situation. It would not be good if they decided to move on.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1380767875409</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 22:37:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380768596143-229</Id><Topic><Title>The 5th Boeing built Wideband SATCOM operational adding to US Defense needs for secure communications</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1380767271040</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 22:27:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rs2, You are correct. Let them, the haters, instead focus their negativity on me - on cue, I am sure that they will. They should not dis WGS. Wideband Gapfiller is a great program. I had very good people working for me and many friends that supported the program. It is vital to our national security and is a testament to the hard work of the folks in El Segundo, providing much deserved pride to the Boeing company.
