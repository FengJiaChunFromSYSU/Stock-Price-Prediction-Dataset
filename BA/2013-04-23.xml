Its Official</Title><Msg>Bill Anderson April 22, 2013 It did not take long for the editors of the War Street Journal to serve as the media mouthpieces for John McCain and Lindsey Graham: A row has broken out over whether the Obama Administration is violating the legal due process of Boston terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev by not reading him his Miranda rights before questioning. The more relevant question for the safety of the U.S. homeland is why the Administration has declined to designate him as a terrorist enemy combatant. Lest one thinks that the WSJ is claiming this is an exceptional situation, think again: The Boston bombing also ought to chasten Senators Rand Paul, Mike Lee and other libertarians who keep insisting that the U.S. homeland is not part of the terror battlefield. “It’s different overseas than it will be here. It’s different in the battlefield than it will be here,” Mr. Paul told Fox News earlier this year. “Which gets precisely to the argument I have with some other Republicans who say, well, ‘the battlefield is everywhere, there is no limitation.’ President Obama says this. Some members of my party say the battle has no geographic limitations and the laws of war apply. It’s important to know that the law of war that they’re talking about means no due process.” Boylston Street sure looked like a battlefield on Monday, and so did Watertown on Thursday night. The artificial distinction is Mr. Paul’s focus on geography. The vital distinction for public safety is between common criminals, who deserve due process protections, and enemy combatants at war with the U.S., wherever they are. We need to understand what these people are saying. Federal law must assume that every inch of continental U.S. soil is a battlefield in which the rules of battle apply and that</Msg><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1366690866775</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 00:21:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366692487247-3</Id><Topic><Title>FBI in contact with Bomber after bombing and before fatal shooting....</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1366673866450</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 19:37:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sparty would rather believe a scurrilous report of what a MOTHER in the former Soviet Union said about her "little darlings" than believe ANYONE in a responsible position in the USA.

To continue, over half were alcohol related and over half were not wearing seat belts. In short, there is a lot a person can do to avoid being killed in a car. Why does one have to care only about gun violence or vehicular violence, not both? The auto industry and regulators work diligently every year to reduce auto deaths. People caught driving under the influence of alcohol lose their driving privileges. Some people can never get driving privileges due to pre existing conditions. There is no reason why thousands of people can never own a firearm due to pre existing conditions.

My opinion is until the BOD and the CEO of Boeing are replaced the stock holders of the USA will not trust Boeing leadership. Why , because they have no ethics and make false statements ,miss delivery dates, spend more than they promise to develop planes and then make up excuses. Domerrrrr45, the most recent example is the 787, it is 4 years late , after CEO said 4 years ago the plane would be flying and ready to go in a couple of months at the launch. , the cost was supposed to be at firt 5 billion well it is 33.6 billion and counting, the 787 plane, does not work, 24-7-365 like the local designed 777, so far and the 787 only plane made in the USA to be grounded in over 20 years. The last grounded plane was made by the same business plan company style of management , outsourcing , who are in charge of Boeing now, so since you think I am a conspiracy instead of a stock market investor , as most people understand you will never change but , you can be used by me as an example of a person who is trading wiith his emotion, not his trained or commons sense ability to read a stock chart . hnag in there Domerrrrr45 in a decade or so you may learn somthing about how the stock market works</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1366737205924</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:13:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366738207762-31</Id><Topic><Title>Jesus Loves the #$%$. but he hates Hom*ism</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1366666256570</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 17:30:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes........Maybe not born but certainly in existence.

Max Baucus will not seek reelection in 2014, becoming the latest senior red-state Democrat to bail out of a potentially difficult reelection campaign, a senior Democratic official confirmed to POLITICO. Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, had nearly $5 million in the bank at the end of the first quarter but was expected to face a tough fight in his GOP-leaning home state. The good news is that Baucus joins a growing list of red and purple-state Democrats who aren't interested in facing voters next year, increasing Republicans' chances of making significant gains in the upper chamber. The GOP needs to net six seats to seize the Senate -- still a very tall task, but one that's made easier by this roster: Baucus joins colleagues Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, Carl Levin of Michigan and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey in exiting the 2014 race. His Montana seat is likely to be one of the toughest on that list for Democrats to defend.</Msg><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1366738487359</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:34:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366739255391-33</Id><Topic><Title>No Gun Licenses for Marathon Bombers</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1366637683696</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 09:34:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm sure I did contribute.

You're obvious a victim of socialized government education (low information voter.) "why do the Tbaggers hate the American people so much-Always trying to deny Americans health insurance, health care." TEA Party people don't hate American people - quite the contrary, they are some of the most patriotic people in the country. They have never been against people buying all the health care they can afford. They just don't believe you have a RIGHT to force other people to pay for your healthcare (wouldn't that be a form of slavery?) TEA Party are definitely not in favor of slavery like the Democrats are. "pensions" Never heard a TEA PARTY person say he was against pensions - do you have some evidence of this or are you a typical Democrat that has to lie and make up stuff to try and make a non-existent point? "living wages" TEA Party people believe in freedom and that wages should be what every is freely agreed to by the worker and the employer is a fair deal to both parties. If minimum wage laws help lift people out of poverty why are Democrats so stingy......why not raise ti to $50 an hour? Labor is a commodity.....do you want the government controlling the price of all commodities?......taht would make you a fascist at best and a communist at worst. "Stoopid" You calling someone stoopid [sic] is hilarious. "deny vote" #$%$ are you talking about? Illegal aliens, felons, dead people, dogs, people who vote multiple times? or are you talking about the New Black panther - those are Democrat supporters. Why do Democrats go to such great lengths to lie and make stuff up? Are they just incredibly ignorant or incredibly evil, dishonest and deceitful people?</Msg><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1366746035605</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 15:40:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366746525790-52</Id><Topic><Title>does Domerrrrr45 opinion and his statement that Boeing is a cash machine mean much? bark and ouch no</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1366678344344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 20:52:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BA up 142 percent in last 4 years (since 4/20/2009).

It is but a parody of the legitimate movements for which American democracy has historically been held in such high regard. It is, in fact, the latest installment in quite another American tradition: the exploitation of frustrated, desperate, and susceptible people by monied interests and profiteers. The impetus for the Civil Rights movement was centuries of racially based oppression at all levels of American government and society. The logic behind its call for equality was overwhelming. Now consider the Tea Party movement, whose foremost demand of a president who in his first month passed one of the biggest tax cuts ever...is for tax cuts. The movement's incoherence is only illuminated further when this demand is uttered in the same sentence as its call for deficit reduction. Though the movement claims to have no defined leadership, there are public figures and entities who nevertheless carry that mantle, which has led to perhaps its greatest irony: a portion of the American populace who carries a populist banner against the coddling of greedy bankers is led by some of the country's most cynical and base profiteers. When the movement was christened last April for a large tax day protest, it was derived wholesale from the efforts of a registered corporate lobbyist and a right-leaning cable news network, whose president recently pointed out that it's all about ratings. At the Tea Party's national convention last weekend, its keynote speaker was a former governor who quit midterm in order to peddle a book that she didn't write, but for which she collects most of the royalties. If this were Iran's Green Movement, these would be the people slinging marked-up green headbands on the street corner. Of course, the Tea Party is not without its whistleblowers. The $500 per plate entry fee to last week's convention almost led to it being canceled altogether. But the exodus of reasonable elements will only homogenize the movement further towards a particularly polarizing worldview that opens itself to continued profit-driven exploitation.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1366749932123</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 16:45:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366750106643-58</Id><Topic><Title>Whe do Liberals hate the TEA Party so much?</Title><Username>mediocreclassguy</Username><Timestamp>1366743222076</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 14:53:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey another tax cheat and slacker! you are one of the takers and welfare bums that your leader Romney was squawking about aren't you.

Democrats believe it's OK to exterminate the unborn, redistribute the hard earned wages of hard working Americans, think unlimited spending and borrowing is an strategic economic plan and that spending the future earnings of children yet unborn and leaving them the bill is moral. But one of the most amazing things is these bafoons is they think that government bureaucrats can spend money better and more wisely than the people that earn it.

Any of the mechanics on the floor could have told them to use smaller cells and more spacing. As it was, the auto Mfg's told them. Boeing didn't figure out anything.

Boeing concluded in tests before the plane was certified to fly that an internal short circuit in the battery system couldn’t trigger a fire, according to NTSB preliminary reports. The company shot a nail into a battery cell to simulate a short and it didn’t burn. “Cell performance during qualification testing will substantiate the unique design that removes the possibility for internal short failures,” Boeing wrote the FAA in a 2006 memo on how it intended to show the battery was safe. The document was released by the NTSB at the start of today’s hearing. Boeing has since concluded that the nail test isn’t a good way to simulate an internal short, Sinnett said. +++ swell DUH cubed !! Puncture it with a nail- short circut- electrolye vents - and end of issue. But in real life - a short circuit or similar would most likely last longer- things heat up until burst disc vents etc And then to test the system using a simple resistor for a load ?

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. The Supreme Court bit off a piece of the immigration puzzle today. In a 7-2 decision, the court ruled that a longtime legal resident of the U.S. was improperly deported for possession of a small amount of marijuana. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Adrian Moncrieffe immigrated to the United States with his parents from Jamaica in 1984. He was 3 years old then. He and his family were all legal residents. He grew up, became a home health care worker, married and had a family. In 2007, during a routine traffic stop, police found a small amount of marijuana in the car, about enough to make two or three cigarettes. Moncrieffe, who had no prior record, was charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. That's a generic felony under Georgia law and allows for a wide range of sentences. His lawyer did not advise him that if he pled guilty, he could be deported, a requirement that the U.S. Supreme Court has since imposed. Ignorant of the immigration consequences, Moncrieffe accepted a plea deal under which he would avoid prison and have his conviction expunged after five years' probation. The federal government, however, first put him in immigration detention and then deported him to Jamaica, contending that under federal law, there was no discretion on the matter since Moncrieffe had been convicted of an aggravated felony. Today, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Moncrieffe's Georgia conviction was not, in fact, an aggravated felony under federal law. Writing for the seven-member majority, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that where the amount is small and there is no sale, the crime does not qualify as an aggravated felony. Rather, it's a low-level offense that's not a felony at all under federal law. The government's attempt to characterize such an offense as an aggravated felony, she said, defies the commonsense conception of these terms. Moncrieffe, the father of five American children, was close to tears upon learning of the court decision today. ADRIAN MONCRIEFFE: It's just a good day for my family, for me and my family. TOTENBERG: The decision means he can now ask the immigration service to allow him to return to the U.S. and to his wife and children. Most experts say he has an excellent chance of succeeding, given the fact that he has no real ties to Jamaica, that his family is here, and that his conviction by now has actually been expunged from the record under Georgia law.
