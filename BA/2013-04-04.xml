Oncologists say the reduced funding, which took effect for Medicare on April 1, makes it impossible to administer expensive chemotherapy drugs while staying afloat financially. Patients at these clinics would need to seek treatment elsewhere, such as at hospitals that might not have the capacity to accommodate them. “If we treated the patients receiving the most expensive drugs, we’d be out of business in six months to a year,” said Jeff Vacirca, chief executive of North Shore Hematology Oncology Associates in New York. “The drugs we’re going to lose money on we’re not going to administer right now.” After an emergency meeting Tuesday, Vacirca’s clinics decided that they would no longer see one-third of their 16,000 Medicare patients. “A lot of us are in disbelief that this is happening,” he said. “It’s a choice between seeing these patients and staying in business.”</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1365080936727</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 09:08:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365081296841-6</Id><Title>Obama care Unraveling - Democrat's Lies Become Transparent</Title><Msg>Parts of ObamaCare are starting to fray, even before full implementation. The Obama administration now says a special system of exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses to provide insurance will be delayed an entire year -- to 2015. "Lots of small businesses struggle with providing insurance for their workers so this was supposed to facilitate it and make it easier for small business to do this," said Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. "It was a huge portion of the sale job. When they passed the law in 2010 there were many senators and members of Congress who were saying 'I am doing this because it's going to help small businesses.'" The exchanges were designed to give workers a range of choices supported by dollars from their employers. But now they will have only one choice until 2015, which could mean they can't shop for insurance that includes their current providers. Capretta said the administration is "way" behind schedule. Since insurance is more expensive for small businesses, many of which have no obligation under the law to provide coverage, analysts now fear many might just stop trying and let workers go on the soon-to-be-launched state exchanges. Sara Teppema of the Society of Actuaries -- which did an exhaustive study of ObamaCare -- said that "even if it's just a small change of people who are leaving the employment-based insurance and coming into the individual insurance market, their costs and their numbers will overwhelm those who are currently uninsured." That means costs would increase. Meanwhile, 79 senators including several liberal lawmakers recently voted to repeal a new tax on medical devices contained in the health care law following a similar vote in the House. "The House and the Senate agreeing? This is a harmonic convergence, it doesn't happen," said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 385,000, the highest level since November, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the third straight week of gains in claims. Coming on the heels of data on Wednesday showing private employers added the fewest jobs in five months in March, the report implied some weakening in job growth after hiring accelerated in February. Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications last week to fall to 350,000.

Obama was attending four fundraisers for Democrats in the San Francisco area Wednesday and Thursday, urging donors to help wrest the House away from Republicans and to reinstate House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi as House speaker. Environmental activists protested the pipeline, knows as the Keystone XL project, outside one of the events, and his host at another one is a vocal opponent of the project. The pipeline would transport oil from Canada's tar sands to Texas Gulf Coast refineries. "No pipeline for the 1 percent," demonstrators chanted about a block and a half from the Pacific Heights home of composer and philanthropist Gordon Getty, who was hosting a dinner fundraising event. At a cocktail reception earlier, Obama did not address the pipeline, but discussed the environment broadly. The reception, for 100 donors who contributed between $5,000 and $32,400 each, was held at the home of Tom Steyer, owner of a capital management firm and who with his wife, Kat Taylor, finance environmental causes. Steyer opposes the pipeline. The president said he needed Pelosi as a "fully empowered partner" to tackle issues such as climate change and to boost the economy.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1365084257497</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 10:04:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365084788902-19</Id><Title>Battery upgrade teams sent to Japan.</Title><Msg>Boeing Co.

It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president.. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America.

It's Not Who You Might Think April 03, 201312:13 PM Copyright ©2013 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Well, now, to another issue occupying the president and the Congress, immigration, specifically the push for more H-1B visas. These are visas for workers from overseas with specialized skills - researchers, for instance, or software engineers. American tech companies are lobbying hard for an increase in H-1B visas. Here's Microsoft's point man on the issue, Brad Smith. BRAD SMITH: We need to continue to attract some of the best and brightest people in the world to come and join us in world-leading R&amp;D efforts. SIEGEL: Well, that best and brightest argument doesn't always match with the reality of how H-1B visas are used. That's what NPR's Martin Kaste found when he looked at the companies using the most H-1Bs. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: If you scroll through the government's visa data, you notice something surprising. The biggest employer of these foreign tech workers is not Microsoft. Not by a long shot. Nor is it Google or Facebook or any other name brand tech company. The biggest user of H-1Bs are consulting companies or, as Ron Hira calls them, offshore outsourcing firms. RON HIRA: The top 10 recipients in the last fiscal year are all offshore outsourcers, and they got 40,000 of the 85,000 visas, which is astonishing. KASTE: Hira is a professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology. He's also the son of Indian immigrants, so he has a personal interest in questions of labor flow across borders. For the past decade, he's been studying how consulting firms use temporary work visas to help American companies cut costs. He says they use the visas both to supply cheaper workers here, but also to smooth the transfer of American jobs to IT centers overseas. HIRA: What these firms have done is exploit the loopholes in the H-1B program to bring in onsite workers to learn the jobs of the Americans, to then ship it back offshore and also to bring in onsite workers who are cheaper on the H-1B and undercut American workers right here. KASTE: The biggest user of H-1Bs last year was Cognizant, a firm based in New Jersey. They got 9,000 new visas. Following close behind are Infosys, Wipro and Tata, all Indian firms. They're not household names, but they loom large in techie places like the Seattle suburbs. Rennie Sawade is a software designer with 30 years experience. He grew up in Michigan watching the decline of the auto industry, so he went into computers in search of a more secure career. But that's not how it turned out. RENNIE SAWADE: Basically, what I see is it's happening all over again. KASTE: Programmers like him tend to be freelancers, contract workers and the big consulting firms are the competition. Sawade recalls the time he almost landed a plumb job at Microsoft. SAWADE: I remember having phone interviews and talking with a manager, having them sound really excited about my experience and that he was going to bring me into meet the team. KASTE: And then, nothing. He called his own placement agency to find out what had happened. SAWADE: And that's when they told me, oh, they hired somebody from Tata Consultancy. And then she told me on the phone, the woman I was talking to, said, her jaw just dropped when they found out how little Microsoft was paying this person from Tata Consultancy to do this job. KASTE: Sawade is active in a labor organization called WashTech, so he gets the complaints from IT workers around the country. The H-1B consulting firms are especially active in banking, insurance, and pretty much any industry that runs on big computer systems maintained by aging, increasingly expensive American tech workers. He laughs at the notion that a cost-cutting insurance company somewhere is in dire need of hotshot foreign programmers with specialized skills. SAWADE: They require that the current employees are in that department to train the people they bring over from India. And maybe not - the people in India are not necessarily there to replace them, at least not right away. They're just learning the job. KASTE: Learning the job, he says, so the consulting firm can eventually provide the same service from somewhere cheaper. NPR tried repeatedly to get interviews with the biggest H-1B users, but none would agree to talk. We did reach Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, which counts Cognizant among its members. DEAN GARFIELD: Some of the companies are companies, yes, that are providing services that bring greater efficiencies to businesses. But what's wrong with that? KASTE: Garfield rejects the notion that Cognizant is using foreign tech workers to undercut Americans. He points out that H-1B workers are supposed to be paid prevailing wages. In practice, though, that rule is rarely enforced. In a 2011 report, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said worker protections are, quote, "weakened by several factors" and that oversight is, quote, "cursory." Garfield acknowledges the system is not perfect. GARFIELD: The main, legitimate criticism right now - which is one we would level as well - is that the accountability mechanisms are not fully integrated and not seamless. It's more a check the box. KASTE: But he also takes exception to criticism that lumps the consulting firms together, something he calls offensive. GARFIELD: There is a lot of anti-India sentiment in many of the criticisms and articles around this that I think are completely unfounded and unnecessary. KASTE: But it's not offensive to Neeraj Gupta. NEERAJ GUPTA: I'm a U.S. citizen. I came to the country on a student visa for my master's in electrical engineering. KASTE: Gupta spent part of his career working for an Indian consulting firm Patni. And he says, it was obvious they were using H-1B workers to replace Americans. GUPTA: Oh, almost every one of our projects was like that. KASTE: On some of those projects, he says, even the clients had misgivings. GUPTA: I had people come to me and tell me that the number one issue that they faced - and even as they were offering this work - was the fact that they had longstanding employees and the implications of them losing their jobs. KASTE: He now runs what he calls a domestic outsourcing company. It's also a consulting firm, but his workers are American. So he does have an incentive to criticize the H-1B system. At the same time, he doesn't want to eliminate it. He believes American tech companies are in dire need of highly skilled foreign workers. The problem, he says, is that so many of the visas are gobbled up for middle-of-the-road tech jobs already being done by Americans.

In 1794, when Congress appropriated $15,000 for relief of French refugees who fled from insurrection in San Domingo to Baltimore and Philadelphia, James Madison stood on the floor of the House to object saying, "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents." -- James Madison, 4 Annals of congress 179 (1794) Thomas Jefferson backed up Madison by declaring, "Congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically enumerated." • " The government of the United States is a definite government, confined to specified objects. It is not like state governments, whose powers are more general. Charity is no part of the legislative duty of the government." -- James Madison, speech in the House of Representatives, January 10, 1794 • In a famous incident in 1854, President Franklin Pierce was pilloried for vetoing an extremely popular bill intended to help mentally ill. The act was championed by the renowned 19th century social reformer Dorothea Dix. In the face of heavy criticism, Pierce countered: "I cannot find any authority in the Constitution for the public charity." To approve such spending, argued Pierce, "would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the Constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the Union of these States is founded."</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1365099435250</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 14:17:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365099794396-75</Id><Title>SELL BA</Title><Msg>will be in the red today, form tripple tops in today chart. the stock is exhausted.</Msg><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1365099794396</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 14:23:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365099928211-76</Id><Topic><Title>SAD BUT TRUE</Title><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1365098341761</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 13:59:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too bad BA</Msg><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1365099928211</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 14:25:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365099987358-77</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Boeing, if problem solved why FAA limiting range?</Title><Username>america_wants_change</Username><Timestamp>1364680265683</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 17:51:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No decision from FAA or NTSB yet. 787 may never fly again.</Msg><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1365099987358</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 14:26:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365100017111-78</Id><Topic><Title>787 bad news</Title><Username>nicehereinca</Username><Timestamp>1364360407092</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 01:00:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good news for Airbus</Msg><Username>inwestminsterca</Username><Timestamp>1365100017111</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 14:26:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365100020103-79</Id><Title>Projected Shortage of 45,000 Doctors by 2020...</Title><Msg>Let’s do the math: We have nearly 30 million uninsured people about to get medical coverage under the health care law come January. And we have a projected shortage of 45,000 primary care physicians by 2020. Add to that the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP), with 43,000 members who say they can offer basic care if state laws would just let them set up an independent practice without doctor supervision. And the answer is … The nurse-practitioners, of course, say it’s a matter of simple addition: New laws are needed to give them more autonomy. But doctors say it’s a miscalculation to think that patient safety won’t be compromised by not having a doctor overseeing things. Family physicians have more than four times as much education and training, accumulating an average of 21,700 hours, whereas nurse-practitioners receive 5,350 hours, the American Academy of Family Physicians points out. Others question whether this is a situation of the health care industry looking for cheaper labor to provide services to patients.

No. The Jews have tried to make the Holocaust a new religion and the smallest doubt cast on their hoax, is scary to them, because they might lose out on future reparations, after all $10 billion per year is not enough.</Msg><Username>mining_phd</Username><Timestamp>1365132627451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 23:30:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365132721864-154</Id><Topic><Title>28 Percent Of Americans Believe In Global New World Order Conspiracy</Title><Username>barking_dogmas</Username><Timestamp>1365100928579</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 14:42:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One reason so many people do believe the holocaust did happen is so many of their relatives were victims of it, or were troops who liberated prisoners of it.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1365132721864</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 23:32:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365133811605-155</Id><Topic><Title>None Dare Call it Treason</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1365095629698</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 13:13:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Almost worse, dikweed, anyone with-out their head up their Liberal knew there were too many programmers, let alone the relatively unskilled "IT professionals" twenty years ago .
