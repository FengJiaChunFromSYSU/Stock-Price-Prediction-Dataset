A day of celebration for the 787 Dreamliner turned into a public-relations disaster Monday for All Nippon Airways (ANA) of Japan and for Boeing. The first of the jets to fly into Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in regular passenger service was grounded after arrival due to a maintenance issue, leaving ANA’s Tokyo-bound return flight passengers stranded. Better take a ocean liner to Japan it is a lot saver than the twin engine GE explojet engine and the carbon fiber shatter and poof it is gone plane.

Now Wendy, can you tell me what percentage of the outstanding shares of Boeing at about 70 dollars per share and over what period of time 7 billion dollars of Boeing shareholder money will buy back? Next tell me where that 7 billion dollars of shareholder money would be best spent. Wendyhorn, should the Chicago mangement team be using shareholder money to buy back share and give themselves a bonus on long term stock price, or use shareholder money for the development of the late 737Max which accounts for 99% of the profits of Boeing shareholder airplane profits , Wendy, Wendy, Wendy wow ee go girl are you rally taking that long walk off a short pier with Boeing shareholder money?

The teenager loved flying small planes as a Civil Air Patrol cadet and seemed happy as he played an online game with friends Wednesday night. But hours later, authorities say, Tyler was outside wearing a black ski mask and wielding a knife when he was shot by his father, who thought he was a prowler. No immediate charges were brought against Jeffrey Giuliano, a popular fifth-grade teacher, in the slaying of 15-year-old Tyler, who was gunned down in his aunt’s driveway next door to his own home in New Fairfield around 1 a.m. Thursday. “It’s something out of a Hollywood script,” said John Hodge, the first selectman, or top elected official, in the town of nearly 14,000 people about 50 miles from New York City. He said he couldn’t recall another killing in his eight years on the job. (PHOTOS: American Gun Culture) State police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance said the boy had never been in trouble with the law, and some of those who knew him described him as a good kid with an easygoing personality. Investigators and acquaintances said they were at a loss to explain what he was doing outside dressed all in black and carrying a weapon. “Certainly, that is the major question we are trying to answer at this point,” Vance said. State police said the shooting happened after Jeffrey Giuliano got a call from his sister next door saying that someone might be trying to break into her home in their neighborhood of attractive colonial-style houses. Giuliano grabbed a handgun and went outside to investigate, troopers said. He confronted someone in a ski mask and opened fire when the person came at him with something shiny in his hand, police said. When police officers arrived, Tyler was lying dead in the driveway with a knife in his hand, and his father, in a T-shirt and shorts, was sitting on the grass. Detectives informed the elder Giuliano several hours later that he had shot his son, Vance said. “All in all, it’s a tragedy,” Vance said. Police were investigating whether the father’s gun was registered. No one answered the door at Giuliano’s home or his sister’s.</Msg><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1349171170195</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 05:46:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349172711045-9</Id><Topic><Title>Defense Contractors</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1349127803597</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:43:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Perhaps so. One thing is sure; never has our country had so much to lose in a presidential election. You see, I took Obama seriously when he said that he was going to “fundamentally transform” our country. I took his chief advisor and the head of his transition team, Valerie Jarrett, seriously when she said Obama would be ready to “rule from day one.” Both of these statements were entirely and completely consistent with the Obama we met in Dinesh D’Souza’s book and movie “2016, Obama’s America.” Transform America? Into what? That’s pretty easy to figure out if you look into Obama’s past. Transform America into a nation weakened in its international relations with an economy based on government spending and wealth seizure and redistribution where desires for freedom are subjugated to the quest for security. Anyway ……. I’m sure you folks want me to be brutally honest with you as to how I feel this election is going. Some days are better than others. Just take this one poll on which candidate can do a better job with our economy. First; consider a few facts: Obama said he would cut our deficit in half in his first term. He didn’t. He exploded it. And don’t buy this “two wars that weren’t paid for” nonsense. The money for those two wars was pretty much appropriated before he became president. Obama pushed through an $850 BILLION so-called stimulus plan, and now he tells us that spending belongs to Bush? Doesn’t that strike you as a bit dishonest? Our economy is the worst it has ever been in the history of this country … except for the few years that our economy was in a recession. The WORST, folks! There are fewer people with jobs right now than there were when Obama was sworn in as president. If you allowed for all of the people who just gave up and stopped even looking for jobs – included them in the workforce instead of writing them off -- our unemployment rate right now would be over 16% Obama has increased our national debt by an amount that exceeds the total debt incurred by all U.S. presidents from George Washington through Bill Clinton .. and a bit into the administration of Bush 43 Just those facts … and there are many more … but consider just those facts and tell me how anyone could possibly say that they believe that Obama could do a better job with our economy than Romney? How do people work that out in their minds? Romney has a demonstrable record of success. Obama’s record is one of failure. And people really think that Obama could do a better job with the economy?

With each day that passes the more I believe that I no longer understand what America is all about. I do not recognize or understand this country anymore and the people of this country. I was raised to believe in freedom. Freedom is and always has been crucial to me and, I thought, the people of this nation. I see the love of freedom fading. Fading fast; and the love of security growing. I think the phrase that applies here is “The New Normal.” I’m sprouting my curmudgeon wings .. which means I go way back, back to where “normal” was loving freedom and believing in self-reliance. That certainly is not the normal now. For forty-two years I’ve been listening to presidential State of the Union speeches, and each year I hear the word freedom less and less. Instead, it has been replaced with one word that I think will one day prove to be the downfall of this nation: security. When people wake up each morning in pursuit of the American Dream, they are no longer dreaming of freedom. No, they are dreaming of security. Government-provided security is the new normal. Freedom is so 1960s. There’s another element of the new normal. Government dependence. A growing number of Americans spend far more time trying to figure out what wonderful new government benefits they can qualify for than they do trying to figure out how they can use their talents and work ethic to build their wealth on their own. Not that many people seem to have the desire to put forth the effort to become rich, and this is for two reasons. One … Our government has propped them up with handouts and entitlements, which validates their moocher lifestyle. Work hard? Why? Secondly; liberals in this country have done a damn good job of demonizing the rich … just about to the point where people no longer want to become rich because they view it as a negative. They believe that rich people had to steal that money in order to become rich, they don’t pay their taxes, they became rich by taking someone else’s living wage, they are bad and don’t pay their fair share, they don’t carry the load, they are swindlers … you know the routine. This is Obama’s class warfare campaign at work. The rich are not only evil, we’re told they’re actually unpatriotic because they don’t pay their fair share (a lie, by the way). People want to be considered patriotic. People don’t want to be considered evil. There are now so many negative connotations attached to wealth that the American people are actually being programmed against working to become wealthy. If rich being evil and unpatriotic is the new normal --- then why bother? After all, you’re not evil, are you? Now I ask you … which candidate do you think appeals to this new normal? Easy .. that would be Barack Obama. Which party speaks to the person who demonizes wealth and encourages government-provided healthcare and security? The Democrats. The Democrats are the party of government provided security, government-provided jobs, government-mandated job protection, government healthcare, government-funded retirement, government schools. Is it any wonder why government employees are one of the top five sources of cash for Barack Obama’s reelection campaign? These people want to keep their cushy government jobs and the security of knowing how difficult it is to be fired, and there is one party and one president who won’t challenge them on that: Barack Obama and the Democrats.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1349181074569</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 08:31:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349181342186-17</Id><Title>Obama's Taxpayer Funded Bribe</Title><Msg>The administration is telling defense contractors, who will be being forced to lay off workers because of the budget sequestration law, that they do not need to abide by the WARN Act and issue layoff notices 60 days in advance. Why? Because these warnings would be issued just days before election. Obama doesn’t want over 100,000 workers getting warnings that they may be laid off just before November 6th. Obama has a plan. It’s pretty simple, actually. Tell these defense contractors to simply ignore the law! Obama does it! Why shouldn’t these defense contractors? But the defense contractors … Lockheed Martin, for instance … were a bit reluctant to go along with Obama on this. The courts might look the other way when Obama ignores the law, but can they get the same break? Obama had a bit of a problem here … so he took it a step further last Friday. He told Lockheed Martin and other defense contractors that he will indemnify them if they get sued and a judgment is entered against them. He’ll just pay their legal losses. And where will he get the money? The taxpayers, of course. So … here’s what Obama is telling these defense contractors: “Hey guys, this WARN Act stuff? Look, I know what the law says; but you just gotta ignore the law this time, know what I’m saying? If you send out those layoff notices I’m going to take a hit just days before the vote. Now look … you’ve seen me ignore the law, right? I did it when I bailed out the United Auto Workers Union. I did it when I let my New Black Panther Party buddies walk on that voter intimidation thing. The law simply can’t be allowed to stand between me and my supporters. The risks are too great. So here’s the deal: You put off sending out those layoff notices. Then if you really DO have to lay those people off, and if they file lawsuits against you and win … well, I’ll cover your losses. How’s that? I’ll just get some taxpayer money and pay the tab. Hell … we’ll call it stimulus spending. That line always seems to work pretty well.”</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1349181342186</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 08:35:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349181996008-18</Id><Title>A Look at who got those Jobs Obama Created</Title><Msg>Immigrants won three out of every four jobs added since January 2009′s employment totals, even though immigrants are only one-sixth of the workforce in a nation of 310 million people.</Msg><Username>bapsychdept</Username><Timestamp>1349181996008</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 08:46:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349182224446-19</Id><Topic><Title>could Trump be right the gov wants Americans to think the unemployment is 8% but Americans know better</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1349148613090</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 23:30:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You lost me in the 1st four words of your subject...."could Trump be right..."

Additionally, during the current campaign the lies and obfuscations about Mitt Romney and the Republicans have been so fast and furious that it is nearly impossible to keep up with them. The administration's reaction to what went on in Libya is not a surprise, as reliance on prevarications and the attendant dishonesty is part and parcel of Obama's normal behavior. There rarely has been a speech or an off the cuff comment since he entered the national stage that does not contain some deliberate or insinuated falsehood. This tendency is exemplified in his recent interview with Univision wherein Obama lied about why he never introduced immigration reform and when the ill-fated Fast and Furious program was raised, he began blaming the Republicans and George Bush respectively. There is now a near universal mistrust of Obama among world leaders as well as many members of Congress who candidly admit they cannot deal with Barack Obama, as he has proven himself to be untrustworthy and unbelievable -- particularly as he refuses to accept any responsibility for the outcome of his actions and policies. The diminished status of the United States around the globe and the greatly eroded standard of living for the vast majority of Americans are testament to these character flaws. At times even the most diehard of his sycophants in the mainstream media are forced to report on this disturbing trait in their hero. This past spring the Washington Post ran a lengthy front page article on Obama's machinations during the debt ceiling debate. The highlight of the piece: Barack Obama deliberately lied to the American people concerning the intransigence of the Republicans in the House of Representatives. It was an amazing admission for a pillar of the sycophantic mainstream media to write a story claiming that their hero lied. A further example of the media's awakening to the deceit and fabrications of the Obama administration is the recent reporting on the Libyan scandal which is actively pursuing the lies and cover-up. However, there has been five years of outright lies and narcissism that have been largely ignored by the media, including some in the conservative press and political class who are loath to call Mr. Obama what he is in the bluntest of terms: a liar and a fraud. That he relies on his skin color to intimidate, either outright or by insinuation, those who oppose his agenda only adds to his audacity. It is apparent that he has gotten away with his character flaws his entire life, aided and abetted by the sycophants around him; thus he is who he is and cannot change.

Bush is responsible for all the problems we have now because the President of the United States is so powerful, but you also believe that Barack Obama isn't responsible for anything that's going wrong because Republicans in Congress won't let him do anything he wants.</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1349184599515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:29:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349184619100-23</Id><Topic><Title>In Defense of Freedom.</Title><Username>zosimomaximo</Username><Timestamp>1349183945614</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:19:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Generations before us defended it.

I am endorsing Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan for President and Vice President because I know having the courage to make decisions and tackle challenges is what leads to results and real change. America needs a comeback team – Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are that team.” “Leaders come in many forms, and John Elway has always exemplified leadership, first as a quarterback for the Super Bowl champion Broncos, and now as an executive vice president for the team,” Romney said in a statement. “He’s had to overcome challenges during his career, and he knows what it takes to turn things around when things get tough. I’m proud to have him on my team as we campaign to lead the comeback this nation desperately needs.” Elway, the longtime quarterback of the Denver Broncos, is executive vice president of football operations for the Denver Broncos. Elway was instrumental in letting quarterback Tim Tebow go in the last off-season and signing Peyton Manning. UPDATE: Elway will rally with Romney tonight in Colorado: This is the second football big to express vocal support for Romney today. Earlier, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson put country first: Woody Johnson was asked in a Bloomberg interview whether he’d prefer to see a winning season from the Jets or Mitt Romney, the man he supports, occupying the White House. “Well I think you always have to put country first,” Johnson said, “so I think it’s very, very important that not only for us but for particularly our kids and grandkids that this election comes off with Mitt Romney and [Paul] Ryan as president and vice-president.”</Msg><Username>econprofhked</Username><Timestamp>1349186197624</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:56:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349186694060-33</Id><Title>2012 DEBT SURPASSES 2011...</Title><Msg>Debt Jumped $1.2759T in FY 2012; Up $10,855 Per Household in Just 12 Months; Beats 2011 Libtards just can't bring themselves to think they will ever have to pay off that debt.

In his widely followed monthly Pimco investor newsletter, the CEO of the company that runs the largest bond fund in the world paints a stark picture of the domestic financial picture. He said the nation has lost the trust of financial entities including the Congressional Budget Office, International Monetary Fund and the Bank of International Settlements, each of which lately has published critiques of international finance. "When all of them speak, we should listen and in the latest year they’re all speaking in unison," Gross wrote. "What they’re saying is that when it comes to debt and to the prospects for future debt, the U.S. is no 'clean dirty shirt,'" the latter reference a term Pimco has used to describe the nation's standing compared to other debt-plagued nations. "The U.S., in fact, is a serial offender, an addict whose habit extends beyond weed or cocaine and who frequently pleasures itself with budgetary crystal meth. Uncle Sam’s habit, say these respected agencies, will be a hard (and dangerous) one to break." Washington must close both the budget deficit, which entails spending and revenue during the course of a given year, as well as a "fiscal gap," which describes the amount that will be needed to pay for social programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid that have unfunded liabilities of tens of trillions of dollars, Gross said. The CBO, BIS and IMF have concluded that the U.S. balance sheet "is in flames and that its fire department is apparently asleep at the station house," he added. The current budget deficit is running at more than $1.2 trillion while the total national debt is more than $16 trillion and there is a fiscal gap of 11 percent of gross domestic product, which is currently $15.6 trillion. Gross said Washington lawmakers need to find spending cuts and tax increases of $1.6 trillion a year to close to fiscal gap. Eliminating the so-called Bush tax cuts, enacted across the board during the George W. Bush administration and a favorite target of Democratic critics, would raise only $200 billion of that total, he said. "Unless we begin to close this gap, then the inevitable result will be that our debt/GDP ratio will continue to rise, the Fed would print money to pay for the deficiency, inflation would follow and the dollar would inevitably decline," Gross wrote. "Bonds would be burned to a crisp and stocks would certainly be singed; only gold and real assets would thrive within the 'Ring of Fire,'" another Gross term for U.S. economic conditions. Should that happen, the results both for investors and the U.S. economy would be catastrophic, he concluded. "If the fiscal gap isn’t closed even ever so gradually over the next few years, then rating services, dollar reserve holding nations and bond managers embarrassed into being reborn as vigilantes may together force a resolution that ends in tears," Gross said. "It would be a scenario for the storybooks, that’s for sure, but one which in this instance, investors would want to forget. The damage would likely be beyond repair."</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1349189912995</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:58:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349190019294-44</Id><Topic><Title>Leader of the Obstructionists</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1349186885481</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:08:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The repub base of support includes the ill informed, amnesiacs and the utterly stupid.</Msg><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1349190019294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 11:00:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349190367384-45</Id><Topic><Title>Go Boeing Engineers</Title><Username>america_wants_change</Username><Timestamp>1349174491984</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 06:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These people make too much money in the first place.

A new report finds dozens of weapons recovered in Mexico have been connected with the ill-fated and ill-conceived anti-gunrunning program. While some Mexican authorities estimate 300 of their citizens have been injured or killed by Fast and Furious guns, little has been known about those weapons south of the U.S. border until now. Through the Mexican Freedom of Information Act, Spanish-language network Univision and Fox News obtained a list of 100,000 weapons recovered in Mexico in 2009 and 2010. The guns were then compared with the serial numbers of the 2,000 guns sold in Fast and Furious. Univision identified a total of 57 more previously unreported firearms that were bought by straw purchasers monitored by ATF during Operation Fast and Furious, and then recovered in Mexico in sites related to murders, kidnappings and other actions by Mexican hit men and drug cartels. In an investigative special that aired Sunday, Univision revealed one such massacre that was later found to be linked with Fast and Furious. It happened in January 2010 in Juarez, Mexico, where cartel members burst into a home killing 16 people -- mostly teenagers -- at a birthday party. While the gunmen were targeting members of a rival gang attending that party, some of the victims were innocent bystanders.

Read this entire post -- the appalling hits just keep on coming. Let's start here: House investigators warned Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to expect a hearing into their finding that American staff at the U.S. Embassy in Libya had their request for additional security denied by Washington officials. “Based on information provided to the Committee by individuals with direct knowledge of events in Libya, the attack that claimed the ambassador’s life was the latest in a long line of attacks on Western diplomats and officials in Libya in the months leading up to September 11, 2012,” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and subcommittee chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, wrote Clinton today. They dismissed out-of-hand the suggestion that the attack ever could have been regarded as a spontaneous protest gone awry. “In addition, multiple U.S. federal government officials have confirmed to the Committee that, prior to the September 11 attack, the U.S. mission in Libya made repeated requests for increased security in Benghazi,” Issa and Chaffetz added (my emphasis). “The mission in Libya, however, was denied these resources by officials in Washington.” The committee noted 13 “security threats” in Benghazi, including an attempt to assassinate the British ambassador to Libya. Those 13 threats weren't just chatter; the US consulate was targeted by two actual bombing attempts leading up to the 9/11 raid. Eli Lake -- who scooped everyone with the "day one" revelation that explodes the administration's excuses about their "spontaneous attack" lies -- reports: In the five months leading up to this year’s 9/11 anniversary, there were two bombings on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and increasing threats to and attacks on the Libyan nationals hired to provide security at the U.S. missions in Tripoli and Benghazi. Details on these alleged incidents stem in part from the testimony of a handful of whistleblowers who approached the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the days and weeks following the attack on the Benghazi consulate. The incidents are disclosed in a letter to be sent Tuesday to Hillary Clinton from Rep. Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the oversight committee’s subcommittee that deals with national security. The State Department did not offer comment on the record last night. The new information disclosed in the letter obtained by The Daily Beast strongly suggests the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the late Ambassador Chris Stevens were known by U.S. security personnel to be targets for terrorists. Ambassador Stevens' own journal reportedly confirms this assertion. CNN says Stevens wrote about his fears of constant threats -- threats, incidentally, that the Obama administration has downplayed or flat-out denied. A crew from the cable news channel discovered the diary lying on the floor of the Benghazi diplomatic outpost, which has still not been secured, and still has not been picked-over by FBI investigators (see UPDATE II, below). But why would Washington deny "repeated requests" for beefed up security in Benghazi, even when it was so obviously required? That's what investigations are for, but here's a common-sense working theory: This president has demonstrated many times over that the one area of government he's willing to cut -- as in real, net cuts -- is the military. Obama's regime-change war in Libya was managed in such a way as to minimize even the appearance of US involvement, to the point of "leading from behind." Boots on the ground were never an option because Obama wanted this to be a clean, casualty-free effort, unlike the terribly hard and costly work in Iraq and Afghanistan. More security for US interests would have meant more US forces in Libya -- which could be perceived as escalating a new war of Obama's doing. Couldn't have that politically, so we proceeded with an exceedingly "light footprint," to a lethal fault. Meanwhile, guess who helped orchestrate this terrorist attack, according to intelligence sources? The revolutions that swept the Middle East and North Africa also emptied prisons of militants, a problem now emerging as a potential new terrorist threat. Fighters linked to one freed militant, Muhammad Jamal Abu Ahmad, took part in the Sept. 11 attack on U.S. diplomatic outposts in Libya that killed four Americans, U.S. officials believe based on initial reports. Intelligence reports suggest that some of the attackers trained at camps he established in the Libyan Desert, a former U.S. official said.</Msg><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1349201542870</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:12:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349202003532-68</Id><Title>Obama Has No Regrets Americans Were Killed in Benghazi</Title><Msg>First, a quote from The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg: "There's a widespread perception in the region that Obama is a weak, somewhat feckless president," (Shadi) Hamid... told me. "Bush may have been hated, but he was also feared, and what we've learned in the Middle East is that fear, sometimes at least, can be a good thing. Obama's aggressive hedging has alienated both sides of the Arab divide. Autocrats, particularly in the Gulf, think Obama naively supports Arab revolutionaries, while Arab protesters and revolutionaries seem to think the opposite." Leaders across the Middle East don't take Obama's threats seriously. Neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor the Arab leaders of the Gulf countries believe he'll act militarily against Iran's nuclear program in his second term..." That says it all, doesn't it? Which brings us to the second point. The Wall Street Journal's Bret Stephens calls Libya Obama's "3 am phone call" moment. To extend the metaphor, Obama bungled the lead-up to the call, slept through it, then jetted to Vegas for politics as usual -- even after receiving the horrifying voicemail message the next day.

Biden tells audience middle class has been 'buried' last four years By Amie Parnes - 10/02/12 01:33 PM ET Vice President Biden said Tuesday that the middle class has been “buried” for the last four years. Biden made the remark at a campaign rally while arguing that Republicans would raise taxes on the middle class. He said the tax hike would be especially bad given what the middle class has been through over the last four years. “This is deadly earnest, man. This is deadly earnest,” the vice president said. “How they can justify, how they can justify raising taxes on the middle class that has been buried the last four years? How in lord's name can they justify raising their taxes with these tax cuts.” Republicans quickly seized on the remarks, accusing the Obama administration of implementing policies that have hurt the middle class. “We agree, the middle class has been buried the past four years by Obama's failed policies from higher taxes to more debt, which is why he doesn't deserve another term in the White House to make it worse,” Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349203503110</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:45:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349203558877-72</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Has No Regrets Americans Were Killed in Benghazi</Title><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1349202003532</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:20:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"No regrets, says the Obama campaign."

White House Has No Comment on House GOPers’ Assertions that Libyan Mission Requested Security Prior to 9/11/12 Attack White House press secretary Jay Carney declined to comment on an assertion by the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that requests from diplomats in Libya for added security prior to the September 11, 2012 attack on the diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, were denied. “I’m not going to get into a situation under review by the State Department and the FBI,” Carney said. Earlier today, chairman of the committee Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the chair of the subcommittee on national security, homeland defense, and foreign operations, wrote to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, asserting that “multiple U.S. federal government officials have confirmed to the Committee that, prior to the September 11 (2012) attack, the U.S. mission in Libya made repeated requests for increased security in Benghazi. The mission in Libya, however, was denied these requests by officials in Washington.” The two congressmen also listed thirteen incidents leading up to the attack – ranging from I.E.D. and RPG attacks to a “posting on a pro-Gaddafi Facebook page” publicizing early morning runs taken by the late Ambassador Chris Stevens and his security detail around Tripoli. “Was State Department headquarters in Washington aware of all the above incidents?” they asked Secretary Clinton, requesting written responses by October 8. “If not, why not?” “If so, what measures did the State Department take to match the level of security provided to the U.S. Mission in Libya to the level of threat?” they asked. The two also asked for details of “any requests made by Embassy Tripoli to State Department headquarters for additional security, whether in general or in light of specific attacks” detailed in the letter. Carney said that “embassy security is a matter that is in the purview of the State Department,” and noted that “Secretary Clinton instituted an accountability review that is underway as we speak” while the investigation of the attack itself is being conducted by the FBI. The press secretary said that “from the moment our facility was attacked” the president has been focused on providing security to all diplomatic posts “and bringing the killers to justice.” About the list of security issues, Carney said it was a “known fact that Libya is in transition” and that in the eastern part of Libya in particular there are militant groups and “a great number of armed individuals and militias.” Carney made his comments in an off-camera gaggle in Las Vegas, Nevada. President Obama is in nearby Henderson, Nevada, preparing for his fist debate with Mitt Romney, to be held Wednesday night. -Jake Tapper</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349203936650</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:52:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349204280933-75</Id><Topic><Title>Debate is Romney's Last Chance !!</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1349195580524</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:33:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intoxicated by your own wishful thinking again, are ya?</Msg><Username>lucid_luke</Username><Timestamp>1349204280933</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:58:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349204487619-76</Id><Topic><Title>Leader of the Obstructionists</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1349186885481</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:08:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>=There is no question who the obstructionists are if you have half a brain....= Exactly, that's your problem: you only have half a brain, and you aren't even using half of that.</Msg><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1349204487619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:01:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349205369644-77</Id><Title>Someone Needs to tell The low Information people it's the Democrats who are the Obstructionists</Title><Msg>The Republican House has passed a budget every year and have passed bill after bill but the anti-democratic Senate controlled by Democrats refuse to even let them come up for an up or down vote.

Univision: Juarez drug cartel leader ‘El Diego’ was captured with Fast and Furious weapons Published: 10:10 PM 10/01/2012 By Matthew Boyle Mexico drug cartel leader Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez (Photo: AP) When Mexican authorities took Juarez drug cartel carnage king Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez — better known as “El Diego” — into custody, he had weapons from Operation Fast and Furious on his person, the English-language transcript of the Spanish-language television network Univision’s special investigation into the scandal shows. “According to investigations, ‘El Diego’ forms the link between this massacre and Fast and Furious,” an anchor read on air in Spanish Sunday evening, referring to two different mass killings drug cartel operatives used Fast and Furious weapons to conduct as Univision reported. “When he [El Diego] was captured in Chihuahua in the summer of 2011, he was found with weapons that the American government had allowed to enter Mexico,” the anchor added. El Diego was, until he was taken into custody, the leader of the Juarez drug cartel’s La Linea — or “enforcement arm.” According to the El Paso Times, El Diego told Mexican authorities after his capture that La Linea’s mission was, among other things, to “eliminate the members of the Sinaloa cartel in Ciudad Juárez.” Mexican authorities have alleged El Diego is responsible for the murders of at least 1,500 people in Juarez and Chihuaha City, Mexico, according to the El Paso Times. Tracy Schmaler, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Eric Holder, has not responded to a request for comment in response to this revelation.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349205799655</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:23:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349205807117-81</Id><Topic><Title>Someone Needs to tell The low Information people it's the Democrats who are the Obstructionists</Title><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1349205369644</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:16:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And try to find a Democrat who has voted for any Obuma proposed budget - No budget for 3 years so far - Ask Hairy reid why not ?</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1349205807117</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:23:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349205917666-82</Id><Title>Democrats are the Party of Choice.......</Title><Msg>......for all Communists.</Msg><Username>capitalists4freedom</Username><Timestamp>1349205917666</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:25:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349205985772-83</Id><Topic><Title>Drip, Drip, Drip...

This article on yahoo sums what we mostly already knew about Mitt Romney. I feel the country is fortunate to know what Mitt Romney said behind closed doors about 47% of Americans. My family is in that 47% and we cannpt supoprt a candidate that holds us in contempt. Shame on this Mormon that purports himself to be a Christian. Romney’s garbageman stars in new attack ad (VIDEO) By Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News Senior Media Reporter A labor union that supports President Barack Obama's re-election campaign has released an attack ad that features a sanitation worker collecting trash outside Mitt Romney's multimillion-dollar California mansion. "My name is Richard Hayes, and I pick up Mitt Romney's trash," the man says to the camera in the 60-second Web ad. "We're kind of like the invisible people, you know. He doesn't realize, you know, that the service we provide, you know, if it wasn't for us, you know, it would be a big health issue, us not picking up trash." "Picking up 15, 16 tons by hand, you know that takes a toll on your body," Hayes continued. "When I'm 55, 60 years old, I know my body's going to be break down. Mitt Romney doesn't care about that." The head of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which produced the spot, says it's a direct response to the Republican presidential nominee's controversial "47 percent" comments that have dogged him of late. "Mitt Romney's '47 percent' videotape revealed his contempt for tens of millions of Americans," AFSCME President Lee Saunders wrote in a blog post. "Romney seems only to be relaxed and at ease when he is surrounded by other millionaires and people willing to pay $50,000 to share a meal with him. And it is only those wealthy donors who get to know what is really on his mind. They spend more money than most Americans make in a year to ask Mitt Romney questions and listen to his reckless banter about Americans like Richard Hayes." Hayes' route includes Romney's $12 million La Jolla, Calif., mansion—"the house where he's putting in an elevator for his cars," wrote Saunders. "No one forced Romney to trash these Americans," he continued. "He was simply stating, to a privileged audience behind closed doors, what he really believes. He never expected that his remarks would be heard by the wider public." The Romney camp said it was unimpressed with the ad. "It's not surprising that a liberal special interest group is trying to distract from President Obama's failed agenda with dishonest political attacks," Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams said in a statement to Yahoo News. "President Obama has consistently sided with union bosses over middle class workers by supporting big government policies that have killed jobs, pushing for disastrous card check legislation that would take away the right to a secret ballot in the workplace, and stacking the National Labor Relations Board with their political cronies. As president, Mitt Romney will promote pro-growth policies that will get our country back on track and create economic opportunity for every American." The ad is the first of three attacking Romney produced by the union. But Saunders recently insisted the AFSCME was nonpartisan. "Let me be perfectly clear about this: Our union does not work for any political party; we work for justice and fairness in the workplace," he said at the AFSCME's annual meeting in June. "If someone takes us on, it does not matter whether they are a Democrat or a Republican, conservative or liberal. We must hold politicians of all political stripes accountable for what they say and what they do. Because when it comes to what affects our members and our rights, it's not about left versus right; it's about right versus wrong." Still, Saunders told attendees, "We must work our hearts out to re-elect President Obama."</Msg><Username>freddy_facebook</Username><Timestamp>1349207189177</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:46:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349207529040-90</Id><Title>UPDATE: WH Refuses to Comment on Denied Security Requests, US Abandons Benghazi</Title><Msg>As that Chinaman guy would say......this looky velly, velly bad for Obumer.

But bear in mind that Mr. Romney was talking to the financial super-elite, and gave every appearance of believing what he said. (I'm usually scornful of analyses based on how someone "comes across," and would never put much weight on it, but the Mitt Romney of this video was a lot looser and more articulate than the guy we usually see.) What this strongly suggests is that the Masters of the Universe, and Master Mitt himself, really believe all this stuff — which is pretty remarkable. His "lucky ducky" trope about people who depend on the government and pay no federal income tax is clearly, obviously nonsense. Equally obviously, it was originally created in an effort to dupe people who didn't know better. It was and is what the novelist George Orwell called, in "1984," "prolefeed": junk aimed at the ignorant masses (ignorant by design) — the people who are ready to believe at a moment's notice that we've always been at war with Eastasia. In Mr. Orwell's vision, however, the Party, and especially the Inner Party, wasn't supposed to consume this same tripe. It was supposed to understand the true Party agenda and vision. So it actually is a revelation to see Mr. Romney and friends obviously swallowing the prolefeed whole. The news here isn't really about their lack of empathy; it's about their raw ignorance. The Political Economy of Redistribution Mitt Romney is getting beaten up, and rightly so, for claiming that redistribution is un-American. Of course we redistribute, and we've been doing it on a substantial scale for generations. Medicare, for example, is in effect a strongly redistributive program: it's supported by a payroll tax (and other revenue) in which the amount you pay in depends on your income, but it supplies a benefit that depends only on your medical costs. From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs! So no, President Obama isn't a radical for suggesting that we should continue to do what we're already doing; the real radicals are the people on the right who want to declare much of what our government has been doing these past three generations illegitimate. The real question — arguably the central question of political economy — is how much to redistribute. And it's both interesting and important to try to understand how that decision gets made. There's a substantial literature that makes use of something like the following model: 1. The government levies taxes on everyone — say, as a constant proportion of income. 2. It uses that revenue to pay for a benefit that everyone receives. 3. Voters choose parties based on which offers a tax/benefit program closest to the one that maximizes their own utility. 4. The end result reflects the preferences of the median voter. This kind of model suggests that the median voter will, in fact, want redistribution as long as his or her income — median income — is less than average income, because in that case he'll have more to gain than to lose from a bit of redistribution. And this condition is always met because income distribution is skewed to the right (there are people with incomes $1 million above the median, but none with incomes $1 million below the median). But in that case, won't the median voter favor complete redistribution, with all income taxed away and then handed out as benefits? No, because of incentives: too high a tax rate will discourage effort and reduce overall incomes. So there's a trade-off that leads to some equilibrium level of redistribution. O.K., it should be obvious that while this model is pretty, it falls down badly in the realism department. For one thing, median-voter models of politics suggest that the parties should converge on similar policies; in fact, they're polarized. Beyond that, the model suggests that higher income inequality should lead to more redistribution. What we see in practice, however, is that European countries with relatively low inequality do much more redistribution than the United States, with its high inequality — and that as the United States has gotten more unequal, its tax and transfer system has grown less, not more redistributive. I don't think we have a full explanation of these awkward facts. But the model is still useful for thinking about the political world we live in.In particular, imagine yourself as a hired gun for the right tail of the income distribution. What would you do in an effort to stop median voters from realizing that they would benefit from a more European-style system? Well, you'd do everything you could to exaggerate the disincentive effects of higher taxes, while trying to convince middle-income voters that the benefits of government programs go to other people. And at the same time, you'd do everything you could to disenfranchise lower-income citizens, so that the median voter would have a higher income than the median citizen. So far, efforts along these lines have been remarkably successful in the United States. But operatives on the right are clearly worried that their three-decade run of success may be coming to an end.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_777</Username><Timestamp>1349214288065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 17:44:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349215168034-112</Id><Topic><Title>The Real Romney Emerges</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_777</Username><Timestamp>1349214288065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 17:44:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post, but my butt-buddy analgonquin definitely won't like it.</Msg><Username>alangonquins_loverboy</Username><Timestamp>1349215168034</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 17:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349215513862-113</Id><Topic><Title>Davis Love: Woods and Stricker were worthless.</Title><Username>johnt_baptist</Username><Timestamp>1349103413768</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 10:56:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How much did you lose betting on the cup......sounds like more than $100 Just remember the cup was lost on Sunday and it happened before Woods could finish his match Next time bet heavy on the NY Jets or Dallas Cowboys</Msg><Username>docfunknstein</Username><Timestamp>1349215513862</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 18:05:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349215540017-114</Id><Topic><Title>Vulture/ Voucher Hiding Specifics of Their "Program"</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1349211338479</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 16:55:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because if lost a limb or two, it would be harder to make money?</Msg><Username>chris_genna2</Username><Timestamp>1349215540017</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 18:05:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349216827023-115</Id><Topic><Title>Vulture/ Voucher Hiding Specifics of Their "Program"</Title><Username>imshockedshocked</Username><Timestamp>1349211338479</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 16:55:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And some people want this IDIOT to be the next president....... boggles the mind.</Msg><Username>engineer_eds_buttplug</Username><Timestamp>1349216827023</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 18:27:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349217326605-116</Id><Topic><Title>re You Hitting The Jackpot With BA?</Title><Username>chadwickchapman606</Username><Timestamp>1349211499295</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 16:58:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cool thanks for sharing that.

Less successful have been their attempts to defend these laws in federal court. Ari Berman of the Nation counts 11 cases that have been rejected by the courts, including today’s ruling in Pennsylvania that narrowly (and temporarily) blocked a voter ID provision passed by the state. In other key battleground states, like Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin, judges have similarly ruled against crackdowns on voter ID laws, restrictions on voter registration and early voting, and voter purges, among other things. “It is a remarkable development that courts across the country have almost uniformly rejected every single law passed making it harder for eligible citizens to vote,” Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center, told Berman. “This is a clear rejection of attempts by politicians to manipulate the election rules for political gain.” However, some states, like Kansas and Tennessee, still have strict voter ID laws on the books for this cycle.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_777</Username><Timestamp>1349224992756</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 20:43:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349225288455-125</Id><Topic><Title>GOP voter laws getting walloped by the courts</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_777</Username><Timestamp>1349224992756</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 20:43:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But, the Supremes Will Uphold Voter I'd Laws and You Know to, Dik!</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349225288455</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 20:48:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349225361176-126</Id><Topic><Title>Joe Biden Gives Obama the Middle Finger... says Middle Class Buried Last Four Years!</Title><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349210308746</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 16:38:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Democrats have the Executive Branch covered and the Senate covered for the last four years.
