What constitutes the 1% are "returns" filed with the IRS where the income is greater the $250K. Some of those are individuals, some of those are couples (joint returns), and of those individuals and couples are business owners and professionals. I am guessing you are not one of them. Why is that? You don't need to answer. Nobody's business but your own. The question is rhetorical: did you do everything in your life, as well as do all of your homework in school and go to college, in order to be a part of this 1%? My wife and I were in this so-called 1%, for a short while, until I needed to retire. So, now we are not in the 1%. Our house is nice, but smaller than many across the nation. Some very large homes are owned by others that are actually non-1%-ers. Our 401K's and pensions are built up from 35+ years of working and saving. It is not billions. So, this so-called 99% - are they where they are because of "fate"? During their life‚Äôs preparatory stage (youth) were they chained to mediocrity? Or was that their choice? Every choice that we made in life integrates into our success, or lack thereof. It isn't fate so much as it is election. If a person is born into a "dead town", get out. The cost is only bus fare. Or join the military - it also provides immediate transplantation from that "dead town" as well as structure and opportunities, but with some risk. Choose a job that has a future. And it is not impossible to transform "flipping burgers" into owning a franchise and, guess what, joining the 1%. If we believe that we are "victims", then we are indeed victims, but not at the hands of others. At least that is still true in the United States - for now. If I had to offer advice, it would be: work hard, go to college, have a good attitude at work, save money/don't blow it all. Maybe you will achieve being the 1% - if that is important. But that person will have succeeded in being successful and not envious, even if that person does not ‚Äúescape‚Äù being a 99%-er. Years ago, my union member, Democrat voting grandfather said, and this was about 1970, that ‚Äúgive all the poor $10,000 (about $60K today) each, and in six months, they will have spent all the money and returned to being poor.‚Äù Given this liberal man‚Äôs perspective, I suspect that he might be a conservative today, but he understood the value of work, and he left his wife (grandma) with a house that was paid for and she died at the age of 97, painlessly slumping over at the table, while enjoying a breakfast with her daughter (my aunt). Neither my grandmother, nor grandfather were complainers but doers. In fact, they were ‚ÄúOakies‚Äù that got in their cars in the 1930‚Äôs, left their ‚Äúdead town‚Äù, and made a success out of their lives ‚Äì and they were the 99%. From a faith point of view, it is important to not get trapped into "envy" (10th commandment). If there is something fundamentally wrong with our tax structure, then fix that. The motive should be for greater success of both the 99% as well as the 1%. Encourage investment. But stop being covetous of your neighbor's wealth.

Although the Tea Party was allegedly given votes in the midterms to address financial issues, abortion restriction and defunding Planned Parenthood immediately rose to the top of the new Republican priority list. That was all supposed to end with this election--but did it? This absurd period of legislative history that became dubbed the ‚Äúwar on women‚Äù (though it affected people of all genders) culminated in this year's notorious spate of comments from Tea Party-approved candidates about rape -- legitimate, god-willed or otherwise -- and resulted in the biggest anti-misogynist backlash at the ballot box we‚Äôve seen in a long time. Women handily voted for Obama, vetoed extreme anti-choicers and listed abortion as an important issue in exit polls. But in several states, GOPers seemed not to get the message. At all. Some of them are continuing to fight the same battles, in some cases putting women‚Äôs access at risk. Could it be because they have no ideas besides digging back into the ‚Äúdump on women‚Äôs rights‚Äù bag of tricks? 1. Ohio. Right away during Ohio's lame duck session, members of the state GOP decided that it might be a good idea to revive some battles they lost, like the dangerous and restrictive ‚Äúheartbeat ban,‚Äù which would ban abortion while a fetal heartbeat was detected (and whose potential effects many have compared to the situation in Ireland that led to Savita Halappanavar‚Äôs death). They also made efforts to defund their state‚Äôs Planned Parenthood--again. This led to State Senator Nina Turner creating a T-shirt that said ‚ÄúGet Out of My Panties‚Äù and calling the GOP in her state "insane." At last this week, these Ohio GOP efforts to curtail reproductive freedom came to an end, but not after they wasted a lot of time and energy on all ends trying to remind women of their desire to legislate in the womb. 2. Arizona is worthy of a double prize, and not only because the state is continuing to fight an appeal in court to keep funding away from Planned Parenthood--even though they‚Äôve lost in lower courts. Even worse, there‚Äôs a new shame tactic from the state, which has already instituted a highly constitutionally questionable 20-week ban: a Web site which tries to manipulate women out of having abortions. At Jezebel, Katie JM Baker offers an analysis of the site‚Äôs true intentions: Make no mistake: the website is biased, ...The title itself ‚Äî "A Women's Right to Know" ‚Äî is incredibly patronizing. The first paragraph on the home page doesn't define abortion or even explain why a woman might choose to terminate a pregnancy; instead, it states that "... If your doctor performs an abortion on you without obtaining your voluntary consent or without allowing a private medical consultation they may be liable to you for claims in a civil action." Because it's that easy for women to get abortions, you guys! Those wily doctors will give you an abortion even if you don't want one! Lock your windows! Rather than offering women medically accurate information, the site offers half-truths and shame. 3. Arkansas GOPers, finding themselves in charge of both legislative chambers, are wasting no time trying to do what they do best: get all up in Arkansas uteri. They are introducing measures to ban abortion by ‚Äútelemedicine‚Äù as well as a controversial 20-week ban: Mayberry said he plans to reintroduce legislation next year that would ban abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy, based on the disputed claim that a fetus can feel pain after that point. Mayberry's bill was one of 10 anti-abortion measures that failed to clear the House Public Health Committee during last year's session, and it's one of three measures that Arkansas Right to Life says it plans to push for in the legislative session that begins Jan. 14. ...The Arkansas attorney general's office last year opposed the measure, telling the panel that it was in conflict with established law and would likely be struck down as unconstitutional. 4. Wisconsin. Despite their state‚Äôs hearty endorsement of President Barack Obama‚Äôs re-election, Wisconsin Republicans are also gearing up for more anti-choice measures along the same lines as other states, eager to take advantage of a GOP-dominated state goverment: The state's largest anti-abortion group sees opportunities to place further regulations on abortion, including requiring women seeking the procedure to view an ultrasound of her fetus. Wisconsin Right to Life is also proposing banning abortions that would cause pain to the fetus, barring abortions that are sought based on the sex of the fetus and prohibiting the ability of state employees to use their state healthcare plans to access abortions. 5. Mississippi‚Äôs only abortion clinic is embattled by a law designed to shut it down and is in danger of closing. A press release from the Center for Reproductive Rights notes that ideology trumps medical sense in this fight: Although all the doctors currently providing abortions to women at the Mississippi clinic are board-certified ob-gyns, the physicians responsible for the lion‚Äôs share of the clinic‚Äôs patients have not been granted privileges by any of the hospitals in the area. In fact, several of the hospitals refused to even process the physicians‚Äô applications, citing their biased policies and practices towards abortion care. CRR has filed suit to prevent the law from going into effect, while anti-choice protesters targeting the clinic continue to ‚Äúharass and terrify‚Äù patients. All these states show that the misguided crusade against women‚Äôs rights is not over, despite the overwhelming ‚Äúout of our exam rooms, out of our bedrooms‚Äù message sent by the 2012 election. In 2013, keep your eye on the states to see whether the ‚Äúwar‚Äù on reproductive health services comes to an end, continues, or as some activists wish, goes the other way. Wouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if, instead of fighting retrograde bills, we focused on expanding access, coverage and information about abortion and sexual health?</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_667</Username><Timestamp>1354407387604</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 19:16:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354407626915-44</Id><Title>GOP Extremists Continue to Push Repugnant Anti-Women Laws</Title><Msg>GOP Extremists Continue to Push Repugnant Anti-Women Laws By Sarah Seltzer, The 2012 election was meant to be a referendum on, among other things, the tide of Republican extremism that swept reproductive rights to the edge of existence in many states between 2010 and 2012.

Nearly a month after their blow-out defeat, Republicans still refuse to confront their demographic challenges By Joshua Holland Republicans are responding to their recent losses not by moderating their rhetoric or rethinking their policy preferences, but by retreating deeper into the conservative bubble ‚Äî and hardening it lest any objective reality intrude. In the Wall Street Journal, William McGurn approached the idea that villifying half the country as lazy ‚Äútakers‚Äù dependent on the largesse of the makers may not be a way to win over the masses. He wrote, ‚ÄúMaybe Americans who have reason to feel insecure about their futures don‚Äôt find a government that promises to be there for them when they need it all that menacing.‚Äù But he then rejects the notion and calls for better propaganda. ‚ÄúConservatives‚Äô top priority,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúshould be promoting an alternative‚Äîthat in a highly competitive, global economy, the only real economic security for ordinary Americans is the security of opportunity.‚Äù Victor Davis Hanson‚Äôs analysis of the election was representative and equally informative. He wrote that Mitt Romney was an amazing candidate ‚Äì ‚Äúa glittering Sir Galahad who, given his impressive horse, armor, and lance, along with his decency and piety, assumed that he could win a joust in a fair charge against the other team‚Äôs knight.‚Äù Hanson claimed that 47 percent of the population are in fact dependent on government and mocked the idea that the Republican Party might try to reach out to non-white voters. ‚ÄúThe only way Republicans can appeal to Latinos,‚Äù he wrote, is to ‚Äúclose the border, stop illegal immigration, and allow the melting pot and upward mobility to fracture ‚ÄòHispanics‚Äô along class lines.‚Äù For Hanson and most of his readers, neither the message nor the messenger were problematic; only the pernicious bias of the traditional media prevented voters from embracing the plans Mitt Romney was going to detail right after his victory. Hanson then, without irony, warned his fellow Republicans of the dangers of falling into the comforting ‚Äúcocoon‚Äù provided by the conservative media. That cocoon is about to grow, and William McGurn may get more, if not better, conservative spin. According to CL Atlanta, ‚ÄúCox Media Group, the parent company of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, plans to launch an ‚Äòindependent (nonpartisan), anti-propaganda‚Äô national news website for conservative audiences that is ‚Äòrooted in the South away from the right and left coasts.‚Äô‚Äù Because Fox and the rest of the dedicated right-wing media apparently aren‚Äôt enough. The new ‚Äúnational news website for conservative audiences‚Äù will no doubt parrot Paul Ryan‚Äôs line that Obama didn‚Äôt win a mandate to govern ‚Äúbecause [voters] also reelected the House Republicans.‚Äù Never mind that House Democrats won the popular vote and the GOP retained its majority largely due to skillful gerrymandering following the 2010 Census. So despite the fact that polls show a majority of Americans favor raising taxes on the wealthy in order to maintain programs that help lower-income people ‚Äì and that more voters will blame the GOP than Democrats if the government starts down the fiscal slope ‚Äì House Republicans are so far sticking with Ryan‚Äôs disastrous ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù for their next round of hostage-taking. ‚ÄúOur opening position is pretty much the Ryan budget, and we‚Äôll see what they want to counter with that,‚Äù Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, a member of the House Budget Committee, told The Hill. Safely ensconced in their bubble, the conservative movement isn‚Äôt sparing a moment for introspection, and certainly isn‚Äôt going to change its tune anytime soon. Most believe the election was somehow illegitimate ‚Äì either because Obama managed to bribe voters with ‚Äúgifts,‚Äù as Mitt Romney sees it, or because Americans were hoodwinked. A conspiracy theory that massive voter fraud delivered Obama a second term has moved from the fringes ‚Äì from Dean Chambers, the ‚Äúunskewed polls‚Äù guy ‚Äì to Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who this week told a right-wing talk radio host that it was highly suspicious that Obama lost in all of the states that passed voter ID laws (all deep red states where Democrats never win, of course). So the Tea Party is going to redouble its efforts to primary viable Republicans it deems insufficiently wingnutty. Despite costing the GOP four winnable Senate seats in the past two election cycles by nominating freaks like Richard Mourdock, Todd Akin, Sharron Angle and Christine O‚ÄôDonnell, they are already gearing up to unseat senators Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, Lamar Alexander in Tennessee and Saxby Chambliss in Georgia, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Club for Growth is threatening to target West Virginia Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, a popular Republican with a long family pedigree in the state, after she announced her intention to run for the seat held by Democrat Jay Rockefeller. Scott Walker is trying to do away with same-day voter registration and Pennsylvania will fully implement its voter ID law. Despite exit polls showing that only one in four Americans wants Obamacare repealed, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, after briefly declaring that it was the law of the land, renounced his momentary apostacy and vowed to fight on for full repeal. A year after polls showed that voters diapproved of Republicans mucking with the debt ceiling by a 68-30 margin, Boehner declared that the coming limit was his ‚Äúleverage‚Äù in negotiating a solution to the contrived fiscal slope ‚Äúcrisis.‚Äù Even the supposed ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from Grover Norquist‚Äôs anti-tax pledge by a handful of Republicans like Linsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and Saxby Chamblis, R-Georgia, is a sham. The ‚Äúrogue‚Äù senators will likely earn themselves a primary challenge from the right, but the reality is that their push for new revenues by eliminating unspecified deuctions while keeping rates on the wealthiest Americans low was the idea put forth by the guy who just lost an election to Barack Obama. This is a movement that has swallowed its own rhetoric to such a degree that it is not capable of looking at the reality of its demographic challenges and adapting. It‚Äôs a movement that‚Äôs unprepared to accept the growing unpopularity of its positions on social issues. Republicans created a dedicated information infrastructure to combat what they saw as widespread bias in the media and academia, and now it‚Äôs that same mighty wurlitzer that will prevent them from adapting to a changing America.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_667</Username><Timestamp>1354408257269</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 19:30:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354408500750-47</Id><Title>Is the right wing media bubble impenetrable?</Title><Msg>Republicans are responding to their recent losses not by moderating their rhetoric or rethinking their policy preferences, but by retreating deeper into the conservative bubble ‚Äî and hardening it lest any objective reality intrude.

This is what the Federalist Papers had to say about the electoral college: "It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations. It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the United States. But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief." Times have changed. The electoral college, as far as I can tell, was never supposed to be with "winner take all" for some states and not others - which creates some amount of distortion - though apparently there are now only two that do not. But California's 55 votes going 100% to Obama (and Democrat candidates for the foreseeable future) is a distortion as the actual votes were not 100% for Obama. Years ago, I thought that the elimination of the electoral college was just political hay. But the last several elections with the state distortions and the possibility of undermining the individual vote, it just seems like it is time to dump it. And, Hooz, we don't need a "Constitutional Convention", just a specific amendment - wouldn't want to open the doors to a third+ term for Obama. :-)</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1354417232632</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 22:00:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354417433025-59</Id><Topic><Title>Do Democrats have a permanent Electoral College advantage?</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_667</Username><Timestamp>1354407788231</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 19:23:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>censored err dumbo err entitlement err MO err spaz</Msg><Username>iamtheonetruespaz666</Username><Timestamp>1354417433025</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 22:03:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>18</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354418701314-60</Id><Topic><Title>BOEING WALKS OUT ON NEGOTIATIONS</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1354229919047</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:58:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep read the link- however- they just lumped boeing in the whole mess without giving specifics- While all companies have to contribute under erisa to meet minimumm guidelines, and the low interest rate makes it look worse, it is a stretch to say BA is overburdened by the UNION pension since the majority of the NON UNION employees have also pensions - about 20 different plans IN ALL. Suggest you look at last years annual report- and certain Form 5500 filings, etc. And LAST YEARS SUMMARY IS AVAILABLE ON THE BOEING SITE. Look for the Heritage plan ( BCERP ) which applies to about 20,00o speea and a similar amount of IAM.

As required by law, this notice also includes general information regarding pension plan terminations and benefits guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation which is found elsewhere in this booklet. Participant Information The total number of participants in the plan as of the Plan‚Äôs valuation date was 150,461. Of this number, 54,392 were active participants, 67,263 were retired or separated from service and receiving benefits, and 28,806 were retired or separated from service and entitled to future benefits. +++ Year-End Assets and Liabilities The asset values in the chart above are measured as of the first day of the Plan Year and are actuarial values. Because market values can fluctuate daily based on factors in the marketplace, such as changes in the stock market, pension law allows plans to use actuarial values that are designed to smooth out those fluctuations for funding purposes. The asset values below are market values and are measured as of the last day of the plan year. Market values tend to show a clearer picture of a plan‚Äôs funded status as of a given point in time. As of December 31, 2011, the fair market value of the Plan‚Äôs assets was $13,588,363,605. On this same date, the Plan‚Äôs liabilities were $17,103,873,963. ++ the above amount meets the 80 percent funding bar for erisa, and is actually 100% of the target of 80.4 % according to the published document.</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1354419680325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 22:41:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354420827568-62</Id><Topic><Title>BOEING WALKS OUT ON NEGOTIATIONS</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1354229919047</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:58:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The most overwhelming problem facing Boeing right this minute is ALL the chart boys ("power point rangers") who made the 787 such a disaster are STILL THERE.
