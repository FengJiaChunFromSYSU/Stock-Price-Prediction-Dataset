AirBus has no answer for the 777 or the 777x. Boeing has gone way further than AirBus in using composite materials in aircraft. The 777ER can already fly 12,000 miles without refueling. The 777x will push the range further using composite wings and smaller engines. The 787 is starting to make some major strides and the 787-10 is right behind the 777x in the development cube. The KC-46 tanker program is going to be huge. The Air Force needs to replace 400 50 year old KC-135 aircraft. This is going to be at least a 20-30 contract. The Secretary of the Air Force just made a statement that there will be no spending cuts on the tanker program. He said it is a major priority for the Air Force to be able to extend their air power worldwide on a moments notice. He also said that flying 50 year old aircraft has created a danger to the air crews. That 100 a share price will look cheap in a couple of years. Boeing is about to do something they haven't done in a long long time, kick some major butt!</Msg><Username>defense_junky</Username><Timestamp>1369467728482</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 03:42:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369470136287-4</Id><Topic><Title>wonder why domerrrr45, foulmouther, and the rat pack keep pretending Boeing is a good stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369448330536</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 22:18:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well wayne, if you want a high flyer, check out UNXL.</Msg><Username>defense_junky</Username><Timestamp>1369470136287</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 04:22:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369471526431-5</Id><Topic><Title>New poll reveals half of Americans wants Obama impeached</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1369012709636</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 21:18:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Asshat.</Msg><Username>cliberg</Username><Timestamp>1369471526431</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 04:45:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369474470420-6</Id><Topic><Title>wonder why domerrrr45, foulmouther, and the rat pack keep pretending Boeing is a good stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369448330536</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 22:18:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you hate women?</Msg><Username>bebop_arugula</Username><Timestamp>1369474470420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 05:34:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369479023805-7</Id><Topic><Title>wonder why domerrrr45, foulmouther, and the rat pack keep pretending Boeing is a good stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369448330536</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 22:18:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bebop, that is a troll reply, a woman in a employment setting is not a sex toy for managers I think its you bbop, who has the hate problem Wayne</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369479023805</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 06:50:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369479534517-8</Id><Topic><Title>wonder why domerrrr45, foulmouther, and the rat pack keep pretending Boeing is a good stock</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369448330536</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 22:18:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>greg, agreed, only 2 suppliers and many customers so Boeing can continue to screw up as badly as now, and until china makes their 737 competition plane a flier .

It worked great . Boeing not so good, Boeing leadership consistently makes the wrong decisions. The customer wants light weight planes it only took mulally two years of no sale to finally understand that the sonic cruiser was nto going to sell, going marginally faster at huge fuel cost was a no sell and exit mulally. Jim is just as bad the Md business plan of failure is his only plan. next the customer is not always right, while military has a history of composite materials they also have a limitless budget and do ot fly the warplanes 24 -7-365 with tired ground crews and substandard workers all over the world banging things against the planes. When an aluminum part is damages you can see it , nos so with composite materials unless destroyed. As more composite bodied planes start flying, eventually one will crash like the when the Airbus lost a composite tail. defense user there will be the day of reconciliation, when the bird comes back to the nest. there has never been a successful most or all composite airplane and they are smaller examples and they all failed due to the nature of composite failure. you cant see it until its too late. The 787 is a comet in process, it will be a matter of years but all composite large planes will not work. As far as Airbus their middle road is much better, some composite and a nicad battery something that is a step up but not a experimental airplane that puts the flying public at risk. doubt me? the battery for the 787 is not fixed, or it would not be put in a box,if you think containing a fire is a good thing, compared to what? as the planes start making more emergency landings with a fire in the box the Boeing 787 will fail</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1369481211361</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 07:26:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369485823738-12</Id><Topic><Title>Global Warming nuts killing themselves and their children</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369409806041</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 11:36:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dem666 Genna and James , it is people like you who seem to be the science DENIERS - Do you believe a Transient Climate Response of 1.3 degrees C (this was just released by IPCC scientists last week) is in IMMEDIATE DANGER to the destruction of the planet? Are you really terrified over a 1 mole fraction increase in atmospheric CO2 now that scientists have lowered the Transient Climate Response and admitting that their modeled feedbacks were too high? Is there no difference between a little warming of less than 1.3 degreesC by 2100 that scientists are now estimating as opposed to the 6 degreesC of warming by 2100 that nut jobs cling to? There are science DENIERS on the left who now deny 23 years of NASA satellite data that show that Total Precititable Water has not increased with the rise of CO2 as predicted by the global warming theory. The models of future climate disasters now show little increase in climate disaster costs now that the old Transient Climate Response figure has been tossed and the new figure is plugged in. Franny Armstrong and her friends are nut jobs who are ignorant of climate science facts and instead embrace a religious type "end of days" position that CO2 will destroy the planet and all life. There is no longer a science based reason to belief in runaway catastrophic global warming. If you still believe in runaway catistrophic global warming or you support policy based on such a belief, then you are science DENIER nut jobs like Franny. It is important to educate people on the truth and not the religious styled hype.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369485823738</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 08:43:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369491060438-13</Id><Topic><Title>Global Warming nuts killing themselves and their children</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1369409806041</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 11:36:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"she plans to kill herself and them when it comes to it."

Mulally has turned Ford upside down and changed the negative culture at Ford. As Ford Jr said, picking Alan Mulally to run Ford was the right choice, and it becomes more right every day. Ford now has some of the highest rated cars on the market! Problem with the 787 Lithium ion battery was that the company they outsourced the battery to in Japan outsourced the design to another company in Japan. This company never had much experience designing high output Lithium ion batteries. Elon Musk at TSLA called Boeing and told them that they had the same problems with their car Lithium ion batteries because they used large cells in the design which caused huge heat problems and thermal runaway which caused the batteries to breakdown. They solved the heat problem by redesigning their batteries using thousands of micro cells. Boeing is working this fix in their new battery design. I used to fly all over the world fixing computer hardware and software problems. I flew on every aircraft in existence. AirBus aircraft don't fly as smooth as Boeing aircraft. For trivia buffs, the 777 is the only aircraft in the world that has never had a major aircraft crash that resulted in loss of life. Last but not least, my 150 target for Boeing stock was being conservative. I actually believe Boeing will break 200 in the next couple of years if they don't split the stock.

All of the fires were on scheduled flights, one of which was in flight and the other two occurred at the gate. More than 50 wires were burned on each plane and numerous circuit breakers were tripped The safety alert affects all Boeing models 737-100 through 737-500, the so-called "Classic series," built from 1967 to 1999. More than 1,600 of the planes still remain in active service. The alert says the malfunction occurred because of improperly installed clamps on air ducts.

Boeing has now issued new instructions for installation of the clamps that clarify the proper positioning to avoid future mishaps, the safety alert said.</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1369509208411</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 15:13:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369509425579-23</Id><Title>china air 747 issue</Title><Msg>ELLENWOOD, Ga.

It may sell wonderfully inside the conservative closed-information loop, but it’s a nasty idea that sorts exceptionally badly with democratic politics. In case you’re unfamiliar, the right to be free from criticism is the core idea behind what used to be complaints about “political correctness” and which have now morphed into the conviction that some accusations are too terrible to be made. See, for example, former Heritage immigration expert (or is that race-and-intelligence obsessive?) Jason Richwine. As he told conservative reporter Byron York: The accusation of racism is one of the worst things that anyone can call you in public life … Once that word is out there, it’s very difficult to recover from it, even when it is completely untrue. What does “difficult to recover” mean in this context? Richwine, after all, is the protégé of none other than Charles Murray, who has been accused of racist writings for … well, for decades. And yet Murray has “recovered” just fine, at least if book sales and think-tank posts and other traditional markers of success are concerned. Richwine surely knows that. So what’s his complaint? It is the same as most complaints about political correctness: that some people won’t consider his actions respectable. (No doubt someone with a bit more imagination than Richwine might imagine even worse things to be called than “racist.” For example, someone could be called a member of an intellectually inferior race, genetically doomed to always be looking up to those races that have superior intelligence. But pointing that out would no doubt violate Richwine’s standards of civilized political discourse.) Similarly, the Republican response to the Democratic “war on women” rhetoric hasn’t been so much that the criticism is wrong but rather that it’s — as one Republican member of the House said this week — “repugnant.” One might say that whatever grievances one former Heritage think-tanker, or even some Republican politicians, might have are interesting but of little importance in the grand scheme of things. But it turns out that the exact same logic — the logic that conservatives should feel perfectly free to engage in political advocacy without any danger of someone criticizing them — has become central to the Republican platform on campaign finance. Indeed, only a few years ago, most Republicans held the opposite position; during the debate on the (bipartisan, to be sure) McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill, the Republican alternative was to allow money to flow more freely as long as it was disclosed. That was then. Now, disclosure is seen as an abomination — precisely because it can lead to, yes, criticism of the donors. Thus, Mitch McConnell’s epic op-ed this week, in which McConnell claimed the First Amendment was imperiled by “explicit attacks on groups and other private citizens” by Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. Those attacks did, in fact, happen; McConnell linked to an Obama campaign page which publicized opposition research on big Mitt Romney donors. Again, there’s no claim that the research was incorrect or that anything beyond that criticism took place (nothing about harassment by federal government agencies, for example). It’s just the criticism alone that is, for McConnell, beyond the pale. For McConnell, the whole thing is “the left-wing playbook: Expose your opponents to public view, release the liberal thugs and hope the public pressure or unwanted attention scares them from supporting causes you oppose.” McConnell then concludes by observing that “[t]he First Amendment … was written to protect speech that was not popular” and that “The American people need to remain vigilant against any effort by the powerful to stifle speech.” Which, for McConnell, means keeping that speech anonymous if possible, and if not, then protected against criticism. I think it’s wrong to read this, as Ed Kilgore does, as a claim that if government officials knew who was criticizing them, they might retaliate with actual oppression and “the jails [would be] crammed with poor innocent conservatives.” No. What McConnell says plainly is it’s the criticism itself that’s the danger that must be avoided. It’s nuts. But it’s also deeply anti-democratic. It’s true that we should be careful, in democratic politics, to avoid questioning people’s motives. There’s nothing wrong, however, with noting the interests involved in politics, in questioning who would benefit from a policy, and from pointing out that a campaign is financed by people who would benefit from their preferred policies being adopted. Indeed, there’s nothing wrong with the press using those donors as a shorthand way of informing citizens which interests are represented by the various candidates, or for those candidates to make a point of which interests finance their opponents. Moreover, there’s simply nothing wrong with saying that incorporated in the freedom of speech is the risk that one’s speech is going to be criticized. The framers of the Constitution did not, in fact, include in the real First Amendment McConnell’s right not to be criticized. Nor would they support it. Liberals are not immune to this kind of thinking. Indeed, as far as I know, complaints about “political correctness” began with liberals who were frustrated that those to the left of them criticized them for being insufficiently party-line, with the implied penalty of social disgrace — social disgrace, that is, to the extent that being publicly considered not “really” on the left mattered to anyone. But in most recent cases, liberal complaints about conservative criticisms are limited to legitimate complaints about accuracy (as in the phony idea that 47% of the population are “takers”) or decency (criticizing Sandra Fluke when she testified publicly was reasonable, but calling her a #$%$” because she supported Affordable Care Act provisions for birth control was not). The First Amendment and political speech are indeed very close to the core of democracy. The Republican delusion that it includes the right to be free from criticism is, therefore, quite destructive. That’s true when they seek the freedom to attack ethnic groups without risking being called out for racist comments; it’s true when they seek the freedom to dominate campaigns financially without risking being called out on that. Mitch McConnell and the Republicans are dead wrong about that. And if they disagree with me? They are free to say so.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369522459151</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 18:54:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369525551671-31</Id><Topic><Title>GOP: Party of crybabies</Title><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369522459151</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 18:54:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone know Jonathan Bernstein?

Ted Cruz isn’t interested in making friends. Is that a smart way for a senator to conduct himself? By John Dickerson| Sen. Ted Cruz doesn’t have as many friends as he says he does. In the latest round of Cruz’s simmering debate with Sen. John McCain (who labeled Cruz a "wacko bird"), Cruz spoke of "my friend, the senior senator from Arizona" while painting him as out of touch with his party and country. It usually takes a while for senators to learn how to weaponize compliments and imprecations of friendship, but Cruz is a quick study. After a patient attack on McCain's understanding of history, Cruz said: "I know my friend from Arizona is well aware of that because he is such an esteemed historian of this body." Like use of the word "frankly," which in Washington means just the opposite, Cruz’s sentence is best read in reverse: McCain is neither a friend, esteemed, nor a historian. (He is still, however, from Arizona.) Do you need friends in the Senate anymore? Ted Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah are testing this theory in new ways. The power of Tea Party activists in Republican politics, the public’s low esteem for Congress, and structural changes in the Senate like the elimination of earmarks and the weakening of appropriations power have created more incentives for senators to get by without a little help from their friends. Cruz has had a series of run-ins with his colleagues since being sworn in only four months ago. He battled Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein over gun control, his Senate Republican colleagues over a threat to filibuster gun legislation; and most recently he tangled with McCain and Republican Sen. Susan Collins over budget procedure. He wears the dustups as a badge of honor. "Count me a proud wacko bird," he told an approving audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference, referring to McCain’s jab. Advertisement There was a time when a new senator could not have survived such a controversial start. "The making of a good senator is in some ways similar to the making of a good work of art," William White wrote in 1956 in Citadel: The Story of the U.S. Senate. "There are few shortcuts." Lyndon Johnson gave a copy of the book to freshman senators. It advised that a career rested "upon what is slowly developing and enduring ... rather than what is quick and spectacular. Eminence may be reached by a concentration on frenetic and untypical senatorial activity, but it will never be sustained in that way." Ted Cruz didn’t read that book, and even if he did, he’s decided to write his own. Though his colleagues have suggested he tone down his hard charging approach, he continues to engage with verve on multiple fronts. White’s description of the Senate described the institution before an ambitious John F. Kennedy vaulted to the presidency after serving only one term, beating out Senate lion Lyndon Johnson and other Senate veterans for his party’s nomination. A politician no longer had to build up a Senate career to make a national name. Sen. Barack Obama marked the final evolution of this theory. Sen. Ted Kennedy advised him to run soon lest he get too weighed down with associations to the Senate. Now Sens. Marco Rubio, Paul, and Cruz see the Senate cloak room as the waiting room to the Oval Office. Cruz's constituents at home like his brand of truth telling. They sent him to Washington to ruffle feathers. He is seen as a patriot fighting for the right cause. Fans delight in his rhetorical flourishes, like his recent comparison of Senate debate to the argument among warring factions in Gulliver’s Travels over which end of the boiled egg to crack first before eating. To join a club and immediately use it as a foil is seen as bad manners by Senate veterans. To portray your colleagues as sniveling weasels is seen as bad form. And, as one longtime Senate aide pointed out, it’s also probably worth pausing before telling John McCain you’re the one fighting for liberty when McCain actually did. Cruz is at liberty to be himself because he doesn't need establishment Republicans; he can raise all the campaign cash he requires from the grass-roots. He doesn't need help from leadership to orchestrate votes that will help him with moderates in his state because there aren’t enough moderates in Texas to make it matter. Other Tea Party favorites such as Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin take a different approach. They will both be up for re-election in blue states in a presidential year, which means Democratic turnout will be high, so they'll need all the establishment help they can get (if they don't face a Tea Party primary first). These senators are counter-examples to Cruz and company: principled conservatives who aren’t irritating their colleagues. In the old Senate, Cruz would have curbed his enthusiasm because he might have wanted to bring pork home to his state and he’d need help from his colleagues to do that. Earmarks are now mostly gone. But there are still dangers lurking for Cruz and others in the purity caucus. Though Barack Obama moved through the Senate quickly, he used it as a platform for bipartisan platform building. That’s what you need to do to win a national election in a diverse country. Cruz is pursuing the opposite strategy. It may win him cheers at home, but that puts him on track toward becoming this generation's Phil Gramm, the Texas senator whose effort to build a conservative platform from within the Senate made him unappealing as a national candidate. Fellow conservatives worry that Cruz in particular, and Paul and Lee to a lesser extent, are harming the conservative brand. As a talented speaker with a knack for the limelight—who is now getting invitations to key primary states—Cruz gets media attention which elevates his clashes. When he treats a respected veteran senator like Dianne Feinstein like a dope, it makes all conservatives look bad. This isn't just about image. More established Republican senators argue that there are strategic downsides to the behavior of the firebrand freshmen. During the debate over gun control, the Wall Street Journal criticized Cruz, Paul, and Lee for giving Democrats a tactical victory by threatening a grandstanding filibuster. Cruz then earned a second critique from the Journal for overplaying his role and portraying himself in a way that belittled others in the cause: "Normally we'd ignore this insider politics, but Senators Cruz and Paul have been declaring for all to hear that they and a few others are the only conservatives of principle in politics." The nightmare scenario that one Republican aide paints is that Cruz, Paul, and Lee allow Democrats to portray the party as hopelessly obstructionist and use it to make the public case for the "nuclear option," a procedural move that would allow Democrats to override the filibuster with simple majority votes. If this extreme scenario came to pass, it would dilute the power of all Republican senators because they would effectively lose the power to filibuster. At issue in the marching career of Ted Cruz is whether nodding to the niceties of the Senate is an act of capitulation or a requirement if you are hoping to score long-term victories. I spoke to Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma this week about a wide variety of topics. He is as principled a conservative as you can find in the Senate, and he is more eloquent than Cruz about the venality of career politicians. But Coburn can also talk about the power of human relationships in politics in a way that seems antithetical to the brand of politics pursued by Cruz. "Relationships are how deals get done," said Coburn, who in this case was talking about President Obama. He's been friendly with Obama since 2005, the year they both arrived in the Senate. This is a constant source of confusion for Coburn’s constituents. "The No. 1 question I get at home is: Why are you friends with Barack Obama?" Coburn's answer, as Obama wrote in his essay about him for Time, is, “How better to influence somebody than to love them?” It's hard to imagine Ted Cruz talking that way.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1369528317221</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 20:31:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369529146970-34</Id><Topic><Title>Barack Obama Is A Winner</Title><Username>sir_paul_mccartney777</Username><Timestamp>1369520943386</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 18:29:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"That's right because he cheats."
