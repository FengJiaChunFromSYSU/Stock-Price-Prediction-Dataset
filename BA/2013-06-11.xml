Airbus was up 150% for 5 years a few weeks ago now Airbus is up 170% , Boeing trend is down now for 5 years Boeing is up less at 38%. I posted the ACAD stock several months ago at a gain of 60%, several months ago. If the over confident, Boeing hacks and trolls would have dropped their over confidence and ego involvement instead just read a stock chart, about Boeing it would be clear the Boeing stock chart did not compare favorably with ACAD. If the BHT had read both charts without over confidence and ego involvement in Boeing , they would have invested in ACAD and they would be up 320% on ACAD and another 100% on my 16 days post on TSLA so on 200k in just a few months the over confident Boeing hacks and trolls would have made 100% gain on TSLA and I told them to sell on the short squeeze . right at day 16 past may 3 at 100% profit too. so the 200k would be 400k . next they could have put the 400k into ACAD and have gained another 300%on the proceeds of the TSLA gain and now would be siting on $1,200,000 . Instead the BHT have gained only 35% on the same 200k or not 1.2 million dolars instead only 70 thousand dollars . Over confidence in Boeing is not good for their back pocket is it. Now you really need to look up SBT wow that is the big one coming your way . It will make TSLA and ACAD look small going forward SBT!!!</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370941385197</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 05:03:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370941581884-9</Id><Topic><Title>787, the numbers 30 billion, 150 million, 5% profit = 4000 planes , 34 years , orders so far 890</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370794141201</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 12:09:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well Boeing is down for the day and the reason is the disaster of the cost and delay on the plane Boeing is pinning its 15 year forward looking hope on the 787 no surprise 30 billion in the hole and no way to make a Penney for 34 years</Msg><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370941581884</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 05:06:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370941641321-10</Id><Topic><Title>88 IRS agents should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law all doing major time</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1370215723311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 19:28:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"so liberals aren't tax dodgers, just the Conservatives?"

But it’s never been truly functional. What happened? Recommended by the 9/11 Commission, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board began life as an agency within the Executive Office of the President. The concept: a bipartisan, civilian group that would advise and report on the administration’s protection of privacy and civil liberties. After delays in nominating and confirming the five members (a running theme in the PCLOB’s history) the board finally met in early 2006. But the underfunded board was criticized from the get-go as little more than an appendage of the presidency. Its first report to Congress was heavily edited by administration officials, inspiring Democrat Lanny Davis to quit in protest. In response, Congress passed legislation in 2007 transforming the PCLOB into an independent agency. It also expanded the board’s mandate to reviewing the actions of Congress as well as the White House and gained subpoena power. And then… nothing happened. President Bush nominated three board members in early 2008. Congressional Democrats proposed two names; Bush accepted only one, and in retaliation the Senate refused to move on any of Bush’s nominees.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1370958209582</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:43:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370958243930-36</Id><Topic><Title>Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board !</Title><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1370958209582</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:43:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>President Obama came into office and fared no better. He didn’t nominate a full slate to the board until December 2011. “We did not expect it to be the first set of nominations he made… but we were very disappointed that it took as long as it did to get those nominations,” said Sharon Bradford Franklin, senior counsel at the Constitution Project, a legal watchdog. Then Obama’s nominee for chairman, David Medine, was held up by Republicans in the Senate for over a year. Among other things, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) faulted Medine for refusing to say whether or not the country is engaged in a “war on terrorism.” Without a chairman, the board couldn’t hire staff and had no full-time members. Medine was finally confirmed last month, and he’s still putting the wheels in motion; the board doesn’t even have a website yet. Now, at last, the board might actually function as the commission intended. “It’s too soon to figure out or to know how that body is going to work and when it will be effective,” said Michelle Richardson, a legislative counsel for the ACLU. At a public hearing, the board said it planned to focus on FISA and cybersecurity. In the wake of last week’s revelations, Medine has asked National Intelligence Director James Clapper for a classified briefing “as soon as possible” on the surveillance programs collecting phone and email records. Not bad for a board almost no one knows exists.</Msg><Username>stick.man007</Username><Timestamp>1370958243930</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:44:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370958323831-37</Id><Topic><Title>Stats for PC White Liberals</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1370889885326</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 14:44:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>albucucu .......you're a victim of socialized government education aren't you?</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1370958323831</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:45:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370959006980-38</Id><Title>rockstar doesn't think we've lost any Liberty.</Title><Msg>70,000 pages of IRS rules and regulations the tell us what we can and can't do with our own money, 43,000 pages of rules and regulations that tell the things individuals, doctors and hospitals can't do regarding our health care, 94,000 pages of EPA rules and regulations telling you how you cannot use your own property and rocks4brains doesn't think we're losing any of our liberties.</Msg><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1370959006980</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:56:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370959077810-39</Id><Topic><Title>It Doesn't Seem to Matter How mush a Democrat Politician Screws Up......</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1370956672157</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:17:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama Care is the only facility available where mental defectives such as yourself will be able to get insurance.

The Shadow Party was conceived and organized principally by George Soros, Hillary Clinton and Harold McEwan Ickes… "The Shadow Party is the real power driving the Democrat machine. It is a network of radicals dedicated to transforming our constitutional republic into a socialist hive. The leader of these radicals is ... George Soros. He has essentially privatized the Democratic Party, bringing it under his personal control. The Shadow Party is the instrument through which he exerts that control. ... It works by siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions that would have gone to the Democratic Party in normal times, and putting those contributions at the personal disposal of Mr. Soros. He then uses that money to buy influence and loyalty where he sees fit. In 2003, Soros set up a network of privately-owned groups which acts as a shadow or mirror image of the Party. It performs all the functions we would normally expect the real Democratic Party to perform, such as shaping the Party platform, fielding candidates, running campaigns, and so forth. However, it performs these functions under the private supervision of Mr. Soros and his associates. The Shadow Party derives its power from its ability to raise huge sums of money. By controlling the Democrat purse strings, the Shadow Party can make or break any Democrat candidate by deciding whether or not to fund him. During the 2004 election cycle, the Shadow Party raised more than $300 million for Democrat candidates, prompting one of its operatives, MoveOn PAC director Eli Pariser, to declare, “Now it’s our party. We bought it, we own it…”"”</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1370960383680</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 10:19:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370960619864-44</Id><Topic><Title>Stats for PC White Liberals</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1370889885326</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 14:44:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep, your race card/victim status wore out a long time ago</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1370960619864</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 10:23:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370961132434-45</Id><Topic><Title>rockstar doesn't think we've lost any Liberty.</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1370959006980</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:56:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well until you can name a liberty you have lost you`re full of nothing but hate for you fellow Americans. and you sound as if you support the terrorist with some of the nonsense you folks are spewing these days. you pay taxes to be a member of society if you have a problem with that you`re welcome to leave this society at anytime.</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1370961132434</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 10:32:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370961421955-46</Id><Topic><Title>rockstar doesn't think we've lost any Liberty.</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1370959006980</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:56:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep, why am i forced to pay for your care and feeding?</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1370961421955</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 10:37:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370962037091-47</Id><Topic><Title>rockstar doesn't think we've lost any Liberty.</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1370959006980</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:56:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To keep the animals at bay.</Msg><Username>freeveritas</Username><Timestamp>1370962037091</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 10:47:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370963314997-48</Id><Topic><Title>rockstar doesn't think we've lost any Liberty.</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1370959006980</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:56:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sparty enrolled in the free lunch program long before the beginning of barack's great depression, he was taking full advantage of free stuff at full employment levels (4-5%), dumbos have rendered a number of our citizens unemployable.</Msg><Username>censored50</Username><Timestamp>1370963314997</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 11:08:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370964453912-49</Id><Topic><Title>rockstar doesn't think we've lost any Liberty.</Title><Username>pay4ityourself</Username><Timestamp>1370959006980</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:56:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you don`t pay for anything of mine sorry you have been misled</Msg><Username>rockstar80333</Username><Timestamp>1370964453912</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 11:27:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370964525717-50</Id><Title>BOEINGS HITTING A NEW HIGH TODAY$$$$$</Title><Msg>This Company will be Rocking into the 2020$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>tucsonlighting747</Username><Timestamp>1370964525717</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 11:28:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370964830571-51</Id><Topic><Title>787, the numbers 30 billion, 150 million, 5% profit = 4000 planes , 34 years , orders so far 890</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1370794141201</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 12:09:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Didn't your earlier posts say you recommonded TSLA back inJan?

The 59-year-old has an annual salary of $52,700, gets five weeks of vacation a year, and is looking forward to retiring on the sizable nest egg in his 401(k), which his employer augments with matching funds. After 26 years at his company, he’s not worried about layoffs. In 2009, as the recession deepened, his bosses handed out raises. “I’m just grateful to come here to work every day,” he says. This wouldn’t be remarkable except that Carcello works in retail, one of the stingiest industries in America, with some of the most dissatisfied workers. On May 29, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) employees in Miami, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area began a weeklong strike. (A Walmart spokesman told MSNBC the strike was a “publicity stunt.”) Workers at an Amazon (AMZN) fulfillment center in Leipzig, Germany, also recently held strikes to demand higher pay and better benefits. (An Amazon spokesman says its employees earn more than the average warehouse worker.) In its 30-year history, Carcello’s employer, Costco, has never had significant labor troubles.</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1370977586747</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 15:06:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370977667812-79</Id><Topic><Title>Why Wall Street HATES Costco (but LOVES Mal*Mart)</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1370977586747</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 15:06:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pt2 Costco Wholesale (COST), the second-largest retailer in the U.S. behind Walmart, is an anomaly in an age marked by turmoil and downsizing. Known for its $55-a-year membership fee and its massive, austere warehouses stocked floor to ceiling with indulgent portions of everything from tilapia to toilet paper, Costco has thrived over the last five years. While competitors lost customers to the Internet and weathered a wave of investor pessimism, Costco’s sales have grown 39 percent and its stock price has doubled since 2009. The hot streak continued through last year’s retirement of widely admired co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jim Sinegal. The share price is up 30 percent under the leadership of its new, plain-spoken CEO, Craig Jelinek. Despite the sagging economy and challenges to the industry, Costco pays its hourly workers an average of $20.89 an hour, not including overtime (vs. the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour). By comparison, Walmart said its average wage for full-time employees in the U.S. is $12.67 an hour, according to a letter it sent in April to activist Ralph Nader. Eighty-eight percent of Costco employees have company-sponsored health insurance; Walmart says that “more than half” of its do. Costco workers with coverage pay premiums that amount to less than 10 percent of the overall cost of their plans. It treats its employees well in the belief that a happier work environment will result in a more profitable company. “I just think people need to make a living wage with health benefits,” says Jelinek. “It also puts more money back into the economy and creates a healthier country. It’s really that simple.”</Msg><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1370977667812</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 15:07:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370977712875-80</Id><Topic><Title>Why Wall Street HATES Costco (but LOVES Mal*Mart)</Title><Username>randroids</Username><Timestamp>1370977586747</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 15:06:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In February, Jelinek set Costco’s convictions in ink, writing a public letter at the behest of Nader, urging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage for the first time since 2009. “We know it’s a lot more profitable in the long term to minimize employee turnover and maximize employee productivity, commitment and loyalty,” he wrote. The letter barely moved the needle. Although President Obama echoed Jelinek’s sentiment and called for a $9-an-hour wage in his State of the Union address, Congress is deadlocked on the issue. But Jelinek’s letter had a secondary effect. It cast a brighter light on Costco’s philosophy and created a stark contrast with its competitors. That juxtaposition raises an important question: Can the rest of corporate America become more like Costco? Or will Costco, buffeted by the same disruptive changes affecting all of retail, be forced to become more like everyone else?

Most doc dropping insurance are dropping insurance because of dwindling re-imbursement while they see health iinsurance companies executives and CEO's making millions and the stock value spiking ever higher. The Affordable Healthcare Act will allow anyone without insurance to have insurance and so they don't get whipped out financially when wife finds cancer lump in breast or husband finds bloody stools. Yes, its all about that and much more. No-one can force a doctor to take insurance unless there is a tax bomb involved for the consequences. The FDA thugs are making more and more doc's move their practice outside the borders of the US to practice good medicine that is already been in use for 10 years in Europe.

This is a near perfect “apples to apples” comparison of administrative costs, because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are operating under similar rules and treating the same population. (And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans: A recent General Accounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent of their revenue on medical expenses, with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and 6.6 percent to profits—a 16.7 percent administrative share.) And:According to CMS, for common benefits, Medicare spending rose by an average of 4.3 percent each year between 1997 and 2009, while private insurance premiums grew at a rate of 6.5 percent per year. (See Table 13) According to a calculation by the National Academy for Social Insurance, if spending on Medicare rose at the same rate as private insurance premiums during that period, Medicare would have cost an additional $114 billion (or 31.7 percent).</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1370990882722</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 18:48:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370992463781-108</Id><Topic><Title>Cash-only doctors abandon the insurance system</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1370951726686</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 07:55:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>counting the wrong beans.

They still don't get it Michael Lind My previous Salon essay, in which I asked why there are not any libertarian countries, if libertarianism is a sound political philosophy, has infuriated members of the tiny but noisy libertarian sect, as criticisms of cults by outsiders usually do. The weak logic and bad scholarship that suffuse libertarian responses to my article tend to reinforce me in my view that, if they were not paid so well to churn out anti-government propaganda by plutocrats like the Koch brothers and various self-interested corporations, libertarians would play no greater role in public debate than do the followers of Lyndon LaRouche or L. Ron Hubbard. An unscientific survey of the blogosphere turns up a number of libertarians claiming in response to my essay that, because libertarianism is anti-statist, to ask for an example of a real-world libertarian state shows a failure to understand libertarianism. But if the libertarian ideal is a stateless society, then libertarianism is merely a different name for utopian anarchism and deserves to be similarly ignored. Another response to my essay has been to claim that a libertarian country really did exist once in the real world, in the form of the United States between Reconstruction and the New Deal. Robert Tracinski writes that I am “astonishingly ignorant of history” for failing to note that the “libertarian utopia, or the closest we’ve come to it, is America itself, up to about 100 years ago. It was a country with no income tax and no central bank. (It was on the gold standard, for crying out loud. You can’t get more libertarian than that.) It had few economic regulations and was still in the Lochner era, when such regulations were routinely struck down by the Supreme Court. There was no federal welfare state, no Social Security, no Medicare.” It is Tracinski who is astonishingly ignorant of history. To begin with, the majority of the countries that adopted the “libertarian” gold standard were authoritarian monarchies or military dictatorships. With the exception of Imperial Britain, an authoritarian government outside of the home islands, where most Britons were denied the vote for most of this period, most of the independent countries of the pre-World War I gold standard epoch, including the U.S., Germany, France, Russia and many Latin American republics, rejected free trade in favor of varying degrees of economic protectionism. For its part, the U.S. between Lincoln and FDR was hardly laissez-faire. Ever since colonial times, states had engaged in public poor relief and sometimes created public hospitals and asylums. Tracinski to the contrary, there were also two massive federal welfare programs before the New Deal: the Homestead Act, a colossal redistribution of government land to farmers, and generous pension benefits for Union veterans of the Civil War and their families. Much earlier, the 1798 act that taxed sailors to fund a small system of government-run sailors’ hospitals was supported by Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton alike. State and local licensing rules and trade laws governed economic life in detail, down to the size of spigots in wine casks, in some cases. It was precisely these state and local regulations that the Supreme Court struck down, in Lochner v. New York (1905) and other cases, to promote the goal of creating a single national market. At the same time, sharing their racism with most white Americans, federal judges in Tracinski’s “libertarian” America permitted the most massive system of labor market distortion of all: racial segregation, which artificially boosted the incomes and property values of whites. The single national market that Lochner-era courts sought to protect from being Balkanized by state and local regulations (other than racial segregation) was walled off by the highest protective tariffs of any major industrial nation. The U.S. government between Lincoln and FDR engaged in a version of modern East Asian-style mercantilism, protecting American industrial corporations from import competition, while showering subsidies including land grants on railroad companies and using federal troops to crush protesting workers. This government-business mercantilism was anti-worker but it was hardly libertarian. High tariffs to protect American companies in Tracinski’s alleged Golden Age of American libertarianism were joined by racist immigration restrictions that further boosted the incomes of white workers already boosted by de jure or de facto racial segregation. The 1790 Naturalization Act barred immigrants from becoming citizens unless they were “free white persons” and had to be amended by the 1870 Naturalization Act to bestow citizenship on former slaves of “African nativity” and “African descent.” Although the Supreme Court in 1898 ruled that the children of Asians born in the U.S. were citizens by birth, Tracinski’s libertarian utopia was characterized by increasingly restrictive immigration laws which curtailed first Asian immigration and then, after World War I, most European immigration. Calvin Coolidge, the subject of a hero-worshiping new biography by the libertarian conservative Amity Shlaes, defended both high tariffs and restrictive immigration. Here is an excerpt from President Coolidge’s second annual address in 1924: Two very important policies have been adopted by this country which, while extending their benefits also in other directions, have been of the utmost importance to the wage earners. One of these is the protective tariff, which enables our people to live according to a better standard and receive a better rate of compensation than any people, any time, anywhere on earth, ever enjoyed. This saves the American market for the products of the American workmen. The other is a policy of more recent origin and seeks to shield our wage earners from the disastrous competition of a great influx of foreign peoples. This has been done by the restrictive immigration law. This saves the American job for the American workmen. In 1921 then vice-president Coolidge wrote an article entitled “Whose Country is This?” in Good Housekeeping, in which he declared: “Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend. The Nordics propagate themselves successfully. With other races, the outcome shows deterioration on both sides.” (Amity Shlaes’s hero evidently believed racist pseudoscience about dangerous and inferior “half-breeds”). Protectionist, nativist paleoconservatives of the Patrick Buchanan school might have reason to idealize the U.S. as it existed between 1865 and 1932. But libertarians who want to prove that a country based on libertarian ideology can exist in the real world cannot point to the United States at any period in its history from the Founding to the present.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1370993164442</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 19:26:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370993905973-112</Id><Topic><Title>Cash-only doctors abandon the insurance system</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1370951726686</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 07:55:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Medicare’s administrative costs were $8 billion in 2011, or 1.4 percent of total Medicare spending of $549 billion that year.

Now this is CBS reporting not Fox. CBS News' John Miller reports that according to an internal State Department Inspector General's memo, several recent investigations were influenced, manipulated, or simply called off. The memo obtained by CBS News cited eight specific examples. Among them: allegations that a State Department security official in Beirut "engaged in sexual assaults" on foreign nationals hired as embassy guards and the charge and that members of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's security detail "engaged prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries" -- a problem the report says was "endemic." The memo also reveals details about an "underground drug ring" was operating near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and supplied State Department security contractors with drugs. Aurelia Fedenisn, a former investigator with the State Department's internal watchdog agency, the Inspector General, told Miller, "We also uncovered several allegations of criminal wrongdoing in cases, some of which never became cases." In such cases, DSS agents told the Inspector General's investigators that senior State Department officials told them to back off, a charge that Fedenisn says is "very" upsetting.</Msg><Username>team_hozomeen</Username><Timestamp>1371007540290</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 23:25:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
