When water fre4ezes it expands. when sea ice melts, the volume of the iceberg declines. Melting sea ice will NOT cause the oceans to rise. And on the dark clothes versus white under the sun as in ashcanistan or sahara, lets not forget that at night- black clothes/surfaces radiate to the normally clear night sky- ( check out black body radiation issues ). It is not always true that black is bad in desert areas, even under the sun, especially when made of wool. Of course the bedouins do not understand this, thus they have been using dark colors for a few thousand years.

Fact 3) Energy, independent of the Federal government, is driving the economy and is leading us to being a net exporter. Fact 4) Obama made a major "global warming" speech attacking non-solar energy the other day. Fact 5) Obama said he will sidestep Congress in his quest to implement his "global warming" remedies that suppress non-solar/renewable energy. Fact Look.

On June 14, 2013 Dr. Briffa of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia made public an updated Yamal tree ring chronology. This updated chronology no longer supports the 'Hockey Stick' as the updated chronology of tree rings shows no temperature change from 1920 to today and states that over longer periods that there is no longer a high confidence that current temperatures are warmer than past temperatures. Here is a direct quote from the abstract published in the upcoming July 2013 Quaternary Science Reviews. In it the authors state: "There are numerous periods of one or two decades with relatively high growth (and inferred summer temperatures close to the 1961–1990 level) but at longer timescales only the 40-year period centered at 250 CE appears comparable with 20th century warmth. Although the central temperature estimate for this period is below that for the recent period, when we take into account the uncertainties we cannot be highly confident that recent warmth has exceeded the temperature of this earlier warm period." I'm sure the usual aliases will respond with their usual anti-scientific attack of the messenger, but I know there are some here who are interested in the actual science and may want to access all data and code used in the updated chronology at the CRU web site. Use the search term "Reassessing the evidence for tree-growth and inferred temperature change during the Common Era in Yamalia, northwest Siberia". The first hit will be the actual paper published in the July 2013 Quaternary Science Reviews and the second hit is the CRU web site with all the data.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372514834084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 10:07:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372516438818-12</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Hockey Stick No longer Supported By CRU/Briffa Tree Ring Data</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372514834084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 10:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Aha.

How did you completely miss that part? Yes it is "likely" warmer (barely so) but the confidence level is NOT HIGH! I have written here before the uncertainty levels in the science have been increasing because of the divergence between modeled data and measured data and this is further proof from the leading climate scientists that with this updated chronology, they have lees confidence now than before. Again my. It can't be any clearer to those interested in science rather than politics. The most damaging aspect is in Figure 2 of the study which shows that the new tree chronology has no warming signal from 1920 to present.</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372528516950</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 13:55:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372528664768-20</Id><Topic><Title>How does Evolution explain Gayness?</Title><Username>rebel2rouse</Username><Timestamp>1372440974476</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 13:36:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes; it's what happens when posters use such vile words so frequently that someone thinks we ought to have computers censor us.

He said, and this is about the Voting Rights Act. He said, ‘Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political process.’ Just the fact that he talks about black people voting as an entitlement, that is so much more racist than anything Paula Deen ever said. And I don’t know why I have become the champion of Paula Deen. I didn’t even know who this person was a year ago. I thought it was Tammy Faye Baker if you had shown me a picture of her. But I mean, Donald Trump is a worst racist, but he doesn’t say the N-word. We have replaced having a conversation about race, with oh, okay, liberals feel good about themselves if they make the bad person go away. Who’s the bad person? The one we caught saying that one word. Donald Trump is a worse racist, but he gets to keep his show because he never said the word. Sarah Palin is a worse racist. She said Obama was shucking and jiving his way to victory. Newt Gingrich said he was the food stamp president. This is real racism. Whether it is Paula Deen, Donald Trump, Antonin Scalia or Sarah Palin, all their racism comes from the same belief that African-Americans are inferior. It all comes from the same place of discrimination against an individual or a group of people based on their membership in a group or category. There is no such thing as real and unreal racism. Maher appeared to upset by the fact that Paula Deen gets punished while racists like Trump and Palin get to continue to keep their positions on television. Is the difference the fact that Deen admitted to using the N-word? There is more to it than that. In her deposition Deen mentioned the idea for a “slave wedding,” and there is a self admitted pattern of racist beliefs that is impossible to overlook. Paula Deen has never fully seemed to realize that her attitudes are wrong. She may not be a mean spirited person, but she has adopted a defiant attitude about her straight out of Jim Crow beliefs. The reality is that racism is racism. Maher was correct about Palin, Scalia and Trump, but I think something that he said earlier in the segment is the real reason why Deen is punished while the other raging racists continue to spew their hate. By using the N-word, Deen was practicing Racism 1.0. Trump, Scalia Palin and Gingrich have moved on to Racism 2.0. Racism 2.0 is in some ways worse that the original because it is subtle. It is hidden in language that makes it seem like anything but discrimination. Whereas Paula Deen’s old school racism is easily spotted and rejected, the new version is much easier to slip into our national subconscious. The American people know Racism 1.0 (Paul Deen style) when they see it, and they don’t like it. Many Americans haven’t learned to recognize, or don’t want to face the reality of, Racism 2.0 (Trump, Palin, Scalia, Gingrich style). Bill Maher was right to call out the new form or racism, but wrong to try to split the two. America is now wise enough to punish Paula Deen’s racism, but Donald Trump, Sarah Palin, and the new breed of racism need to held to the same standard. Despite what the Supreme Court believes, racism is alive and well. Our goal shouldn’t be to rank the degrees of racism, but to eliminate it all.</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372531108323</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 14:38:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372531584732-23</Id><Title>Scientists will challenge Obama's calculation on the social cost of carbon</Title><Msg>Recently one of the world's most published and well known scientists on storm damage costs challenged Obama's calculations on the social costs of CO2 offering to debate anyone willing to defend Obama's claims.

Are there any heretics throughout history that weren't hated?</Msg><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372535525138</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 15:52:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372536232155-31</Id><Topic><Title>Climate Hockey Stick No longer Supported By CRU/Briffa Tree Ring Data</Title><Username>ali_infesto</Username><Timestamp>1372514834084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 10:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IOW, you're a case of arrested development stuck in the attitudes of a boy experiencing puberty.

It reinforces that past warming was not just weather and that 40 years of data indicates a warm climate event.

White grievance-mongers, that’s who By Joan Walsh Finally people on the right have begun to see that there may be an aspect of racism at the heart of the Trayvon Martin case – and predictably, it’s against accused killer George Zimmerman. On Wednesday prosecution witness Rachel Jeantel, who was on her cellphone with Martin while he was being pursued by Zimmerman, actually testified that Martin told her he was being followed by “a creepy #$%$ cracker.” But it wasn’t until Thursday that it blew up the right wing of the Internet – when Jeantel offered the badgering defense attorney Don West her opinion that the term isn’t racist. From Glenn Beck’s the Blaze to the Breitbots to smaller right-wing shriekers to Twitter trolls everywhere, white grievance-mongers seemed less bothered by the fact that Martin allegedly used the term, than by Jeantel saying it wasn’t a slur. For the record: I have been known to say “Jesus Christ on a cracker,” and I want to make clear I am not praying for the Son of God to jump a white person. My God, don’t these people get tired of themselves? So much of the trumped-up racial upset on the right, generally, is about language: If black people can use the N-word, why can’t we? (Even Paula Deen tried to use that as self-defense at first.) Now we’re moving on to: If the N-word is racist and forbidden, words like “cracker” should be, too. But “cracker” has never had the same power to demean, or to exile, or to sting. No social order has ever been devised whereby African-Americans oppress people they deride as “crackers.” We don’t even really know where the term comes from. I’ve seen it suggested that enslaved black people invented it because of the “crack” of the slavemaster’s whip, but it was used by planter cl#$%$ elites to describe the hardscrabble Scots-Irish dating back to the late 18thcentury. (Both meanings could be true.) If it’s demeaning at all — and some white Southerners have embraced it — it derives from white-on-white snobbery. But like most discussions of white cl#$%$ distinctions in this country, this one will be preempted … because black racism! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Still, I’m not sure why Zimmerman defense attorney Don West zeroed in on Martin’s use of the term, or even less relevant, what Jeantel thought it meant. (For the record, she seemed to focus on the “crazy #$%$” part and said she thought Martin was trying to describe a “pervert” pursuing him, which is why she said she told him to run away.) Those shocked by the fact that she didn’t see a racial slur in Martin calling Zimmerman “cracker” might note that she also said her friend told her “the #$%$ is behind me,” right before Zimmerman caught up to Martin. Maybe that proves Martin is the real racist! On the week that the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act because we’ve supposedly come so far in eradicating racism, there’s a perverse kind of political poetry in the outcry on the right over the use of the word “cracker” here. Let’s remember: a white and Latino man is on trial for killing a young black man, in a clash that began because the white/Latino man thought the black man was hanging around someplace where he didn’t belong, looking “like he’s up to no good.” But let’s freak out over the victim reportedly describing the accused as a “cracker.” Crackers, please …</Msg><Username>hoozdik_hertz_557</Username><Timestamp>1372549670145</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 19:47:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372549821798-39</Id><Topic><Title>One of the few stocks so solid you don't have to worry each day</Title><Username>rs2ms2ts2ks72</Username><Timestamp>1372539657202</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 17:00:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You listen to Jim Crammer---I don't have the time.

It is amusing that those that protest the racism of the "N" word are OK with other forms of denigration, such as "cracker" - as if we can also differentiate between rape and incest and assign a scale of OK'ness or NOT-OK'ness. Bad behavior is bad behavior. I am so glad that the Lord made the issue of sin an easy one - everyone is a sinner and even the lying that these people do to themselves is just as damning as murder when it comes to being condemned for eternity and the need to be saved, the solution which is freely found in John3:18.
