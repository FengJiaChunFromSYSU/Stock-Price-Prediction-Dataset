It is true that there are some small motors out there that ethanol is harmful to, but other than that it is invaluable to the energy sector. It is in almost all passenger vehicle fuel, replacing the carcinogenic additive from the benzene family, as an octane enhancer.

Replacing fossil fuels with bio- energy does not by itself reduce carbon emissions, because the CO2 released by tail- pipes and smokestacks is roughly the same per unit of energy regardless of the source ( 1, 5). Emissions from producing and/or reﬁning biofuels also typically exceed those for petroleum ( 1, 6). Bioenergy therefore reduces greenhouse emissions only if the growth and harvesting of the biomass for energy captures carbon above and beyond what would be sequestered anyway and thereby offsets emissions from energy use. This additional carbon may result from land management changes that increase plant uptake or from the use of biomass that would otherwise decompose rapidly. Assessing such carbon gains requires the same accounting principles used to assign credits for other land-based carbon offsets. - TD Searchinger ______________________________________________ I plan to keep you informed as even environmental groups are beginning to see the global damage that corn based ethanol has wrought on the poor.

First the energy returned on energy invested EROEI is the lowest of all energy sources 1.3 which is not economically viable without government subsidies (there is some dispute with values as high as 1.9 but 5 is considered break even). Second: from Scientific American (Princeton and U of Minn): Converting corn to ethanol in Iowa not only leads to clearing more of the Amazonian rainforest, researchers report in a pair of new studies in Science, but also would do little to slow global warming—and often make it worse. Tilman and his colleagues examined the overall CO2 released when land use changes occur. Converting the grasslands of the U.S. to grow corn results in excess greenhouse gas emissions of 134 metric tons of CO2 per hectare—a debt that would take 93 years to repay by replacing gasoline with corn-based ethanol. And converting jungles to palm plantations or tropical rainforest to soy fields would take centuries to pay back their carbon debts. "Any biofuel that causes land clearing is likely to increase global warming," says ecologist Joseph Fargione of The Nature Conservancy, lead author of the second study. "It takes decades to centuries to repay the carbon debt that is created from clearing land." Diverting food crops into fuel production leads to ever more land clearing as well. Ethanol demand in the U.S., for example, has caused some farmers to plant more corn and less soy. This has driven up soy prices causing farmers in Brazil to clear more Amazon rainforest land to plant valuable soy, Searchinger's study notes. Because a soy field contains far less carbon than a rainforest, the greenhouse gas benefit of the original ethanol is wiped out. "Corn-based ethanol, instead of producing a 20 percent savings [in greenhouse gas emissions], nearly doubles greenhouse emissions over 30 years and increases greenhouse gases for 167 years," the researchers write.</Msg><Username>techpath2000</Username><Timestamp>1372704353496</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 14:45:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372704374394-53</Id><Topic><Title>NFL: We Decline to Help Promote Obamacare</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1372700692835</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:44:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that a proposition?

Snowden was made the bad guy for violating laws. No mention was made that Snowden ultimate boss James Clapper Jr. director of National Intelligence for misleading the Congressional oversight committee when asked about if the NSA collects any data on millions of Americans. It was only after Snowden revelations that Mr. Clapper admitted that he was sorry to have mislead Congress. That is why Snowden is a whistle blower if the boss lies, how can he got the truth out about lies to Congress. Then Snowden was faced with the issue had the NSA exceeded its mandate to go mainly after terrorists by acting as if it was the CIA or FBI. I am sure he felt his boss was out of control by spying on our allies Germany and French embassies in Washington and many European government offices, supposedly our friends and treating them like enemies. Mr Snowden believed his ill gotten information brought to light would stop the lies and bring about fair dealing with our allies. Isn't that we all expect from government to conduct our business with allies honestly and to have our Congress now the truth on how the executive branch carries out its business.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1372709043077</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 16:04:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372709138087-65</Id><Topic><Title>Boeing stock up 2.5% this week, and what's your point ?</Title><Username>waynedickenson961</Username><Timestamp>1372558853706</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 22:20:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wayne doesn't even use the accepted symbol for EADS.

Gillard executed a ruthless intra-party coup against Rudd in 2010 -- now he's returned the unwelcome favor. Both are members of the embattled left-wing Labor Party, which has been lagging behind in polls for months: Kevin Rudd has ousted Prime Minister Julia Gillard as leader of Australia's Labor Party. He won by 57 votes to 45, in a leadership ballot of Labor lawmakers. The change comes ahead of a general election due in September, which polls suggest Labor is set to lose. This is the latest twist in a long and bitter rivalry between the two politicians - but it could be the last as Ms Gillard has said she will now leave politics. "I will not re-contest the federal electorate... at the forthcoming election," said Ms Gillard, Australia's first female prime minister. As the conservative opposition -- led by the Liberal Party's Tony Abbott -- accumulated its sizable lead, Gillard turned to a full-blown "war on women" narrative in an attempt to salvage her fate. Her cynical plot failed spectacularly:</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1372711214003</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 16:40:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372712012135-70</Id><Topic><Title>150 Years ago today</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1372698303554</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:05:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And yet the first draft in the history of the United States was instituted in the confederacy.

But we should remind ourselves that it's very possible these same Syrian rebels will be the beneficiary of American arms in the next few weeks. The Vatican is confirming the death by beheading of Franciscan Father, Francois Murad, who was martyred by Syrian jihadists on June 23. Below is the news release from the Vatican, via news.va. On Sunday, June 23 the Syrian priest François Murad was killed in Gassanieh, in northern Syria, in the convent of the Custody of the Holy Land where he had taken refuge. This is confirmed by a statement of the Custos of the Holy Land sent to Fides Agency. The circumstances of the death are not fully understood. According to local sources, the monastery where Fr. Murad was staying was attacked by militants linked to the jihadi group Jabhat al-Nusra. Father François, 49, had taken the first steps in the religious life with the Franciscan Friars of the Custody of the Holy Land, and with them he continued to share close bonds of spiritual friendship. After being ordained a priest he had started the construction of a coenobitic monastery dedicated to St. Simon Stylites in the village of Gassanieh.After the start of the Civil War, the monastery of St. Simon had been bombed and Fr. Murad had moved to the convent of the Custody for safety reasons and to give support to the remaining few, along with another religious and nuns of the Rosary.</Msg><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1372712055879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 16:54:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372712362804-72</Id><Topic><Title>Seeing the Unseen or That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen</Title><Username>mir_roguns</Username><Timestamp>1372707681692</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 15:41:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I`m Rich and think you`re full of sh lt to your eyeballs.

The defense hasn't even provided their case yet.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1372725753853</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 20:42:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372726016913-93</Id><Topic><Title>Waynedick..mystery of the ages...............</Title><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1372721157594</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 19:25:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thats why he is called galapagos waynedick...his best friend is iguana fred...!</Msg><Username>domerrrrr45</Username><Timestamp>1372726016913</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 20:46:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372726809624-94</Id><Title>TRACKING EVERY 787 AROUND THE WORLD</Title><Msg>BA has worked with google and if you go to flighttracker newairplane you can see it all. takes a while to load depending on your internet speed neato!</Msg><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1372726809624</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 21:00:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372727846746-95</Id><Topic><Title>Why Won't they Just Let Zimmerman Go?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1372714867302</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 17:41:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing.</Msg><Username>poordumbbastard</Username><Timestamp>1372727846746</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 21:17:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372729148093-96</Id><Topic><Title>TRACKING EVERY 787 AROUND THE WORLD</Title><Username>donwshuper50</Username><Timestamp>1372726809624</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 21:00:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can get to feature if you go to Boeings website and track 787's</Msg><Username>falmouthharbor</Username><Timestamp>1372729148093</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 21:39:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372732009750-97</Id><Topic><Title>Catholic Priest Beheaded By Syrian 'Rebels'...</Title><Username>x6xxx234</Username><Timestamp>1372688792626</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 10:26:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Syria is Syria, but take a look at Egypt tonight.</Msg><Username>albucucu</Username><Timestamp>1372732009750</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 22:26:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372735815143-98</Id><Topic><Title>How much does a thief have to steal to be a thief?</Title><Username>hope4whitepeoples</Username><Timestamp>1372715271431</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 17:47:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Joe Some type of higher power undoubtedly loves you and NEVER forget to keep campaigning, especially IN WRITING. You are a precious resource. Probably not for your own candidate, but . . . . The only suggestion here is try to get your money back for whatever schooling you undertook.</Msg><Username>georgewbushisachickenhawk</Username><Timestamp>1372735815143</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 23:30:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
