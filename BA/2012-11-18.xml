NON UNION!!! Next week may be Black Friday but sweets lovers across the nation hung their heads in sorrow on a dark Friday yesterday as Hostess announced they would cease making their line of products, which include the iconic Twinkies brand, because of the Bakers Union Strike. But now as the brand heads toward liquidating and selling off its assets, a Mexican company may be angling to resurrect the golden Twinkies. According to the Christian Science Monitor, while food producers ConAgra and Flowers Food, the American company behind Nature Valley granola, have expressed interest along with Little Debbie baker McKee Foods, Mexico’s Grupo Bimbo may hold the inside track. Grupo Bimbo is the world’s largest bread baking firm, which already owns parts of Sara Lee, Entenmann’s and Thomas English Muffins and previously made what was considered a low-ball offer of $580 million a few years ago, Forbes reports. Now Hostess may only be worth $135 million. Economists say high sugar prices tied to US trade tariffs were a big reason Hostess was struggling, but a Mexican company could be a lifeline for Twinkies because it would be able to take advantage of access to lower-priced sugar in Mexico. While Hostess was clearly struggling, analysts believed Grupo Bimbo had an eye on the company since the early 2000′s because it saw Hostess as a key ingredient for North American expansion with delivery routes that penetrated across the country into convenience stores, gas stations and grocery markets, according to Forbes. Daniel Servitje Montull runs Grupo Bimbo, which was founded by his family in 1954. His family is worth $4 billion. Servitje Montull, has already worked magic before, taking on Mexico’s tortilla market and positioning white bread in Latin America. If Grupo Bimbo pulls off a deal with Hostess for Twinkies, his next challenge will be resurrecting an American favorite.</Msg><Username>very_smart_voter</Username><Timestamp>1353262176670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 13:09:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353263557094-13</Id><Topic><Title>Willtard lost the black and hispanic vote as well as...</Title><Username>republicanfascists</Username><Timestamp>1353169505534</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 11:25:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe you should move there with the amount of help you are willing to provide or compromise.

"But with high brand recognition and $2.5 billion in revenue per year, other companies are interested in bidding for at least pieces of Hostess. Twinkies alone have brought in $68 million in revenue so far this year, which would look good to another snack-maker. "There's a huge amount of goodwill with the commercial brand name," said John Pottow, a University of Michigan Law School professor who specializes in bankruptcy. "It's quite conceivable that they can sell the name and recipe for Twinkies to a company that wants to make them." Hostess has said it's received inquiries about buying parts of the company. But spokesman Lance Ignon would not comment on analysts' reports that Thomasville, Ga.-based Flowers Foods Inc. and private equity food investment firm Metropoulos &amp; Co. are likely suitors. Metropoulos owns Pabst Brewing Co., while Flowers Foods makes Nature's Own bread, Tastykake treats and other baked goods. Messages were left for spokesmen for both companies on Sunday." Y.T.

But, I am trying to figure out why Hooz or any of his liberal minions that voted for Obama are here. (I am not worried about “black.mariah” as those are always nonsense posts that fall in line with the nonsense that we have been dealing with since 2008.) I can provide a perspective on Biblical teachings, but what can Hooz provide at this point? To now “worship” and “love” Obama - now that we are stuck with him for four more years? Hooz &amp; Co.’s goal to get Obama in office the second time has been accomplished. What Hooz and his collective ilk should be doing is fleeing from the board. They serve no purpose at this point. I was watching a business owner indicating that he was going to have to drop health care because he could not afford the version mandated by Obamacare AND it simply would be cheaper to “pay the penalty”. Those employees who then wind up without any healthcare, unless they go out and buy something on the market on their own, will have to also pay the government a penalty for not buying healthcare. So, Obama gets “penalties” from both directions, by the way from those least able to afford it, but he doesn’t have to provide anything other than blather and rhetoric – which is what we have come to expect. Then, there is Israel and Gaza. For those that just cannot believe that Obama is an “Isla…..” sympathizer, here is what the White House said recently: “Israel has the right to defend itself in any military manner that it sees fit” (the "public consumption") AND “Obama urged Israel not to invade Gaza” (in the confidential conversation with Israel's leadership). I won’t recite the usual expression employed for hypocrisy.</Msg><Username>bulky_bob</Username><Timestamp>1353297861565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 23:04:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353298169013-40</Id><Topic><Title>3,500 mph...</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1353297597998</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 22:59:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a pound of feathers makes a difference</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1353298169013</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 23:09:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353300001810-41</Id><Title>Raining cats and dogs</Title><Msg>3 + 4 + 777</Msg><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1353300001810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 23:40:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353300170061-42</Id><Topic><Title>Raining cats and dogs</Title><Username>black_mariah777</Username><Timestamp>1353300001810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 23:40:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tell youir friends...
