The Navy's website gives the fleet status indicating that, overall, only 36% of U.S. naval vessels are deployed. An "aircraft carrier system availability" requirement of "11 for 3" is absurd. This administration is purposely underutilizing our navy - as Romney accurately pointed out in the presidential debates. Why is that? The lack of support to the Mediterranean is a contributing reason that the events unfolded in Bengahazi as they did. And, yet, folks voted this man back in office for more of what he is able to do or purposely not do for our nation's security.

You cite "sea room". It must not be a significant issue as Obama deployed two aircraft acrriers at the same time to the Persian Gulf which represents less than 1% of the total ocean accessible waters. The admirals report to the commander-in-chief. So, which admiral is going to ask for more than the President is wanting to deploy? Apparently, one admiral (Rear Adm. Charles M. Gaouette) got in hot water and was fired for just that as a result of Benghazi. Obama had two of the three "underway" deployed to the Persian Gulf on 9/11/2012; the other in the Pacific. Three carriers "underway" with eight at port is a monumental waste. The question begged is, if this is all that is required, then why do we need three more? The reason for deployment is to support and be ready for "hot spots". Ported carriers have a 90 day readiness requirement. Kind of slow. The Persian Gulf 2 carrier deployment was overkill. The Pacific Fleet one carrier deployment is under-kill - given: North Korea and South Korea disputes, island disputes between Japan and China and island disputes between Taiwan, China, and the Philippines. Then there is the Mediterranean: nothing, no carrier support. And yet, there is Libya, Egypt, Gaza, Israel, Syria, - all in flames in one form or another. And NATO partner Turkey requesting support. It is as if Obama is driving towards a "hands off" policy in the Middle East - save for ridiculous oversight of Iran. What did he say about Israel recently (during the dispute with Gaza)? Now read this carefully, "As for security, every state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able to defend itself – BY ITSELF – against any threat." That doesn't sound like Obama intends to "have Israel's back". And Obama has made sure of it with the bizarre carrier operations and deployments.

Everything that I posted is a fact. It comes from the Navy. And, yes, unlike the voterbots that put him back in office, I can criticize the President.

The Fleet Response Plan (2001) as indicated in the "Navy Transformational Roadmap" on the Navy's website, states, "The requirement to be able to swiftly defeat aggression in overlapping conflicts called for in the 2001 QDR has necessitated a focus on developing new surge capabilities to complement and capitalize on our current competency in providing immediately employable forward-deployed naval forces." Further, "With refined maintenance, modernization, manning and training processes, as well as fully-funded readiness accounts, the Fleet can consistently sustain a level of at least 6 surge-capable carrier strike groups, with two additional strike groups able to deploy within approximately 90 days of an emergency order." Three does not sound like six. Forget for a moment what are the traditions and blather coming from some position document. Where are they needed? Two in the Pacific (Japan, Koreas, China, Philippines). One in the Mediterranean (more for the Middle East). And one in the Indian Ocean and one in the Persian Gulf. At least five. Presumably, that is the logic behind the 2001 FRP.

We have been deploying our armed forces in surge mode for too long and it has started to catch up to us. Carriers and soldiers cannot sustain the level of deployment we have been asking for the last 10 years without rest refit and maintenance. Now we are in a situation where maintenance issues are starting to seriously inhibit our ability to deploy naval forces just when we need them. And, trust me, our Army and Marine troops are worn out from too many deployments with too little rest.
