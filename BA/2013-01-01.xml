After this, he goes through a list of abuses the Russian people have faced not only during Soviet times but under Vladimir Putin too, and here is his conclusion: "[Gun control] is about power and total power over the people."

Americans were prohibited from owning automatic firearms in the 30s (one reason Clyde Barrow was so famous was he got hold of BARs until they brought him the kind of penalty he richly deserved). Americans have even -- take note capitalists -- been prohibited from owning gold at one point in our history.

Mr. and Mrs. America, turn 'em all in, I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren't here." ----------------------------------------------------------------- While you contemplate the above quote with Pure moral HORROR ...contemplate an even larger one that follows..this time by a man who lived though gun confiscation in Russia. ---------------------------------------------------------------- “And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.” ― Aleksandr I.

The theory is that should doctors not get the 27 percent payment they will no longer receive medicare patients. I ask why is it that our government supports a medical payment system that insures doctors become wealthy. I find that the wealthier doctors become the more arrogant they get. There should be a law that doctors can not charge medicare more than private insurance. If doctors are paid the same as private insurance there will be no reason for not receiving medicare patients.</Msg><Username>phantomfield</Username><Timestamp>1357099373680</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 23:02:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357100078667-86</Id><Topic><Title>Two Quotes that should convince the ones on the Gun confiscation Fence</Title><Username>spartacus67517</Username><Timestamp>1357093399487</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 21:23:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seems that in a TRULY free Republic, the will of the people THROUGH Freedom of speech is more important.
