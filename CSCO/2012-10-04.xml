Romney is right the 47% who are the leeches that get the Federal goodies for free are not interested in anyone who wants to derail their Gravy Train. The 47% ain't impressed by lower taxes, for they don't pay Fed income taxes. Romney has no chance with them changing their vote.

Obama was asleep and Willard was showered, awake and ready to fight. Obama had many chances to say "Willard what are you talking about ?" but looked like he needed Clinton to make his points. Obama is a good designer but not a good salesman. The bottom line: regardless of facts, Romney was able to lie better than Obama and won, even if he didn't tell us one single thing of how he plans to do anything. NOW FOR THE ONLY POLL THAT MATTERS. Go to "intrade dot [you know what] " (stupid yahoo) Bets are made on future events on that site, those events are traded in value just like if they were stocks. The site is incredibly accurate in its ability to predict future winner (it accurately predicted 48 out of 50 political races). Forget about any other poll. This is the latest after the debate ...Earlier this week, the site's users placed the odds that President Obama would win re-election at about 75%. But in the minutes after the debate finished, the index showed Obama's numbers had fallen to 68.9%.

J. Dionne WASHINGTON — If we elected the president by popular vote, we would have heard some different spin going into the debates. With the presidential election looking closer in the national polls than it does in the swing states, the pressure on Mitt Romney from his party and the pundits alike would have been rather less demanding. In one sense, this is surprising. Our antiquated Electoral College actually gives Republicans an advantage. By guaranteeing every state three electors regardless of population, the system offers outsized influence to smaller, mostly Republican rural states. In 2000, George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore. Bush became president not only because the Supreme Court awarded him Florida but also because sparsely populated Western states, from the Dakotas through the Rockies and up to Alaska, boosted his Electoral College total. In 2012, the system is working in President Obama’s favor. If all the pundit talk during the Reagan years was of an “Electoral College lock” for the GOP, the lock has rusted into uselessness since Bill Clinton first picked it in 1992. Instead, we have what National Journal political writer Ron Brownstein has aptly dubbed the “blue wall” because Democrats now have more states reliably in their corner than the Republicans do. Since 1992, Democrats have never received fewer than 251 electoral votes. In the same period, Republicans averaged just under 167 electoral votes in the three elections they lost. Obama starts with a bigger electoral vote base and thus has more paths to victory than Romney. There are ample grounds for wariness of sweeping structural explanations in politics. A case can be made that Obama is doing well in the swing states for reasons having more to do with the campaign than with any wall. The president and his allied super PAC have simply been more focused and disciplined than the comparable Romney efforts. Bill Burton, one of the maestros behind Priorities USA Action, the main pro-Obama group, argues that various entities advertising on Romney’s behalf have put forth a cacophony of themes and messages that have yet to cohere into a strong, persuasive argument. Yet broader trends in American politics are making the blue wall thicker. As John Judis and Ruy Teixeira argued in their prescient 2002 book, “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” Republicans were becoming increasingly a party of older, white Americans at the very moment when the country was becoming much more diverse. Romney’s hard line on immigration, which has left him with an anemic share of the Latino vote, has deepened his predicament. It’s no wonder he tried to soften his stance on the DREAM Act in an interview on Monday with The Denver Post. Faced with their weakness among African-Americans and Latinos, whose share of the vote is steadily growing, Republicans need to win something on the order of 60 percent of all white votes to get to a majority. And this is difficult because significant groups of white voters, notably the overlapping groups of younger voters and professional and technical workers, have been driven away from the GOP in part by its social conservatism. This problem is aggravated by the Democrats’ strength, especially pronounced this year, among women. All these factors play back into the Electoral College. The power of the Latino vote took states that had been reasonably friendly to the Republicans at the presidential level — Nevada and Colorado, for example — and made them swing states. Southern states such as Virginia, North Carolina and Florida are no longer Republican-leaning (or GOP bastions) because a combination of African-Americans, Latinos and new migrants in the white professional class has transformed their demography. In the meantime, the very same factors have made states that were once competitive — including the electoral vote troves of California and Illinois — and moved them firmly into the Democrats’ presidential camp. Nearly four decades ago, Lawrence O’Brien, the legendary Democratic operative, wrote a memoir whose title, “No Final Victories,” embodies one of the best aspects of democracy. In free nations, political triumphs are provisional and those who lose today have a chance of prevailing tomorrow. That’s why there is no electoral wall so durable that it can’t be demolished eventually. Someday, necessity will force Republicans to come to terms with their problems among Latinos, African-Americans, younger professionals, and women. But for now, Mitt Romney’s trouble in reaching outside the GOP’s comfort zone is making his Electoral College problem — and his task in the debates — even more daunting.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1349362787345</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 10:59:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349362808951-67</Id><Topic><Title>You need to see this Report!

It invests at home. GM put American manufacturing back in the high-tech race on American soil. The new GM is good for America, and America is good for GM, as a former GM chairman declared in 1953. GM is back where it should be. We need to look no further than General Motors’ own figures to learn that GM outsources almost two thirds of its jobs overseas. Less than one in five GM vehicles are manufactured in the United States. To be exact: GM’s December 31, 2011 annual report shows General Motors of North America accounting for 98,000 of the 207,000 GM jobs worldwide. But 12,000 of these jobs are in Canada and 11,500 are in Mexico. Accordingly, GM has 74,500 jobs in the United States and 122,500 abroad, even after Obama’s touted surge in Detroit jobs. Almost two thirds of GM’s jobs are in other countries. GM’s outsourcing is not a slip. GM clearly states that foreign investment and outsourcing of jobs are an integral parts of its growth strategy.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1349395679031</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:07:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349396109307-223</Id><Title>the CEO with Swiss Bank Accounts is now ready to work for the middle class</Title><Msg>this c-riminal outsourced our jobs and now would say anything to get elected. incredible</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349396109307</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:15:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349396253918-224</Id><Title>luckily, it has only been 4 years since these c-riminals almost destroyed the country. most still remember</Title><Msg>this c-riminal should be in jail and not allowed to attempt to buy the presidency</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349396253918</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:17:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349396355585-225</Id><Title>this c-riminal outsourced our jobs and now he is lecturing us on how to get them back!</Title><Msg>jail this c-riminal now!</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349396355585</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:19:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349396376730-226</Id><Title>The Networks plan to cut back on exit polling</Title><Msg>Now you might ask what's the big deal......WELL, it was a big deal in 2004 when the networks came out early and LIED about the exit polling in Florida and many people seeing the wide win by Bush decided to not vote.
