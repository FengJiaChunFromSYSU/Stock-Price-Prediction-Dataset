Senators reach deal on immigration changes By Erica Werner, Associated Press A bipartisan group of leading senators has reached agreement on the principles of sweeping legislation to rewrite the nation's immigration laws. The deal, which was to be announced at a news conference Monday afternoon, covers border security, guest workers and employer verification, as well as a path to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants already in this country. Although thorny details remain to be negotiated and success is far from certain, the development heralds the start of what could be the most significant effort in years toward overhauling the nation's inefficient patchwork of immigration laws. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- President Barack Obama also is committed to enacting comprehensive immigration legislation and will travel to Nevada on Tuesday to lay out his vision, which is expected to overlap in important ways with the Senate effort. The eight senators expected to endorse the new principles Monday are Democrats Charles Schumer of New York, #$%$ Durbin of Illinois, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Michael Bennet of Colorado; and Republicans John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Several of these lawmakers have worked for years on the issue. McCain collaborated with the late Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy on comprehensive immigration legislation pushed by then-President George W. Bush in 2007, only to see it collapse in the Senate when it couldn't get enough GOP support. Now, with some Republicans chastened by the November elections which demonstrated the importance of Latino voters and their increasing commitment to Democrats, some in the GOP say this time will be different. "What's changed, honestly, is that there is a new, I think, appreciation on both sides of the aisle — including maybe more importantly on the Republican side of the aisle — that we have to enact a comprehensive immigration reform bill," McCain said Sunday on ABC's "This Week." "I think the time is right," McCain said. The group claims a notable newcomer in Rubio, a potential 2016 presidential candidate whose conservative bona fides may help smooth the way for support among conservatives wary of anything that smacks of amnesty. In an opinion piece published Sunday in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Rubio wrote that the existing system amounts to "de facto amnesty," and he called for "commonsense reform." According to documents obtained by The Associated Press, the senators will call for accomplishing four goals: •Creating a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already here, contingent upon securing the border and better tracking of people here on visas. •Reforming the legal immigration system, including awarding green cards to immigrants who obtain advanced degrees in science, math, technology or engineering from an American university. •Creating an effective employment verification system to ensure that employers do not hire illegal immigrants. •Allowing more low-skill workers into the country and allowing employers to hire immigrants if they can demonstrate they couldn't recruit a U.S. citizen; and establishing an agricultural worker program. The principles being released Monday are outlined on just over four pages, leaving plenty of details left to fill in. What the senators do call for is similar to Obama's goals and some past efforts by Democrats and Republicans, since there's wide agreement in identifying problems with the current immigration system. The most difficult disagreement is likely to arise over how to accomplish the path to citizenship. In order to satisfy the concerns of Rubio and other Republicans, the senators are calling for the completion of steps on border security and oversight of those here on visas before taking major steps forward on the path to citizenship. Even then, those here illegally would have to qualify for a "probationary legal status" that would allow them to live and work here — but not qualify for federal benefits — before being able to apply for permanent residency. Once they are allowed to apply they would do so behind everyone else already in line for a green card within the current immigration system. That could be a highly cumbersome process, but how to make it more workable is being left to future negotiations. The senators envision a more streamlined process toward citizenship for immigrants brought here as children by their parents, and for agricultural workers. The debate will play out at the start of Obama's second term, as he aims to spend the political capital afforded him by his re-election victory on an issue that has eluded past presidents and stymied him during his first term despite his promises to the Latino community to act. "As the president has made clear for some time, immigration reform is an important priority and he is pleased that progress is being made with bipartisan support," a White House spokesman, Clark Stevens, said in a statement. "At the same time, he will not be satisfied until there is meaningful reform and he will continue to urge Congress to act until that is achieved." For Republicans, the November elections were a stark schooling on the importance of Latino voters, who voted for Obama over Republican Mitt Romney 71 percent to 27 percent, helping ensure Obama's victory. That led some Republican leaders to conclude that supporting immigration reform with a path to citizenship has become a political imperative.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359382456243</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 09:14:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359382484550-18</Id><Title>I heard 11,000,000 illegals again...</Title><Msg>Does this number ever change ?

In a special message to the annual anti-abortion protest March for Life, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) vowed that ending abortion would be one of the top priorities of Republicans this year. “Defending life, of course, is about much more than voting the right way or saying the right things,” he said. “It’s about promoting a culture of life. It’s about understanding that abortion is a defining human rights issue of our time. Because human life is not an economic or political commodity, and no government on Earth has the right to treat it as such.” “With all that’s at stake, it is becoming more and more important for us to share this truth with our young people, to encourage them to lock arms, speak out for life, and help make abortion a relic of the past,” Boehner continued. “Let that be one of our most fundamental goals this year.” Boehner said the Republican-led House would again seek to pass the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which sparked controversy in 2011 because of how it defined rape. The bill was approved by the House but died in the Senate. Yay, we're back to the War on Women as their top goal: ending safe, legal abortions and forcing women to resort to unsafe, illegal abortion!

Reihan Salam interviewed the Jabba pundit emeritus John Podhoretz about how the Republican Party had gotten away from these great thinkers and have run away from the Bush legacy, ignoring the huge deficits they supported when Bush enacted them, pretending that the economy was booming until a black man moved into the Oval Office. J-Pod's answer is that Bush's utter incompetence in Iraq made Americans distrust his domestic policy. PODHORETZ: I think obviously politically Republicans distanced themselves from George W. Bush because it was the politic thing to do. Numbers don't lie. He became very unpopular. Parties tend not to embrace figures and politicians who become unpopular. My view is that a lot of the distress over Bush's domestic agenda, from which Republicans fled, beginning really in 2005 had... it was an ancillary result of the failure to secure victory in Iraq early and to have a favorable reckoning... SALAM: So Iraq sank what might have been a successful domestic policy agenda. PODHORETZ: Right. Well, what I mean is that I think the entire country stopped listening to President Bush on what would be advantageous for the country when it lost faith that he was managing the war effectively and so he found it more difficult to get hearings on some of the issues that now are bedeviling the Republican party. J-Pod isn't entirely wrong. I think that even the willfully blind loyalty of the Republican Party couldn't ignore that the Bush presidency was an exercise in failure. And so it was natural for many Republicans (including the talking heads, who couldn't turn their back on Bush fast enough) to distance themselves from that sinking ship, to keep the taint of failure off them. But it also ignores the Frankenstein's monster the Republican Party have created in the tea party. Decades and decades of conservative talking points ("Everyone knows lower taxes means economic growth!' "The free market rises all boats!" "We must cut entitlements to strengthen the economy!" "Abortion is murder!") were given with a wink. Politicians knew that for all their talk about ending abortion, they really would never do it, because they needed that wedge issue to run on for elections. They knew that even though they cried for cutting taxes, they could always sneak tax increases in the forms of fees or adjustments, as Reagan did over and over. They understood that it was all stagecraft. But after decades of these talking points without substance, they have birthed a generation of true believers in the form of the tea party. And let's be honest, the tea party are merely Republicans with another name. These tea partiers have accepted these truisms without examining them and believe them wholly. They missed the winks; they've ignored the reality and they're ready to implement the Republican agenda full bore. The only problem is that the establishment Republicans aren't interested in doing so, because as Bush's presidency proved so well, the Republican agenda is a one way ticket to failure. And hence, the implosion of the Republican Party, between the cynicism of the establishment and the willful ignorance of the tea party. But for J-Pod, it's all about Bush's suspicious immigration policy, not his disasterous economic policies, that killed the Republican Party. His proof? No conservative radio host wanted to talk about his nasty smear book on Hillary Clinton. In 2006 I published a book on Hillary Clinton called Can She Be Stopped... (crosstalk) The morning that I did my... I had 150 radio interviews scheduled. The book was sort of being sent off in a big way... the first book about Hillary Clinton in 2008 and I did eight interviews the first day and every single one of those interviews, I came on, on a conservative radio station somewhere in the country and I said, yes, I'm here to talk about my book, Can She Be Stopped? and the conservative radio talk show host would say, this is April 2006, I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about immigration and what Bush is doing and what is going on? Why is he doing this? What's the matter with the President? What's going on? These were... this was supposed to be a friendly audience that hated Hillary and would love to hear about how she should be stopped in 2008 and no... no conservative in the country wanted to talk about the Democrats. They wanted to talk about Bush and distance themselves from him on immigration. Republicans didn't want to talk smack about Hillary Clinton??? My god, they *are* in disarray!</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359388238651</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 10:50:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359388265362-32</Id><Topic><Title>If your 4 year old is bored let him play with your gun!!!

Is it all good?</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1359394475061</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 12:34:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359394544120-65</Id><Topic><Title>Goebbels Step-Grandchildren Are Hidden Billionaires</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1359394323913</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 12:32:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think Kerry is married to Heinze who is Goebbels step child....sad, eh?

They will not need so many registered Democrats as soon as they legalize the 20,000,000 illegals now living in America. Many of these un-needed Democrats are very obese and would make perfect fodder for hungry North Koreans. It would be an act of kindness to provide the Democrats that are 'un-loveable' with a chance to redeem their useless lives while serving as food for hungry Koreans. This would be a low cost budget item and would actually reduce Treasury expenses. A one way ticket to North Korea is all that's needed. Massive amounts of malt liquor would be served on this one way flight, and the airplane would not even have to land, just shove the obese and semi-comatose Democrats out of the plane into the scattered villages of hungry peasants, in essence 'food bombing' these deserving people! The peasants. Could there be a more noble ending to the useless lives of Democrats every where? I think not. No volunteers will be accepted. This is too serious to allow to chance. Once total gun control is in effect in Democratic counties, it will be easy to #$%$ the fat fellows off the streets, front porches, bars, brothels, pool halls, gambling areas, lines of food stamp applicants, medicaid clinic waiting rooms and all sorts of government sponsored locales. YOU CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS NEW PROGRAM, DEMOCRAT!!! You will be truly helping very hungry people. Why should they eat their own children when we have millions of excess Democrats right here, all around us, taking up valuable space. Cheers one and all.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1359402804410</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:53:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359402872205-104</Id><Title>where is government worker magoo?</Title><Msg>hahahahahahaha we know it is you jr. fn idiot...what a loser.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1359402872205</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:54:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359402973380-105</Id><Topic><Title>bipartisan love fest</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359402737485</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:52:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>undercount! there are 20 million illegal aliens and all of them are voting La Raza!!

The opinion of Papa John's among recent casual diners dropped precipitously after CEO John Schnatter's public comments about Obamacare, according to a new study from YouGov BrandIndex, which researches brand perception for marketing directors, brand managers and PR reps. The site conducts thousands of interviews a day, providing real-time info that shows trends and responses to different marketing techniques or in this case, public gaffes. The national pizza chain's YouGov BrandIndex Buzz score -- which the site uses as an indication of brand favorability -- dropped to four at the end of November, down from 32 on election day. YouGov tracked the public's perception of three restaurants following anti-Obamacare comments made by company CEOs. Papa John's, Applebee's and Denny's all saw declines among adults who have eaten at casual dining restaurants in the past month. Denny's score even fell to zero after franchise owner John Metz announced a five percent 'Obamacare surcharge' in November. The brand's score jumped up to a six shortly afterwards "potentially due to CEO John Miller's apologetic statement a few days later," according to the YouGov report. Applebee's score dropped more than 25 points after Zane Tankel -- who owns 40 Applebee's in the New York area -- appeared on the Fox Business Network and expressed reluctance to expand because of the health care overhaul. Still, Papa John's fared the worst, despite Schnatter's attempts to clarify his statement in a HuffPost blog, writing:</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359409995109</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 16:53:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359410090187-131</Id><Topic><Title>just stop the gotcha-type of questions!!!

January 25, 2013 |</Title><Msg>It's time for another "pro-life" pop quiz, boys and girls, so sharpen those No. 2 pencils. One of the biggest talking points of your anti-woman movement is that it's actually to protectwomen from, um, themselves. That is why women must be forced to undergo transvaginal ultrasounds, listen to hypothetical descriptions of what their fetus might look like in a few months, read about imaginary risks of one of the safest procedures there is—all so women, poor dumb little dears that they are, will understand that terminating a pregnancy means, you know, terminating a pregnancy. It's all about compassion for the ladies, you see. Do you prove just how much you really care about women by: (a) Ensuring that all women have safe, affordable access to health care for themselves and their children; or (b) Forcing rape victims who are impregnated by their rapists to carry their pregnancies to term or go to prison for up to three years. If you guessed (a), congratulations, you're correct! If you guessed (b), you're state Rep. Cathrynn Brown of New Mexico—a Republican, of course—with a super duper pro-lifey, pro-womany plan to criminalize rape victims. Laura Bassett at Huffington Post reports: A Republican lawmaker in New Mexico introduced a bill on Wednesday that would legally require victims of rape to carry their pregnancies to term in order to use the fetus as evidence for a sexual assault trial.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359411267443</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 17:14:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359411269322-140</Id><Topic><Title>GOP helping to create 11 million more DNC voters</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359386891602</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 10:28:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am completely in favor of allowing the 20,000,000 illegals to vote.

And while the GOP holds a majority in the House, the statisticians tell us that, thanks to gerrymandering, more people voted for Democrats to fill those seats in spite of the outcome. So it shouldn't be a surprise that -- according to a new Wall Street Journal poll -- both Congress and the GOP are ranking pretty low in the Mr. Congeniality pageant. Right now, only 26 percent of adult Americans have a positive view of the Republican Party (compared to 44 percent for the Dems) and for Congress it's even worse: only 14 percent are pointing up their thumbs. But it turns out that there's something out there that people dislike even more. No, not cockroaches. Cockroaches -- along with traffic jams, used car salesmen and Genghis Khan -- are doing quite fine when held in comparison to Congress. No, we're talking about something that people see as even more revolting: the Tea Party! Since 2010, self-identified Tea Party members have dropped from 24 percent of the electorate to just 8 percent. Suddenly realizing an urgent need for a makeover, the South Florida Tea Party announced this week that it's changing its name to the "National Liberty Foundation" -- all to distance itself from a the Tea Party brand. A brand that even the Palm Beach County Tea Party said was infused with too much "negative information" and laced with too many "racist, crazy" connotations. Gosh, it just seems so darned unfair that a racist and crazy organization should be burdened with a racist and crazy reputation. But history tells us that this kind of simple renaming isn't enough to really overhaul an image. Take the infamous Blackwater organization. The brains behind it changed its name to Xe, and then Academi, all with the continuing hope of distancing itself from its human rights abuses. But it never managed to shake its evil reputation. Why? It's not because they never stopped being evil. It's because they never came up with a catchy motto like "What's in your wallet?" or "15 minutes could save you 15 percent." That's why!</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359412586367</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 17:36:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359413431521-146</Id><Topic><Title>racist tea billies have an 8% approval rating, LOL makes the GOP look popular</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359412586367</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 17:36:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, so true!</Msg><Username>barjonicat</Username><Timestamp>1359413431521</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 17:50:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359413579915-147</Id><Topic><Title>As early as next week, the Boy Scouts of America may announce it will allow gay Scouts and troop leaders, a spokesman for the group has told USA TODAY.</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359403904866</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 15:11:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's exactly right.

Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County has issued a radio message suggesting that residents consider how to protect themselves from crime, including, perhaps, firearm training. “With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option,” the sheriff said in the recording, one installment in the periodic public service messages he issues. “You could beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back,” he said, later suggesting that residents consider taking a certified course in firearm safety. Sheriff Clarke said in an interview that his office has faced budget cuts in recent years and that he meant his message merely to encourage safety and personal responsibility. “I wouldn’t tell people to go get a gun,” Sheriff Clarke said. “I wouldn’t tell them not to go get a gun.” Obama's got it WRONG...

Mattioli lost his six-year-old son James in the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut back in December. “Gun laws are not the problem,” he said. In an emotional testimony, Mattioli said that more gun laws would not solve the problem and that politicians who try and proclaim that the issue is “complex.” He believes there is simply a lack of civility and that “what we are seeing are symptoms of a bigger problem. This is a symptom. The problem is not gun laws. The problem is a lack of civility.” =========================== Goog it and read the whole article. And don't forget,... ... Beware the dangerous uncivil extremely evil bloodthirsty murderous M;uslim monkey maggot from Kenya. It's not about guns, it's about anti-American M'ao style Marxist M;uslim monkey control.</Msg><Username>ivanhoeiofflkoxly</Username><Timestamp>1359430180031</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 22:29:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
