Juniper reported earnings that beat the street but gave guidance that was SLIGHTLY below the street. This happened last quarter and at that time Juniper also dragged Cisco down with it. When Cisco reported they beat and raised and the stock went up 8%. Cisco was eating Junipers lunch. Why the street didn't learn anything is beyond me. Yesterday F-5 Networks gave a POOR earning sreport and got hammered after hours, COMPETITOR Riverbed beat and raised and went UP 8%. Everything is not as it seems. Goldman and Morgan Stanley BOTH said Cisco channel checks reveal STRONG orders. I think Cisco is putting the hurt on the competition.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1351167353674</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 08:15:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351167867762-11</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi-GATE heating up</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1351165247205</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 07:40:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I believe he will at least tell Americans the truth, unlike O'Loser who either blames someone or LIES about it.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1351167867762</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 08:24:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351170165084-12</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO is too beneficial to miss right now.

You are like Obummer- lies don't count if you are a liberal. All conservatives are vilified because one person said that he believes that abortion is murder under any circumstances. I don't care what he thinks. All that is important is what God thinks. Are you sure abortion isn't murder? The law of the land is that partial birth abortion is fine. Obummer voted for after birth abortion three times. That is not what Roe v. Wade was suppose to be. I am not even religious, but really sick of you liars. At one time I thought the Roe v.

Bids are out and two bids are under serious consideration to move the soon to be largest iceberg in history from the Antartic to the Indian ocean, and pump fresh water into Saudi, creating the largest freshwater-climate change adventure since Nile irrigation procedures 3000 years ago! And the Middle East is doing it again. OceanTugs Ltd. (OTL-Nasdaq), has the winning bid to move the Pine Island berg from Antartic to Saudi in 2013. The berg will be moved during Southern hemisphere 'winter' to reduce current changes and energy requirement. The move will take an estimated 6 months and cost 3.6 billion dollars. Ocean Tugs stated that the bid includes all diesel provided free to the tugs by Saudi's new Ja'amlah refinery, thereby reducing the actual cost of moving this historic amount of fresh water to the desert kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Climatologists from University of Birmingham have been engaged by the kingdom to provide the ideal location of the immense new freshwater reservoir to affect prevailing winds and increase local precipitation from the usual annual 4 inches of rain to 36 inches of rain, restoring the Kingdom to it's once verdant, prehistoric paradise. Skeptics have been beheaded, and most Democrats are standing in line, awaiting their turn in the new fun adventure ride..'the Guillotine'....

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell broke with the Republican party during the 2008 election, to endorse then-candidate Barack Obama for president, calling Obama a "transformational figure." With 12 days to go before the presidential election, Powell publicly endorsed President Obama for re-election on "CBS This Morning" Thursday "I voted for him in 2008 and I plan to stick with him in 2012 and I'll be voting for he and for Vice President Joe Biden next month." Powell explained his choice to Charlie Rose and Norah O'Donnell: When he took over, the country was in very very difficult straits. We were in the one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression. The fiscal system was collapsing. Wall Street was in chaos, we had 800,000 jobs lost in that first month of the Obama administration and unemployment peaked a few months later at 10 percent. So we were in real trouble. The auto industry was collapsing, the housing was start[ing] to collapse and we were in very difficult straits. And I saw over the next several years, stabilization come back in the financial community, housing is now starting to pick up after four years, it's starting to pick up. Consumer confidence is rising." Summarizing the past four years under Obama, Powell said "Generally we've come out of the dive and we're starting to gain altitude." He acknowledged that problems remain, saying "The unemployment rate is too high, people are still hurting in housing but I see that we're starting to rise up." Turning to foreign policy, Powell said he saw "the president get us of one war, start to get us out of a second war and did not get us into any new wars. And finally I think that the actions he has taken with respect to protecting us from terrorism have been very very solid. And so, I think we ought to keep on the track that we are on." Powell expressed his concern about Republican candidate Mitt Romney's changing positions on international affairs. "The governor who was saying things at the debate on Monday night ... was saying things that were quite different from what he said earlier. I'm not quite sure which Gov. Romney we would be getting with respect to foreign policy."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351179665845</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:41:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351179885993-64</Id><Title>Trump is the GOP!</Title><Msg>dumb but loud Trump's "big" announcement arrived Wednesday, via YouTube, and billed as a bombshell, it was really more of a bust. Trump said in the video, "Now, I have a deal for the President. ... If Barack Obama opens up and gives his college records and applications, and if he gives his passport applications and records, I will give to a charity of his choice -- inner city children in Chicago, American Cancer Society, AIDS research, anything he wants, a check, immediately, for $5 million." Greta Van Susteren said on Fox, "First of all, $5 million - that's chump change to you. You're a very rich man." Told that the president is not going to do it, Trump replied, "Well, no, I don't know that." Others couldn't resist the punch lines. David Letterman said, "Hey Don, I'll give you $5 million if you release that thing on your head. Let him go! Let him be free!" Steven Colbert quipped, "He has to have it by 5 o'clock on Halloween because that night he's renting out his enormous orange head as a jack o'lantern." Even the president joined in.

Perhaps owing to Americans’ short attention spans, many of the most controversial stories concerning the Republican nominee have hardly been examined — while the mainstream media obsessed over the gaffe-filled, clown-car elements of the 2012 campaign. The result is an incomplete picture of the man who could be Commander-in-Chief. What follows are 10 troubling stories from Mitt Romney’s past, all of which have been reported by the media — and subsequently forgotten by all but the most ardent political observers. Posthumous Baptisms One of the oddest — and some would say most offensive — practices of the Mormon Church is posthumous baptism, in which deceased members of other faiths are baptized as Latter Day Saints so that they can get into heaven. When Newsweek asked Romney in 2007 if he had preformed baptisms for the dead, Romney responded: “I have in my life, but I haven’t recently.” One of the posthumous baptisms that the Romney family performed was on his father-in-law, Edward Davies — despite the fact that Davies was a staunch atheist who considered religion to be “drudgery” and “hogwash.” Profiting From 9/11 Romney’s involvement with an insurance startup called Endurance Specialty Holdings has largely been forgotten among the wave of questionable business deals that have come to light during the presidential campaign. Endurance Specialty Holdings was designed to purchase debt from insurance companies that suffered huge losses in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. According to a report by Politicker’s Hunter Walker, Romney was invested in the company through Golden Gate Capital — a private equity firm started by one of his former colleagues at Bain Capital — and CCG Investment Fund, LP. By the end of 2003, Endurance Specialty Holdings was reporting a net income of over $263.4 million. Sensitive to charges that he had profited from the 9/11 tragedy, the Romney campaign insisted that the Republican nominee had no control over his investments, as they were managed by a blind trust — an institution that Romney himself famously described as an “age-old ruse.” Potential Voter Fraud In 2010, Romney voted for Republican Scott Brown in Massachusetts’ special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by the late Ted Kennedy. To prove his Bay State residency, Romney claimed that he was living in his son Tagg’s unfinished basement – which seems unlikely for a quarter-billionaire with multiple houses of his own. If Romney was lying about his residency, it would constitute voter fraud, a crime punishable by up to five years in jail. Commission of that particular felony would be highly ironic, given the extreme lengths to which Romney’s own party has gone to root out alleged election fraud. Some observers, like M.S. Bellow Jr. of The Guardian, have speculated that Romney refuses to release his 2009 tax return because it lists an address other than Tagg Romney’s Belmont, Massachusetts home. The vote-fraud story has mostly gone unnoticed by the mainstream media, however. Profiting From Disposal Of Aborted Fetuses Another of Romney’s questionable Bain deals that has gone underreported is the firm’s profitable investment in the medical waste disposal firm Stericycle. Bain Capital sank $75 million into the company in 1999 — an odd investment for a staunchly anti-abortion Republican to make. After all, Stericyle has long been attacked by right-wing groups for disposing of aborted fetuses. The investment raises serious doubts about Romney’s stated timeline of his exit from Bain Capital. Before Mother Jones’ David Corn broke the Stericycle story, Romney claimed that he had fully left Bain in February of 1999. The SEC documentation of the Stericycle deal proved that wrong, however, prompting Romney surrogates to explain that he had “retroactively retired” from the company in 2002. Had the story garnered more attention, it could have irreversibly damaged Romney’s credibility regarding his business record. Trying To Block A Lifesaving Abortion In 1990, Judith Dushku — a professor at Suffolk University in Boston and the mother of actress Eliza Dushku — published an article recounting the story of a 41-year-old woman who had developed a life-threatening blood clot during her sixth pregnancy. While she was at the hospital to undergo the abortion that she needed to survive, her bishop — one Mitt Romney — showed up unnannounced and tried to stop her from going through with it. According to Dushku, Romney and the woman had the following conversation: He said – What do you think you’re doing? She said – Well, we have to abort the baby because I have these blood clots. And he said something to the effect of – Well, why do you get off easy when other women have their babies? And she said – What are you talking about? This is a life-threatening situation. And he said – Well what about the life of the baby? And she said – I have four other children and I think it would be really irresponsible to continue the pregnancy. Dushku says that after she went public with the story, Romney — who was once a friend of hers — cut off all contact with her. If anyone still doubts Romney’s true position on abortion, this story makes his real attitude abundantly clear. Still Hiding Those Tax Returns (And That Over-stuffed IRA?) The broader story of Romney’s financial history has gone largely unquestioned since he released two years of tax returns and a summary of tax rates from the previous 20 years in late September. The media is wrong to let Romney off the hook on this topic, however: voters still don’t know what rates Romney paid from 1990-2009 (if he paid any taxes at all,) or how his IRA grew to such massive proportions, among many other unanswered questions. Potentially Violating Ethics Laws (With Paul Ryan’s Brother) Throughout Romney’s tenure as governor of Massachusetts, the state did frequent business with a marketing company called Imagitas. The company, which was run by former Bain employees Tom Beecher and Tobin Ryan — brother to Romney’s running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan — had been started based on loans from Bain while Romney was still running the company. When it was sold in 2005, Bain — from which Romney still makes a massive amount of money through dividends, interest, and capital gains — tripled its original stake. Did Romney violate ethics laws by steering contracts towards a company in which he had a financial stake? Nobody knows. Romney never filed disclosure forms detailing in which individual companies Bain Capital held investments, and he and his campaign have refused to answer questions about his financial connection to Imagitas. His Son’s Connections With A Ponzi Scheme In 2009 Tagg Romney, Mitt’s eldest son, partnered with several North Carolina investors who are facing a lawsuit in connection to the $8 billion Stanford Financial Group Ponzi scheme, the second largest such scam in history behind only Bernie Madoff’s. Romney helped these investors form a new company — called Solamere Advisors, a similar title to Romney’s own Solamere Capital — shortly after Stanford was arrested for his crimes. As Lee Fang reported in The Nation, Tagg Romney then falsely claimed to reporters that Solamere Capital had no involvement with Solamere Advisors — likely because Mitt Romney has invested about $10 million of his own money into his son’s business. Profiting From The Auto Bailout — While Jobs Were Shipped To China Although Romney infamously declared that the federal government should “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt,” the self-described “son of Detroit” profited handsomely off the auto bailout. As Greg Palast reported in The Nation, Romney and his wife made millions off an auto parts company called Delphi after it was bought for pennies on the dollar by Romney’s partner (and one of his primary campaign donors,) Paul Singer. Singer and his partners took billions in federal bailout dollars in exchange for continuing to supply auto parts to General Motors and Chrysler. They kept the money, stiffed the company’s pensioners, and moved 25 of Delphi’s 29 plants to China. The White Horse Prophecy In 1843, Joseph Smith supposedly prophesied that “You will see the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed… It will hang like a thread as fine as a silk fiber,” until Latter Day Saints ride in on a metaphorical white horse to save the Constitution and take control of the government. Although Romney has publicly stated that he does not believe in the prophecy, many Mormon political figures have used language evoking it, raising the question of how much of Romney’s support within his Mormon base is actually based on an obscure religious doctrine. In Nevada, a closely-fought swing state that is home to many Mormons, ABC News reported last month that LDS church officials had distributed a 30-minute PowerPoint presentation urging church members to register and vote “with one voice” — an appeal that came very close to violating the church’s tax-exempt status, which prohibits partisan activity.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351181913365</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:18:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351181926823-76</Id><Title>COLON BOWEL SUPPORTS LARGE FECAL BLOB?

Romney Will Take Us To War! By tmcbpatriot | October 23, 2012 | 1 Comment Terrorism Mitt Romney, October 22, 2012 (Debate #3): “In the 2000 debates there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9/11 happened. So we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty. And that means a strong military. I will not cut our military budget.” Al Gore, October 17, 2000 (Debate #3): “I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction. Look, we’re gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years.” George W Bush, October 17, 2000 (Debate #3): “Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East. Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling. Sanctions are loosened. The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction.” George W Bush, October 11, 2000 (Debate #2): “We don’t know whether he’s developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there’s going to be a consequence should I be the president.” —— Keepin’ the Peace. Heh. Heh. Heh. Mitt Romney, October 22, 2012 (Debate #3): “Let me — let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East, and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more — is peaceful. We want a peaceful planet.” George W Bush, October 17, 2000 (Debate #3): ”You’re going to live in a peaceful world. It will be a world of peace because we’re going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends…I want to have the military keeping the peace…This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace.” —— Strengthening Our Military Mitt Romney, October 22, 2012 (Debate #3): “We don’t want to get drawn into a military conflict…I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of — of our — of our troops. We need to have as well a strong military. Our military is second to none in the world.” “We’re blessed with terrific soldiers and extraordinary technology and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion dollars in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that.” “And our military — we’ve got to strengthen our military long- term.” “Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the president of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people. And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is the combination of the budget cuts that the president has as well as the sequestration cuts. That, in my view, is — is — is making our future less certain and less secure. I won’t do it. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only, only consider if all of the other avenues had been — had been tried to their full extent.” George W Bush, October 17, 2000 (Debate #3): ”Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war. And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.” “I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course. But we have an opportunity — we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal. We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we’re smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace.” —— Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints!

The findings represent a huge change from just after the party conventions in September, when Democratic enthusiasm was stronger, Pew said. In the latest poll – of 1,005 people conducted Oct. 18-21 – Pew found that 73 percent of Republicans said the campaign is interesting, up 23 points since early September. The survey was conducted before the final debate between President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla. The Pew results also showed more independents viewing the campaign as interesting, 56 percent, compared with 45 percent in September. By contrast, the percentage of Democrats who say the campaign is interesting remained unchanged, at 66 percent. Democratic enthusiasm had jumped 19 points between June and September, Pew said. In addition, far more Republicans also view the campaign informative – 69 percent versus 49 last month – and largely fewer responded that the campaign is “too long” than did so in September, 42 to 62 percent, Pew reports. In fact, the percentage of Republicans who now say the campaign is too long is ranks about as low as it was in January, 49 percent, which was when the GOP primaries began, Pew reports. Overall, 63 percent told Pew that the 2012 presidential campaign was interesting, versus 28 percent who said it was not. Urgent Poll: Who Won the Presidential Debates? Vote Here! That was up 10 points from September, when 53 percent of found the campaign interesting overall. The latest results compared with Pew survey results from January to June, in which majorities said the campaign was dull – with no more than about 4-in-10 finding it interesting.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351188433896</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:07:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351188543210-130</Id><Title>Don helped mitts polls</Title><Msg>mitt up big today...maybe america is starting to wonder about the communist who is running america.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351188543210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:09:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351188867602-131</Id><Topic><Title>Hugo Chavez endorses Obama</Title><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351186063776</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 13:27:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>communists stick together....hey where is all the csco info?? this board sucks</Msg><Username>kbononi</Username><Timestamp>1351188867602</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:14:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351188908158-132</Id><Topic><Title>Don helped mitts polls</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351188543210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:09:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what language is that?</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351188908158</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:15:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351189013112-133</Id><Title>liberals jump all over palin and call her a racist</Title><Msg>BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA god they look dumber every day. palin serves them up. only those who are racist see racism in every cloud that passes the summer sky.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351189013112</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:16:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351189090240-134</Id><Title>Benghazi Proves OBumbles is Liar-In-Chief</Title><Msg>I'm very disappointed in Hillary for aiding and abetting the Liar-In-Chief.</Msg><Username>ammd1518</Username><Timestamp>1351189090240</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:18:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351189213750-135</Id><Title>obama show us your past.</Title><Msg>for the children please. to help the children. obama talks about don on tv and makes fun of him but it would take him less time to release the transcripts and make some charity stronger for it.

In what has been dubbed “Benghazi-Gate,” the conservative media has jumped on the emails as definitive proof that the Obama administration has been lying about what it knew and when in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attack on a diplomatic mission in Benghazi. Rice’s response was likely not what Van Susteren expected: RICE: But when things are unfolding very, very quickly, it’s not always easy to know what is really going on on the ground. And to my mind, the really important questions here are about how information was collected. Did the various agencies really coordinate and share intelligence in the way that we had hoped, with the reforms that were made after 9/11? So there’s a big picture to be examined here. But we don’t have all of the pieces, and I think it’s easy to try and jump to conclusions about what might have happened here. It’s probably better to let the relevant bodies do their work.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1351194785404</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:53:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351194840730-178</Id><Topic><Title>biggest winner the last four years</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351194577002</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:49:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama said he would get them...did he mean more money? all that tough talk was just blue lip service.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351194840730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:54:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351194871006-179</Id><Title>TRUMP SAYS: AS LONG AS THERE ARE REPUKES, MY IDIOT SELF WILL HAVE AN AUDIENCE</Title><Msg>Whoooha !</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1351194871006</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:54:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351194926379-180</Id><Topic><Title>TRUMP SAYS: AS LONG AS THERE ARE REPUKES, MY IDIOT SELF WILL HAVE AN AUDIENCE</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1351194871006</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:54:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>obama turns his back on charity to save his job.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351194926379</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:55:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351195053298-181</Id><Title>liberals should be happy</Title><Msg>when obama gets the boot he will write more books about himself that they can read.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351195053298</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:57:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351195068894-182</Id><Title>WHY WON'T THE DONALD TAKE $1 Million FOR CHARITY...</Title><Msg>All he has to do it let Colbert put his balls in his mouth.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1351195068894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:57:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351195138565-183</Id><Topic><Title>Check out Cisco Systems</Title><Username>dorindapedq42783</Username><Timestamp>1351179943071</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:45:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your spambolini tastes so much better than everyone else's!</Msg><Username>porkypiggins</Username><Timestamp>1351195138565</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:58:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351195189526-184</Id><Topic><Title>WHY WON'T THE DONALD TAKE $1 Million FOR CHARITY...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1351195068894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:57:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean like everyone has been doing to your Momma?

WASHINGTON -- The plan offered by the Republican presidential ticket to turn Medicaid into a block grant program run by the states would cut enrollment in half, a study found. Between repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its Medicaid expansion and moving to a block grant program, the plan proposed by GOP vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) would cut enrollment between 31.3 million and 37.5 million, an analysis by the Urban Institute found. The report compared Medicaid enrollment and spending under both the ACA and the plan offered by Ryan the last two years as chair of the House Budget Committee. "The proposed changes and reductions in federal financing for Medicaid under the House Budget Plan would almost certainly worsen the problem of the uninsured and strain the nation's safety net," read the report, which was commissioned by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. Under the block grant program proposed by Ryan and a very similar one offered by Romney, Medicaid spending would be capped annually and divvied up to states based on a formula. Spending would only increase to keep up with population growth and inflation. But the growth rates of both population and inflation typically fall below the growth rate of Medicaid spending, leaving a gap between expected services and funding. However, states would have more flexibility to set eligibility and coverage as well. Not only would enrollment fail to make up for the lack of Medicaid spending, payments to providers would also suffer, the report said. "Payments to providers could fall by 32% relative to the baseline," it noted. In the final presidential debate this week, Romney praised the plan as one that states would embrace.

Allred came to court to get the gag order on her client, the wife of the founder of Staples, lifted. The gag order prevents her client from discussing the details of her divorce in the early 90s, where Mitt Romney offered testimony in support of the husband. Allred left court empty handed. Over Allred's pathetic pleas, the attorney from the Boston Globe agreed to Staple's stipulation settling the matter - leaving the gag order intact. At one point, Allred was actually heard begging the Boston Globe attorney to turn down the offer, yelling "please!" The answer? No. Thus the stipulation was signed, and Allred's client was silenced. In effect, the Boston Globe threw Allred under the bus. The angst on the radical left was immediately evident. David Corn, of Mother Jones, desperately tweeted "How did Allred let that happen? Was there a screw-up?" In the end, Allred ended up with nothing more than a 20 year old piece of paper and nobody to talk about it.

"I always start at Costco," Romney said on the "Rachel Ray Show" today as the audience watched pre-taped video of her pushing an over-sized grocery cart at the bulk-goods store. Zooming around the store that she' didn't name by location, Romney grabbed large bags of spinach, several containers of frozen cream puffs and pre-cooked rotisserie chicken. "The great thing about frozen desserts, they're always ready to go," Romney gushed. For roughly $4.50 per person - a $137.50 tab - Romney can feed all five sons and their families, a total of 30 people, she said.
