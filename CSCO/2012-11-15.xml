It seems to be an even bigger concern, however, to some from the political standpoint. They are squarely blaming the new Medical Device Excise Tax and the Obama administration for the Kalamazoo-based company's decision. “We’ve already got the highest unemployment rate in the country,” said Charlie Owens, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business. “Clearly, the federal law is aggravating the problem and it’s undermining the state’s effort to improve the economic climate.” Stryker Chairman, President and CEO Stephen P. MacMillan said the decision was a result of “a challenging economic environment and a market slowdown in elective medical procedures,” as well as the need to prepare for the new tax. The company said that it will look to cut its 20,036-person worldwide staff before the end of 2012 and restructure some of its operations in order to wring out about $100 million in pre-tax operating costs savings. It said it expects the Medical Device Excise Tax, which requires the makers of various medical devices to pay 2.3 percent of their gross U.S. revenues on such products beginning in 2013, to cost it about $150 million. If Stryker does an across-the-board cut of its 2,250-person Kalamazoo-area workforce, about 112 local workers would lose their jobs. About 1,002 of its worldwide workforce would be cut. “It’s unintended, but not unpredictable,” Owens said. “The layoffs next year at Stryker because of the law will affect a lot of families in the Kalamazoo area, including the families who depend on the local small businesses.” Owens said local restaurants, delicatessens, markets, gas stations, barber shops and other small retailers will be affected by the potential loss of Stryker employees. He called on Michigan's congressional delegation to reconsider the law before it causes more damage. The tax is part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law in March of 2010 by President Barack Obama. It is intended to help generate $20 billion in 10 years to help pay for universal health care. In its analyst blog, Zacks Equity Research wrote today: “The highly controversial tax, representing a part of the Patient Protection &amp; Affordable Care Act (labeled as "ObamaCare") enacted by the government-mandated healthcare reform in the U.S., will be a drag on devices companies.” Although it also stated that the downsizing and restructuring will enable Stryker “to realign resources and continue investment in strategic areas for growth,” Zacks said of the tax payout: “The outlay is expected to throttle innovation as it will impact investment in research and development. Moreover, it will lead to job cuts and higher prices for customers.”</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352980002730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 06:46:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352980030664-29</Id><Topic><Title>Remember when Obama PROMISED to cut the deficit in half</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1352929080769</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 16:38:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are correct, 4 more years of a LIAR.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1352980030664</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 06:47:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352983121577-30</Id><Title>PEACEFUL DISSOLUTION OF US.......MID-WEST, SOUTH-WEST, SOUTH-EAST UNITE WITH CANADA</Title><Msg>to form the newest, most powerful energy rich nation in history TexAnada.

Economists have long known that, in spite of the rhetoric about 'getting the government off our backs', the red states receive more federal spending, net of taxes, than the blue states. Alaska, Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, and the Dakotas topped the list of moochers in 2005. Despite Romney’s comments, it is the states with high percentages of people who pay no income tax that tend to vote Republican. Mississippi is number one, followed by Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas and South Carolina. The Democratic-leaning states of New England (comprising Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont), New York, New Jersey, and California are the ones paying into the federal treasury and subsidising everyone else. Updated data show the same pattern in 2007. The mid-Atlantic states, New England, Minnesota, and Illinois are the biggest net givers. Alaskans are the most dependent on the federal government, receiving $7,448 in spending (net of taxes) per capita. (That is not even counting the handouts of oil revenues that they get from their own state government). Those who claim to be fiscally conservative are the ones who in truth tend to be the biggest sources of deficits vis-à-vis the federal government.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1352991252557</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 09:54:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352991477906-48</Id><Title>red states are liars</Title><Msg>Sex is interesting. Notwithstanding fervent proclamations about the importance of abstaining from sex before marriage, evidence suggests that young people in red states do not act the way they talk. They do have sex before marriage, and it is less likely to be safe sex than among those in blue states. States that vote Republican have higher pregnancy rates among girls aged 15 to 17, as Figure 5 shows (the difference is highly significant statistically). They also have higher rates of the sexually-transmitted disease chlamydia (this difference, unlike the others, is not statistically significant at the aggregate state level, but is when combined into an overall measure of unsafe sex). Apparently the gap between what they say and what they do is particularly wide for teenagers who describe themselves as evangelical Christians. According to research by Mark Regnerus (a sociologist at the University of Texas, Austin), white evangelical adolescents usually (74%) state a belief in abstinence before marriage, but in fact are surprisingly more active sexually, compared to mainline Protestants and Jews who do not tend to state such a belief. When the believers in abstinence do engage in sex, they are less likely to use contraception than others.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1352991477906</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 09:57:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352991645669-49</Id><Title>We are getting tired of being polite</Title><Msg>It seems to me that, until now, 'liberals' who live in the blue states have, out of politeness, held back from suggesting that those who live in red states exhibit behaviour in their personal lives that falls short of the conservative rhetoric of personal responsibility in which their politicians revel. It would be unseemly and elitist to point fingers at any category of fellow Americans and imply that they are promiscuous, fat, gluttonous, lazy, uneducated, or that they are more prone to divorce and shootings. (Residents of blue states tend to be more educated and to have higher incomes than residents of red states, thus qualifying us as 'elites'.) Charles Murray features such statistics in his book, Coming Apart. Murray argues that those who live in the 'super zip codes' – the areas with high levels of income and education – are maintaining the traditional American values of hard work and family values. Those who live elsewhere show 'crashing' rates of industriousness and marriage. (His statistics look at white people only, so as to control for race.) Earlier studies had documented that divorce rates have declined among blue-state households, while they have continued to rise in red states. Carbone and Cahn (2010): “The areas of the country most committed to traditional values have the highest divorce and teen pregnancy rates.” (The decline in divorce is associated with educated women who delay marriage in the first place. Carbone and Cahn 2012, and Goldin and Katz 2002.) Many academic researchers and news media fear accusations of liberal bias. Murray may be immune from this fear. He is well-known as a conservative/libertarian whose book The Bell Curve dealt with black-white differences in test achievement.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1352991645669</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:00:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352992772542-50</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH CSCO ANALYST REPORT</Title><Username>danwilliam291</Username><Timestamp>1350653652093</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 09:34:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good alert</Msg><Username>jacobthompsons</Username><Timestamp>1352992772542</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:19:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352992944733-51</Id><Topic><Title>PEACEFUL DISSOLUTION OF US.......MID-WEST, SOUTH-WEST, SOUTH-EAST UNITE WITH CANADA</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1352983121577</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 07:38:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Red Workers will not support Blue Parasites.

Republicans tell us these comments convinced them that Romney just doesn’t get it, and that “47 percent” was no slip of the tongue. 4) Supporters would like Romney to sound like a leader, not a pundit. 5) Why alienate people now, when he could use his fame and platform to start or support some big philanthropic or civic effort? It's worth remembering that this push-back is coming from a group of politicians who only last week were still touting Romney as the nation's next president. The general reaction is also noticeably different from the one we saw this summer when Romney's 47-percent tape was playing on a near-constant loop on cable news networks and many of the candidate's surrogates were left largely standing behind the main thrust—if not the exact wording and tone—of those remarks.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353004483692</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:34:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353004686480-114</Id><Title>Israel started WWW3 in the middle east.</Title><Msg>First it was the factory in Sudan two moths back, then Hamas now, then Iran is next which would trigger WWW3.</Msg><Username>strong_iiiii</Username><Timestamp>1353004686480</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:38:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353004858630-115</Id><Topic><Title>REPUBLICANS have NO ONE TO BLAME for LOSING but their RACIST/BIGOTED SELVES!</Title><Username>dumbpainting</Username><Timestamp>1353003294309</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:14:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Democrats were still crying about the 2000 elections, even after they knew they won this one.

The missing lawmakers included Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who at the time of the top-secret briefing held a press conference in the Capitol to call for the creation of a Watergate-type special Congressional committee to investigate how and why the attack took place. – Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @PoliticalTicker McCain, who has accused President Barack Obama of not telling the truth about the Benghazi attack, said that even though there are several committees involved in the probe, only a select committee could streamline the information flow and resolve the "many unanswered questions" about the tragedy. When CNN approached McCain in a Capitol hallway Thursday morning, the senator refused to comment about why he missed the briefing, which was conducted by top diplomatic, military and counter-terrorism officials. Instead, McCain got testy when pressed to say why he wasn't there. "I have no comment about my schedule and I'm not going to comment on how I spend my time to the media," McCain said. Asked why he wouldn't comment, McCain grew agitated: "Because I have the right as a senator to have no comment and who the hell are you to tell me I can or not?” When CNN noted that McCain had missed a key meeting on a subject the senator has been intensely upset about, McCain said, "I'm upset that you keep badgering me." While McCain refused to shed light on why he didn't show, his spokesman Brian Rogers emailed CNN a short time later with an explanation. He blamed it on a "scheduling error" but wouldn't provide any more detail. According to a Democratic aide on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, only three of the eight GOP members of the committee attended the two hour briefing that ran from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. ET. By contrast, seven of the nine Democratic members were there.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353012900309</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:55:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353012964536-174</Id><Topic><Title>last time the joos stole the land</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353012429198</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:47:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>because I don't think Israel should murder children and old women I am a hater, LOL the rabbit hole is deeper then I thought</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353012964536</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:56:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353013044575-175</Id><Topic><Title>We're approaching total capitulation</Title><Username>waiting_for_total_capitulation</Username><Timestamp>1353011990380</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:39:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you could have another 5-6% downside but will see a double in the next two years, assuming Israel doesn't start WW3</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353013044575</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:57:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353013219470-176</Id><Topic><Title>No buyers.

All the Torah Sages of that time opposed them and opposed Zionism, saying that Zionism would lead only to destruction. However the true People of Israel will never change their nature or give up their Faith because of the strength the Creator gives them. Zionism is a foreign growth in the body of the Jewish People. The end will be that it will rid itself of this foreign growth and remain pure. Zionism has overcome the Jewish people by force, fraud and terror, but none of this will help them because the truth will always remain with the help of the Creator. Zionism will not replace the Jewish People. The Jewish People will remain strong in their faith and the Zionist State will cease to exist. It is therefore, our demand that the State that calls itself ISRAEL, should cease to exist. Since this won't be done, we demand that they cease to call themselves "Israel", because their entire being is in complete opposition to the true People of Israel. The true People of Israel deny them permission to call themselves by that name. The Zionist leaders have no right to set themselves up as the representatives and spokesmen of the true People of ISRAEL. Since we know they will not fulfill this demand either we feel that at least we cry out the truth. The truth will always remain the truth. By no means or force can the truth be changed. Even if all the world would say that one and one is three, the truth will remain that one and one is two. Let the truth be declared. The use of the Name "ISRAEL" by that State is a complete falsification. The People of Israel have nothing to do with that State. Zionism and its State have no share and no part in the true ISRAEL.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353013592521</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 16:06:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353013643020-181</Id><Topic><Title>No buyers.
