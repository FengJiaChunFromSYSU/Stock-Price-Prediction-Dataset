I'm not real wealthy but doing okay, bringing in enough to live on and save a bit besides my investment money. I don't know how you figure they screwed the middle class. Middle class taxes are the lowest they've been in 50 years except for the short time under OBAMA where social security taxes were lowered to help get us out of the Bush Depression and they've just gone back to where they would have been already. I think you're listening to way way way too much FOX News and believing it. In case you haven't noticed, the republican's have done everything they can in the past 12 years to hurt the lower and middle class and cater to the wants of the extremely wealthy. Acutally it goes back twenty years plus but accelerated when Bush won the white house and the republicans controlled the congress.</Msg><Username>larrymountainmankiwihero</Username><Timestamp>1381594009977</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 12:06:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381594414380-18</Id><Topic><Title>UNION WORKERS (FORMER D AND F STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL) PRODUCE INFERIOR PRODUCTS</Title><Username>lvl2gay</Username><Timestamp>1381547265733</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 23:07:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So which union do you belong to????</Msg><Username>av8lover</Username><Timestamp>1381594414380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 12:13:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381594641804-19</Id><Topic><Title>Another man of the people.</Title><Username>myrtletheturtle28</Username><Timestamp>1381535109226</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 19:45:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kind of shows the racial imbalance that exists in our legal system. A black man goes to prison for years while people like Mark Sanford of South Carolina stole from the people of South Carolina to pay for his exotic trips to Argentina to play with his mistress, while preaching family values. He never went to prison. In fact, the people of South Carolina put him in the US House of Reps after being caught. I know it doesn't say much for the intelligence of the people of South Carolina but that's a whole nother subject. How about Tom DeLay who misued hundreds of thousands of campaign funds and the republican judge in Texas has let him off. Is there any wonder how a guy can gun down an innocent young black kid in Florida and walk while they want to put a young black kid in prison for ten years for stealing a candy bar? What about the black woman who they put in jail in Florida for firing a warning shot and harming nobody because she was being attacked?

They have what we might call emotional policy goals. They want to wipe Obamacare, and Obama’s desires on taxation, and the entire Obama record, really, from the face of the earth, like Pharoah wanted to wipe Moses’s name from the obelisks. They don’t even really know what they want to win, as Indiana GOP Congressman Martin Stutzman famously said last week. But if it humiliates Obama, it’s a win. Bad for the country? That doesn’t matter either. To them, by definition, if it’s bad for Obama, it’s good for the country. They actually think this. And so, through a combination of a critical mass of anti-thought people in their caucus who won’t govern at all if it means seeing Obama come out OK, and a “leader” who can now plainly be called the weakest speaker since America became a country of consequence, the Republican Party has finally and fully succumbed to its cultural rage. It has used that rage mostly effectively for nigh on 50 years now, since Barry Goldwater. That rage has served it well on balance. It helped elect Nixon. It certainly helped elect Reagan, and even though it could be argued that once in office Reagan didn’t do that much to stoke it, he understood that he needed it to win, which is why he opened his 1980 campaign down in Mississippi, to say to his America that it was all right to resent black people, he understood you. The rage kept the base galvanized. It kept the enemy, or enemies—liberal and the media, often one and the same—in the gun sights. But it could also be controlled, the way Reagan controlled it. And even Dubya controlled it. The rich didn’t really share the rage, or most of them. Even the Koch Brothers probably don’t, what with all the froufrou artsy-fartsy outfits up in New York they help sustain. But all of them have used it. And they have tolerated it, the casual racism, the hatred of gay people, and the rest. They tolerated it because the booboisie voted the right way, and because they, the elites, remained in charge. Well, they’re not in charge now. The snarling dog they kept in a pen for decades has just escaped and bitten their hand off.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381611328156</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 16:55:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381611488055-34</Id><Title>the real reason the left fears the teaparty</Title><Msg>they know a third party will happen, they don't want it to come from conservative soil.
