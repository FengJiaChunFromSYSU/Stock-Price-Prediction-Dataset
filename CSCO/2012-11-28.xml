Miss Vicky Smegma received an e-mail this morning from the Facebook main office. The e-mail read: Dear Miss Smegma, You are too ugly to be on Facebook. We have received many complaints about your extreme ugliness and it must stop. You will be sued for millions of dollars if you do not comply. Have a nice day! Miss Smegma says she burst into tears after receiving the nasty e-mail. "How can people be so mean." she cried. "How can I have a nice day after receiving a notice like this." she sobbed some more. A Facebook representative did call later in the day and also spoke to the press: "Facebook is all about being superficial." said the representative. "We can't have ugly people on there--we have our standards." The representative called Miss Smegma and told her she was the ugliest woman he had ever seen. He also plans to sue the penniless spinster--just to be extra mean. "Maybe the old dog can go to UglyFacebook--we don't want her with us."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354108894334</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 08:21:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354111992458-10</Id><Topic><Title>THE REPULICANS ARE IN THE DRIVER SEAT........</Title><Username>lovemoney100</Username><Timestamp>1354076014433</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 23:13:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And the Dems will control the House in 2014</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354111992458</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 09:13:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354112590524-11</Id><Title>ANYBODY WANTS A PICTURE OF RHONDA...</Title><Msg>Just go to her facebook page.

Two months before the hijackings, FBI agents in Phoenix reported their suspicions about Arab students at a Phoenix flight school, and directly referred to the possibility of a connection to bin Laden. In a memo from the Phoenix FBI to headquarters, the agents recommended an urgent nationwide review of flight schools "for any information that supports Phoenix's suspicions" of a terrorist connection. The memo reportedly cited Osama bin Laden by name. The memo's existence has apparently been known for months, but until recently, lawmakers and congressional staff have not gained full access to it, and the direct reference to bin Laden had not been revealed. The memo has still has not been publicly released. Sens. Charles E. Grassley, Dianne Feinstein and Patrick Leahy are among the lawmakers asking the FBI to release it, and are demanding an investigation into the missed warning signs. Not Until After 9-11 Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, who has read the memo, told ABCNEWS today: "They raised a very serious terrorism concern and threat to the United States, and it involved the use of training at aviation schools and terrorists from the Middle East. That should have been fair warning." The memo said terrorists might be seeking jobs with U.S. airlines or airports and urged FBI headquarters to "obtain visa information" on all "individuals obtaining visas to attend these types of schools" around the country. None of that was done until after Sept. 11, after four hijacked airliners plowed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. More than 3,000 people were killed and the World Trade Center was destroyed.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354113047066</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 09:30:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354113457749-13</Id><Topic><Title>ANYBODY WANTS A PICTURE OF RHONDA...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1354112590524</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 09:23:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hurry, hurry, I can feel a take down coming.

Having offered commercial Wi-Fi services for its high-speed data customers since 2004, Cincinnati Bell is now deploying Ruckus ZoneFlex™ Smart Wi-Fi to support its business customers requiring managed, campus-wide Wi-Fi solutions such as local stadium venues, college campuses, and other hospitality establishments. Cincinnati Bell is also considering upgrading their current Wi-Fi hotspots to higher speed 802.11n using Ruckus Wireless Smart Wi-Fi. At one college campus in particular, with Ruckus ZoneFlex 802.11n products, Cincinnati Bell is supporting an average download of 440 gigabytes within a 24-hour period from only 100 students and their devices. "We're seeing a steady rise in interest and use of public Wi-Fi," said Paul McDaniel, network engineer at Cincinnati Bell. "As our deployment footprint grows to meet customer needs, we've seen a marked increase in the bandwidth required to meet the demand." According to Cincinnati Bell, higher smartphone penetration continues to drive wireless data services for its subscriber and commercial business. However, Wi-Fi as a best effort access technology is no longer acceptable to business customers and subscribers now armed with powerful, new, Wi-Fi-enabled tablet devices and smart phones. "Our business customers are looking for us to provide a comprehensive solution that includes true carrier-class Wi-Fi," said Mike Waggoner, senior product manager for Cincinnati Bell. "With Ruckus, we are improving our position on delivering to our customers what we believe is the best Wi-Fi products and technology." "With our legacy Wi-Fi system we were seeing performance degrade dramatically as more and more users were trying to connect to the same AP," said John Miller, integrated planner, Data and Transport Networking for Cincinnati Bell. "This is a real problem that conventional Wi-Fi was never really designed to address." With Ruckus Smart Wi-Fi, Cincinnati has been able to realize much greater user capacities per access point (AP) with better signal coverage. An adaptive antenna array integrated into every Ruckus Wi-Fi AP allows Cincinnati Bell to deploy less hardware that can support more users at greater distances. Cincinnati Bell's commercial Wi-Fi services are managed through Ruckus ZoneDirector Smart WLAN controllers, located at Cincinnati Bell's central office. Looking forward, Cincinnati Bell sees only more demand for Wi-Fi data services everywhere their subscribers roam. "We live in an always connect world. We see Smarter Wi-Fi technology as a cornerstone to satisfying applications as mobile Internet usage continues to grow," concluded Waggoner.</Msg><Username>lawstuff22</Username><Timestamp>1354117020305</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:37:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354117041038-27</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO can not compete with RKUS...</Title><Username>lawstuff22</Username><Timestamp>1354117020305</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:37:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>........</Msg><Username>lawstuff22</Username><Timestamp>1354117041038</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:37:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354118180773-28</Id><Title>Loser still groveling</Title><Msg>I see Junior is still trying to rattle cages to get somebody to talk to him.LOLOLOLOL Poor lonesome little twerp.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday sales dropped 0.3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 368,000-unit annual rate. Government data for new home sales are subject to substantial revisions. Indeed, the Commerce Department cut its estimate for September's sales rate to 369,000 from 389,000. The housing sector has been a point of relative strength this year in an economy beset by flagging business confidence and cooling demand from abroad, and Wednesday's report did not change the view that housing is still in recovery mode. "Despite the downward revisions, new home sales and the housing market in general are on the right path," said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an economist BNP Paribas in New York. "It's just that progress will be slow." The data leaves the pace of new home sales just below that reported in May, suggesting little upward momentum in the market for new homes. Stocks edged lower following the data's publication, also weighed down by investors' concerns that lawmakers might fail to strike a deal to avoid slashing the budget deficit next year, which would likely trigger a recession.

On election night as results trickled in, with strange voting anomalies surfacing, the margin of victory, particularly in the swing states, did not pass the “smell test.” Electoral fraud can occur at any stage in the process, but there are three main types: 1) debasing voter rolls with deceased, illegal, and fictitious voter registrations; 2) preventing eligible voters from voting by disenfranchisement, rendering unable to actually vote or duplicative votes, or instituting rules or tests that voters (particularly military absentee voters) are unable to comply; and 3) altering the results by interfering with the voting process or the counting of votes, or manipulating the means of voting through tampering with machines or altering results. There are numerous examples of each of these fraudulent activities taking place before, during, or after the November election. Nationwide it is estimated that there are 24 million ineligible voter registrations, including 1.8 million dead people listed as voters. The National Voter Registration Act includes provisions to ensure accurate and current voter registration rolls, but has never been enforced, despite known problems in many states. Dead people remain on the rolls, duplicates are not checked, and many registrations are suspect. There have been 400 cases of voter registration fraud prosecuted (ACORN under its many aliases) and 491 cases of absentee ballot abuse. The Columbus Dispatch estimated that more than 20% of registered Ohio voters aren’t eligible: in two counties there were 109 registered for every 100 eligible voters; and in 31 counties over 90% of eligible voters registered which is 20% higher than national average. Unless voter rolls are rigorously scrubbed each year, natural attrition will gradually erode the accuracy and dependability of the voter rolls. Obama lost in each and every state where voter ID laws were in place. A poll watcher in Pennsylvania reported that up to 10% of ballots cast reverted to a default of Obama. Voters in Nevada, North Carolina, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin had touch screen voting machines that recorded Obama, even after Romney was selected. Republican poll watchers in multiple states were either turned away or not allowed to enter the precincts or thrown out once they had done so. People were openly bragging that they voted twice or more. In North Carolina, workers at a group home coaxed residents into voting for Obama. In Flushing, NY a Korean-American translator directed voters to vote for Democrat candidates. In St. Louis, voters found that someone had already voted with an absentee ballot in their name, forcing the use of provisional ballots. In Ohio, Democrats bussed Somali non-US citizen voters, who could not speak English from state to state, to vote for Obama. In Maine, a busload of black people was transported from rural town to rural town to vote. Only 20% of the overseas military turned in absentee ballots in 2008 and less than half were ever received and counted, and predictions are that it will even be worse in 2012. Requiring voter identification does not suppress the vote, but it does suppress the illegal votes. It is clear that there were multiple cases where people’s votes were not accurately recorded and ineligible people were able to poison the results with ineligible votes. There are far too many examples of precincts that delivered fraudulent votes in key cities to pack the totals that may have impacted who got the electoral votes in many swing states. This tactic was so pervasive it earned its own name of “spigot cities.” In 59 Philadelphia, PA precincts, Obama recorded 100% of the votes. In Cleveland, OH districts, Obama recorded 100% of the votes. In 100 precincts in Ohio, Obama recorded 99% of the votes. In Broward County, FL precincts, Obama received over 99% of the votes. In one precinct, a rout over 99% is a possibility but hundreds of precincts recording over 99% exceed any possibility of credibility. In St. Lucie County, FL, 141% of eligible voters turned out to vote! (Statistically impossible) In Ohio, Obama won a county by 108% of registered voters. In two counties in Colorado, voting turnout exceeded the voter-age population. It is believed that this systemic voter fraud is protected by the Voting Section of the Justice Department, and that no meaningful investigations will ever take place to understand these voting “anomalies.” The sheer volume of fraudulent activities, centered on the swing states, suggests a concerted effort to influence the results of the November election. The final totals of absentee ballots cast and actually counted have not yet been released, but new record low turnouts are predicted. Even if the number of fraudulent votes counted did not swing individual election results, the piloting of these criminal techniques portends bigger problems in future elections where these proven techniques can be rolled out beyond deep blue precincts. Massive and systemic electoral fraud seems to be the newest and slickest way for Democrats to steal elections. Eighty eight percent of Americans who voted in November support establishing national standards for voting, including the hours polls are open, who is eligible to vote, and the design of ballots. The fact that there are very few examples of voter fraud prosecuted each year is more a reflection of the partisan nature of this administration than an indication of its scarcity. The American people are disgusted by the hint of electoral fraud and want it completely removed. The DOJ has fought against state initiated voter identification laws, despite proof that when voter id was enforced in Georgia higher voter turnout was achieved and no instances of voters being denied. Now is the time to invest in an internet enabled voting system based on a unique voter id that can be designed to be as secure as our banking system. The military would be an ideal pilot since the current approach is steadily eroding their ability to participate in this most important right and responsibility of citizenship.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1354119502538</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 11:18:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354119539766-34</Id><Topic><Title>MOMENTUM ON THE SIDE OF DEMOCRATS</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1354118998657</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 11:09:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fun to see you reading my clever, witty posts!

House Speaker John Boehner immediately shot down the call by veteran Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma for the chamber to approve the Senate measure, saying he disagreed with his colleague. House GOP aides insisted there was no plan to bring the proposal up for a vote. However, the public call by Cole -- which echoed similar statements from conservatives in recent weeks -- as well as his prediction that the Senate proposal would pass in the House showed an increasing desire among House Republicans to move beyond an issue that has harmed them.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354132018740</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 14:46:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354132121932-74</Id><Topic><Title>remember when 9-11 occurred</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354071110016</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 21:51:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep...

Bush said, we will attack “at a time of our choosing.” He dismissed the United Nations, saying “The United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities. So we will rise to ours.” He chose to attack Iraq on the evening of March 19, 2003, and he did so with shock and awe, but without legality under international law. Less than two months later, Bush dressed up in a flight suit, landed on the aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, stood under a sign that said “Mission Accomplished,” and boasted with his usual shortsightedness, “In the Battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.” The people of the world will have prevailed when Mr. Bush is on trial at the International Criminal Court.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354133184308</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 15:06:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354133292672-80</Id><Title>DROOLING DEMOCRATS DELIRIOUS WITH DEBT INDUCED EUPHORIA...</Title><Msg>when they return to 'normal', that is only slightly drunk, the massive debt that will halt all American progress will bite them in the tender regions...and then all of America will rejoice as Democrats writhe in agony, the same way they have burned to ashes America's future...oh it's good!!!!

The two had met as freshmen at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, in 2005, and two years later Tyler started a prayer group, a former longtime member of the group told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was afraid of retaliation from Tyler Deaton. Tyler Deaton was listed at one point as a division coordinator for IHOPU's "friendship groups," but the school said that was a mistake. It issued a statement distancing itself from Tyler Deaton after Moore, a student at IHOPU, was arrested. "Since Bethany's death it has come to light that over five years ago, both she and Mr. Moore joined an independent, close-knit, religious group in Georgetown, Texas," the school said in a statement. "This religious group of fewer than 20 people was led by Tyler Deaton. They relocated to Kansas City over the last few years and operated under a veil of secrecy." IHOPU is the educational arm of International House of Prayer of Kansas City, an evangelical Christian group focused on missions and preparation for the end of time. The Deatons' prayer group had at least two houses, with women living in one and men in another. Bethany Deaton, 27, moved into the men's house with Tyler Deaton after they married in August. According to the criminal complaint, Moore told police that men in the house began drugging Bethany Deaton and sexually assaulting her soon after she moved in. He said she was seeing a therapist and group members became concerned she would tell the therapist about the assaults. Moore and other men who lived in the house told police that several group members also were having sexual relations with Tyler Deaton, unbeknownst to his wife. One man, whose name was blacked out of the criminal complaint, told police that Tyler Deaton said after Bethany Deaton died that he had had a dream he killed his wife by suffocating her. Moore told detectives Tyler Deaton instructed him to kill Bethany Deaton because he knew Moore had it in him to do it, and that Moore reported back to Tyler Deaton after she was dead. Moore told police that he had placed a bag over Bethany Deaton's head and held it there until her body shook.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354138525126</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 16:35:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354139174264-92</Id><Topic><Title>most republicans like to pretend like bush was never president....</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354138635385</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 16:37:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>or you could just get a job and not make stuff up all day on a stock message board because you are a lonly loser. seriously, dont you have somthing better to do with your life all day?</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1354139174264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 16:46:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354139357969-93</Id><Title>THE SECOND PRESIDENT BUSH, MOST ACCOMPLISHED PRSIDENT SINCE LINCOLN, IS NOW</Title><Msg>standing in the wings, poised to assist this most incompetent goober in history, President Goober Obimbo!!!

Take his legislative agenda. No Child Left Behind is now widely unpopular among both liberals and conservatives—so unpopular that Congress has spent the past five years assiduously avoiding a vote to reauthorize it. His tax cuts expired in 2010 and are now little more than a political football. His own party wants to repeal key provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley. The Supreme Court has effectively gutted campaign finance reform. On the foreign policy front, his wars are widely viewed as expensive failures. And he was never able to get so much as a vote on Social Security privatization or immigration reform. That doesn't leave much. Pretty much all that's left is the PATRIOT Act and the Medicare prescription drug bill. That's not much for eight years. Beyond that, neither party wants anything to do with him. It's not surprising that Democrats still think of him as the Frat Boy President, one of the worst of all time, but what is surprising is that Republicans largely agree.And the bonus, cost of both precious wars $3 TRILLION and counting.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354155305189</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 21:15:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354156929144-140</Id><Title>Who's pulling those strings?</Title><Msg>Two Billionaires Are Pulling Grover Norquist's Strings Posted: 28 Nov 2012 07:00 AM PST I wonder why Eric Holder doesn't bring a RICO suit against Grover, Turd Blossom, and the Koch brothers? After all, you could make a reasonable case for extortion: Grover tells Republican officials to vote his way, or he will drown them in a primary challenge. It doesn't seem like that's how democracy is supposed to work. Lee Fang for The Nation: Grover Norquist’s iron grip over much of the Republican Party is somewhat puzzling. Why should Senators and other lawmakers listen to a guy caught laundering money for Jack Abramoff? But consider Norquist’s tax pledge and political power another way: that he’s just a proxy for the powerful interest groups that finance him. In the nineties, it was big tobacco that used Norquist’s tax pledge as a cover to lobby lawmakers against cigarette taxes (Norquist still uses an e-mail system donated to him by Altria to send out Tea Party action alerts against tobacco taxes). Now, big PhRMA and other industry groups provide grants to Norquist while his foundation endorses other giveaways, like protectionist support against importing cheaper drugs from Canada and the classification of tax subsidies to refineries as “tax cuts” that must not be cut. I took a look at the last available budget numbers for Americans for Tax Reform, Norquist’s group. Though they do not reveal their donors, we can cobble together much of Norquist’s donors using foundations and other nonprofits that donate money to him. The disclosures show that only two billionaire-backed groups have provided over 66 percent of Norquist’s funding: • The Center to Protect Patients Rights donated $4,189,000 to Americans for Tax Reform in 2010, 34 percent of the group’s budget that year. • Crossroads GPS donated $4,000,000 to Americans for Tax Reform in 2010, 32.46 percent of the group’s budget that year. The Center to Protect Patients Rights is the foundation used by the billionaire clique led by the Koch brothers to distribute grants to allied groups. In 2010, wealthy moguls like Steve Bechtel of Bechtel Corporation and Steve Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group met behind closed doors to help lend money to these types of efforts. Crossroads GPS is the undisclosed group run by Karl Rove. The only known donors are folks like Paul Singer, the “vulture” hedge fund king who benefits enormously from tax strategies like the carried interest loophole. Norquist’s pledge largely benefits billionaires like Singer and Schwarzman, who pay almost nothing in payroll taxes and likely pay a lower rate than their secretaries.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354156929144</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 21:42:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354159070779-141</Id><Title>GO Grover GO!</Title><Msg>Every day that Grover's charade continues, every day that what's left of the GOP is extorted, is one day closer to the utter collapse of the blind donor system.
