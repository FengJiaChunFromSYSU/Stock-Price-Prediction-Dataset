Timothy Roemer, a former Democratic congressman, asked him when he first found out about the report from the FBI's Minnesota field office that Zacarias Moussaoui, an Islamic jihadist, had been taking lessons on how to fly a 747. Tenet replied that he was briefed about the case on Aug. 23 or 24, 2001. Advertisement Roemer then asked Tenet if he mentioned Moussaoui to President Bush at one of their frequent morning briefings. Tenet replied, "I was not in briefings at this time." Bush, he noted, "was on vacation." He added that he didn't see the president at all in August 2001. During the entire month, Bush was at his ranch in Texas. "You never talked with him?" Roemer asked. "No," Tenet replied. By the way, for much of August, Tenet too was, as he put it, "on leave."</Msg><Username>rationalthought11</Username><Timestamp>1347364430682</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 07:53:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347364505036-23</Id><Topic><Title>how many homosexuals on this board</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1347233103995</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 19:25:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that what you tell all your LOG CABIN REPUB buddies, Walter?</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1347364505036</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 07:55:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347364529971-24</Id><Title>WASHPOST/ABC POLL....OBAMA 48% ROMNEY 47%...</Title><Msg>when the incumbent cannot get over 50% HE'S DOOOOOOMED!!!

Interviews I conducted with New Hampshire voters last month reveal the political liabilities of telling potential Republican voters exactly what the Romney-Ryan ticket intends to cut. Two voters, both Republicans, told me they could not bring themselves to vote for their party this year because the Ryan budget cuts spending for veterans’ benefits. In an interview days after Romney announced on a Saturday that he had picked Ryan, George Lemieux said, “Based on what Romney did this weekend, I would not vote for him.” Lemieux, a 67-year-old Vietnam War veteran who spent 26 years in the Army, declared that “Ryan wants to decimate Medicare; he wants to decimate the V.A. I have a brother who is dependent on V.A. disability, and he wants to cut it out entirely.” “The Ryan budget will kill everybody,” said Aura-Lee Nicodemus, another woman I met, who works at the V.A. Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt. and is active in the advocacy organization, Disabled American Veterans. “I’m a registered Republican and I can’t vote for Romney. His actions speak louder than words.” There is a clear rationale for their concerns. Under the Ryan budget, “Mandatory and Defense and Nondefense Discretionary Spending” – which includes Function 920 Allowances, but excludes Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — would fall from 12.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 2011 to 6.75 percent in 2023, 5.75 percent in 2030, 4.75 percent in 2040 and 3.75 percent in 2050, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347365666200</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 08:14:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347365903335-29</Id><Topic><Title>My Etch-N-Sketch Record Shows I Win 55% of My Debates with Empty Chairs</Title><Username>roboromney_version_2012</Username><Timestamp>1347217442507</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 15:04:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, but you will not be debateing an empty chair, your opponent is an empty suit.</Msg><Username>nidan7500</Username><Timestamp>1347365903335</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 08:18:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347366191673-30</Id><Title>Ronmey=no to social security and medicare BUT more money for defense and wars..</Title><Msg>Mitt is UNFIT</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1347366191673</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 08:23:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347366247913-31</Id><Title>Mitt Ronmey =SHOW YOUR TAXES OR NO VOTE..</Title><Msg>What are you hiding????????????</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1347366247913</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 08:24:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347366373018-32</Id><Title>Ronmey "I feel your pain",,what a LIE=Mitt is UNFIT</Title><Msg>Show your taxes</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1347366373018</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 08:26:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347367060717-33</Id><Title>ROMNEY MADE BIGGEST ROOKIE MISTAKE POSSIBLE--HE LET OBAMA DEFINE HIM!!!

CBS News spoke with Eichenwald Monday. He said, "What I've been able to see are the presidential daily briefs before August 6 of 2001. And they're horrific, and they are - our reports are 'an attack is coming,' 'there are going to be mass casualties.' The worst of them, the Pentagon, the neo-conservatives at the Pentagon, as the CIA was coming in saying, 'al-Qaeda's going to attack,' said, 'Oh, this is just a false flag operation. Bin laden is trying to take our attention off of the real threat, Iraq.' And so there are presidential daily briefs that are literally saying, 'No they're wrong, this isn't fake, it's real.'" "CBS This Morning" co-host Norah O'Donnell said, "Then when a lot of people hear this, aren't they going to say, 'This is another example of where, not just the Bush administration, but our intelligence community dropped the ball. They failed to heed the warnings that were in a number of these (documents) that went all the way up to the president of the United States.'" Eichenwald replied, "Actually, the counterterrorist center of the CIA did a spectacular job, and that's what really comes down. You know, in the aftermath, the White House and others said, 'Well they didn't tell us enough.' No, they told them everything they needed to know to go on a full alert and the White House didn't do it."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347367369991</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 08:42:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347368658286-36</Id><Title>GEORGE WILL- ROMNEY'S ARITHMETIC DOESN'T ADD UP!</Title><Msg>GEORGE WILL IMPLIES ROMNEY WILL SCREW OVER THE MIDDLE CLASS it's ARITHMETIC there's NO WAY we can incur $5 TRILLION in tax cuts AND $2 TRILLION MORE in defense spending without affecting the middle class and poor which is WHY george will said: "There is uncertainty surrounding the Romney-Ryan tax cut plan, because they have not specified the deductions that will be closed," Will said. "And we know where the big money is: mortgage interest deductions, charitable deductions, taxing that's compensation, which it is, employee-provided health insurance, and state and local taxes. All of those, you either hit only the rich, in which case you don't get much money, or you hit the middle class." reagan's guy, bruce bartlett said: Mr. Romney has said that his charitable contributions are akin to tax payments insofar as both finance social welfare. Of course, social welfare is only a small portion of federal spending that would get even smaller under Mr. Romney’s budget proposal. The distribution of income is extremely relevant for Mr. Romney tax plan. He has said that he will close enough tax loopholes so that the wealthy will pay the same share of taxes they are paying now, even though he will cut their income tax rates by 20 percent. However, he has also said that the current low rates on dividends and capital gains, which expire at year’s end, will be made permanent. Thus Mr. Romney would preserve exactly those provisions of the tax code most responsible for millionaires like himself paying tax rates considerably lower than those with a fraction of his income, like Mr. Ryan. It is principally for this reason that the Tax Policy Center recently concluded that Mr. Romney’s numbers don’t add up. Either he will greatly increase the deficit or he will have to raise taxes on the middle class to maintain revenue neutrality. Even if every deduction, exclusion and credit for the wealthy was abolished, their taxes would still go down under Mr. Romney’s plan. For someone who has made his business acumen and expertise with finance a cornerstone of his presidential run, that Mr. Romney’s signature campaign proposal doesn’t add up may be the most telling fact voters need to know about him.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1347368658286</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:04:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347369455865-37</Id><Title>CSCO strong sell</Title><Msg>Network equipment sales stalled.</Msg><Username>pn1409</Username><Timestamp>1347369455865</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:17:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347370786872-38</Id><Title>Whats UP with CSCO...

CBS News' Norah O'Donnell put Paul Ryan's feet to the fire for criticizing President Obama for defense spending cuts after he supported them himself. Mitt Romney's "Meet the Press" appearance put the cuts back in the spotlight on Sunday. The candidate said that Republicans made a "mistake" when they agreed to a debt ceiling deal that would decrease defense spending by $500 billion over the next ten years. O'Donnell did not give Ryan on an easy pass on the issue. "He's talking about you because you voted for those cuts, correct?" she asked him. Ryan said that he voted for the cuts because he was trying to find "common ground" with the Democrats to reduce the budget deficit. He added that he wrote a bill that would have reduced spending elsewhere and prevented "the president’s irresponsible, devastating defense cuts." O'Donnell continued to press Ryan, saying that the defense cuts were part of the Budget Control Act and that he supported the act. She went a step further and quoted him calling the legislation a "victory" and a "positive step forward." "So, you voted for defense cuts, and now you’re criticizing the president for those same defense cuts that you voted for and called a victory," O'Donnell said. "The goal was never that these defense cuts actually occur," Ryan responded. He said that he supported a sequestration measure, which would have triggered automatic cuts if the supercommittee did not reach a deal. O'Donnell said that the act also contained $1 trillion in immediate cuts, including the defense cuts. "And you also voted for those, and now you're saying you didn't vote for them?" she asked. He said that the Obama administration proposed $478 billion in defense cuts, in addition to cutting about $500 billion in defense from the sequestration. "Right. A trillion dollars in defense spending, and you voted for it!" O'Donnell shot back.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347374106582</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:35:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347374462860-43</Id><Topic><Title>WASHPOST/ABC POLL....OBAMA 48% ROMNEY 47%...</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1347364529971</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 07:55:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama got a better bounce out of his convention than Romney.

Adelson has vowed to spend as much as $100 million to help sway the 2012 election. According to a new report by Seth Hanlon, the director of fiscal reform at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, Adelson could turn that investment into a $2 billion tax cut if Romney is elected. From Hanlon's report on how Romney's tax plan could benefit Adelson: • Cut top tax rates, saving Adelson approximately $1.5 million on his annual compensation as chief executive of his casino company. • Maintain the special low rates on dividends, potentially saving Adelson nearly $120 million on a single year’s worth of dividends, more than enough to recoup his politi- cal donations. • Maintain the special low rates on capital gains, allowing Adelson to make back his political donations in capital gains tax cuts just by selling a fraction of his stock. • Provide a tax windfall of an estimated $1.2 billion to Adelson’s company, Las Vegas Sands Corp., on untaxed profits from its Asian casinos, as well as a tax exemption forfuture overseas profits. Adelson’s casinos already enjoy a special foreign tax exemp- tion from the Chinese administrative region of Macau, and Gov. Romney would make those foreign profits exempt from U.S. taxes as well. • Eliminate the estate tax, potentially providing a staggering $8.9 billion windfall to Adelson’s heirs.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347375527071</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:58:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347375606118-47</Id><Title>WALTER STILL CAN'T FIND A POLL that has MITT ROMNEY ahead of OBAMA ?

Why?

That's how you get things done. The other thing - STEPHANOPOULOS: Isn't that a - secret plan? RYAN: - we don't want to - no, no. No, no. What we don't want is a secret plan.

Not anymore. Back then the landscape looked quite promising for Romney to beat Barack Obama. After all, Obama was a Democratic president presiding over one of the worst recessions since the Great Depression, a doctrinaire liberal out of sync with most Americans, and a man who apparently has lacked the leadership to forge compromises in Washington to get the nation moving again. But months later, Mitt Romney is behind in national tracking polls, most importantly in almost every swing state. A leading GOP official on Capitol Hill told me in Tampa that Romney can't win Ohio and he won't win Virginia. How could this happen? If I could put my finger on it, I would say the Romney campaign has been poorly managed. They haven't staged their candidate well and their messaging has been incoherent, to put it nicely. We saw this mismanagement early in the primary. Romney's campaign should have locked up their candidate's nomination by January. But the campaign team decided they didn't want to owe the conservative base of the GOP much, so they decided to forego the usual outreach efforts. Instead, they spent tens of millions of dollars in attack ads against fellow Republicans. Four months later, they had the nomination but at a nasty political cost. ... ... I thought the most telling moment of the Tampa convention was Chris Christie's speech. Christie was given the keynote speaking slot. It is considered the most important speech second to the nominee's and afforded prime-time coverage. Much has been made of the fact Christie used it as an infomercial for himself, and barely mentioned either Romney or Obama for that matter. It's important to remember that Romney's campaign strategists also have worked for Christie. So reading the tea leaves of Christie's "out for himself" speech, I can only conclude Romney's advisers are either incompetent or have significant doubts about Romney will to win, hence Christie's distancing act. Romney himself seems to have a difficult time grappling with messaging. Granted, his strengths are in business, not in communications. This is why his campaign team is so important. So far, their advice and messaging have fallen woefully short. Romney hasn’t helped. His selection of Paul Ryan, a rising star congressman who few thought had presidential stature and has no foreign policy credentials, has further confused Romney's message. By tapping Ryan, Romney highlighted congressional Republican efforts to abolish Medicare, a dream issue for the Obama campaign. So a campaign that should have been increasingly focused on Obama's job performance has become one about Medicare and the Ryan plan... ... Earlier this summer Rupert Murdoch tweeted a message that may turn out to be prophetic: "Tough O Chicago pros will be hard to beat unless he [Romney] drops old friends from team and hires some real pros. Doubtful." Obama critics have been touting Edward Klein's new bestselling book about Obama entitled "Amateur." But it's looking more and more that Obama is no amateur, while the Romney campaign has more than their fair share of them.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347388806002</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:40:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347389305628-94</Id><Topic><Title>PLANET KOLOB, THAT'S WHERE GOD LIVES ACCORDING TO MORMONS.

John Bolton, Bush’s U.N. ambassador and an especially combative member of the neoconservative contingent so closely linked with that administration, has been part of Romney’s inner circle throughout the year. Cofer Black, a former top executive at the Bush-era security contractor once called Blackwater, is a top adviser to Romney on intelligence issues, shaping his views on subjects such as interrogations of terrorism suspects. And Dan Senor, who was a top official in the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq in the year after the invasion, is now at the right hand of vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan. Senor was also cited as one of the influential thinkers behind some of Romney’s controversial comments during his trip to Israel, when he said the innate superiority of Israeli culture is one reason the Israelis are doing better economically than the Palestinians.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347395951907</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 16:39:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347396426726-118</Id><Topic><Title>IT FIGURES THAT GREG, RHONDA AND WETBRAIN WERE MISSING TODAY</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1347394026586</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 16:07:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not as much as everybody laughs at you,buddy.</Msg><Username>crankf41</Username><Timestamp>1347396426726</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 16:47:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347396613473-119</Id><Topic><Title>IT FIGURES THAT GREG, RHONDA AND WETBRAIN WERE MISSING TODAY</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1347394026586</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 16:07:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing funny about Junior.

Past targets have included gays, feminists and pagans, atheists, people with Alzheimer's, adoptive parents, Haitians and people who don't pray enough. This time, the televangelist focused his ire on wives who fail to properly obey their husbands. On Monday's broadcast of Robertson's television show "The 700 Club," he answered a question from a viewer named Michael about how to repair his marriage to a woman who "has no respect for me as the head of the house." Robertson's response: "Well, you could become a Muslim and you could beat her." Bizarrely, this comment elicited laughter from Robertson's co-host, Terry Meeuwsen. Unfortunately, Robertson didn't stop there. "I don’t think we condone wife-beating these days but something has got to be done to make her." He also called the woman a "rebellious child" who doesn't want to "submit to any authority." However, since the Scripture doesn't allow for divorce, Robertson urged the husband to "move to Saudi Arabia," where, ostensibly, beating the woman would be permissible. WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE. According to Right Wing Watch, the very same clip was edited when posted on the Christian Broadcast Network's website in order to remove the offensive rhetoric.
