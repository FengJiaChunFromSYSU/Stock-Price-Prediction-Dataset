The records obtained by the Justice Department listed outgoing calls for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, for general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and for the main number for the AP in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. It was not clear if the records also included incoming calls or the duration of the calls. In all, the government seized the records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. The exact number of journalists who used the phone lines during that period is unknown, but more than 100 journalists work in the offices where phone records were targeted, on a wide array of stories about government and other matters. In a letter of protest sent to Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation. He demanded the return of the phone records and destruction of all copies. "There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters. These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know," Pruitt said.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368535129447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 08:38:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368535213144-20</Id><Topic><Title>Obama in trouble?</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368535129447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 08:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone can beat Obama, right?</Msg><Username>ubiquitous_board_troll</Username><Timestamp>1368535213144</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 08:40:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368535316986-21</Id><Topic><Title>Obama in trouble?</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368535129447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 08:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hussein operates right out of Hitler's Handbook.

Issa ended up backtracking on that one, too, and it was super awkward when it came out that Issa never asked for him to appear.</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368537245283</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:14:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368537258143-35</Id><Topic><Title>Obama in trouble?</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368535129447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 08:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as they can find a club.</Msg><Username>ivanhoeofloxxly</Username><Timestamp>1368537258143</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:14:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368537292116-36</Id><Title>Capitalism will win in the end</Title><Msg>The game is over for the communist party.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368537292116</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:14:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368537645481-37</Id><Topic><Title>Capitalism will win in the end</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368537292116</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:14:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>has been since reagan though bush did give away trillions of taxpayer money bush is the biggest us commie in history</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368537645481</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:20:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368538148772-38</Id><Title>Watch what you say</Title><Msg>We now have an administration who wont use the word terrorist but if you use the word patriot, they will come after you.</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1368538148772</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:29:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368538211211-39</Id><Topic><Title>Obama in trouble?</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368535129447</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 08:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>threat against the PRESIDENT? reported!</Msg><Username>kill_the_guilty_not_the_innocent</Username><Timestamp>1368538211211</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:30:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368538271916-40</Id><Title>If O'Bama is impeached</Title><Msg>… the 4 Americans he murdered won't have died in vain. . .

"To maintain discipline in the military, it must have been necessary at that time," Hashimoto said. "For soldiers who risked their lives in circumstances where bullets are flying around like rain and wind, if you want them to get some rest, a comfort women system was necessary. That's clear to anyone." Historians say up to 200,000 women, mainly from the Korean Peninsula and China, were forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers in military brothels. China's Foreign Ministry criticized the mayor's comments and saw them as further evidence of a rightward drift in Japanese politics under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368538881062</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:41:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368539367621-47</Id><Topic><Title>conservative tea billies wonder why women won't vote for them, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368538881062</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:41:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, FDR and the dems were much nicer to Japanese women.

And for the first time in Obama's presidency, the damage to his regime may be permanent. Three revelations have come together like an avalanche. First, there was a Benghazi hearing that proved beyond any reasonable doubt that this administration is feckless, dishonest, and cravenly politicized. But in its aftermath on Friday, an executive branch information dump dropped another bombshell: the IRS does indeed target and intimidate conservative groups. This appalling admission from a senior IRS official was obviously meant to slide into the news cycle and dissipate over the weekend. This unseemly public relations gambit has become a hallmark of the Obama approach to all issues, regardless of their importance to the nation. Deny or delay, spin and win. And, to the discredit of our electorate, it has worked--until perhaps now.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368544149825</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:09:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368544291874-93</Id><Title>Professional Politician exposed good luck mr president.</Title><Msg>Such sweeping intrusion upon a news organization's privacy--exposing all its sources and chilling all speech in the process--makes a mockery of the Constitution's guarantee of not "abridging the freedom of speech."

Even the phrase “making America a better place to live” began getting applications for 501c(4) status reviewed.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368546306905</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:45:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368546387454-109</Id><Topic><Title>REPUBS shouldn't have reduced embassy security funding- look what happened in BENGHAZI !!</Title><Username>godwithamerica</Username><Timestamp>1368546302085</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:45:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bush did it right jr ROTFLOL fn idiot Oh look new jr id -Member since: Apr 15, 2013</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368546387454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:46:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368546393477-110</Id><Topic><Title>Comunists hate American values</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368546306905</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:45:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes the guy who was in charge of the IRS at the time was a bush appointee as we know - bush was the biggest commie in american history</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368546393477</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:46:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368546451187-111</Id><Topic><Title>REPUBS shouldn't have reduced embassy security funding- look what happened in BENGHAZI !!</Title><Username>godwithamerica</Username><Timestamp>1368546302085</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:45:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no, REPUBS did it !</Msg><Username>godwithamerica</Username><Timestamp>1368546451187</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:47:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368546513723-112</Id><Title>Questions for Repubs to Ponder:</Title><Msg>Questions for Repubs to Ponder: A terrorist is driving down the road and get's a flat tire.

The upgrades averaged about PT 25.50. I thought LAST Q, was inflection point for CSCO earnings as the EPS. spiked up on SOFTWARE. If that was the REAL beginning of software traction they could not just beat by .02-.03, but by around .05-.06. I think if we do eps. .49-.52 the stock languishes, but if SOFTWARE did real well, and eps., is .54-.55 a .05-.06 beat we start a run to fair value, So SHUT UP Chambers.

The first House hearings and again the one last week established thorugh eyewitness accounts and corroborated by State Dept officels, that the funding had no impact on Benghazi. It was completely the fault of State Dept officials that not only neglected to initially provide the proper security, but when asked for increased security, reduced it at their discretion, then refused to send help during 7 hours of a pre-planned attack, then changed the CIA intelligence report, then continued on a campaign of lies misrepresenting the truth because it didn't fit with the narrative of "Osama is dead and the AQ is on the run". Tihe act of a terrorist is an act of terror and a terroristic act when done to inflict mass casualties and incite terror. Osama's little twist on words was cute (as he always does) but he said, "no act of terror will ... " . He didn't refer to Benghazi as a terror attack and didn't for weeks, including his address near the caskets, Letterman, the View, the UN, Telemundo, Daily Show, etc..

Nor do they remember the it was Nixon who ordered the IRS to deeply audit and investigate democrat fat cats. Given the obvious increased urgency for diversity in the GOP a decade or so from now, it seems hard to imagine that the adults in the room would shake down the first minority President over something that everyone will have obviously forgotten in five years' time. Unless you believe the lunatics really are running the asylum, it just seems vanishingly unlikely that impeachment would occur.

Meanwhile Congressional Republicans remain very unpopular with a 36/57 favorability rating. Voters think Congress should be more focused on other major issues right now rather than Benghazi. By a 56/38 margin they say passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill is more important than continuing to focus on Benghazi, and by a 52/43 spread they think passing a bill requiring background checks for all gun sales should be a higher priority. While voters overall may think Congress' focus should be elsewhere there's no doubt about how mad Republicans are about Benghazi. 41% say they consider this to be the biggest political scandal in American history to only 43% who disagree with that sentiment. Only 10% of Democrats and 20% of independents share that feeling."

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia), sounded the first discordant note at a press briefing this morning, telling reporters, “The time for wasting day after day investigating Benghazi is over. The American people are counting us to waste our time repealing Obamacare yet again.” Warning that “the American people don’t have an endless appetite for meaningless political theater,” Cantor added, “If we’re going to do something that’s purely symbolic, pointless, and detached from reality, I say it should be repealing Obamacare for the thirtieth or fortieth time.” Rep. Cantor’s comments drew a strong rebuke from Darrell Issa (R-California), who has spearheaded the investigation into Benghazi: “Quite frankly, we have all the time in the world to blow repealing Obamacare. The moment to waste our time investigating Benghazi is now.” Noting that previous attempts to repeal Obamacare had cost the taxpayers approximately fifty million dollars, Issa said, “I think we’re entitled to spend at least that much, if not more, investigating Benghazi again and again and again.” But even as the debate raged over whether Obamacare or Benghazi was more worthy of Congress’ wasted time, House Speaker John Boehner offered a third point of view: “Personally, I think the time we’re wasting on Benghazi and Obamacare could be better spent blocking progress on guns and immigration.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368550856565</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 13:00:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368550866749-148</Id><Topic><Title>Bernanke is working</Title><Username>pn1409</Username><Timestamp>1368530721439</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 07:25:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea, but it's working.

Everyday You Have To Twist The Truth!</Title><Msg>Fox News, the unofficial arm of the Republican Party that claims to be fair and balanced, is conducting an all-out assault on President Obama, doing everything from letting Mitt Romney advisers masquerade as objective commentators to ignoring facts when a high-profile Obama critic or Fox News commentator makes unfounded charges. MediaMatters.org, the watchdog group, has cataloged numerous instances of Fox’s one-sided and unethical behavior. “Fox News has repeatedly hosted advisers to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney without disclosing that they are helping his campaign. Media Matters examined recent appearances by advisers John Bolton, Jay Sekulow and Walid Phares, who have all appeared on Fox News and criticized the Obama administration. Bolton and Phares are Fox News contributors, while Sekulow is a frequent Fox News guest,” the group stated. “Bolton, a Romney foreign policy adviser, said on Fox News that Obama’s foreign policy is ‘confused and incoherent and incompetent’ and defended Romney’s foreign policy experience.

Rumsfeld was telling his aides to come up with plans for striking Iraq At 9:53 a.m., just 15 minutes after the hijacked plane had hit the Pentagon, and while Rumsfeld was still outside helping with the injured, the National Security Agency, which monitors communications worldwide, intercepted a phone call from one of Osama bin Laden's operatives in Afghanistan to a phone number in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. The caller said he had "heard good news" and that another target was still to come; an indication he knew another airliner, the one that eventually crashed in Pennsylvania, was at that very moment zeroing in on Washington. It was 12:05 p.m. when the director of Central Intelligence told Rumsfeld about the intercepted conversation. Rumsfeld felt it was "vague," that it "might not mean something," and that there was "no good basis for hanging hat." In other words, the evidence was not clear-cut enough to justify military action against bin Laden. But later that afternoon, the CIA reported the passenger manifests for the hijacked airliners showed three of the hijackers were suspected al Qaeda operatives. "One guy is associate of Cole bomber," the notes say, a reference to the October 2000 suicide boat attack on the USS Cole in Yemen, which had also been the work of bin Laden. With the intelligence all pointing toward bin Laden, Rumsfeld ordered the military to begin working on strike plans. And at 2:40 p.m., the notes quote Rumsfeld as saying he wanted "best info fast. Judge whether good enough hit S.H." – meaning Saddam Hussein – "at same time. Not only UBL" – the initials used to identify Osama bin Laden. "Go massive," the notes quote him as saying.

Because they weren’t wearing anything else. Walking down a busy street in Charlotte, N.C., this weekend were a 20-something mother, clutching her newborn infant, and a 40-something grandmother. Also in tow was a toddler. RELATED: THE NAKED COWBOY IS GETTING HITCHED None of them had a stitch on, which created a bit of a traffic jam on the main thoroughfare of Providence Road. “Like freshly born naked,” said Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Capt. Rod Farley, describing the group’s appearance. “This was Adam and Eve stuff — not even a loincloth.” When the Lord speaks, these women listen: Police arrest and question mother and grandmother walking down the road in Charlotte, N.C., with infant and a toddler in tow. God told them all to "get naked," police said. Which they did. Resident Jill Mead was driving by, when she did a double-take. It “blew my mind,” she said. RELATED: NAKED, HIGH DALLAS MAN DRIVES THROUGH A SHOPPING MALL AND STEALS CLOTHES When police arrived and questioned the birthday-suit entourage, the women said they’d been divinely inspired. Apparently “the Lord told them to get naked and walk down the street,” Farley said. The naked family was taken to a nearby hospital for physical and mental evaluations. “It didn’t appear that they had any problems short of that they didn’t have any clothes on,” Farley said Saturday, following the incident.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368562873843</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:21:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368562924711-331</Id><Topic><Title>You Teabillies Are Done in 2014</Title><Username>nixon_rides_again</Username><Timestamp>1368561089619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 15:51:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368562924711</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:22:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368562971576-332</Id><Topic><Title>Must be out of the loop</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1368561281096</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 15:54:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The issue is Carney was trying to shield Obama from all the scandals but made it look like Obama doesn't have a clue about anything.</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1368562971576</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:22:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368563184556-333</Id><Topic><Title>Must be out of the loop</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1368561281096</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 15:54:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so you say any facts though?</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368563184556</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:26:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368563695947-334</Id><Topic><Title>Must be out of the loop</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1368561281096</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 15:54:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368563695947</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:34:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368563778449-335</Id><Title>IRS targeting timing...</Title><Msg>The targeting began in 2010, shortly after the emergence of the conservative Tea Party movement, which helped Republicans, in the election that year, pick up seats in the Senate and control of the House of Representatives.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368563778449</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:36:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368563836960-336</Id><Topic><Title>GREAT DAY!

"The subpoenas were limited to a reasonable period of time and did not seek the content of any calls," DOJ Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote to AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt. "In addition, these records have been closely held and reviewed solely for the purposes of this ongoing criminal investigation.

Mary's two associates, Aaron Goodrich, 18 and Emory Evans, 25, were taken to a room and shot. Mary herself had five bullets in her, from at least two different guns, most likely with silencers.
