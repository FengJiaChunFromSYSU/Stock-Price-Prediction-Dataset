Roxanne Rubin, 56, a casino worker on the Las Vegas Strip, was arrested on Nov. 3, 2012 after trying to vote twice, once at her poling site in Henderson and then at a second site in Las Vegas. The poll workers at the second site said that she had already voted, but Rubin said that she hadn't and insisted on casting a ballot, which the poll workers refused to allow her to do. Rubin said that she was trying to show how easy it would be to commit voter fraud with just a signature. "This has always been an issue with me. I just feel the system is flawed," she told the AP Thursday. "If we’re showing ID for everything else, why wouldn’t we show our ID in order to vote?” Rubin, like many Republicans, claim that the threat from voter fraud -- which is close to non-existent -- is why voter ID laws need to be in place. But Nevada has no voter ID law -- other than for first-time voters who didn't show ID when they registered to vote -- and she was caught anyway. The prosecutor in the case said he knew of no other voters in Nevada or elsewhere arrested for voter fraud. Democratic Nevada Secretary of State Ross Miller, who has called for a photo ID law, slammed Rubin in a statement. "If Ms. Rubin was trying to demonstrate how easy it is to commit voter fraud, she clearly failed and proved just the opposite," he said. Rubin's deal requires her to pay $2,481 to the state in restitution, complete 100 hours of community service, stay out of trouble and complete an impulse control course.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359469134281</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 09:18:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359469448750-15</Id><Title>CSCO kid.. was a friend of mine...</Title><Msg>The Csco Kid was a friend of mine He drink whiskey, Poncho drink the wine He drink whiskey, Poncho drink the wine We met down on the fort of Rio Grande We met down on the fort of Rio Grande Eat the salted peanuts out of can Eat the salted peanuts out the can The outlaws had us pinned down at the fort The outlaws had us pinned down at the fort Csco came in blastin', drinkin' port Csco came in blastin', drinkin' port They rode the sunset, horse was made of steel They rode the sunset, horse was made of steel Chased a gringo last night through a field Chased a gringo last night through a field</Msg><Username>spinaltap58</Username><Timestamp>1359469448750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 09:24:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359469639664-16</Id><Title>Egypt is NOT a failed state , ISLAM IS !</Title><Msg>And other countries over thar, Ha ha !!!</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1359469639664</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 09:27:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359469733723-17</Id><Topic><Title>Voter Fraud!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359469134281</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 09:18:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>teabillys are bad for america If you really want to see some p*ssed off teabillies,watch the Crosbt,Stills,Nash &amp; Young concert on AXS.TV.Gotta love Mark Cuban for airing this program.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359469733723</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 09:28:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359469906129-18</Id><Topic><Title>Voter Fraud!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359469134281</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 09:18:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oops typo,it's CrosbY not T.I know how upset crazy carey gets when words are misspelled.carey's a teabillie,right?</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359469906129</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 09:31:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359469998053-19</Id><Topic><Title>Egypt is NOT a failed state , ISLAM IS !</Title><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1359469639664</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 09:27:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And other countries over thar, Ha ha !!!

LOL</Title><Msg>Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said Monday that it's "up to me and Fox News" to halt planned immigration reform proposed earlier in the day by a bipartisan group of Senators. Limbaugh said that any immigration reform including a pathway to citizenship would amount to amnesty, but that there wouldn't be much Republican opposition to it. "It's up to me and Fox News, and I don't think Fox News is that invested in this. I don't think there's any Republican opposition to this of any majority consequence or size. We'll have to wait and see and find out. But this is one of those, just keep plugging away, plugging away, plugging away until you finally beat down the opposition," Limbaugh said. Limbaugh's comments were a reference to a suggestion by President Barack Obama that Limbaugh and Fox News were part of the reason compromise is a "dirty" word in Washington. "I'm gonna tell you, folks, I am not paid enough," Limbaugh said. "If Fox News and I are the only thing keeping the Republicans from caving to Barack Obama on every issue, I'm not paid enough."

Posted: 29 Jan 2013 07:00 AM PST The irony of this little Sean Hannity rant is almost too much for one sitting. While calling President Obama "the Anointed One", calling him a radical left-wing failure, and ranting about how the President wants to take away free speech, Hannity breathlessly (and shamelessly) claims that Fox News is the "only media channel that has delivered fair and balanced coverage" of the president. He's serious. He delivers that message with bright-eyed ferocity in response to the president's fairly mild remarks to The New Republic in an interview last week. According to Hannity, the reason the country is divided is because President Obama's rhetoric is too polarizing. In Hannity's world, the fact that someone dares to disagree with the Supreme Conservative Voices in this country means they're a polarizing force responsible for all of the division in this country. No one else, and especially not Fox News, is responsible for any of the divide. He ends with this: "While he's so busy bashing the first and second amendments of the constitution, sorry, Mr. President, we're going to continue on this program to do our part to save America from your radical agenda." Gee, that's not divisive at all. Not even a little bit, right? The unbalanced rants of Sean Hannity are all the evidence anyone needs of who it is who divides, and who doesn't.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359474942116</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 10:55:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359474951488-46</Id><Topic><Title>obama says he is not a "liberal"</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1359470236521</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 09:37:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking of Cuban greatness, How's Hugo's medical treatment going? *** Good question.

A new report from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication finds that the majority of voters are concerned about global warming and want their elected leaders to take action. The report follows up a September, 2012 national survey “Climate Change in the American Mind” and is an attempt to answer the question “do political leaders stand to benefit, or not, from talking about and supporting action to address global warming?” The answer is yes — 58 percent of registered voters say they will consider a candidate’s position on global warming when deciding how to vote. Of those 58 percent, a majority of 83 percent say global warming is happening and 65 percent say it is because of human activity. A majority of Democrats (73 percent) and Independents (63 percent) are somewhat or very worried about global warming, compared to only 33 percent of Republicans. However, even 46 percent of Republicans say global warming will harm future generations and a majority 52 percent of Republicans say that global warming should be a medium, high or very high priority for the president and Congress. The report says that “Independents more closely resemble Democrats in their attitudes and beliefs about global warming, and like Democrats, most support efforts to address global warming. Thus, the issue of global warming is an opportunity to connect with most Independents.” Clean energy cuts across party lines, with Democrats (83 percent), Independents (85 percent) and Republicans (70 percent) all agreeing that the United States should rely more on renewable energy in the future. There is also a bipartisan majority who support funding more research into renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, with 83 percent of Democrats and Independents and 63 percent of Republicans supporting more renewable energy research funding. A majority of Republicans also side with Democrats and Independents in supporting eliminating subsidies for the fossil fuel industry (coal, oil and natural gas) and opposing eliminating subsidies for the renewable energy industry (solar, wind and geothermal) — 53 percent of Republicans want to end subsidies for the fossil fuel industry and 52 percent support subsidies for renewable energy. Half of Republicans support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, while large majorities of Democrats (80 percent) and Independents (74 percent) support regulation. The report directly contradicts the opinions of GOP insiders who say that climate change is not a winning issue for Democrats. A National Journal poll found that 9 out of 10 GOP insiders say climate change is not an issue Democrats can capitalize on.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359476426516</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 11:20:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359476511106-58</Id><Topic><Title>Will csco settle with vhc....</Title><Username>eldoctoro</Username><Timestamp>1345118944592</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 08:09:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Siemens settled with VHC.

Roxanne Rubin, 56, a casino worker on the Las Vegas Strip, was arrested on Nov. 3, 2012 after trying to vote twice, once at her poling site in Henderson and then at a second site in Las Vegas. The poll workers at the second site said that she had already voted, but Rubin said that she hadn't and insisted on casting a ballot, which the poll workers refused to allow her to do. Rubin said that she was trying to show how easy it would be to commit voter fraud with just a signature. "This has always been an issue with me. I just feel the system is flawed," she told the AP Thursday. "If we’re showing ID for everything else, why wouldn’t we show our ID in order to vote?” Rubin, like many Republicans, claim that the threat from voter fraud -- which is close to non-existent -- is why voter ID laws need to be in place. But Nevada has no voter ID law -- other than for first-time voters who didn't show ID when they registered to vote -- and she was caught anyway. The prosecutor in the case said he knew of no other voters in Nevada or elsewhere arrested for voter fraud. Democratic Nevada Secretary of State Ross Miller, who has called for a photo ID law, slammed Rubin in a statement. "If Ms. Rubin was trying to demonstrate how easy it is to commit voter fraud, she clearly failed and proved just the opposite," he said. Rubin's deal requires her to pay $2,481 to the state in restitution, complete 100 hours of community service, stay out of trouble and complete an impulse control course.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359478552056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 11:55:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359478656869-71</Id><Topic><Title>rick santelli</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359475026189</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 10:57:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do liberals think calling others stupid or racist is intelligent arguing??

Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I’m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause. Yes, yes, I know, the finding itself is “dog bites man.” What makes this “man bites dog” is that Muller has been a skeptic of climate science, and the single biggest funder of this study is the “Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation ($150,000).” The Kochs are the leading funder of climate disinformation in the world! It gets better: Our results show that the average temperature of the earth’s land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases. These findings are stronger than those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations group that defines the scientific and diplomatic consensus on global warming.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1359480139135</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 12:22:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359480163405-87</Id><Topic><Title>REPUBLICANS THIS WEEKEND FINALLY CONCEDED THAT GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1359479930230</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 12:18:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NEVER!

The term evolved from ‘Indian gift’ which was first coined by Massachusetts Loyalist politician, Thomas Hutchinson, in 1765 during American colonization when Natives gave gifts to the white Europeans in anticipation of receiving a gift in return. In 1848 historian and linguist John Russell Bartlett published his Dictionary of Americanisms which first cited the phrase ‘Indian giver’: “INDIAN GIVER. When an Indian gives anything, he expects an equivalent in return, or that the same thing may be given back to him. This term is applied by children in New York and the vicinity to a child who, after having given away a thing, wishes to have it back again.” Note the figurative application already existed by 1848. It is likely that some Europeans accepted gifts from Natives who expected something in trade, and when nothing was received, demanded the return of the gift. *** Obama gave a temporary tax decrease to try to pump up the economy so he would be re-elected. Right after the election he raised taxes. #$%$!</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1359485390939</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:49:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359485391544-134</Id><Topic><Title>I get a 2% ding to my take home pay it is not a tax hike but a tax break I no longer get!</Title><Username>dumbpainting</Username><Timestamp>1359484911811</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:41:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So if Obama recinds a tax decrease from JFK is it just a tax break I no longer get or is it a tax hike?

Ready for Hillary, one of two Clinton super-PACs registered with the Federal Election Commission, says on its Facebook page that it was created by five friends, including a former aide and former adviser to the New York Democrat. Clinton, who is leaving her post as secretary of state, is a former U.S. senator and first lady. Married to former President Bill Clinton, she lost the 2008 Democratic nomination to Barack Obama. She is mentioned as a potential candidate in the next presidential election, though she hasn’t made any decision as to her future plans. Earlier this month, she reported that she retired her remaining debt from the 2008 campaign. “We believe Hillary will see that 2016 is the right year, for the right woman for so many different reasons,” the group says on its Facebook page. “The goal is to be as organized and ready as possible for Hillary at that time.” During an interview on CBS Corp.’s “60 Minutes” show that aired Jan. 27, Clinton declined to discuss her plans, saying she couldn’t “make predictions about what’s going to happen tomorrow, or for the next year.” Under federal law, anyone can set up a super-PAC to support or oppose any candidate. Those activities can’t be coordinated with the candidate. In 2012, super-PACs, which can take in unlimited donations, were established by close aides of the presidential candidates. The Center for Public Integrity, a Washington-based watchdog group, identified one of the leaders of the pro-Clinton super-PAC as Allida Black, a George Washington University professor and longtime Clinton supporter. Another Clinton-related committee, Hillary Clinton Super PAC, also registered with the FEC. That PAC is based in Davenport, Iowa, the state that will select the first delegates to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. © Copyright 2013 Bloomberg News.

Doublethink, a word coined by George Orwell in the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, describes the act of simultaneously accepting two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct, often in distinct social contexts.[1] It is related to, but differs from, hypocrisy and neutrality. Its opposite is cognitive dissonance, where the two beliefs cause conflict in one's mind. Doublethink is an integral concept of George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The word doublethink is part of Newspeak.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359494892217</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 16:28:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359495445689-178</Id><Title>obama pinched middle class pay checks</Title><Msg>someone had to pay for his fancy ball.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1359495445689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 16:37:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359495777696-179</Id><Topic><Title>obama pinched middle class pay checks</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1359495445689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 16:37:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>switched your id from flute to dead to post your doublethink, is that how you manage your cognitive dissonance?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359495777696</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 16:42:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359497464230-180</Id><Topic><Title>stock market flying</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359493934536</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 16:12:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumb dumb When Obama goes on vacation does he go to the Hamptons with his white rich dem friends or does he go to Harlem with the bros on welfare???</Msg><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1359497464230</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:11:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359497902208-181</Id><Topic><Title>stock market flying</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359493934536</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 16:12:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah LibTARDS and O'Loser is a big supporter of the middleclass and poor.

Heavy rain will accompany the storms, the Weather Channel reports. In the north-central USA, the rain will fall on frozen ground, which has prompted the weather service to issue flood watches in parts of the Upper Midwest, including Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee and Indianapolis. Warm air is pushing north ahead of the storms: Chicago has set a record high temperature of 62 degrees, which is about 30 degrees above average. Corpus Christi, Texas, reached 90 degrees on Tuesday, only the 4th time that city has reached the 90s in January since records began in 1887. The severe weather threat will extend farther east Wednesday, according to AccuWeather meteorologist Brian Edwards. He says the storms will move into Atlanta, Charlotte and Raleigh on Wednesday. There could even be a couple of gusty storms as far north as Washington.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359501550326</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 18:19:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359501813651-205</Id><Topic><Title>The 2nd Ammendmant was written for settling a Wild unexplored land</Title><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1355712620791</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 21:50:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thats what its come 2 wild demorats liberals running wild usefull idiots gone crazy!</Msg><Username>shwdl</Username><Timestamp>1359501813651</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 18:23:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359501950714-206</Id><Topic><Title>The 2nd Ammendmant was written for settling a Wild unexplored land</Title><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1355712620791</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 21:50:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TOTALLY AGREE..WELL SAID, WELL PUT.. screw Democrats</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1359501950714</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 18:25:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359502298748-207</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN THE 20 MILLION ILLEGALS EACH BRING OVER 3 FAMILY MEMBERS....</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1359498231118</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:23:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>JuniorGIRL IS MAYOR OF GAY LAND!</Msg><Username>shwdl</Username><Timestamp>1359502298748</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 18:31:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359502766879-208</Id><Topic><Title>REPUBLICANS THIS WEEKEND FINALLY CONCEDED THAT GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1359479930230</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 12:18:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Climate is always changing so let's tax it and regulate it.

Jesse Ventura March 9, 2010 You didn’t see anything about it in the mainstream media, but two weeks ago at a conference in San Francisco, more than one thousand architects and engineers signed a petition demanding that Congress begin a new investigation into the destruction of the three World Trade Center skyscrapers on 9/11. That’s right, these people put their reputations in potential jeopardy – because they don’t buy the government’s version of events. They want to know how 200,000 tons of steel disintegrated and fell to the ground in 11 seconds. They question whether the hijacked planes were responsible – or whether it could have been a controlled demolition from inside that brought down the Twin Towers and Building 7. Richard Gage, a member of the American Institute of Architects and the founder of Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth, put it like this: “The official Federal Emergency Management [Agency] and National Institute of Standards and Technology reports provide insufficient, contradictory and fraudulent accounts of the circumstances of the towers’ destruction.” He’s especially disturbed by Building 7, whose 47 stories came down in “pure free-fall acceleration” that afternoon – even though it was never hit by an aircraft. This is a subject I take up in my new book, American Conspiracies , published this week by Skyhorse. An excerpt follows: Some people have argued that the twin towers went down, within a half hour of one another, because of the way they were constructed. Well, those 425,000 cubic yards of concrete and 200,000 tons of steel were designed to hold up against a Boeing 707, the largest plane built at the time the towers were completed in 1973. Analysis had shown that a 707 traveling at 600 miles an hour (and those had four engines) would not cause major damage. The twin-engine Boeing 757s that hit on 9/11 were going 440 and 550 miles an hour. Still, we are told that a molten, highly intense fuel mixture from the planes brought down these two steel-framed skyscrapers. Keep in mind that no other such skyscraper in history had ever been known to collapse completely due to fire damage. So could it actually have been the result of a controlled demolition from inside the buildings? I don’t claim expertise about this, but I did work four years as part of the Navy’s underwater demolition teams, where we were trained to blow things to hell and high water. And my staff talked at some length with a prominent physicist, Steven E. Jones, who says that a “gravity driven collapse” without demolition charges defies the laws of physics. These buildings fell, at nearly the rate of free-fall, straight down into their own footprint, in approximately ten seconds. An object dropped from the roof of the 110-story-tall towers would reach the ground in about 9.2 seconds. Then there’s the fact that steel beams that weighed as much as 200,000 pounds got tossed laterally as far as 500 feet. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) started its investigation on August 21, 2002. When their 10,000-page-long report came out three years later, the spokesman said there was no evidence to suggest a controlled demolition. But Steven E. Jones also says that molten metal found underground weeks later is proof that jet fuel couldn’t have been all that was responsible. I visited the site about three weeks after 9/11, with Governor Pataki and my wife Terry. It didn’t mean anything to me at the time, but they had to suspend digging that day because they were running into heat pockets of huge temperatures. These fires kept burning for more than three months, the longest-burning structure blaze ever. And this was all due to jet fuel? We’re talking molten metal more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Probably the most conclusive evidence about a controlled demolition is a research paper (two years, nine authors) published in the peer-reviewed Open Chemical Physics Journal , in April 2009. In studying dust samples from the site, these scientists found chips of nano-thermite, which is a high-tech incendiary/explosive. Here’s what the paper’s lead author, Dr. Niels Harrit of the University of Copenhagen’s chemistry department, had to say about the explosive that he’s convinced brought down the Twin Towers and the nearby Building 7: “Thermite itself dates back to 1893. It is a mixture of aluminum and rust-powder, which react to create intense heat. The reaction produces iron, heated to 2500 degrees Centigrade. This can be used to do welding. It can also be used to melt other iron. So in nano-thermite, this powder from 1893 is reduced to tiny particles, perfectly mixed. When these react, the intense heat develops much more quickly. Nano-thermite can be mixed with additives to give off intense heat, or serve as a very effective explosive. It contains more energy than dynamite, and can be used as rocket fuel.” [i] Richard Gage is one of hundreds of credentialed architects and structural engineers who have put their careers on the line to pointout the detailed anomalies and many implications of controlled demolition in the building collapses. As he puts it bluntly: “Once you get to the science, it’s indisputable.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359506297670</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:38:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359506455621-217</Id><Topic><Title>Jesse says Bush brought down the towers to start a war</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359506297670</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:38:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is what Jesse Ventura says about anything important??</Msg><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1359506455621</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:40:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359506524939-218</Id><Topic><Title>we could get a flash crash here--1000 pt drop!!</Title><Username>pn1409</Username><Timestamp>1352305313173</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 11:21:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone holding stocks since 2009 are about even after 4 years.

My take: Our government engaged in a massive cover-up of what really happened, including its own ties to the hijackers. Unanswered questions remain about how the towers were brought down, and whether a plane really struck the Pentagon.

Communication Networks was down 11.7%. We did forecast it to be down, but not as much as it turned out to be. We had a fair amount of push outs on wireless infrastructure, especially middle of the end of the quarter. There was a major impact for the quarter itself. Computing and storage was down 9.8%. Actually, we forecasted at beginning of the quarter it to be up. We had a fair amount of weaknesses in demand on existing programs and ramp of the new programs was lot slower than what we anticipated. Communication Networks, we are forecasting to be slightly down. Let me make a few comments. Short-term wireless infrastructure demand will continue to be weak. Rest of the communication Networks are stable, and we also have a fair amount of new projects in works that should help us, maybe little bit in the second, but more maybe in the third quarter. Long-term, we are well positioned as demand improves in this segment, because we are well positioned with all the key players in this market. Enterprise computing and storage, we are also forecasting down. Short-term basically we are going to continue to see weak demand. On a positive side, we do have a strong pipeline of new projects that we are working on. So, we you look at the long-term, we believe the forecast for the future are positive.</Msg><Username>carpet.bomber</Username><Timestamp>1359507376969</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:56:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359507712285-223</Id><Title>jesse on W</Title><Msg>On Homeland Security: Post-9-11: authorized attacks on terrorists amid civilians After 9/11, Bush's Justice Dept. wrote up a long memo with the subject line: "Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the US." The whole concept basically shreds our Bill of Rights. In short, "constitutional rules regulating law enforcement activity are not applicable." The military could even "attack civilian targets where suspected terrorists were thought to be." And later, "First Amendment speech and press rights may also be subordinated to the overriding need to wage war successfully." Where does it say that, if you call something "terrorism," the Constitution and the Bill of Rights can be made null and void? All they've got to do is say the word and they can put you under surveillance without a warrant. To me, this smacks of an attack on the foundations of democracy that plays right into the HANDS of terrorists. It also sets a precedent for the kinds of tactics we went to see at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and elsewhere. Source: 63 Documents, by Gov. Jesse Ventura, p.250 Apr 4, 2011 On Homeland Security: Geneva convention does not apply to al Qaeda &amp; Taliban A few months after September 11, President Bush sent out a "mass memo" that lays out why the al Qaeda and Taliban detainees were "unlawful combatants" and so the Geneva Convention calling for humane treatment of POWs did not apply to them. Well, if they're not covered by an international agreement, shouldn't they be covered by the laws of the United States and our Constitution and Bill of Rights? My point being, this situation has to fall under SOMEBODY'S law. Bush wrote: Pursuant to my authority as Commander of Chief, I accept the legal constitution that none of the provisions of Geneva apply to our conflict with al Qaeda in Afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world because among other reasons, al Qaeda is not a High Contracting Party to Geneva. I determine that he Taliban detainees are unlawful combatants and, therefore, do not qualify as prisoners of war. Source: 63 Documents, by Gov.

Summers exemplifies the links between cheerleaders in academia, Wall Street, supine regulators and an ignorant Capitol Hill that Ferguson stresses were at the root of the problem. It helps that Summers looks like a mafia boss, but the difficulties in making the case against him are shown by the need to explain financial products like credit default swaps and how securitization was used by banks to increase their borrowing. The UK banksters and the Europeans were all in on it too. That's why Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Slovakia and Greece are broke. They rolled deadbeat countries (e.g., Greece) into AAA vehicles that Corzine invested in and then lost the savings of many Americans.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1359510062097</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 20:41:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359510899276-229</Id><Topic><Title>jesse on W</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359507712285</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 20:01:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is in office for one reason: to keep the blacks from rioting.

Here, we decided to focus on Obama's claim that "the Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004." There were 20,745 border patrol agents as of April 9, 2011; 17,659 of them stationed along the southwest border with Mexico, according to data provided by Steven Cribby, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. That's up from 17,499 border patrol agents at the end of September 2008, four months before Obama took office (an 18 percent increase). Singling out just the border patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border, the number has increased from 15,422 to 17,659 (a 14 percent increase). According to a March 3, 2010, analysis of border security by the Congressional Research Service, "Border Patrol agent manpower assigned to the southwest border has been increasing steadily since the early 1990s. In 1992, there were 3,555 agents assigned to the southern border, by 2000 that number had increased by 141 percent to 8,580. Since 2000, the number of agents assigned to the southern border has continued to increase, more than doubling once more to 20,119 agents at the end of FY2009. The rapid and steady increase of Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border reflects the ongoing interest in Congress in stemming the tide of illegal immigration."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359511778979</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 21:09:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359511916574-236</Id><Topic><Title>The 2nd Ammendmant was written for settling a Wild unexplored land</Title><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1355712620791</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 21:50:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOOK AT SYRIA!!!

Technically, that's fewer than under George W. Bush, whose cumulative total was 2 million. But Bush’s number covers eight full years, which doesn’t allow an apples-to-apples comparison. If you instead compare the two presidents’ monthly averages, it works out to 32,886 for Obama and 20,964 for Bush, putting Obama clearly in the lead. Bill Clinton is far behind with 869,676 total and 9,059 per month. All previous occupants of the White House going back to 1892 fell well short of the level of the three most recent presidents. We wondered whether there might have been a surge of undocumented immigrants that explained the increase, but there wasn’t. During the first two years of Obama’s tenure, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated the illegal immigrant population nationwide at 11.2 million, compared to an average during Bush’s eight-year tenure of 10.6 million. And illegal immigration actually peaked late in Bush’s second term, at which point the recession hit and the numbers declined under Obama. Such patterns do not explain the 57 percent bump in monthly deportations that we found under Obama. but facts are illusory in the tea bag world</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359512764359</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 21:26:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359513754435-241</Id><Title>If things were reversed...</Title><Msg>...and the Dems didn't have a majority of the Hispanic vote but instead the Republicans did, Obama and his band of merry men would be working 24hr shifts to make sure the border fence would be completed.

She said it is necessary to counteract a Bush-era memo that gave officials the opposite idea. "Police throughout the country have the idea that they can help us enforce federal laws," she said. "We don't want their help on laws we don't like." Attorney General Eric Holder said he doesn't like a law prohibiting people from intimidating voters at polling places. "So long as intimidation is accomplished without requiring actual physical violence," he said, "we're going to allow it, but only if the intimidators represent a minority population. It would be wrong to allow white racists to intimidate black voters." Dr. Di A. Rhea, director of the new Capital Redistribution of Assessments Plan, said prohibitions against confiscating wealth are unfair to federal officials who wish to spread that wealth. "We are asking President Obama to declare an executive order that would direct federal law enforcement officers to ignore this outdated component of federal law," she said. ""Legislating and amending the Constitution are unwieldy, and we need changes now, not miles or days down the road." Other laws that administration officials say they might stop enforcing are Presidential term limits, Freedom of Information laws that force federal officials to reveal information to the media, welfare reform bills that require recipients to work or attend school, and requirements that candidates for high federal offices to be U.S. citizens.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1359521371588</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 23:49:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359521718923-263</Id><Title>What ever happen to the</Title><Msg>Border Agent Brian Terry's Death investigation?
