I bought a bird feeder. I hung it on my back porch and filled it with seed. What a beauty of a bird feeder it was, as I filled it lovingly with seed. Within a week we had hundreds of bird taking advantage of the continuous flow of free and easily accessible food. But then the birds started building nests in the boards of the patio, above the table, and next to the barbecue. Then came the poop. It was everywhere: on the patio tile, the chairs, and the table everywhere! Then some of the birds turned mean. They would dive bomb me and try to peck me even though I had fed them out of my own pocket. And others birds were boisterous and loud. They sat on the feeder and squawked and screamed at all hours of the day and night and demanded that I fill it when it got low on food. After a while, I couldn't even sit on my own back porch anymore. So I took down the bird feeder and in three days the birds were gone. I cleaned up their mess and took down the many nests they had built all over the patio. Soon, the back yard was like it used to be quiet, serene and no one demanding their rights to a free meal. Now let's see. Our government gives out free food, subsidized housing, free medical care and free education, and allows anyone born here to be an automatic citizen. Then the illegal’s came by the tens of thousands. Suddenly our taxes went up to pay for free services; small apartments are housing 5 families; you have to wait 6 hours to be seen by an emergency room doctor; your child's second grade class is behind other schools because over half the class doesn't speak English. Corn Flakes now come in a bilingual box; I have to ‘press one ' to hear my bank talk to me in English, and people waving flags other than 'Old Glory' are squawking and screaming in the streets, demanding more rights and free liberties. Just my opinion, but maybe it's time for the government to take down the bird feeder. If you agree, pass it on; if not, just continue cleaning up the poop.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363779333747</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 07:35:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363779366124-9</Id><Title>THE STIMULUS Obama wasted on Union thugs &amp; Big Bank crooks.</Title><Msg>THE STIMULUS Obama wasted on Union thugs &amp; Big Bank crooks.

The bombings, which targeted Shia neighborhoods and establishments, also injured nearly 100 other people. Al-Jazeera reports: Ten car bombs, including two detonated by suicide bombers, one roadside bomb and two gun attacks struck in and around the Iraqi capital during morning rush hour on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the US-led invasion. Sunni fighters tied to al-Qaeda have stepped up their campaign of attacks this year in an attempt to trigger sectarian tensions and undermine Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shia-led government. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts. Ongoing sectarian and political violence has been the "new normal" in post-occupation Iraq, betraying US promises that the toppling of Saddam Hussein would welcome in a new era of stability, democracy, and prosperity for ordinary Iraqis. Though Al-Qaeda did not exist in Iraq before the US invasion, it now boldly operates throughout the country. Though no responsibility for Tuesday's attacks had been claimed, officials speaking to the Associated Press blamed the group.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1363784613471</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:03:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363784616862-32</Id><Topic><Title>Defending a monster</Title><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1363782766582</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 08:32:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hitler was never convicted of violating the Geneva convention and torturing our soldiers, Bush was, that was the point moron, that even Hitler as bad as he was, followed the Geneva convention.

In what is the first ever conviction of its kind anywhere in the world, the former US President and seven key members of his administration were yesterday (Fri) found guilty of war crimes. Bush, #$%$ Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and their legal advisers Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Jay Bybee and John Yoo were tried in absentia in Malaysia. The trial held in Kuala Lumpur heard harrowing witness accounts from victims of torture who suffered at the hands of US soldiers and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. They included testimony from British man Moazzam Begg, an ex-Guantanamo detainee and Iraqi woman Jameelah Abbas Hameedi who was tortured in the notorious Abu Ghraib prison. At the end of the week-long hearing, the five-panel tribunal unanimously delivered guilty verdicts against Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their key legal advisors who were all convicted as war criminals for torture and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. Full transcripts of the charges, witness statements and other relevant material will now be sent to the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, as well as the United Nations and the Security Council. The Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission is also asking that the names of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Gonzales, Yoo, Bybee, Addington and Haynes be entered and included in the Commission’s Register of War Criminals for public record. The tribunal is the initiative of Malaysia’s retired Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who staunchly opposed the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. He sat through the entire hearing as it took personal statements and testimonies of three witnesses namely Abbas Abid, Moazzam Begg and Jameelah Hameedi. The tribunal also heard two other Statutory Declarations of Iraqi citizen Ali Shalal and Rahul Ahmed, another British citizen. After the guilty verdict reached by five senior judges was delivered, Mahathir Mohamad said: “Powerful countries are getting away with murder.” War crimes expert and lawyer Francis Boyle, professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law in America, was part of the prosecution team. After the case he said: “This is the first conviction of these people anywhere in the world.” While the hearing is regarded by some as being purely symbolic, human rights activist Boyle said he was hopeful that Bush and Co could soon find themselves facing similar trials elsewhere in the world. “We tried three times to get Bush in Canada but were thwarted by the Canadian Government, then we scared Bush out of going to Switzerland. The Spanish attempt failed because of the government there and the same happened in Germany.” Boyle then referenced the Nuremberg Charter which was used as the format for the tribunal when asked about the credibility of the initiative in Malaysia. He quoted: “Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit war crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any person in execution of such a plan.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363787216388</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:46:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363787738666-54</Id><Title>new takeover transmission company</Title><Msg>I did hear a Nordic Transmission company takeover on the way</Msg><Username>paulrichard10</Username><Timestamp>1363787738666</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:55:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363788127631-55</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see this report yet?

The weather was picture perfect. The ocean was blue and clean. They dropped by the fruit stand some locals had along the road. Everyone got out of the car and decided to munch on the gorgeous fresh fruit that looked like the cover of a magazine. So much better than the Frankenstein food back home, A few bites were taken out of one piece of fruit and since one of the gurls couldn't finish it, they put it in a plastic bag to keep the juices from making a sticky mess in the car. An hour later the gurls began their lesson on parasites. When the bag with the sticky fruit was re-opened by accident, lots of little bugs were found running around inside the bag and could actually be seen now coming out of the fruit.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1363789559774</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 10:25:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363789736478-73</Id><Topic><Title>obama thinks we have to spend out way to prosperity.</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1363789165802</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 10:19:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He tried it for 4 years and it didn't work.

The attacks, mostly by car bombs, targeted small restaurants, day laborers and bus stops in the Iraqi capital and nearby towns over a span of more than two hours. The bombings came 10 years to the day that Washington announced the start of the invasion on March 19, 2003 - though by that time it was already the following morning in Iraq. While violence has ebbed since its peak in 2006 and 2007, the latest attacks show that insurgents remain a potent threat to Iraq's security forces and long-term stability. One of the deadliest of Tuesday's attacks struck close to one of the main gates to the heavily-fortified Green Zone, which houses major government offices and the embassies of several countries, including the United States and Britain. That blast outside a restaurant killed six people, including two soldiers, and wounded more than 15. Thick black smoke could be seen rising from the area as ambulances raced to the scene. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Tuesday's blasts, but the attacks bore hallmarks of al-Qaida in Iraq. The terror group favors spectacular, coordinated bombings intended to undermine public confidence in the #$%$-led government. Police and hospital officials who provided accounts of the days' bloodshed reported the most casualties from a car bombing near the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in Baghdad's eastern Qahira neighborhood at around 10 a.m. That blast killed seven people and wounded 21.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1363795719183</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 12:08:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363795808632-111</Id><Topic><Title>Take the Survey: who is a bigger liar Armstrong or Obama the past 4 years?</Title><Username>bachus_i00</Username><Timestamp>1363229527608</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 22:52:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Economic growth in Asia is crumbling due to Obama's weak dollar policy.

Passing on the keystone pipeline. 3. Touts a Green Energy Company as exemplary that fails a year later. 4. Using the Gulf Oil Spill to promote Green Energy – instead of cleaning it up. 5. Thinking the Tea Party is a passing fad – or that they are racists. 6. Pulling out of Iraq with no clear victory over insurgent forces. 7. Trying to re-write history through speeches – with inaccurate information (i.e. Statue of Liberty) 8. Getting a Nobel Prize for being the most ineffective President in the history of the United States, though some say it was for his pigment. 9. Putting all legislation on the Internet for five days before it comes to a vote. 10. Returning the bust of Churchill to the Brits. 11. Giving a collection of DVDs to the British PM. 12. Denying the notion of American Exceptionalism. 13. Promising to close Gitmo — failing to do so. 14. Securing the Olympics for Chicago in 2016. 15. Naming numerous Communists/Socialists/Progressives to his various Czar positions and then watching them scurry for cover when Beck begins to call them out, forcing them to resign. 16. Government races for NJ, VA and the Senate Seat in Mass. 17. The midterm elections, which Obama himself called a shellacking. 18. Prediction that stimulus would ensure that unemployment doesn’t exceed 8%. 19. Bowing to just about everybody. 20. Proposing amnesty for illegal aliens to increase the population of voters for Democrat elections. 21. He said, I have visited 57 states. Now there is just 1 left to visit. 22.

The end is near. According to the Qur'an, the kingdoms of Sodom and Gomorrah were allied with the cities of Admah, Zeboim and Bela. These five cities, also known as the "cities of the plain", were situated on the Jordan river plain in the southern region of the land of Canaan. The Jordan river plain (which corresponds to area just north of the modern day Dead Sea) has been compared to the garden of Eden,[Gen.13:10] being a land well-watered and green, suitable for grazing livestock. Divine judgment by Yahweh was then passed upon Sodom and Gomorrah along with two other neighboring cities that were completely consumed by fire and brimstone. Neighboring Zoar (Bela) was the only city to be spared during that day of judgment.[Deut.29:23][Gen.10:19] In Abrahamic traditions, Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of God's wrath.[Jude 1:7] Sodom and Gomorrah have been used as metaphors for vice and homosexuality viewed as a deviation. The story has therefore given rise to words in several languages, including the English word sodomy, used in so-called sodomy laws to describe a sexual "crime against nature" consisting of anal and/or oral sex, either homosexual or heterosexual.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1363798472694</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 12:54:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363798550446-150</Id><Topic><Title>It’s hard to think of a president that has been more of an Epic Failure than President Obama.</Title><Username>goparegreatfolks9</Username><Timestamp>1363797829055</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 12:43:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>guess you are to stupid to remember Bush two useless wars a million killed took a large budget surplus into a giant budget deficit first American President to be found guilty of War crimes Destroyed the housing market Destroyed the auto industry Destroyed the banking industry worst stock market performance under a President since the great depression I guess dementia does that to you tea billies you can't even remember what it was like to be losing 800,000 jobs a month.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363798550446</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 12:55:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363798663790-151</Id><Title>Harry said marines died because sequester</Title><Msg>marines are angry and say harry is full of it...opsie harry exposed, little church gossip women usally are.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1363798663790</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 12:57:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363798804719-152</Id><Topic><Title>Is Obama really fit to be President or even run a Kool-Aide Stand?

The DNC is ready to vote present so the GOP will own it if it passes. The GOP is now in a position where they are twisting GOP arms to get them to vote against the bill so it won't pass. LMAO House Democrats are not whipping a “no” vote on the Republican Study Committee (RSC) budget, opening up the possibility they will try a fancy floor maneuver. Two years ago, Democrats whipped a “present” vote on the conservative RSC plan, in an attempt to force a situation where it replaced the leadership-backed budget authored by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) For the amendment to succeed, it only needs a majority, excluding present votes. In 2011, the RSC budget failed on a 119-to-136 vote, with 172 voting “present.” “I thought it was a good strategy when I first proposed it. I think it remains a good strategy, to let the American people know what, in fact, the majority of Republicans really believe,” Democratic Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Tuesday. The RSC plan is coming up for a vote Wednesday. It would balance the budget in four years with much deeper cuts than the newest Ryan budget. It would also privatize Medicare for those 59 and younger, an older cutoff date than Ryan has used, or which centrists in the party find comfortable. The Hoyer move could spell trouble for many in the GOP. The conservative Heritage Action organization announced Wednesday that they are "key voting" the RSC budget, meaning a "no" vote on the RSC would count against a member's annual ratings. If the RSC budget is on track to passage, House GOP leaders will likely have to engage in arm-twisting to lower the GOP "yes" vote total, in order to ensure the RSC budget amendment does not pass.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363800496508</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 13:28:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363800774966-170</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO CEO Buying Shares?</Title><Username>fredric.sylvester</Username><Timestamp>1363621330780</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:42:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice job</Msg><Username>lawrenceparker53</Username><Timestamp>1363800774966</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 13:32:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363800793030-171</Id><Title>rand paul, ted cruz, rick santorum, marco rubio - and these are the most electable republicans? really?</Title><Msg>GOP might as well do a hail mary pass and run Archie Bunker !

The Pope leans towards Mr. Obama and said, "Do you know that with one little wave of my hand I can make every person in this crowd go wild with joy? This joy will not be a momentary display, but will go deep into their hearts and they'll forever speak of this day and rejoice!" Obama replied, "I seriously doubt that! With one little wave of your hand....Show me!" So the Pope backhanded him and knocked him off the stage!

The council voted Feb. 5 to change the names of Confederate Park, Jefferson Davis Park, named for the Confederacy's president, and Nathan Bedford Forrest Park, named for a Confederate lieutenant general who was also the KKK's first grand wizard. The new names are Memphis Park, Mississippi River Park and Health Sciences Park, respectively, though the council may change those names later. The council's move came in response to a bill moving through the Tennessee Legislature this year that would forbid local governments from changing names of any parks or monuments named for wars or war heroes, including those involving the Civil War.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363811485894</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:31:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363811702479-257</Id><Topic><Title>WHY IS THE TEA PARTY SO POPULAR ALL OVER AMERICA?</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1363803802085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 14:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>time to read 'Harbinger'.</Msg><Username>bvioml123</Username><Timestamp>1363811702479</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:35:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363811825617-258</Id><Topic><Title>TEA PARTY ALTERS US LANDSCAPE AND DOMINATES.</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1363811071132</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:24:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Harbinger prophecy.</Msg><Username>bvioml123</Username><Timestamp>1363811825617</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:37:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363811985426-259</Id><Title>SOCIAL SECURITY -- this lady nails it:</Title><Msg>THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CALCULATION OF AVAILABLE SOCIAL SECURITY IS THEY FORGOT TO FIGURE IN THE PEOPLE WHO DIED BEFORE THEY EVER COLLECTED A SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK!!! WHERE DID THAT MONEY GO? Remember, not only did you and I contribute to Social Security but your employer did, too. It totaled 15% of your income before taxes. If you averaged only $30K over your working life, that's close to $220,500. Read that again. Did you see where the Government paid in one single penny? We are talking about the money you and your employer put in a Government bank to insure you and I that we would have a retirement check from the money we put in, not the Government. Now they are calling the money we put in an entitlement when we reach the age to take it back. If you calculate the future invested value of $4,500 per year (yours &amp; your employer's contribution) at a simple 5% interest (less than what the govt. pays on the money that it borrows), after 49 years of working you'd have $892,919.98. If you took out only 3% per year, you'd receive $26,787.60 per year and it would last better than 30 years (until you're 95 if you retire at age 65) and that's with no interest paid on that final amount on deposit! If you bought an annuity and it paid 4% per year, you'd have a lifetime income of $2,976.40 per month. Another thing with me.... I have two deceased husbands who died in their 50's, (one was 51 and the other one was 59 before one percent of their social security could be drawn. I worked all my life and am drawing 100% on my own social security). Their S.S. money will never have one cent drawn from what they paid into S.S all their lives. THE FOLKS IN WASHINGTON HAVE PULLED OFF A BIGGER PONZI SCHEME THAN BERNIE MADOFF EVER DID. Entitlement my foot, I paid cash for my social security insurance! Just because they borrowed the money for other government spending, doesn't make my benefits some kind of charity or handout!! Remember Congressional benefits? --- free healthcare, outrageous retirement packages, 67 paid holidays, three weeks paid vacation, unlimited paid sick days. Now that's welfare, and they have the nerve to call my social security retirement payments entitlements? We're "broke" and we can't help our own Seniors, Veterans, Orphans, or Homeless. Yet in the last few months we have provided aid to Haiti, Chile and Turkey . And now Pakistan ......home of bin Laden. Literally, BILLIONS of DOLLARS!!! Our retired seniors living on a 'fixed S.S. income' receive no additional federal aid nor do they get any financial breaks, while our government and religious organizations pour hundreds of billions of $$$ and tons of food to foreign countries! They call Social Security and Medicare an entitlement even though most of us have been paying for it all our working lives, and now, when it's time for us to collect, the government is running out of money. Why did the government borrow from it in the first place? It was supposed to be in a locked box, not part of the general fund. Sad isn't it?</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1363811985426</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:39:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363812001386-260</Id><Topic><Title>SO ANTI-CHRIST OBAMA PROMISES TO PROTECT ISRAEL TODAY</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1363809694375</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:01:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so smartass bvi you say that you're a shemale??

Your math is a fail however, in 1960 the average family income was $5,600 so 15% of that was all of $840 not $4,500, makes your numbers way off, The fact is benefits the elderly (on average) take out are substantially greater then what they put in. According to the institute’s data, a two-earner couple receiving an average wage — $44,600 per spouse in 2012 dollars — and turning 65 in 2010 would have paid $722,000 into Social Security and Medicare and can be expected to take out $966,000 in benefits. So, this couple will be paid about one-third more in benefits than they paid in taxes. If a similar couple had retired in 1980, they would have gotten back almost three times what they put in. And if they had retired in 1960, they would have gotten back more than eight times what they paid in. The bigger discrepancies common decades ago can be traced in part to the fact that some of these individuals’ working lives came before Social Security taxes were collected beginning in 1937. Some types of families did much better than average. A couple with only one spouse working (and receiving the same average wage) would have paid in $361,000 if they turned 65 in 2010, but can expect to get back $854,000 — more than double what they paid in. In 1980, this same 65-year-old couple would have received five times more than what they paid in, while in 1960, such a couple would have ended up with 14 times what they put in.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363813662223</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 17:07:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363814020968-270</Id><Topic><Title>Texas state senator: Close abortion clinics because sometimes men have anal bleeding LADY GAIL NAILED IT!</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1363812226118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:43:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumb and dumber your anl obsession is worse than Juniors.

Paul Ryan's (R-WI) budget. House Democratic Caucus Chair Xavier Becerra (D-CA), Vice Chair Joe Crowley (D-NY) and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Marcia Fudge (D-OH) touted their alternative budgets in a morning press briefing and aggressively criticized Ryan over his GOP proposal. "Earth to Chairman Ryan. Come in, Chairman Ryan. Come back to Earth," said Becerra. "Because people want to work. People want to make sure the earned benefits they paid for are there for them when they finally need them. ... Come back from space." Fudge said that "if anyone can add or subtract, they can look at the Ryan budget and know that it doesn't add up. Mathematically it doesn't make any sense. ... The Ryan budget is based on a premise that is false from the beginning." She went after him for claiming he'll repeal the Affordable Care Act while assuming its higher taxes and Medicare cuts. "Did Ryan indicate which planet they're on?" said Crowley. Hey Crowley they are from Texas, it ain't on this planet.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363814152629</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 17:15:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363814180801-272</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO starting to move higher!</Title><Username>lucadobson</Username><Timestamp>1362659226270</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 07:27:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>solid information</Msg><Username>vincent.mcneill</Username><Timestamp>1363814180801</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 17:16:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363814181317-273</Id><Topic><Title>SOCIAL SECURITY -- this lady nails it:</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1363811985426</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:39:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>THE FOLKS IN WASHINGTON HAVE PULLED OFF A BIGGER PONZI SCHEME THAN BERNIE MADOFF EVER DID. *** Everybody forgot about the Obama gubmint shutdown next Friday.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1363814181317</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 17:16:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363814455235-274</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO CEO Buying Shares?</Title><Username>fredric.sylvester</Username><Timestamp>1363621330780</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:42:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great report, thanks!</Msg><Username>hardytodd859</Username><Timestamp>1363814455235</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 17:20:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363814547321-275</Id><Topic><Title>SO ANTI-CHRIST OBAMA PROMISES TO PROTECT ISRAEL TODAY</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1363809694375</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:01:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's not a man of his word.

Police spokeswoman Raquel Foster told The Journal Gazette shortly before that officers had taken the child from the house where he had been held hostage by the man who pulled a 49-year-old woman off a bus and shot her Wednesday morning. The Allen County Coroner's office identified the woman as Jacqueline Bouvier Hardy of Fort Wayne.

The DNC is ready to vote present so the GOP will own it if it passes. The GOP is now in a position where they are twisting GOP arms to get them to vote against the bill so it won't pass. LMAO House Democrats are not whipping a “no” vote on the Republican Study Committee (RSC) budget, opening up the possibility they will try a fancy floor maneuver. Two years ago, Democrats whipped a “present” vote on the conservative RSC plan, in an attempt to force a situation where it replaced the leadership-backed budget authored by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) For the amendment to succeed, it only needs a majority, excluding present votes. In 2011, the RSC budget failed on a 119-to-136 vote, with 172 voting “present.” “I thought it was a good strategy when I first proposed it. I think it remains a good strategy, to let the American people know what, in fact, the majority of Republicans really believe,” Democratic Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Tuesday. The RSC plan is coming up for a vote Wednesday. It would balance the budget in four years with much deeper cuts than the newest Ryan budget. It would also privatize Medicare for those 59 and younger, an older cutoff date than Ryan has used, or which centrists in the party find comfortable. The Hoyer move could spell trouble for many in the GOP. The conservative Heritage Action organization announced Wednesday that they are "key voting" the RSC budget, meaning a "no" vote on the RSC would count against a member's annual ratings. If the RSC budget is on track to passage, House GOP leaders will likely have to engage in arm-twisting to lower the GOP "yes" vote total, in order to ensure the RSC budget amendment does not pass.
