If (2), ain't NOBODY gonna be in the mood to elect yet ANOTHER dombfock RepubliCON to high office. If (3), then no Republican candidate (Christie included) will be well-positioned to run against the Dems in 2016. BUT IF (4) ... CALLING PRESIDENT CHRISTIE, CALLING PRESIDENT CHRISTIE!!!

Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said in an email to employees Tuesday that Jeep assembly lines will remain in operation in the United States. Suggestions to the contrary are "inaccurate," Marchionne assured his staff. The Romney ads also imply that General Motors is going to double production in China after trimming 15,000 jobs in Ohio. GM subsequently blasted the Romney campaign for playing politics with an auto bailout that helped the U.S. manufacturing sector through the 2008 economic crisis. "We've clearly entered some parallel universe during these last few days," GM spokesman Greg Martin said. "No amount of campaign politics at its cynical worst will diminish our record of creating jobs in the U.S. and repatriating profits back to this country."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351688566369</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 09:02:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351689740127-25</Id><Topic><Title>Check This stock analysis</Title><Username>danial_joseph</Username><Timestamp>1333929008000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-04-08 19:50:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice to be member.</Msg><Username>phyllishenry3033</Username><Timestamp>1351689740127</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 09:22:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351690299067-26</Id><Title>Wow Obama got the NYSE open again</Title><Msg>what a miracle worker!!!</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351690299067</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 09:31:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351690655109-27</Id><Topic><Title>Wow Obama got the NYSE open again</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351690299067</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 09:31:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You be one stupid dude!.

This marks the first time that the issue wasn’t brought up in the debates since Ronald Reagan ran for re-election. Whether or not Sandy is a direct result of climate change is debatable, unlike the science that shows that inaction to prevent a climate crisis is the “gravest threat humanity faces.” In the aftermath of a hurricane that’s estimated to have caused $20 billion in damage, climate is suddenly a hot topic of conversation. You remember that in his speech at the Republican National Convention, Mitt Romney blasted the president for wanting to “begin to slow the rise of the oceans.” Tuesday in Minnesota, President Clinton noted, “In my part of America, we would’ve liked it if somebody could’ve done that yesterday.” Clinton praised the president’s policies to transition to green energy and added, “In the real world, Barack Obama’s policies work better.” The politics of the electoral college make talking about fighting carbon emissions nearly impossible, as it could alienate crucial votes in the coal regions of Ohio and Pennsylvania. But it’s important to remember Barack Obama’s record. According to Time magazine’s Mike Grunwald – the author of the seminal book on the stimulus, The New, New Deal, “…he’s probably done more to prevent climate change than anyone else on the planet.” Who even comes close? Al Gore, maybe. In addition to the president’s new fuel standards that will save a whole year of carbon emissions by 2025, Grunwald points out that Obama is also responsible for untold innovations in green technologies: Obama’s stimulus bill also launched a quiet clean-energy revolution, with unprecedented investments in wind, solar, geothermal and other renewables; energy efficiency in every possible form; blue-sky research into low-carbon technologies; the smart grid; electric vehicles; advanced biofuels; and the factories to build all that green stuff in the U.S. Basically, the president has launched several Manhattan Projects to get us to cleaner energy. But because of both the Republicans’ incredibly successful effort to brand the stimulus a failure and the electoral college, he can’t even mention them. Would a President Romney take credit for the progress that will emerge from these investments? Or would he reverse the new fuel standards and stamp out any progress he can? Bet on the latter. Since he began running for president, Romney has moved from a genuine green energy reformer to a tool of Big Oil’s agenda, even refusing to acknowledge that climate change is caused by human activity. His energy policies never even mention climate change or indicate that he would try to wean America off oil, as even George W. Bush used to suggest. Sandy reminds us what happens when we ignore climate change. But we also have to remember that the president’s actions to get us off oil and coal speak louder than words.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351697414867</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 11:30:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351697634667-43</Id><Topic><Title>Only #$%$ laughing at rising Oceans</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351697414867</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 11:30:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Idiot!</Msg><Username>fallis.1942</Username><Timestamp>1351697634667</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 11:33:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351697634675-44</Id><Topic><Title>Only #$%$ laughing at rising Oceans</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351697414867</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 11:30:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Idiot!</Msg><Username>fallis.1942</Username><Timestamp>1351697634675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 11:33:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351698004881-45</Id><Title>CSCO Yahoo Finance charts - all on one screen - for free</Title><Msg>See all CSCO charts - all on one screen - for free.

Fifty-four percent of Americans think Obama will win the election, compared with 32 percent who predict a Romney victory, according to Gallup polling released Wednesday but conducted before Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast. Eleven percent have no opinion. Back in May, 56 percent believed an Obama win was likely in November, 36 percent thought Romney was likely to win, and 8 percent had no opinion, according to Gallup. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday found a similar result: 53 percent of registered voters believed Obama would win, compared with 29 percent for Romney. In the 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 elections, Americans accurately predicted the popular vote winner. The gap between Obama and Romney is similar to the gap between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000. Fifty-two percent of registered voters thought then-Vice President Gore would defeat the Texas governor, while 35 percent thought Bush would win. The poll of 1,063 adults was conducted on Saturday and Sunday, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351698271270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 11:44:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351699109802-48</Id><Title>obama orders fema to leave nj and go to chicago and delaware</Title><Msg>homes of obama and biden, making sure areas are safe for their returns on Jan 20th.</Msg><Username>soletraine</Username><Timestamp>1351699109802</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 11:58:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351700137257-49</Id><Topic><Title>Hurricane Sandy Looting, Fights Plague South Brooklyn</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1351697009240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 11:23:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>would that be in an all DemocRATic precinct?

One letter read: Congress faces a difficult task to balance needs and resources and allocate burdens and sacrifices. Just solutions, however, must require shared sacrifice by all, including raising adequate revenues, eliminating unnecessary military and other spending, and fairly addressing the long-term costs of health insurance and retirement programs. The House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral criteria. We join other Christian leaders in insisting a “circle of protection” be drawn around essential programs that serve poor and vulnerable people. Another letter read: At a time of great competition for agricultural resources and budgetary constraints, the needs of those who are hungry, poor and vulnerable should come before assistance to those who are relatively well off and powerful. With other Christian leaders, we urge the committee to draw a “circle of protection” around resources that serve those in greatest need and to put their needs first even though they do not have powerful advocates or great influence. Yet another read: The moral measure of this budget debate is not which party wins or which powerful interests prevail, but rather how those who are jobless, hungry, homeless or poor are treated. Their voices are too often missing in these debates, but they have the most compelling moral claim on our consciences and our common resources.

A fair amount of this boils down to Ohio, where three polls released on Tuesday gave Mr. Obama leads by margins ranging from three to five percentage points. Two of the polls, from Grove Research and the Mellman Group, generally show strong results for Democrats, which give them less impact in the forecast after applying our adjustment for pollster “house effects”. Still, the three polls taken collectively were enough to widen Mr. Obama’s projected lead in Ohio to 2.4 percentage points from 2.1 on Monday. Given how central Ohio is to each candidate’s electoral strategy — and how little time remains in the race — this was enough to improve Mr. Obama’s Electoral College chances. (The forecast does not yet account for the poll by Quinnipiac University for The New York Times and CBS News, which had Mr. Obama five points ahead in Ohio but which was released after we had run the model for the night.)</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351709816289</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 14:56:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351709961394-94</Id><Topic><Title>Obama strongly favored to win despite bagger bull</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351709816289</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 14:56:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In six more days we'll all know the answer from the only poll that really matters.</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1351709961394</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 14:59:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351710004020-95</Id><Topic><Title>A general was interviewed on the news obviously this president failed and is attempting to hide it perhaps until after the election</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1351708313461</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 14:31:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are a LIAR, and make up your own evil fairy tales.

(NTWK), a worldwide provider of global IT and enterprise application solutions, today provided preliminary revenue results for the first quarter ended September 30, 2012. Preliminary revenue results indicate the company's strongest first quarter ever, with revenue expected in the range of $10 million to $11 million. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An analyst covering the stock recently upped its earnings projections for NTWK based on significant increased global demand for all of its software products and services (legacy and cloud) Analyst comments: All business lines are very strong growth across the board. Significant demand for all legacy and cloud products. Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 net income projections. EPS forecast of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. . NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12.

The attacks culminated on September 11, 1857, with the mass slaughter of the emigrant party by the Iron County district of the Utah Territorial Militia and some local Native Americans. The wagon train—composed almost entirely of families from Arkansas—was bound for California on a route that passed through the Utah Territory during a turbulent period later known as the Utah War. After arriving in Salt Lake City, the Baker–Fancher party made their way south, eventually stopping to rest at Mountain Meadows. While the emigrants were camped at the meadow, nearby militia leaders, including Isaac C. Haight and John D. Lee, made plans to attack the wagon train. The militia, officially called the Nauvoo Legion, was composed of Utah's Mormon settlers (members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church). Intending to give the appearance of Native American aggression, their plan was to arm some Southern Paiute Native Americans and persuade them to join with a larger party of their own militiamen—disguised as Native Americans—in an attack. During the initial assault on the wagon train, the emigrants fought back and a five-day siege ensued. Eventually fear spread among the militia's leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men, and had probably discovered who their attackers really were. This resulted in an order by militia commander William H. Dame for the emigrants' annihilation. Running low on water and provisions, the emigrants allowed a party of militiamen to enter their camp, who assured them of their safety and escorted them out of their hasty fortification. After walking a distance from the camp, the militiamen, with the help of auxiliary forces hiding nearby, attacked the emigrants. Intending to leave no witnesses of complicity by Mormons in the attacks, and to prevent reprisals that would further complicate the Utah War, the perpetrators killed all the adults and older children (totaling about 120 men, women, and children). Seventeen children, all younger than seven, were spared.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351713423472</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 15:57:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351713447718-114</Id><Title>Fingerpointing time</Title><Msg>Gasoline shortage now growing on East coast.Next comes the price spikes.

This percentage is similar to, but slightly higher than, the FiveThirtyEight forecast, which gave Mr. Obama a 76 percent chance of winning Ohio as of Friday. It is important to emphasize that this analysis covers cases in which there were at least three distinct polling firms active in a state; you will find more frequent misses in cases where there were just one or two polls. In Ohio, however, there are not just three polls: roughly a dozen polling firms, rather, have surveyed the state over the past 10 days. There are no precedents in the database for a candidate losing with a two- or three-point lead in a state when the polling volume was that rich.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351713677478</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 16:01:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351713788598-117</Id><Topic><Title>Fingerpointing time</Title><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1351713447718</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 15:57:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you can smell the baggers desperation, an entire election season of hatred going to waste.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351713788598</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 16:03:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351713886812-118</Id><Title>Can any of you baggers tell me</Title><Msg>what State Mitt is a resident of?

Given the GOP's ongoing use of the "voter fraud" fable to justify modern Jim Crow laws and its highly-publicized persecution of the voter registration group Acorn, an actual case of felony voter fraud committed by the Republican nominee could have been a big story – but Romney was able to tamp down the flames by claiming, not very credibly but also not disprovably, that he and Ann actually were living in their son Tagg's Belmont, Massachusetts basement in 2010.

Obama's standing improved 2 points from the school's last poll, while Romney's fell a significant 5 points. The poll gives Obama a 4-point Real Clear Politics average lead in the state in polls taken over the past two weeks. In another state, Obama holds a big early-voting advantage. He wins the early vote 56-36 thus far — significant, as 10 percent of the 1,243 likely voters surveyed said they had voted.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351715933008</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 16:38:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351715996540-137</Id><Topic><Title>O'Loser playing hurricane Sandy for political GAIN.</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1351715784536</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 16:36:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's close to Dover AFB right now.

He said that Jeep, the American icon and great Toledo institution, "is thinking of moving all production to China." Everyone paying attention to the election called him on it. Chrysler Group LLC has set the record straight, stating it has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America. Defiance is an Ohio auto town whose most important employer is the General Motors (GM) plant that was saved by President Barack Obama. Voters there recognize that Romney's claim is just plain foolish, because Jeep is expanding, not contracting -- it's been all over the Ohio press for a year. Though the fact-checkers and the media unanimously shot down Romney's claims, no one was more stunned at the sheer craziness of Romney's statement than the workers at the Jeep factory, just down the road from Defiance. Chrysler is investing $500 million, adding 1,100 jobs and will actually add new models to one of the Jeep plants in Toledo.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351726572359</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 19:36:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351726638236-181</Id><Topic><Title>Is Manchelle an orangutan or a spider monkey?</Title><Username>celltones</Username><Timestamp>1351725136483</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 19:12:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She's a dude...orangutan -- you nailed it!</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351726638236</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 19:37:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351726647613-182</Id><Topic><Title>New Ohio Quinnipiac poll out: Obama +5</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1351704200037</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 13:23:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well the Gov. of Ohio says Romney is ahead.

His campaign is based entirely on persuading people that Mitt Romney is a uniquely bad man, entirely dedicated to the rich, ignorant of the problems of the average person. As long as he could run his negative ads, the campaign at least kept voters away from the Romney bandwagon. But once we all met Mitt Romney for three 90-minute debates, we got to know him — and to like him. He was not the monster Obama depicted, but a reasonable person for whom we could vote. As we stripped away Obama’s yearlong campaign of vilification, all the president offered us was more servings of negative ads — ads we had already dismissed as not credible. He kept doing the same thing even as it stopped working. The result was that the presidential race reached a tipping point. Reasonable voters saw that the voice of hope and optimism and positivism was Romney while the president was only a nitpicking, quarrelsome, negative figure. The contrast does not work in Obama’s favor. His erosion began shortly after the conventions when Indiana (10 votes) and North Carolina (15) moved to Romney (in addition to the 179 votes that states the states McCain won Then, in October, Obama lost the Southern swing states of Florida (29) and Virginia (13). He also lost Colorado (10), bringing his total to 255 votes. And now, he faces the erosion of the northern swing states: Ohio (18), New Hampshire (4) and Iowa (6). Only in the union-anchored state of Nevada (9) does Obama still cling to a lead. In the next few days, the battle will move to Pennsylvania (20), Michigan (15), Wisconsin (10) and Minnesota (16). Ahead in Pennsylvania, tied in Michigan and Wisconsin, and slightly behind in Minnesota, these new swing states look to be the battleground. Or will the Romney momentum grow and wash into formerly safe Democratic territory in New Jersey and Oregon? Once everyone discovers that the emperor has no clothes (or that Obama has no argument after the negative ads stopped working), the vote shift could be of historic proportions. The impact on Senate races could be profound. Give the GOP easy pickups in Nebraska and North Dakota. Wisconsin has been a roller coaster. Once an easy win for Republican Tommy Thompson, then a likely loss as Democrat Tammy Baldwin caught up, and now Republican again, it will probably be a third pickup. Romney’s surge in Virginia is propelling George Allen to a good lead for the first time all campaign. In Montana, Republican Denny Rehberg holds and has held for some time a small lead over Democrat incumbent Jon Tester. And, in Pennsylvania, Smith has powered his campaign to a small lead over Democrat Bob Casey Jr. The GOP now leads in these six takeaways. But it is also within easy striking distance in Ohio and Florida, where incumbents are under 50 percent and Republican challengers Connie Mack (Fla.) and Josh Mandel (Ohio) are only a few points behind. It may even be possible to entertain daydreams of Rhode Island (Barry Hinckley) and New Jersey (Joe Kyrillos) going Republican. Republican losses? Look for a giveback in Maine and possibly in Indiana and Massachusetts. In Indiana, Republican Richard Mourdock had established a 5-point lead over Democrat Joe Donnelly. But his comments about rape knocked him back to a tie. With Romney carrying the state by 15 points, however, Mourdock could still make it. In Massachusetts, Brown has been in hand-to-hand combat with Elizabeth Warren. Down by five a few days ago, he’s now tied, but the undecided usually goes against the incumbent. The most likely outcome? Eight GOP takeaways and two giveaways for a net gain of six. A 53-47 Senate, just like we have now, only opposite. Barack Obama’s parting gift to the Democratic Party.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351727722686</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 19:55:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351727758665-192</Id><Topic><Title>DIICK MORRIS expains why Obama will lose bigtime</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351727722686</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 19:55:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>koljkojojojojo</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351727758665</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 19:55:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351728116158-193</Id><Topic><Title>NewJersey,yes,Benghazi,no</Title><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1351721525319</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 18:12:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Haven't seen any" baggers" claiming Bill Ayers is dead like you did,dumdum.LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL</Msg><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1351728116158</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 20:01:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351728304713-194</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN ROMNEY WINS THE POPULAR VOTE AND 330 ELECTORAL VOTES, BECAUSE OF SANDY</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1351636824869</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 18:40:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Katie Couric is gonna cry!

It is also noteworthy that Israel and the Jews have never featured so prominently in a presidential campaign. In last week’s debate on foreign policy between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney, both candidates competed to demonstrate their pro-Israel credentials and the Jewish state was mentioned no less than 34 times. Until six weeks ago there was an emerging consensus shared by supporters and opponents alike, that Romney had failed to make an impact and that Obama would be reelected. Yet since the first dramatic debate, the upsurge in support for Romney has been extraordinary, and if the polls reflect reality, the outcome could be a real cliff-hanger. Of course, opinion polls can be misleading. The complexity of the Electoral College voting system does not necessarily grant victory to the candidate receiving the majority of votes. The even more critical factor is whether those who actually vote will proportionately adhere to the same trends as those initially polled. Not surprisingly, many Israelis will be hoping for a Romney win. Despite Obama’s ongoing commitment to providing Israel with military aid and his more recent positive policies towards Israel, it is no secret that he personally loathes Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Most Israelis are fearful that if reelected, no longer needing a charm offensive to garner Jewish support, Obama is likely to repeat the pattern of his first term when he unashamedly reneged on many of his previous undertakings towards Israel. They are concerned that he will revert to his earlier policy of “adopting daylight between Israel and the US” and will renew pressure on the Jewish state to make further unilateral concessions towards the Palestinians. There is fear that he will again insist that the indefensible 1949 armistice lines be considered as the opening benchmark for negotiating borders and will also press for the division of Jerusalem. Romney, in contrast, enjoys a cordial personal relationship with Netanyahu. More importantly he also seems to display a far more positive attitude towards the Jewish state. One of his major criticisms of the administration’s foreign policy has been Obama’s alleged abandonment and continuous public chastisement and humiliation of Israel. Whereas Obama blames Israeli settlement policies – including home construction in east Jerusalem’s Jewish suburbs – for the impasse with the Palestinians, Romney says plainly that peace will be unattainable until the Palestinians genuinely abandon their objective of destroying the Jewish state. As to Iran, notwithstanding undertakings to do all that is necessary to prevent them from becoming a nuclear power, should sanctions fail to bring about tangible results there are grave doubts as to whether Obama would be willing to take the tough measures required. However, should Romney be elected, while presumably providing notice of tougher intentions, during his first months in office he too would be unlikely to immediately initiate drastic military action. There is a vast chasm between the approaches of both candidates in relation to the Arab world, which is increasingly falling under more extreme Islamic and jihadist influences and where use of the terms Islamic extremism or Islamic terrorism are even banned. Despite having eliminated Osama bin Laden, the Obama administration has, as a matter of course, appeased Islamists by initially resisting sanctions and failing to support the Iranian dissidents seeking regime change. Shortly after taking office, Obama infuriated the Mubarak government by legitimizing the Muslim Brotherhood when he insisted that their representatives occupy the front row at his inaugural speech in Cairo. Furthermore, at the outset of protests in Egypt, he abandoned the authoritarian President Hosni Mubarak, regarded as one of the strongest US allies in the Arab world. Since then, his administration has consistently understated the fanatical extremism of the Muslim Brotherhood and ignored the recent genocidal exhortations against Israel by their newly elected Egyptian leader. The groveling response to the terrorist upsurges in Libya and Egypt is another indicator of the administration’s policy of Islamic appeasement. Obama also repeatedly publicly praised the dictatorial Islamist Turkish leader, Recep Erdogan, who made himself popular in the Arab world by his anti-Israeli tirades and efforts to impose boycotts and isolate the Jewish state. Yet, after four years in office, despite President Obama’s desperate efforts to appease and “engage” the Islamists, the US today is more reviled in the Arab world than ever before. The perception amongst most Israelis is that a Romney administration would be more realistic and tougher towards the Islamists. However, in contrast, the majority of American Jews, clearly loth to forfeit their liberal DNA, still support Obama and will continue voting Democrat. Besides, like most Americans, economic policies are the principal factors determining their vote. This also partially reflects the depressing reality that a large proportion of American Jews, especially the more assimilated, no longer consider Israel a major priority when casting their votes. Indeed, for many of the less committed Jews, issues like gay marriage and abortion on demand seem to outweigh the wellbeing of the Jewish state. On the other hand, there will undoubtedly be a substantial number of Jewish defections from the Obama camp, with the more committed and Orthodox Jewish segments voting heavily against the current president. Prime Minister Netanyahu has assiduously avoided engaging in the presidential campaign. That has not prevented his political opponents from accusing him of making Israel a “wedge” issue. Yet it would be inconceivable that due to the US presidential election, an Israeli prime minister should remain silent on the need to for the world to stand up and take tough action against a potentially nuclear power publicly exhorting the world to support its objective of wiping his country – “a cancer” – off the face of the planet. As Netanyahu said to CNN, “I am being guided by the Iranian nuclear calendar not the American political calendar.” But Netanyahu would be less than human if privately he did not yearn for a victory for Romney, who has been both a friend and ally. If, however, Obama is reelected, Netanyahu will be obliged to try to overcome the personal animosity and work with him, without compromising Israel’s security or long-term strategic interests. This will not be easy but as long as grass roots support for Israel remains strong and Congress does not abandon us, it is possible. From his side Obama may have learnt that his bullying tactics only strengthened public support for Netanyahu in Israel. And if Romney wins, Israelis should not be euphoric. Although Romney will undoubtedly have a better chemistry with Israel than his predecessor, we still face tough challenges. And we should bear in mind that whereas Romney is undoubtedly a friend, the track records of Republican presidents toward Israel has also often been problematic. Irrespective who becomes the next president of the USA, American Jewish leaders must seek to reverse the growing threat from the far Left anti-Israeli activists in the Democratic party and reinvigorate the bipartisan spirit which has been so vital to maintain the strong US-Israel relationship.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351729358367</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 20:22:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351730253447-200</Id><Title>LibTURDS want Benghazi-GATE to go away</Title><Msg>because they know its an albatross around his neck.

Now, it’s allegedly happening again, this time in both Kansas and Ohio — and we talked to a vendor supporting the machines about the issue. Nancy from Topeka, Kan., who asked that her last name not be used for reasons pertaining to her husband’s work, told TheBlaze she fears if voters aren’t double checking their selections, they’ll be “robbed of their vote.” Nancy explained that while her husband was casting a vote for Romney, the touchscreen highlighted Obama. “He played around with the field a little and realized that in order to vote for Romney, his finger had to be exactly on the mark,” Nancy wrote in an email. She said “the invisible Obama field came down about 1/4 [of an inch]” into what should technically have been the Romney area. In a phone interview with TheBlaze, she explained further that her husband said he felt the area on the touchscreen that could be pushed to vote for Obama was larger than that for Romney. Nancy and her husband called the Kansas Secretary of State to report the problem and were informed that it was most likely a calibration issue. “My concern is, is this intentional?” Nancy said.
