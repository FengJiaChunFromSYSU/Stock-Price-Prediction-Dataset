Polls show that Mr. Romney has middling personal favorability ratings but that many voters will choose him anyway because of the deteriorating economy. Senate races, however, are less dictated by national economic conditions. Instead, they often turn more on the strengths and weaknesses of the individual candidates, and then by their stances on fiscal and social policy. Mr. Romney has not dictated much in the way of detailed programs in these areas, and some of the policy stances that he has articulated are unpopular. Mr. Romney has also been less able to campaign effectively against an unpopular Democratic initiative, the Democrats’ health care bill, because he passed a similar bill as governor of Massachusetts. Finally, some voters who disapprove of Mr. Obama, but who also have lukewarm feelings toward Mr. Romney, might lean toward voting Democrat for Senate in effort to ensure divided government, especially since Republicans also have control of the House.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1348745366718</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 07:29:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348745393240-11</Id><Title>Theory No. 2: G.O.P. Conservatism Is Hurting</Title><Msg>Theory No. 2: G.O.P. Conservatism Is Hurting An alternative hypothesis is that the shift has to do with overall perceptions of the Republican platform. Our research has shown that statistical measures of candidate ideology are a reasonably powerful predictor of the outcome of Senate races, with candidates who are rated as holding “extreme” views performing poorly. But in practice, ideology is in large part perceptual for voters, and may depend on which issues seem most salient at any given time. August, at which point the shift toward Democrats in Senate races appeared to begin, was dominated by two major news items: Mr. Romney’s selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate, who has very conservative views on fiscal policy, and by the comments about rape made by the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, Todd Akin, which may have reinforced the idea that Republicans hold very conservative positions on social issues. These factors may have made it harder for Republicans to position themselves toward the ideological center. And in several states, including Missouri, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, Republicans nominated sub-optimally conservative candidates. More moderate Republican candidates, like Mr. Brown of Massachusetts and Mrs. McMahon of Connecticut, have increasingly sought to distance themselves from the national Republican brand, and sometimes also from the Republican presidential ticket. Some of these theories are speculative, to be sure. A large number of Senate races remain in play: of the several states in which there has been a shift against Republicans in the polls in recent weeks, perhaps only Florida seems completely lost. But if the trend continues, the question may no longer be whether Republicans can win the Senate — but how vulnerable they are to losing the House.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1348745393240</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 07:29:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348745614921-12</Id><Topic><Title>### CSCO Featured on Squawk Box ###</Title><Username>culttradeers</Username><Timestamp>1347910268996</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 15:31:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>special report</Msg><Username>jhonyking741</Username><Timestamp>1348745614921</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 07:33:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348747454408-13</Id><Topic><Title>how come Obama pardons drug dealers</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1348722301984</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 01:05:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>be happy he pardoned you!</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1348747454408</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 08:04:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348747522004-14</Id><Title>Politico DUPED into running more LIES</Title><Msg>Roger Simon of Politico ran a piece which includes supposed quotes like, " If Stench calls, take a message” and “Tell Stench I’m having finger sandwiches with Peggy Noonan and will text him later.” and after it appeared maybe he was duped, he comes out and says it was satire.

He is unleashed, unchained, off the hook. “I hate to say this, but if Ryan wants to run for national office again, he’ll probably have to wash the stench of Romney off of him,” Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Party of Iowa, told The New York Times on Sunday. Coming from a resident of Iowa, a state where people are polite even to soybeans, this was a powerful condemnation of the Republican nominee. Though Ryan had already decided to distance himself from the floundering Romney campaign, he now feels totally uninhibited. Reportedly, he has been marching around his campaign bus, saying things like, “If Stench calls, take a message” and “Tell Stench I’m having finger sandwiches with Peggy Noonan and will text him later.” Even before the stench article appeared, there was a strong sign that Ryan was freeing himself from the grips of the Romney campaign. It began after his disastrous appearance on Friday before AARP in New Orleans. Ryan delivered his remarks in the style dictated by his Romney handlers: Stand behind the lectern, read the speech as written and don’t stray from the script.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348749082597</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 08:31:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348749108290-21</Id><Title>GDP revised DOWN to 1.3% in Q2</Title><Msg>NOT good news for O'Loser.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1348749108290</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 08:31:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348749327553-22</Id><Topic><Title>Many a truth is spoken in jest</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348749082597</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 08:31:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NOBODY believes anything you say......Why don't you tell us some more about Politicos " stench " and " finger sandwiches " like you reported yesterday.

They gave the rich $15, the wealthy $11, the middle class $8, the lower class $3 and the poor $1. They then told all of them( but the poor )they had to give away $2 to either the class above them or to the class below them. Everyone gave the $2 to the class below them EXCEPT for the lower class. They wouldn't give the $2 to the poor they instead insisted on giving their $2 to the middle class. Researchers realized if the lower class gave the $2 to the poor would then they would be last, so they would rather give it to the wealthier.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348752185405</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:23:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348752454044-27</Id><Topic><Title>POLITICO (RIGHT WING MAG) STENCHY AND GILLIGAN ROTFFLMAO!!!!!!</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1348751975749</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:19:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You Surf, and dum dum got punk'd.LOLOLOLOLOLOL Now you are to dumb to just drop it and let people forget you were played for a fool.

That allows him to make decisions about where and how to spend the money and to take better advantage of discounted ad rates, which candidates receive under federal law. In one Ohio ad buy slated to run just before the election, for example, Obama is paying $125 for a spot that is costing a conservative super PAC $900. The imbalance could prove crucial over the next six weeks, when the candidates and their allies are expected to burn through about $1 billion worth of advertising in battleground states and deploy thousands of staffers and volunteers to drum up votes. With $1.5 billion already spent on the White House race, the final barrage will help determine whether Romney can turn around his fortunes and defeat the incumbent.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348753435557</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:43:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348753478513-37</Id><Topic><Title>New study out of Princeton</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348752185405</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:23:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>People with an i.q.over 100 probably wouldn' t have fallen for the Politico article like you did, smart guy.LOL</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1348753478513</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:44:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348753567627-38</Id><Topic><Title>On the move (CSCO)</Title><Username>maydtd737</Username><Timestamp>1348753070241</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:37:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SPAM C.R.A.P.</Msg><Username>lucenatraveler</Username><Timestamp>1348753567627</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:46:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348753568327-39</Id><Topic><Title>Were You Better Off in 2008 Compared to 2000 After 8 Years of GOP?</Title><Username>roboromney_version_2012</Username><Timestamp>1348753390202</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:43:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>8 Years of an average 5.3% UE under Bush, I'll take that anytime.

A new New York Times poll Wednesday put Romney a shocking 10 points behind Obama; even the most optimistic Democrats have a hard time believing the president, who won Ohio by less than 5 points in 2008, could win the state by 10 this time around. The most optimistic Republicans, for their part, do not believe any polls at all these days, since, in a highly suspicious coincidence, they are nearly unanimous in showing Romney behind. Seeing the candidates campaign in the state back-to-back, as I did, neatly illustrated the divergent mood between the two camps -- one flailing, one on a confident roll. The Obama campaign is clicking on all cylinders, consistent, smoothly choreographed and slickly produced; Romney's appearances are a jumble, his tone of voice pleading to the point of desperation, his speech constantly improvised from a Frankenstinian array of spare messaging parts, never quite gelling into a focused whole. Obama's crowds are a Bieber-like fan-throng; Romney's are only passionately angry. A visitor from another planet who didn't speak a word of any human language could tell which one was up and which was down. In the Columbus suburb of Westerville, Romney began his day in a high-school gymnasium bedecked with a confounding array of slogans. A whirling "debt clock" raced upward from 16 trillion; video monitors read "Victory in Ohio"; a bright-blue banner professed "We Need a Real Recovery"; and a powder-blue banner stated "We Can't Afford Four More Years." The governor, John Kasich, welcomed him to the stage with a whiplash-inducing mixed message: "Ohio's coming back! Our families are going back to work!" he said, extolling the state's fast-improving and better-than-average unemployment rate. And then, quickly turning dour: "But every day I have to face the headwinds from this president."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348753914957</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:51:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348753937378-45</Id><Title>Where will CSCO be in Vaudeville Act II?</Title><Msg>A vote for Obama is a vote for more debt!

Earlier this week, Romney told a CNN reporter that, when it comes to using accurate facts and figures, his campaign has "been absolutely spot on." He added, "And anytime there's anything that's been amiss, we correct it or remove it." "That's what makes that statement so newsworthy, because they Romney campaign...hasn't been correcting or removing their own false claims from the record when they are proven to be false, which is a strange decision for a campaign operating at the presidential level," she said. Maddow went through a number of campaign ads that included false claims that the Romney campaign did not correct or remove. For instance, Romney's first general election campaign ad included Obama saying, "If we keep talking about the economy, we are going to lose." In actuality, Obama said that comment on the campaign trail in 2008, and was quoting then-Republican presidential candidate, John McCain. "Sen. McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, 'If we keep talking about the economy, we are going to lose.'" Maddow said the discrepancy between what Obama actually said and the way the Romney campaign presented it in its campaign add was pretty severe. "That's a really big, really bad lie," she said. Despite the blatant inaccuracy, the Romney campaign kept the ad in tact and on its YouTube channel.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348754261718</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:57:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348754313950-49</Id><Topic><Title>GILLIGAN AND STENCH LOLOLOL!!</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1348753979083</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:52:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you trying to get someone to pay attention to you??

After the first Q2 GDP revision bubbled up from 1.5% to 1.7%, the sellside brigade was confident that the rate of growth would continue and final Q2 GDP would be in line. Instead, we got an absolute shock of a print, with the final Q2 GDP print coming in at a ridiculously low 1.25% (rounded up to 1.3%), below the lowest Wall Street estimate of 1.4%, and the lowest number since the revised 0.1% reported in January 2011. Here is the final GDP trendline: Q4 2011: 4.1%; Q1 2012: 2.0%; Q2 2012: 1.25%. Luckily, at least "housing has bottomed." The reason for the major contraction in the final print: a downward revision to all favorable components except Government which detracted the least from growth in years at just -0.14%. Of note - Personal Consumption was 1.06%, down from the 1.20% per the second revision. If nothing, we now know just what data Bernanke was looking at on an advance basis to come up with QEternity, and we also know the reason for the media and administration's all in gamble to reflate housing yet again. If the housing market does not go up courtesy of infinite cheap leverage, it could be curtains for the Bernanke reflation experiment.

In a little-noticed but vital change last spring, the House Budget Committee chairman cut half a point from the annual growth rate he had allowed for Medicare spending. It gave him the extra margin needed to pay for tax cuts and still placate the right by getting to balance in 2040. But it meant breaking with Ryan’s fellow Medicare reformer, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and raised this question that echoes now in the presidential campaign: Did Ryan cut corners with seniors to pay for tax cuts just as he accuses President Barack Obama of doing to finance health care reform? (Also on POLITICO: 10 presidential debate questions) Indeed, calculations by POLITICO — drawn from a Congressional Budget Office analysis commissioned by Ryan in March — show that without the half-point cut, the House Republican budget would still be in the red in 2040. And Ryan’s small adjustment compounds greatly over time: lowering spending for Medicare by hundreds of billions from 2030 to 2040 and well over $1 trillion from 2040 to 2050. Now, as Mitt Romney’s running mate, Ryan has pushed hard on the Medicare raid theme. (Also on POLITICO: GOP to Romney: Win the future) “Mitt Romney and I know the difference between protecting a program and raiding it,” Ryan told GOP delegates in Tampa, Fla. Returning to the same attack line before AARP in New Orleans last week, Ryan told the seniors lobby, “The law turned Medicare into a piggy bank for Obamacare.” But Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the Budget Committee’s ranking Democrat and the man chosen to play Ryan in prepping Joe Biden for the Oct. 11 vice presidential debate, answered in kind. Ryan is the true Medicare raider, Van Hollen said, squeezing seniors to make room for the GOP’s tax cuts.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1348757387948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 10:49:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348757429040-63</Id><Topic><Title>On the move (CSCO)</Title><Username>maydtd737</Username><Timestamp>1348753070241</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:37:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good job.

You must be kidding, show me the jobs. The only way the UE rate is dropping is the smoke and mirrors method of saying those without jobs who are going into foreclosure on their homes and selling or getting their cars repo'd just DROPPED OUT OF THE JOB MARKET, what #$%$, they cannot get jobs. Who would rather go chapter 13 or walk away from a home that they have paid for years to own rather than work? You Libs are stupid but the rest of us cannot be fooled, a lot less people are working.

If Obama treated his brother like a dog it would be humane.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348794242171</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 21:04:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348794668052-212</Id><Title>In '85 video, Romney says Bain will 'harvest' companies for profit</Title><Msg>#$%$ liberals off that someone can make a profit and harvest the fruit.

The company has become the focus of national attention because it has been taken over by Bain Capital, which plans to shut the factory down, lay off the workers, and outsource the production to China before the end of the year. The workers have pleaded with GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the founder of Bain Capital, to exert his considerable influence to save their jobs. Romney still makes millions each year in income from Bain. So far, he has declined to weigh in, and the factory is scheduled to close by the end of the year. While the workers and the town may suffer, Romney himself has done well as a result of Bain's work with the company. According to his recently released 2011 tax returns, Romney transferred $701,703 worth of Sensata stock to the Tyler Charitable Foundation, a 501(c)3 tax-exempt nonprofit controlled by Romney."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1348798206974</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 22:10:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348803509789-218</Id><Topic><Title>THERE ARE NOW 43 MILLION AMERICANS NOT WORKING, WHO WERE WORKING BEFORE OBIMBO DESTROYED AMERICA</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1348783542436</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 18:05:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You meant before GWB destroyed America did you not or were you once in an airplane with a broken window?</Msg><Username>anncisback</Username><Timestamp>1348803509789</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 23:38:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
