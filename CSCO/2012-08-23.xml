The model points to a Mitt Romney victory in 2012. Ken Bickers from CU-Boulder and Michael Berry from CU-Denver, the two political science professors who devised the prediction model, say that it has correctly forecast every winner of the electoral race since 1980. "Based on our forecasting model, it becomes clear that the president is in electoral trouble," Bickers said in a press statement. To predict the race's outcome, the model uses economic indicators from all 50 states and it shows 320 electoral votes for Romney and 218 for Obama, according to The Associated Press. The model also suggests that Romney will win every state currently considered a swing state which includes Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Colorado.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1345716437030</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 06:07:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345721277403-3</Id><Topic><Title>Bad news for Obama, Good news for America:</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1345716437030</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 06:07:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obumbles going down......

But that's when President Obama is pushing for the spending. When it was President George W. Bush arguing for more stimulus to boost a slow economy in the early 2000s, Ryan's economic analysis was entirely different. "What we're trying to accomplish today with the passage of this third stimulus package is to create jobs and help the unemployed," Ryan said, in comments unearthed by MSNBC's "Up with Chris Hayes" and provided to HuffPost. "What we're trying to accomplish is to pass the kinds of legislation that when they've passed in the past have grown the economy and gotten people back to work." Video of the comments will be aired at 8:00 a.m. Sunday on MSNBC. "In recessions unemployment lags on well after a recovery has taken place," Ryan accurately noted in 2002.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345726986764</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:03:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345727095835-13</Id><Title>Gopers don't believe in science</Title><Msg>"The interesting thing here is this individual is on the House Science and Technology Committee but somehow missed science class," Obama told donors at a New York City event last night.

Neither result was good. Here’s the first question: Has what you have seen, read, or heard about Mitt Romney’s previous business experience managing a firm that specializes in buying, restructuring, and selling companies made you feel … more positive or more negative about him, not made much difference in your opinion or do you not know enough about this to have an opinion at this time? Twenty-five percent said it made them feel more positive, 28 percent more negative, and 27 percent said it made no difference. When you remember that Romney has made this his chief qualification for the presidency, it speaks to the failure of his campaign to effectively rebut the charges. At best, Bain Capital is a non-factor for Romney, and for a significant number of people, it’s a detriment. The ongoing fight over his tax returns has done even more damage to the former Massachusetts governor. Here’s the question: Has what you have seen, read, or heard about Mitt Romney’s tax returns and the percent he has paid in federal income taxes made you feel … more positive or more negative about him, not made much difference in your opinion or do you not know enough about this to have an opinion at this time? Only 6 percent of respondents say that it has made a positive difference in their opinion of Romney. Thirty-six percent say that it has made a negative difference, and 41 percent say that it hasn’t made much difference at all. Seventeen percent don’t know either way. Romney’s anger over the Obama campaign’s decision to go after his tax returns makes more sense in this light; the controversy is doing real damage to his campaign, and more important, it has the potential to do more if Team Obama can return it to the forefront of the discussion. I wouldn’t bet against that possibility. As long as Romney refuses to release his returns, Obama can continue to hit him on the issue. Death by a thousand cuts is an exaggeration, but it’s not far off from what might happen; Romney could become defined by the things he won’t reveal, and gradually loses the trust of the public. His low favorability becomes a burden he can’t lift, keeping him behind Obama through the fall, and into the election.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1345733769504</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 10:56:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345733863173-31</Id><Title>8.3% Unemployment</Title><Msg>LibTURDS talking about what is important to them, Romneys taxes from 10 years ago.

This is a fledgling hypothesis and there's probably a few weak spots and gaps, nothing a good research grant couldn't cure (Harvard, call me...) but here it is: They're not lying to you. They honestly believe all of this stuff and it's not because they're stupid (although some are), it's because they are sick. John W. Dean, in his excellent work Conservatives Without Conscience applies the work of a psychologist called Altemeyer to the political arena. What they discovered was that conservatives tend to be divded into leaders and followers (I'm heavily simplifying. If you're interested, Google Altemeyer's work, it's fascinating). What I think they failed to point out was that the follower group has the ability to edit their internal recollection of reality to concur with approved sources. To you or I, the facts about what came before 9/11 are fairly simple: Bill Clinton wasn't entirely blameless but left the incoming Bush team a through blueprint of how to tackle al Queda and the bulk of the blame is on Bush. To the conservative though, nothing is true unless it comes through approved sources: Their pastor (or televangelist equivelent), Fox "news" and so on. I don't think it's co-incidence that the proportion of fundementalists (in the sense of Biblical literalists) in the population is roughly the same as Bush's surviving supporters. To believe that the earth was created in six days less than ten thousand years ago by a god who seemed to suffer from multiple personalities, that evolution never happened and the evidence is a conspiracy by godless scientists and/or the devil, that Christianity is under constant assault in the USA; it is this kind of internal editing which allows someone to still support Bush. In many ways, it operates like a cult. It has it's high priests (Rush Limbaugh, Shaun Hannity), it's prophets (Ronald Reagan who they are coming vanishingly close to outright worshipping), it's holy books (Jerry Falwell's edited Bible, Atlas Shrugged) and it's articles of faith (oh, pick one) and just like a cult, truth can only come from the lips of Dear Leader or his approved surrogates. All else is lies sent to tempt them from the true faith or just unimportant. It's also not a co-incidence that Republicans tended to accuse Obama supporters of being a cult. That's called projection. I think most of us probably remember the conversation recounted by David Kuo (I think, if someone knows different, please correct me) where a collegue of his said something to the effect of Kuo still belonging to the "reality based". He muttered something about enlightenment principles and observation and then his collegue responded "You don't understand how the world works now. We make our own reality". Although it probably wasn't meant as such, that's a very good summing-up of the mind of the conservative follower; that reality is not an unbiased, verifiable, external truth but something which can be internally constructed from whatever fits one's pre-existing views.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345748293273</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 14:58:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345748381479-80</Id><Title>NOK</Title><Msg>weeeeee hahahahahahahahahah$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 10k shares cost ave 1.92.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345748381479</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 14:59:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345748533509-81</Id><Topic><Title>COURT RULING: FOX NEWS ALLOWED TO LIE !</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo8</Username><Timestamp>1345745078494</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 14:04:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes 'the loons' are the ones that don't like it.

Conservatives have routinely mocked Vice President Joe Biden for arguing that in order to reduce the deficit in the long run, the government needs to spend more now; that sentiment is lampooned in a recent pro-Republican campaign ad. But Biden's analysis -- that the government needs to juice the economy to promote growth, or else revenue will fall long term -- is one that Ryan himself articulated cogently back when the GOP was urging stimulus. Ryan called such stimulus a "constructive answer" worked out on "a bipartisan basis." Opponents of stimulus, Ryan said, ought to "drop the demagoguery." "We've got to get the engine of economic growth growing again because we now know, because of recession, we don't have the revenues that we wanted to, we don't have the revenues we need, to fix Medicare, to fix Social Security, to fix these issues. We've got to get Americans back to work. Then the surpluses come back, then the jobs come back. That is the constructive answer we're trying to accomplish here on, yes, a bipartisan basis. I urge members to drop the demagoguery and to pass this bill to help us work together to get the American people back to work and help those people who've lost their jobs," Ryan said.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345749741621</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 15:22:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345750342912-86</Id><Topic><Title>ODE TO THE 4 BOARD IDIOTS...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345748883913</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 15:08:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh,my.

What About Jesus? Uniquely in the Mormon faith, it is believed that a tribe of ancient Israelites came to America 600 years before Christ. Every summer, hundreds of the faithful act out the story on the same hill where Smith is believed to have dug up the golden plates. After Jesus' resurrection, according to the Book of Mormon, he visited America. In fact, America plays a special role in Mormonism. Mormons believe that when Jesus returns to Earth, he will first go to Jerusalem and then to Missouri. "Mormons think they have a distinctive message. They have always thought that," Fluhman said. "But at the same time, the proximity to traditional Christianity is clear and obvious. So Mormons have a complicated relationship with traditional Christianity, I think is an easy way to say it."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345767457659</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:17:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345768070158-117</Id><Title>It is pretty clear, God is showing his wrath at the GOP for electing a cultist</Title><Msg>As Tropical Storm Isaac approaches hurricane strength and threatening to dampen their party, Republicans say their national convention will go on in Tampa next week anyway, formally nominating Mitt Romney for president.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345768070158</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:27:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345769243651-118</Id><Title>All quiet on the lib front</Title><Msg>Couple weeks ago the FOX poll had Obama up by nine and Junior,dumb,surf,etc just couldn't shut up.

The victor, they say, will be Republican Mitt Romney. The model uses economic indicators from all 50 states to predict the race's outcome. The forecast calls for Romney to win 320 electoral votes out of 538. It says Romney will also win virtually every state currently considered a swing state, including Colorado. The professors who created the model, Ken Bickers from CU-Boulder and Michael Berry from CU-Denver, say it correctly forecast every winner of the electoral since 1980.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1345770887437</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:14:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345771049365-120</Id><Topic><Title>If you can't be on the Mount of Olives there is always Missouri, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345767457659</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:17:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only a repuke can believe this shit.

For those wh... o are listening to liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: On January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took control of Congress: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies had SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION!

The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney), for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (but...the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? -- OBAMA!!!

THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car, but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel while they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets are not passed in the White House. They are passed by Congress, and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. Obama has now gone 1,000 days without a budget, and is still blaming it on the Republicans! In that first year, Congress had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending when Bush, somewhat belatedly, got tough on spending increases. For FY 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed Lame Duck President George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of those massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself and a Democratic Congress. In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is: "I inherited a deficit that I voted for, and then I expanded that deficit four-fold since January 20th 2009."</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1345771572715</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:26:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345771583010-123</Id><Title>Before history is lied away, a few facts to remember:</Title><Msg>The day the Democrats took over was NOT January 20, 2009, it was actually January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took over the House of Representatives and the Senate, at the very start of the 110th Congress.
