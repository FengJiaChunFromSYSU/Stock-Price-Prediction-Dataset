They have already printed enough money for hyperinflation. They want inflation because Keynesians think that money printing reduces unemployment. When you inflate the money supply you lower real wages. As the inflated money reduces real wages more and more, at some point employers will be able to make money by hiring some of the unemployed. So the way money printing reduces unemployment is by reducing real wages. I believe federal reserve chairmen, past and present, have stated that the twin deficits are unsustainable, correct me if I'm wrong. It occurs to me that monetary policy has not been very effective. To me at least, the evidence is in the decline in demand for U.S. treasuries other than the federal reserve and the increase in concern for the physical gold in U.S. vaults, not to mention lack of trust in government that some polls are showing. Every time Ben has to visit congress he tells them they need to do their part to get us back on track. Why? The patient will never wake up if the drugs that induced the comma are not curtailed to the point that they are not in use. We do have inflation? Anybody besides me gone to the store and bought a steak lately? Inflation is running at 13%.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1364990415968</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 08:00:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364991346119-28</Id><Topic><Title>Are CSCO Shareholders On The Verge Of A Huge Score??</Title><Username>l_stave</Username><Timestamp>1364912633676</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:23:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just crazy man.

O'Reilly has taken a fair amount of heat for his comments, in which he said gay marriage opponents' only argument seems to be "thumping the Bible." Ingraham charged that this had caused a "feud" between O'Reilly and conservatives, including radio host Rush Limbaugh. O'Reilly denied that there was any kind of "feud," but Ingraham told him that he didn't need to say what he said, particularly taking issue with his "thump the Bible" comments. "Why did you use the word 'thump?'" she asked him. "Because that's the way you get it across," O'Reilly responded. "There are Bible thumpers, and all they do is say, 'I object to gay marriage because God objects to it.' You don't win a policy debate in America with that." O'Reilly said he was "in business to help," saying his comments were "accurate" and "honest" and that gay marriage advocates "can't win the debate" with the arguments they make now.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364999010696</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:23:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364999050886-53</Id><Title>Obama good to the rich</Title><Msg>As those on food stamps approach 48 million, Porsche estimates a 34% rise in car sales this year.

Walton County Sheriff Mike Adkinson confirmed to The Northwest Florida Daily News that Lane Rees, a former Walton County Commissioner, was taken into custody around 5 p.m. on Monday after a month-long investigation. Deputies recovered "multiple images" of child pornography after serving a search warrant on his home in Santa Rosa Beach. Rees was elected to the Walton County Commission in 2000, where he served until being defeated by 23-year-old Republican Scott Brannon four years later. He has served as Walton County's Republican state committeeman since being elected by party members in 2008. In 2001, Walton County named Rees "Man of the Year." According to his bio, Rees is President of the consulting group Human Resource Solutions, Inc. and serves on the board of the United Methodist Church's Foundation for Evangelism. Rees faces up to 10 years in prison and $10,000 in fines if convicted on all charges.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1365000513377</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:48:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365000547999-63</Id><Title>NRA new purchase</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—The National Rifle Association leader Wayne LaPierre today defended his decision to purchase the former congressman Asa Hutchinson, after an outspoken N.R.A. member complained that the organization should be using its funds to buy current congressmen only. Shortly after Mr. Hutchinson appeared at a press conference in Washington to present the N.R.A.’s plan to arm teachers and other school personnel, N.R.A. dissident Tracy Klugian blasted the purchase of the former Arkansas representative. “Members of the N.R.A. fork over millions of dollars to this organization,” he said. “That money should be used to buy people who are actually in Congress now, not some has-been like Hutchinson who doesn’t even have a vote anymore.” Mr. Klugian said that as he watched former Rep. Hutchinson at the podium, “It made my blood boil, especially when I thought about all of the current congressmen out there who are totally for sale.” Not long after Mr. Klugian made his comments, Mr. LaPierre pushed back: “The purchase of Asa Hutchinson did not and will not prevent the N.R.A. from buying a single additional congressman in the future. Period.” While refusing to divulge the purchase price for Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. LaPierre reassured the N.R.A. membership, “We got a very good deal on Asa. There wasn’t exactly a bidding war.” In a separate statement, Mr. Hutchinson said, “A free and lively exchange of views is what makes the N.R.A. such a great organization—and is why I’m so proud to be owned by it.” Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365000547999</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:49:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365000576290-64</Id><Topic><Title>Good thing we didn’t let Detroit go bankrupt.</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1364999148860</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:25:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What year did Pelosi take the gavel, and does the word "sequester" mean anything to you?

Bush addresses the White House Conference on Increasing Minority Homeownership at The George Washington University Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2002 THE PRESIDENT: …. I appreciate your attendance to this very important conference. You see, we want everybody in America to own their own home. That's what we want. This is -- an ownership society is a compassionate society. More and more people own their homes in America today. Two-thirds of all Americans own their homes, yet we have a problem here in America because few than half of the Hispanics and half the African Americans own the home. That's a homeownership gap. It's a -- it's a gap that we've got to work together to close for the good of our country, for the sake of a more hopeful future. We've got to work to knock down the barriers that have created a homeownership gap. I set an ambitious goal. It's one that I believe we can achieve. It's a clear goal, that by the end of this decade we'll increase the number of minority homeowners by at least 5.5 million families. (Applause) … And it's going to require a strong commitment from those of you involved in the housing industry…And so we've called upon Congress to set up what's called the American Dream Down Payment Fund, which will provide financial grants to local governments to help first-time home buyers who qualify to make the down payment on their home. If a down payment is a problem, there's a way we can address that. And when Congress funds the program, this should help 200,000 new families over the next five years become first-time home buyers. Secondly, affordable housing is a problem in many neighborhoods, particularly inner-city neighborhoods. … I'm doing is proposing a single-family affordable housing credit to encourage the construction of single-family homes in neighborhoods where affordable housing is scarce.

Bush warned the Democratic Congress 17 times in 2008 alone about the systemic consequences of financial turmoil at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and also put forward thoughtful plans to reduce the risk that either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac would encounter such difficulties. Unfortunately, these warnings went unheeded, as the President’s repeated attempts to reform the supervision of these entities were thwarted by the legislative maneuvering of those who emphatically denied there were problems. To this day Barack Obama blames Bush for the 2008 economic meltdown. The truth is, it was Obama not Bush who destroyed the economy. **President Barack Obama was a pioneering contributor to the national subprime real estate bubble, and roughly half of the 186 African-American clients in his landmark 1995 mortgage discrimination lawsuit against Citibank have since gone bankrupt or received foreclosure notices… …Obama has pursued the same top-down mortgage lending policies in the White House. Obama’s lawsuit was one element of a national “anti-redlining” campaign led by Chicago’s progressive groups, who argued that banks unfairly refused to lend money to people living within so-called “redlines” around African-American communities. The campaign was powered by progressives’ moral claim that their expertise could boost home ownership among the United States’ most disadvantaged minority, African-Americans.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1365003741282</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 11:42:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365004230897-76</Id><Topic><Title>Good thing we didn’t let Detroit go bankrupt.</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1364999148860</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:25:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>let's see in Bush's speech and his legislation he pushed for 5.5 million new minority, no money down loans (2003) but you are saying Obama caused it with 186 loans, LOL tea billies have no grasp of the world in the tea billie rabbit hole Obama didn't stop 9-11 despite having a memo unread on his desk saying it was going to happen Obama misled Congress and invaded Iraq on false information of WMD's Obama chose to keep all war expenditures off the budget Obama violated the Geneva Convention and is a convicted war criminal Tea billies are morons</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365004230897</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 11:50:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365004351431-77</Id><Topic><Title>'RICH PEOPLE DENY CLMATE CHANGE'....?????...</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1365003699540</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 11:41:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I don't believe the CO2 theory, fossil fuel theory of 'global warming'....I just don't believe it.

The Billings judge previously announced he would take a reduced caseload and step down as the chief judge.

He still had to point out that America’s problems are the result of the nation’s “cult of multiculturalism.” Tancredo basically did everything he could to make his racist point short of handing out copies of “Mein Kampf” and carrying a sign reading, “If you ain’t white, you ain’t right.” I have never accused the Tea Party of being a racist movement. While I acknowledge that there are certainly those who identify with the group whose objection to Barack Obama is based on his race, it seems unfair to paint everyone in the movement – many of whom are upset with the state of the country and want to express their concerns – with so negative a brush. But if these people want to be taken seriously, why would they waste the national stage they have created with this convention to highlight a racist like Tom Tancredo? To be fair, there were those in attendance who get that. Mark Skoda, a founder of the Memphis Tea Party and a spokesman for the convention, was left shaking his head in amazement, saying “It doesn’t further the dialogue.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365009741006</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 13:22:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365009755010-118</Id><Topic><Title>New independent source of information, moved since yesterday.

As of July 18, an overwhelming 75% of respondents agree that racism is at play in the Tea Party's disapproval of the president. I think the public has seen too many racist posters at Tea Party rallies to write off the group members who carry them as fringe participants. If these so-called fringe members feel comfortable showing up to gatherings with such signs and aren't being reprimanded by others, it's easy to see why the public would get the idea that the Tea Party is a hotbed of racism. Last week, when the NAACP devised a resolution asking "all people of good will to repudiate the racism of the Tea Parties, and to stand in opposition to its drive to push our country back to the pre-civil rights era," it aimed to push conservative leaders to censure the racists in the Tea Party rather than continue blaming "fringe members" for the offensive acts exposed to the public.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365010923398</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 13:42:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365011000443-122</Id><Title>CAN THE U..S.'s APEinChief DRAW US INTO A WAR WITH PORKY PIG OF N, KOREA?</Title><Msg>he is sending ships there and now planes. posturing, bluffing with the lives of ALL U.S. citizens!

(AP) — A state official says a West Virginia county sheriff has been shot to death and a suspect is in custody. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's chief of staff, Rob Alsop, says state police told the governor that Mingo County Sheriff Eugene Crum died Wednesday. Mingo County Office of Emergency Services head dispatcher Willis Spence says the shooting was in Williamson within a block of the county courthouse. Alsop says the suspect also was shot and was taken to a hospital. The shooting comes on the heels of a Texas district attorney and his wife being shot to death in their home over the weekend, and officials suspect a white supremacist prison gang. Those killings happened a couple of months after one of the county's assistant district attorneys was killed near his courthouse office.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365013649384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 14:27:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365014413231-141</Id><Topic><Title>norway has zero national debt</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1365013956883</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 14:32:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It has universal healthcare and free college education.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365014413231</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 14:40:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365014455409-142</Id><Topic><Title>norway has zero national debt</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1365013956883</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 14:32:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You should be happy there then......

Nor is it limited to the intelligence operatives who sat silent as the administration cherry-picked its case for war, or with those, like Colin Powell or Hans Blix, who, in the name of loyalty or statesmanship, did not give full throat to their misgivings. It is also shared by far too many in the Fourth Estate, most notably the New York Times' Judith Miller.

The CIA created two monsters - Saddam and Bin Laden to fight Iran. They got out of control. Dems and Republicans supported both wars -- they were vital to our national security. Of course, wars become unpopular the longer they last and as more people die. Of course Dems used anti-war sentiment to get the White House. 2008 was a layup for Dems. Obama has kept the same wars going on the Bush withdrawal schedule. Media has stopped the daily body counts. We are going to have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan for a long time... just like we still have troops in Germany and South Korea.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1365027646126</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:20:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365029042816-209</Id><Topic><Title>QUESTION?</Title><Username>jen.co44</Username><Timestamp>1365024343558</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 17:25:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hillary won the primaries.

"Yes, I was bloody naive. In hindsight, I was stupid," Koch said as he was questioned by a defense lawyer, Arthur Shartsis. "Mr. Koch, you own a $4 billion company. How naive are you?" Shartsis asked. "When it comes to something that is a hobby, my biggest fault is I'm too trusting," Koch answered. Shartsis asked if Koch had spent more than $100 million over the past quarter-century building his collection of 43,300 wine bottles, along with famous art, antiques, guns, coins, furniture, rare photographs and gold nuggets. "I have spent a lot of money, but I don't want to know (how much), and I don't want my wife to know," said Koch, who has wine cellars in Massachusetts, Florida and Colorado. Shartsis told him that he had spent $6 million at six auctions in October and November 2005 alone. "I did?" Koch said. "I'm not surprised, but I didn't know that fact." He said he was fooled into buying phony wine by a "glowing catalog" each time and complained that a warning by auction houses that wine is being sold "as is" is nothing but "a clause they use to let them steal and cheat."
