Rather than come to grips with the fact that the GOP has become an absurd caricature, almost impossible to parody: a safe harbor for know-nothings, religious wackos, racists, fascists and other right-wing extremists of every stripe, and somehow grappling with it up front, maybe they'll keep "looking for Mr. Right-Wing" for at least another 4, maybe another 8 years...

He said, "God, if you are real, then I want you to knock me off this platform. I'll give you 15 minutes!" Ten minutes went by. The professor kept taunting God, saying, "Here I am, God. I'm still waiting." He got down to the last couple of minutes and a Marine just released from active duty, and newly registered in the class, walked up to the professor, hit him full force in the face, and sent him flying from his platform. The professor struggled up, obviously shaken and yelled, "What's the matter with you? Why did you do that?" The Marine replied, "God was busy, so He sent me." Navy SEALs are always taught 1) Keep your priorities in order and 2) Know when to act without hesitation. A Navy SEAL was attending some college courses between assignments. He had completed missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the courses had a professor who was an avowed atheist and a member of the ACLU. One day he shocked the class when he came in, looked to the ceiling, and flatly stated, "God, if you are real, then I want you to knock me off this platform. I'll give you exactly 15 minutes." The lecture room fell silent. You could hear a pin drop. Ten minutes went by and the professor proclaimed, "Here I am God. I'm still waiting." It got down to the last couple of minutes when the SEAL got out of his chair, went up to the professor, and cold-cocked him; knocking him off the platform. The professor was out cold. The SEAL went back to his seat and sat there, silently. The other students were shocked and stunned and sat there looking on in silence. The professor eventually came to, noticeably shaken, looked at the SEAL and asked, "What the hell is the matter with you? Why did you do that?" The SEAL calmly replied, "God was too busy today protecting America's soldiers who are protecting your right to say stupid #$%$ and act like an #$%$h..o..l..e. So He sent me."</Msg><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1347551637325</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 11:53:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347551875483-55</Id><Topic><Title>if the vp needs 10 yrs mitt needs to release 10 yrs</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347547221946</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 10:40:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>JuniordumdumMagoo, All you had to say was "I knew it was Frank Marshall Davis but I had a brain fart and typed Bill Ayers"and that would have ended it.

Or at least that is the assumption (Update: A false one, apparently this is a made up story). The validity of this story has not been varified by me (I may look into it later) but regardless it is a neat story, with or without the Einstein connection. Enjoy. :) PS: There are legions of arguments debating Einstein’s views on God. Some say he didn’t believe, other say he did believe. He made many references to God, but also made many challenges to the view of God. He was often a skeptic, but I believe quotes like the below prove that he did accept Jesus as His Lord and Savior before passing, realizing that Science could provide no answers for the reason of existance, and the reality of death. “Albert Einstein famously opined, “God is cunning but He is not malicious.” And: “God does not play dice.” When asked his motivation for doing physics, Einstein replied: “I want to know how God created the world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details.” In the final weeks of his life, when Einstein learned of the death of his old physicist friend Michele Besso, he wrote the Besso family: “He has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubborn illusion.” Source. Professor: You are a Christian, aren’t you, son ? Student: Yes, sir. Professor: So, you believe in GOD? Student: Absolutely, sir. Professor: Is GOD good? Student: Sure. Professor: Is GOD all powerful? Student: Yes. Professor: My brother died of cancer even though he prayed to GOD to heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill. But GOD didn’t. How is this GOD good then? Hmm? (Student was silent.) Professor: You can’t answer, can you? Let’s start again, young fella. Is GOD good? Student: Yes. Professor: Is Satan good? Student: No. Professor: Where does Satan come from? Student: From… GOD… Professor: That’s right. Tell me son, is there evil in this world? Student: Yes. Professor: Evil is everywhere, isn’t it? And GOD did make everything. Correct? Student: Yes. Professor: So who created evil? (Student did not answer.) Professor: Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don’t they? Student: Yes, sir. Professor: So, who created them? (Student had no answer.) Professor: Science says you have five Senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Tell me, son, have you ever seen GOD? Student: No, sir. Professor: Tell us if you have ever heard your GOD? Student: No , sir. Professor: Have you ever felt your GOD, tasted your GOD, smelt your GOD? Have you ever had any sensory perception of GOD for that matter? Student: No, sir. I’m afraid I haven’t. Professor: Yet you still believe in Him? Student: Yes. Professor: According to Empirical, Testable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says your GOD doesn’t exist. What do you say to that, son? Student: Nothing. I only have my faith. Professor: Yes, faith. And that is the problem Science has. Student: Professor, is there such a thing as heat? Professor: Yes. Student: And is there such a thing as cold? Professor: Yes. Student: No, sir. There isn’t. (The lecture theater became very quiet with this turn of events.) Student: Sir, you can have lots of heat, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat. But we don’t have anything called cold. We can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat, but we can’t go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it. (There was pin-drop silence in the lecture theater.) Student: What about darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness? Professor: Yes. What is night if there isn’t darkness? Student: You’re wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light. But if you have no light constantly, you have nothing and its called darkness, isn’t it? In reality, darkness isn’t. If it is, well you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn’t you? Professor: So what is the point you are making, young man? Student: Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed. Professor: Flawed? Can you explain how? Student: Sir, you are working on the premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good GOD and a bad GOD. You are viewing the concept of GOD as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, Science can’t even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but Science has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it. Now tell me, Professor, do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey? Professor: If you are referring to the natural Evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do. Student: Have you ever observed Evolution with your own eyes, sir? (The Professor shook his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the argument was going.) Student: Since no one has ever observed the process of Evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor. Are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a scientist but a preacher? (The class was in uproar.) Student: Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the Professor’s brain? (The class broke out into laughter. ) Student: Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor’s brain, felt it, touched or smelt it? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established Rules of Empirical, Stable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says that you have no brain, sir. With all due respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir? (The room was silent. The Professor stared at the student, his face unfathomable.) Professor: I guess you’ll have to take them on faith, son. Student: That is it sir… Exactly! The link between man &amp; GOD is FAITH. That is all that keeps things alive and moving.</Msg><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1347552726245</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 12:12:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347553280253-58</Id><Title>Understanding the Arabs</Title><Msg>I spent two years in Saudi years ago working for ARAMCO.

The new ad, released Wednesday and titled "Won't Say," opens with a zinger on Romney's refusal to release his personal tax returns or offer specifics on how his tax plan would impact the middle class. "Mitt Romney: He won't reveal what's in his taxes, and he won't tell you what he'd do to yours," a narrator says at the beginning of the ad, which will air in Iowa, Nevada, Virginia, and Ohio. The commercial then pivots to how Romney's proposed tax plan would pay for $5 trillion in planned tax cuts, which the Obama campaign says are skewed to millionaires and billionaires "like him." Citing an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the ad notes that, under Romney's tax plan, "taxpayers with children who make less than $200,000 would pay, on average, $2,000 more in taxes. You could lose the deduction for your home mortgage, college tuition, or health care." "How much would you pay?" the narrator asks as the ad comes to a close. "Romney just won't say." Accompanying the ad is a memo from Obama campaign Policy Director James Kvaal, which takes a closer look the plan put forward by Romney and Ryan. "Romney’s tax and budget plans are a riddle wrapped inside a mystery wrapped inside a total sham," Kvaal said in the memo. "Governor Romney and his advisers frankly admit that they won’t reveal their policy plans because it would make them less likely to be elected." Romney and Ryan have repeatedly stated that they would offset tax cuts for the wealthy by closing tax loopholes, but Kvaal notes their apparent inability to identify which particular loopholes they would close. Both men on the Republican presidential ticket were questioned on the issue of tax loopholes in interviews on Sunday, and both Romney and Ryan dodged the question. "We think the secret to economic growth is lower tax rates for families and successful small businesses by plugging loopholes," Ryan told George Stephanopoulos on ABC's "This Week." "Now the question is not necessarily what loopholes go, but who gets them. High income earners use most of the loopholes. That means they can shelter their income from taxation." When pressed by Stephanopoulos on why he would not be more forthcoming in naming which loopholes he would close, Ryan responded, "George, because we want to have this debate in the public. We want to have this debate with Congress. And we want to do this with the consent of the elected representatives of the people and figure out what loopholes should stay or go and who should or should not get them." Similarly, host David Gregory asked Romney on NBC's "Meet the Press" to provide an example of a loophole he would close -- a request Romney failed to oblige. "Well, I can tell you that people at the high end, high income taxpayers, are going to have fewer deductions and exemptions," he said. "Those numbers are going to come down. Otherwise they'd get a tax break. And I want to make sure people understand, despite what the Democrats said at their convention, I am not reducing taxes on high income taxpayers."</Msg><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1347553677628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 12:27:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347553784827-60</Id><Title>ROMNEY TO NATANYAHU: "OUR ARM FORCES ARE AT YOUR SERVICE.</Title><Msg>I am your puppet, Mr prime minister.

Ambassador to Egypt Anne Patterson “did not permit U.S. Marine guards to carry live ammunition,” according to multiple reports on U.S. Marine Corps blogs spotted by Nightwatch. “She neutralized any U.S. military capability that was dedicated to preserve her life and protect the US Embassy.” U.S. officials have yet to confirm or comment on the reports. Time magazine’s Battleland blog reported Thursday. “Senior U.S. officials late Wednesday declined to discuss in detail the security at either Cairo or Benghazi, so answers may be slow in coming.” If true, the reports indicate that Patterson shirked her obligation to protect U.S. interests, Nightwatch states.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1347582214904</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 20:23:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347582233417-144</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S GAYNESS HAS COME OUT AGAIN...AS REFLECTED IN</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1347580026015</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 19:47:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More facts starting to come out.Turns out Obama didn't know the seriousness of the embassy attack because his staff didn't want to wake him up.
