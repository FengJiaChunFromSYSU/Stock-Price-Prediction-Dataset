Yes, he did cast such a vote, but no, he’s not a hypocrite, not even a small one. The reason is simple. Democrats made no threats when they cast their votes. They knew they were going to lose and had no real intention of winning. It was March 16, 2006, when Obama cast the fateful vote. But the Democrats’ votes, Obama’s included, were purely symbolic. The Republicans controlled the Senate at the time, 55-45. The increase in the debt limit, the fourth in George W. Bush’s tenure, passed, 52-48, with three Republicans voting with all the Democrats. But the Democrats knew they were going to lose. They were in the minority; duh. They did not choose to filibuster, which they could have done and which would have meant the Republicans needed 60 votes. If they’d done so, that would have been hardball, and in that case, Obama would have been a participant in a real threat against American creditworthiness. Even then it wouldn’t have been the same as what the GOP is doing now, unless those 45 Democrats had demanded, oh, that Bush rescind his tax cuts or his Medicare Part D bill or some other signal legislative achievement. But the Democrats did no such thing. They cast symbolic votes to force Republicans to vote to increase the debt limit. So Obama’s 2006 vote means nothing and bears no resemblance to what’s going on today.</Msg><Username>junior_makes_hicks_crazy</Username><Timestamp>1381145705186</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 07:35:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381145809058-14</Id><Topic><Title>SNL DID A GREAT JOB LAST NIGHT "IT'S OUR PARTY AND WE'LL DO WHAT</Title><Username>donkeydouchebags</Username><Timestamp>1381089953237</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 16:05:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You poor idiot, you are like Bush, you don't know when people are laughing AT you instead of WITH you.

The Fox News poll, conducted October 1 and 2, found that 42 percent blame the Republicans and 32 percent the Democrats [for the shut down]. And these are low-information, brainwashed Faux Noise viewers saying this. Another poll by CBS found that 3 days into the government shutdown 44 percent of Americans felt that Republicans in Congress were at fault, with only 35 percent placing the blame on President Obama AND congressional Democrats. Notice the "bias" in that result; two Democratic causes summed up to only 35 percent. Another poll by Quinnipiac University showed that 72 percent of Americans disapprove of the Republicans and Tea Party shutting down the government. Tell us again, Fauxbots and right-wingers, how you're the majority?

You can sure disrupt the governance process as is evident with the shutdown right now but not for long.</Msg><Username>william_fagot</Username><Timestamp>1381156371625</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:32:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381157730023-37</Id><Topic><Title>Why does he talk to Russia and Iran</Title><Username>celltones</Username><Timestamp>1381152495645</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 09:28:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your own post tells it all.</Msg><Username>bvioml123</Username><Timestamp>1381157730023</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:55:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381157897111-38</Id><Topic><Title>Why does he talk to Russia and Iran</Title><Username>celltones</Username><Timestamp>1381152495645</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 09:28:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama doesn't negotiate with TERRORISTS- foreign or domestic (Tea Party)</Msg><Username>william_fagot</Username><Timestamp>1381157897111</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:58:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381158226536-39</Id><Title>“Speaker Boehner has a credibility problem,From refusing to let the House vote on a bill that was his idea in the first place, to decrying health-care subsidies for members of Congress</Title><Msg>"From refusing to let the House vote on a bill that was his idea in the first place, to decrying health-care subsidies for members of Congress and staff that he worked for months to preserve, to stating that the House doesn't have the votes to pass a clean CR at current spending levels, there is now a consistent pattern of Speaker Boehner saying things that fly in the face of the facts or stand at odds with his past actions.

You may have missed this interview, in which the speaker issued talking points from another dimension. Jamelle Bouie has the blow-by-blow. To watch John Boehner speak Sunday—in a segment with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos—was to watch him issue talking points from another dimension, where legislative hostage-taking is routine and the American public is eager to threaten the full faith and credit of the United States. The interview was rife with dishonesty, but there were five statements—in particular—that stood out for their recklessness and/or brazen disregard for the truth. John Boehner speaks during an interview with George Stephanopoulos on "This Week." (ABC) “[P]roviding—providing fairness to the American people, under Obamacare, is—all we’re asking for. My goodness. They give big businesses a waiver. They give all these unions a waiver. And yet they’re forcing the American people to buy a product, buy a product that they do not want and cannot afford.” It’s hard to know where to start with this. The idea that the administration granted a blanket waiver to “big businesses” is absurd. The reality is that businesses with more than 50 employees now have until 2015 to comply with the employer mandate for health insurance. This affects a relatively small number of businesses, and is separate from the other employer-centered regulations in the Affordable Care Act. Public opinion is ambivalent on the Speaker’s assertion that Obamacare is a product the “American people do not want”—disapproval is substantial, but few people want the law repealed—and most analyses contradict the claim that insurance under the Affordable Care Act is unaffordable; in many states, premiums are much cheaper than expected. As for the union waivers decried by Boehner? They don’t exist. Just last month, in fact, the administration rejected a bid to extend subsidies to union members who receive employer-provided health</Msg><Username>junior_makes_hicks_crazy</Username><Timestamp>1381171537563</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 14:45:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381171630352-108</Id><Topic><Title>LOL Gov shut down</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381168209916</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 13:50:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look at Junior try to rattle Red's cage.LOL.

"I was trying to get his attention to make sure he sees me before I pulled in front of him," Cruz said. "He never looked back at me." The video then shows Cruz crossing into the middle lane, looking back over both shoulders and then slowing down, resulting in the collision with Lien's SUV. "[It was] never my intention to make him stop," Cruz said. "I didn't think I was doing anything wrong with just turning into another lane. The other bikes are going as slow as I am." "I was looking over my shoulder to see where my friends were," he said. "I wanted them to pull in front so I could follow them. I didn't brake but when I looked over my shoulder, my hand came off the throttle a little, but the driver didn't slow down at all and bumped me." Cruz told ABC News' Harris that both he and Lien stopped and he approached Lien for an explanation. "He looked straight ahead and never made eye contact with me," Cruz said. "So I just went back to my bike and when I was getting on he took off." Lien's wife, Rosalyn Ng, said that her husband feared for their lives when he decided to take off to get away from the group. As he sped off, Lien hit some of the motorcyclists, critically injuring one, authorities said.</Msg><Username>william_fagot</Username><Timestamp>1381172611733</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 15:03:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381172839290-112</Id><Topic><Title>BABY BOOMERS, SAD WITNESS TO THE IMPLOSION OF......</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1381161986455</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 12:06:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a possible scenario.

Devin Nunes, a conservative Republican from California's Central Valley, on Monday accused freshman GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of misleading House Republicans that they could dismantle the Democratic health care-reform law known as Obamacare by forcing a government shutdown. Nunes, said the strategy pursued by Cruz, a Texas freshman, and to a lesser extent Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is "based on a false premise" because Republicans can't get two-thirds votes in the House and the Senate to override President Barack Obama's veto when he rejects any bill that ends his signature law. Obama and the Democratic-majority Senate have refused to entertain any legislation passed by the GOP-majority House that would overhaul, change, delay or end the health care law. The partial shutdown is nearly a week old with no deal to end it in sight. Nunes said Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has run into a wall of opposition from Cruz's House allies to any deal to reopen the government. "It's really difficult at this time until the Cruz people decide and admit to our base that their whole premise of getting rid of Obamacare by shutting down our government was a lie," Nunes said. "This is his strategy that he's laid out, spent money on and he's got a lot of members of the Congress to go along with." Cruz's office didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381174791994</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 15:39:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381174846416-130</Id><Title>Where's all the birthers hiding out?</Title><Msg>Haven't heard much from them since Cruz rolled out of the closet.</Msg><Username>moe_larry_cheezeeie</Username><Timestamp>1381174846416</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 15:40:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381174934606-131</Id><Topic><Title>WHY IS IT SO COLD?</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1381174460271</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 15:34:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>don't worry walter the nursing home will continue to heat your rubber covered nursing bed</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381174934606</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 15:42:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381175062551-132</Id><Topic><Title>WHY IS IT SO COLD?</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1381174460271</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 15:34:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumb wont explain the extra million square miles of ice in the Arctic ocean this year.

Yes, they will punish Democrats...not by voting them out...that will happen in 2014...but they will punish them by marching them naked into crowds of angry college students, armed with barbed wire who will lash Democrats.

They’ll continue to block traffic, they say, until they see the arrest of elected officials who have “violated their oath of office.” Organizers of the event, which is titled “Truckers Ride for the Constitution,” say they are fed up with a variety of headaches caused by the government: Fuel efficiency standards enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency, Obamacare, state and local laws over idling their trucks, and “insurance companies purportedly requiring technological updates,” according to US News and World Report. They say that to demonstrate against violations of the constitution, they plan to circle interstate 495 — known widely as the beltway — and not allow through any traffic. If police try to stop them, they’ll park their trucks right on the highway. Originally, reports from US News and World Report indicated the truckers were looking to impeach President Obama. But Earl Conlon, an organizer of the event, told US News, “We’re not asking for impeachment, we’re asking for the arrest of everyone in government who has violated their oath of office.” These include House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), both for purportedly arming al Qaeda linked Syrian rebels. But while it might seem very US-specific, even some Canadian truckers might join in.</Msg><Username>junior_makes_hicks_crazy</Username><Timestamp>1381182870322</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 17:54:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381182896680-156</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare insurance markets open to surge of new customers ...</Title><Username>junior_makes_hicks_crazy</Username><Timestamp>1381181622952</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 17:33:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>does it make it untrue?

That's unsettling. He seems less sure about what he can do. That's even more unsettling. If you want proof, go and read Friday’s New York Times story by Jonathan Weisman. As it explains, Boehner has on at least two recent occasions promised to pass spending bills, only to fail because the conservative wing of his party wouldn’t support him. That’s why the government is shut down right now. And if Boehner can’t get the Republican caucus behind him on a bill financing basic government operations, who’s to say he can get the Republican caucus to vote for a bill raising the debt limit?

Getting rid of 4100 contracts in one day is no easy task, particularly when Bonehead just kept making me money and I kept getting greedy and holding to the last minute. But I beat the #$%$ out of your chimp companion joe_b and that help me pass the time. Maybe the two of you can get together and we can make it a fair fight, YES ??? So night night my troglodyte friend. PS I was kind of active during the past week because I was busy with the trade and what better way while steering at the PC than to beat up on repukes, don't you think ?
