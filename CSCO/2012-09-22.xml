The earned media includes lobbying and trying to skew the public polls. Historically the most egregious case was the 2000 Gore campaign’s lobbying the networks’ exit pollsters for an early, and wrong, call in Florida. This suppressed the Florida Panhandle and Western state turnout.” (Polls close at different times in different parts of the state, because the state stretches into two time zones.) “In our post-election Florida poll, we found that thousands of Panhandle Floridians heard the call and although their polls were still open for an hour in a close national race decided not to vote. Panhandle voters went two-to-one for Bush. The CBS early wrong call nearly triggered a national crisis.” On what a realistic partisan breakdown would look like: “The 2004 national exit polls showed an even partisan turnout and Bush won 51–48. Had it been the +4 Democratic edge of 2000, John Kerry would have been president. 2008 was a Democratic wave that gave them a +7 partisan advantage. 2010 was a Republican edge. There’s no wave right now. There are about a dozen swing states where in total millions of voters who voted in 2008 for Obama are gone or have not voted since. There are also hundreds of thousands of voters in each of several swing states like Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Colorado, and others who voted from rural, exurban or suburban areas in 2004 for Bush who did not vote in 2008, because they were not excited by McCain or thought he would lose. They are currently planning to vote mainly as a vote against President Obama.” What Obama and his allies are doing now: “The Democrats want to convince [these anti-Obama voters] falsely that Romney will lose to discourage them from voting. So they lobby the pollsters to weight their surveys to emulate the 2008 Democrat-heavy models. They are lobbying them now to affect early voting. IVR [Interactive Voice Response] polls are heavily weighted. You can weight to whatever result you want. Some polls have included sizable segments of voters who say they are ‘not enthusiastic’ to vote or non-voters to dilute Republicans. Major pollsters have samples with Republican affiliation in the 20 to 30 percent range, at such low levels not seen since the 1960s in states like Virginia, Florida, North Carolina and which then place Obama ahead. The intended effect is to suppress Republican turnout through media polling bias. We’ll see a lot more of this. Then there’s the debate between calling off a random-digit dial of phone exchanges vs. a known sample of actual registered voters. Most polls favoring Obama are random and not off the actual voter list. That’s too expensive” for some pollsters.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348288785589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 00:39:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348305913286-2</Id><Topic><Title>And now for a Spelling Lesson...</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1348276186600</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 21:09:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The first two letters in Liberal.......

Over the past few days, some so-called Republicans have taken it upon themselves to lob some pretty harsh words in the direction of my husband. Now, it’s one thing when Mitt gets criticized by the forty-seven per cent of Americans who are parasites sucking at capitalism’s teat. But when former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan calls his campaign “a rolling calamity,” it’s time for Ann Romney to kick some #$%$. Which brings me to you. This is not a fundraising appeal. Lord knows this campaign has all the money it needs, especially since Mitt went to Vegas and promised Sheldon Adelson he’d bomb Tehran on Day One. As Mitt’s wife, I’m asking you to pledge something far more valuable: Your silence. By signing the pledge form below, you become an official member of Ann Romney’s Circle of Silence, an élite tier of the Romney for President Campaign. As a member of the C.O.S., you will receive priority ticketing to the Inauguration, as well as a collectible “Loose Lips Sink Mitt” ball gag. All you have to do is shut the freak up until Election Day. That’s right, for the next forty-six days, I’m asking you to bite your tongue every time Mitt says or does something idiotic. If you think that sounds difficult, welcome to my world. And Peggy Noonan, if you’re reading this: you want a piece of Ann Romney? Then get in the ring, girlfriend, and I’ll mess you up good.

ROMNEY MAKES UP HIS ENTIRE 2011 TAX RETURN TO 'HIT THE NUMBERS'</Title><Msg>LMAO ! I have to say, this guy has balls of steel. He spits on the entire country and tells them it is raining. Romneys paid $1,935,708 in federal income taxes last year on $13,696,951 in income, almost all of it from his investments. That comes out to a 14.1% tax rate, far below the top rate of 35% for earned income. But here's the thing: Had Romney taken full advantage of all the deductions available to him, the rate would have been much lower, perhaps as low as 9%. He donated $4,020,772 to charity (good for him!), but only claimed a deduction on $2.25 million of that. Why? His campaign told BuzzFeed: He has been clear that no American need pay more than he or she owes under the law. At the same time, he was in the unique position of having made a commitment to the public that his tax rate would be above 13%. In order to be consistent with that statement, the Romneys limited their deduction of charitable contributions. In other words, Romney picked a tax rate and told his accountant to hit it. "Just get me somewhere north of 13% so people don't get mad at me." It's just an accounting gimmick; numerical smoke and mirrors. The tax return version of "I'm running for office, for Pete's sake—I can't have illegals!" Romney's reasoning is that he has previously said he never paid less than 13% in taxes. BUT HE WAS WRONG! Because in 2012, his burden under our galactically unjust tax system was less than 13%. So in order to retroactively render his remarks accurate, he simply rejiggered some numbers, neglected to take some deductions, and paid 14.1%. See—all fixed!</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1348332577154</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 12:49:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348333500959-17</Id><Topic><Title>Check out Cisco Systems Inc</Title><Username>kaneshactx84294</Username><Timestamp>1348318558445</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 08:55:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm looking for great articles.

(2) Did you vote in the 2010 off-year election? (3) On a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high), estimate how interested you are in the 2012 presidential election. If the answers to both (1) and (2) are "yes" and the answer to (3) is at least six, they keep that person in their sample as a "likely voter." Otherwise, they discard/ignore the response. Note that, while the left may very well have been overrepresented (compared with more typical presidential election years), the RIGHT voted in disproportionately high numbers (even compared to their typically high turnout). So these two filters should to some extent balance each other out. Note also that many of the atypical voters, who were energized to turn out to vote for Obama in 2008, but then did not vote in 2010, would not make the cut.</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1348342668320</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 15:37:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348342767208-34</Id><Topic><Title>Ignore the polls saying Obama is going to win</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348279149749</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 21:59:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>*... the RIGHT voted in disproportionately high numbers (even compared to their typically high turnout) IN THE 2010 ELECTION. ...*</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1348342767208</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 15:39:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348343877356-35</Id><Topic><Title>Check out Cisco Systems Inc</Title><Username>kaneshactx84294</Username><Timestamp>1348318558445</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 08:55:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing this article.</Msg><Username>mignonfrw634</Username><Timestamp>1348343877356</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 15:57:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348344381741-36</Id><Title>Phone calls from Hell</Title><Msg>George Bush, Queen Elizabeth, and Vladimir Putin all die and go to hell.

And during a fund-raiser here at the Red Rock casino and hotel on Friday, Mr. Romney singled out Sheldon Adelson, the polarizing casino magnate and outspoken Zionist who has pledged at least $40 million to groups trying to defeat Mr. Obama. “I don’t know how it is that Sheldon Adelson got the front row,” Mr. Romney said teasingly. Mr. Romney’s bluntness has even extended to the role of his wife, Ann, in the race.

The model, based on state-level economic data, predicts that President Barack Obama will lose nearly all key states that many observers view as toss-ups: North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio, Florida, Colorado, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. He’d also drop Pennsylvania and Minnesota, where polls indicate Obama is ahead, the study finds. The analysis, authored by Colorado political science professors Kenneth Bickers and Michael Berry, looks at unemployment rates and per capita income from the past 22 years and builds a model that would have accurately predicted each election. It also looks at other indicators, like which party currently holds the White House. “The apparent advantage of being a Democratic candidate and holding the White House disappears when the national unemployment rate hits 5.6 percent,” Berry said in a University of Colorado press release. The unemployment rate is currently 8.3 percent nationally.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1348359540227</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 20:19:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348359873963-56</Id><Topic><Title>the rich C-riminal with Swiss Bank Accounts and businesses in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands paid just 14% in taxes.

Those lucky duckies, they don't pay income taxes!!!! they are leeches!!! For the fact is that the modern Republican Party just doesn't have much respect for people who work for other people, no matter how faithfully and well they do their jobs. All the party's affection is reserved for "job creators," aka employers and investors. Leading figures in the party find it hard even to pretend to have any regard for ordinary working families - who, it goes without saying, make up the vast majority of Americans. Am I exaggerating? Consider the Twitter message sent out by Eric Cantor, the Republican House majority leader, on Labor Day - a holiday that specifically celebrates America's workers. Here's what it said, in its entirety: "Today, we celebrate those who have taken a risk, worked hard, built a business and earned their own success." Yes, on a day set aside to honor workers, all Cantor could bring himself to do was praise their bosses. Lest you think that this was just a personal slip, consider Romney's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. What did he have to say about American workers? Actually, nothing: the words "worker" or "workers" never passed his lips. This was in strong contrast to President Barack Obama's convention speech a week later, which put a lot of emphasis on workers - especially, of course, but not only, workers who benefited from the auto bailout. Needless to say, the GOP's disdain for workers goes deeper than rhetoric. It's deeply embedded in the party's policy priorities. Romney's remarks spoke to a widespread belief on the right that taxes on working Americans are, if anything, too low. Indeed, The Wall Street Journal famously described low-income workers whose wages fall below the income-tax threshold as "lucky duckies."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348360607233</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 20:36:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348362180800-58</Id><Topic><Title>those lucky duckies!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348360607233</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 20:36:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree, so what if someone making less then 30k a year pays 20% a year in taxes and romney pays 13% if they don't call those taxes income taxes then they don't count right? The really rich own congress and the middle class should send more money up to the castle right? hey so what if they pay 7.5% in payroll tax, 3.5% in medicare tax, 8% in state taxes, 3% in city taxes, another 6% in sales taxes, then they pay gas taxes, auto taxes, meal taxes, MVD taxes, heating oil taxes, telephone taxes, etc, etc!!! they are the lucky ducky leeches that pay more in taxes then Mitt does!!! Those lucky duckies, they don't pay income taxes!!!! they are leeches!!!</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348362180800</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 21:03:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348363294220-59</Id><Topic><Title>Cisco to be OUT of the DOW soon</Title><Username>scott4usa</Username><Timestamp>1348356925879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 19:35:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Dow is phony they kick out companies that have stock that doesn't go up because the Dow likes the Average to keep up with inflation. Cisco is a dog, it has averaged $22 per share since 2000. If Cisco gets kicked out of the Dow then Chambers should get kicked out for losing us money and shaming the company.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348363294220</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 21:21:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348366866367-60</Id><Topic><Title>Cisco to be OUT of the DOW soon</Title><Username>scott4usa</Username><Timestamp>1348356925879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 19:35:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Makes sense to invite CSCO out of Dow. When it was put in, it was a 800 pound tech gorilla, and over the last 10 years, under inept leadership of Chambers, it has become an ill defined commodity type company. Increasing dividend won't do the trick. Tech companies overall seem to have a short life under the sun life cycle, ex: Nokia, RIM, am not sure where Apple will be in two years! Full disclosure, I got out of it after riding from 17.85 to 19.25. Won't touch it until Chambers goes.</Msg><Username>gjjagan</Username><Timestamp>1348366866367</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 22:21:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348372685378-61</Id><Title>GODLY PUKES, PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME...</Title><Msg>Secret revealed: Ohio woman unknowingly married father Tell me in which ways The Lord was working here ?
