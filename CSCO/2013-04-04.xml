Read full story at Washinton Post Website. Banks should give Obama the bird. If someone cant make their payments then the bank should not be forced by Obama to give loans to people with bad credit or who obviously can't pay the loans.</Msg><Username>who_eats_collard_greens</Username><Timestamp>1365052693919</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 01:18:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365053833398-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama wants to lower standards for home loans</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1365031201439</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 19:20:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Banks got too tight.

Even though we in America are on a fast track toward Communism, we can take some joy in the death of Obama's friend Hugo. It gave me great pleasure to hear of the demise of another Communist, gangster thug. I can only hope that Fidel Castro is not far behind. Our own Communist gangster is much younger and healthier, unfortunately, and will not die in office as his two heroes did and will. I'm surprised that the bamster wasn't tapped to give the eulogy for Chavez since those two were such good friends. They did share one binding thing in common....the destruction of America as founded.</Msg><Username>cages_are_the_enemy</Username><Timestamp>1365075118945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 07:31:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365075438933-5</Id><Topic><Title>What Ended The Great Depression?,.

But I wonder what it going to happen to their brand over the course of this year. Considering that the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce have agreed on an immigration reform deal, what will happen if Marco Rubio simply walks away from a deal? Or, what if the Senate passes a bill and the House can't follow suit? Or, what if Boehner feels compelled to pass a bill that the majority of his caucus opposes? What if the Senate agrees on a universal background check on guns and the House won't go along with it? Or, what if the Senate Republicans won't give the president the vote he insisted on in the State of the Union? What if the House Republicans refuse to allow a vote? What if Boehner feels compelled to pass a bill that the majority of his caucus opposes? We can ask these same questions about fixing the sequester. If the Republicans continue to refuse to offer any revenues through tax reform and insist on cutting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security (a position opposed by 77% of the people and supported by only 17%) how much blame will they get for that? These are not even the most dangerous issues for the Republicans. Fooling around with the debt ceiling again or causing a government shutdown are both still real possibilities this year. We keep seeing analysis written through the prism of the red/blue divide, where Republicans have more to fear from primary challengers than from Democrats. But their positions on guns and immigration and the budget are not polling well at all. Obviously, their position on gay rights is also polling poorly. In fact, their positions are weak enough with independents and moderates that Republican lawmakers should not assume that they will get the same percentage of those votes in 2014 that they got in 2012. They are in trouble on individual issues, taking positions in some cases that are supported by less t</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1365088214498</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 11:10:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365088479057-34</Id><Topic><Title>Obama = Worst President in US History.</Title><Username>fifendrume</Username><Timestamp>1365084465925</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 10:07:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Things keep getting progressively worse.

U.S. Federal sales were also down significantly from the second quarter a year ago. Although we believe we picked up significant market share we were unable to overcome the significant slowdown.

But the GOP may have a tough time bringing the Tea Party along for the ride. New data from a joint survey by Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution shows that Americans who identify with the Tea Party are far more likely than other Republicans to oppose comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship – and that’s not likely to change any time soon. The question is how the Republican Party will manage its current coalition – especially keeping the Tea Party faction happy – with rising pressure to support policies that would bring more diversity to the party.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365118229821</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 19:30:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365118237699-94</Id><Topic><Title>Why is CSCO down 2% in AH?</Title><Username>lincolns_knight</Username><Timestamp>1365107323339</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 16:28:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All these hedgies missed the last run and are pulling out all stops to buy lower.

Now they will buy csco, and if it drops, buy more. Followed by an upgrade and a raised price target. I still feel fair value for csco is 27-28 and not sure why it hasn't started a steady rise.

Bush has cancelled a visit to Switzerland, where he was to address a Jewish charity gala, due to the risk of legal action against him for alleged torture, rights groups said on Saturday. Bush was to be the keynote speaker at Keren Hayesod's annual dinner on Feb. 12 in Geneva. But pressure has been building on the Swiss government to arrest him and open a criminal investigation if he enters the Alpine country. Criminal complaints against Bush alleging torture have been lodged in Geneva, court officials say. The action in Switzerland showed Bush had reason to fear legal complaints against him if he travelled to countries that have ratified an international treaty banning torture, he said. "President Bush has admitted he ordered waterboarding which everyone considers to be a form of torture under international law. Under the Convention against Torture, authorities would have been obliged to open an investigation and either prosecute or extradite George Bush," Brody said.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365123671568</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 21:01:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365124140021-114</Id><Topic><Title>Commie/Maoist Yahoo Deleting Messages...</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1365122021620</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 20:33:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No conviction cited in your cut &amp; paste...only complaints.

The change means Nelson, 70, no longer is among the handful of Senate Democrats in opposition, while putting him in the new majority of U.S. senators who back equal rights for gays and lesbians. "Simply put, if The Lord made homosexuals as well as heterosexuals, why should I discriminate against their civil marriage? I shouldn't, and I won't," wrote Nelson.
