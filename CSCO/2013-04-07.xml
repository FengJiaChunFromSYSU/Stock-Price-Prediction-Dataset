The really sad part of this poor economy is that the unemployment rate has always been at least twice as high as the Government has posted because self-employed is never counted. Then take into consideration that billions of $ are being printed every month driving down the value of the $, no wonder gas is as high as it is and food and everything we buy! Wake up America. Every society on Earth that has risen to dominate has failed, and usually for the same reasons. All one need do it take a look at the seat of power in the USA, Washington, DC.

This means that over 5 people are dropping out of the workforce for every person that finds a new job. This is hardly a healthy development and one unfortunately that has been present since the start of the recovery. Labor force participation has been dropping for several years. Almost the entire improvement in the unemployment rate over the past four years is due to this drop as we have averaged just over 110,000 jobs/month since the beginning of the recovery which is barely enough to keep up with population growth.
