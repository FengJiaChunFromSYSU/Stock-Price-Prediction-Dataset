He ran for President of the United States during the 2008 election, and was the Constitution Party's unsuccessful nominee for Governor of Colorado in 2010. Tancredo was initially elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1976 and served two terms. After working in the United States Department of Education during the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush Administrations, he was elected to the United States Congress, and served five terms. He decided to not seek re-election in 2008.[1] Tancredo ran for the Republican Party nomination for President in 2008, centering his campaign on the issues of illegal immigration and terrorism. He dropped out of the race in December 2007 to assist former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in his campaign for the nomination. Tancredo announced on July 26, 2010 that he planned to change parties and run for Governor of Colorado on the American Constitution Party ticket. He received 617,030 votes (36.7%), coming in second place, well ahead of the Republican Party nominee, who got about 11% of the vote. Tancredo has declared he will run for governor in 2014, this time as a Republican, because of his opposition to current Colorado governor John Hickenlooper's refusal to execute convicted murder Nathan Dunlap as well as Hickenlooper's attempts to pass firearm legislation.[2]</Msg><Username>rebelwithchemicals</Username><Timestamp>1380618964807</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 05:16:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380620052338-7</Id><Title>All this TROUBLE and EXPENSE could of been avoided since 911 just by</Title><Msg>Applying RULE OF LAW, NO or little NSA, NO TSA if Border was locked down with troops and ICE ET AL would go after expired visa's and running lose illegals to MASS DEPORT them !!!</Msg><Username>rebelwithchemicals</Username><Timestamp>1380620052338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 05:34:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380620170393-8</Id><Topic><Title>All this TROUBLE and EXPENSE could of been avoided since 911 just by</Title><Username>rebelwithchemicals</Username><Timestamp>1380620052338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 05:34:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HECK maybe even oBOMBa care would be affordable without having to $upport MEXICAN citizens !</Msg><Username>rebelwithchemicals</Username><Timestamp>1380620170393</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 05:36:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380622249921-9</Id><Title>Futures are up because a government shutdown is good for the economy</Title><Msg>hurry, jump in, you will miss the boat he,he,he the Wall Street Criminals will hit you over the head with a 2x4 when you least expected.</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1380622249921</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 06:10:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380622424458-10</Id><Title>FINALLY!

But Boehner apparently did not want to risk a revolt by the extremists who are ideologically aligned with Sen. Ted Cruz, the ones who King says live in “echo chambers” where they hear only their own voices. Boehner would rather risk this challenge by King, who was not an imminent threat to the speaker’s rule and had been consistently loyal in all the big recent votes.</Msg><Username>the_original_juniorsclassmate</Username><Timestamp>1380630445421</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 08:27:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380630512075-26</Id><Title>Money making time</Title><Msg>As I told the board last Thurs.buy stocks on Fri.and Mon.

The Republicans in congress are by any means a miserable failure. Do NOT tell me that the democrats didn't want to negotiate. Did you see the Democrats saying they would shutdown congress unless the Republicans enacted gun control or immigration? NO, that is because the budget should have no strings attached. The Democrats DO NOT blackmail, the teabaggers DO. Watch Fox News, all the conservative commentators agree that Republican Congressmen should have passed a clean bill. The last time government was shut down, the Republicans did it in 1995 and 1996.

Undaunted, Mr. Dorrinson said he had begun looking into additional countries, like Chad and North Korea, but he expressed astonishment at a world seemingly overrun by health care. “It turns out that the United States is one of the last countries on earth to get it,” he said. “It makes me proud to be an American.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1380635139637</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 09:45:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380635279347-47</Id><Topic><Title>KommunityOrganizerCare Goes Into Effect...</Title><Username>proconsul_gallio</Username><Timestamp>1380635065666</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 09:44:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yet it was bush who crashed the economy, not barry oopsie</Msg><Username>the_original_juniorsclassmate</Username><Timestamp>1380635279347</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 09:47:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380635317945-48</Id><Topic><Title>Typing standing up today</Title><Username>the_oriqinal_juniorsclassmate</Username><Timestamp>1380634891251</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 09:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hi ORIQUINAL!! have some ted cruz action last night?</Msg><Username>the_original_juniorsclassmate</Username><Timestamp>1380635317945</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 09:48:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380635342756-49</Id><Topic><Title>lol</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1380635139637</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 09:45:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumb,sweety,you were really passionate last night!!!

Don't get me wrong. Shutting down all but the most essential activities of the Federal government for even a few days or weeks is a very bad thing. Government workers will lose income, veterans won't get health care services, travelers won't get passports, lots of other people won't get important government services, and a few tenths of a point will probably be shaved off the economic growth rate. Real people will suffer real harm. But a brief shutdown of the government is nowhere near as catastrophic as failing to increase the federal debt ceiling and, for the first time in history, allowing the American government to default on its obligations. This would cause a global economic meltdown and likely start a new economic recession. And it may be that the only way to prevent a debt ceiling default is to for the House Republicans to shut the government down and face the consequences. The stock market will tank with the Dow likely sinking hundreds of points a day. Public opinion will turn sharply against the Republicans. Pressure on the Republican establishment by financial elites will intensify. And in a short time -- I don't know whether it will be a few days or a few weeks -- the Republicans will be forced to back down; or at least Speaker Boehner will allow a clean government funding bill to come to the House floor and pass with a majority</Msg><Username>mrs_deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1380647037277</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 13:03:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380647142626-138</Id><Topic><Title>HEY - art/global/ and however many other ids you have - CLDX !!</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1380300243319</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-09-27 12:44:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>10 more days like today, and you will make the 27% gain I had in CLAD yesterday.

Let's see "Everyone has a job here" Texas unemployment 6.4% LOL No food stamps--LOL most in any state More than 4 million Texans - the greatest number of any state in the country - spent $6 billion last year through the federal food stamp program. Everyone in Texas is a millionaire LOL What else is distinctive or notable about poverty in Texas? One way to answer this question is to ask how Texas ranks with the other fifty states on a variety of indicators. For example, in 2007 Texas ranked second among all the states in the percent of its populace that was poor (that is, only four states had higher rates). The poverty rate for Texas in that year was 16.5%. The only other state that had higher poverty rates was Mississippi (20.1%). It should be pointed out that the four other states in the top five all have much smaller populations than Texas, and all are predominantly rural, as this table illustrates. This fact alone makes Texas distinct; it clearly has the highest poverty rate of any large industrial state. But Texas also has far greater numbers of poor people than these four other states. Its poor population in absolute numbers (3.934 million people) is larger by far than the combined poor populations of the other four states (3.9 million for Texas compared to 2.13 million for the other four together (US Census Bureau "Income, Earning, and Poverty Data from the 2007 American Community Survey", p. 15).

This has been a favorite attack line by critics who suggest that a panel of bureaucrats are making life and death decisions. But the health care law rations care no more nor less than the current health care system does. For evidence, critics have pointed to the Independent Payment Advisory Board, something the law introduced as a means of controlling costs for the Medicare system. But the board’s parameters are very narrow. It only applies to Medicare. It kicks in only when spending outpaces certain benchmarks. And it can only make system-wide recommendations to rein in future spending. Congress can overrule the board, and the law specifically states that the board may not "ration care" or increase costs for Medicare beneficiaries.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1380663034742</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 17:30:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380663072012-237</Id><Topic><Title>the five biggest tea billie lies about the ACA</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1380662989133</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 17:29:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Death panels. This falsehood, our 2009 Lie of the Year, started after an early draft of the bill sought to allow Medicare to pay for doctors’ visits in which patients discussed end-of-life care, such as living wills. The critics labeled it suicide counseling. Conservative superstar Sarah Palin amped up the debate in August 2009 by declaring on her Facebook page, "The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care." But there was never any panel like that in the bill. Recently, Palin has defended her comments, pointing to the Independent Payment Advisory Board as a death panel. Either way, the claim is ridiculously false and earned a Pants on Fire.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1380663072012</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 17:31:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380663367990-238</Id><Title>House tea bllies</Title><Msg>demanding a line item veto now, LOL Like a poker player in a game of seven card stud raising and back raising with a queen high hand.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1380663367990</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 17:36:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380665131161-239</Id><Title>HOW MUCH MONEY DID THE FEDS SAVE TODAY????</Title><Msg>50 BILLION A DAY...

Most famous of all was the big brouhaha about “death panels,” those fictitious boards of bureaucrats who tea party types claimed would be empowered by Obamacare to kill off grandpas and grannies. But there were many other untruths and, from a long list assembled by Politifact, here are just a few: • The Affordable Health Care Act is a scheme to ration care, just like the systems in Canada and the United Kingdom. The truth, of course, is that Obamacare leaves American healthcare in the hands of the insurance industry. That is why many people on the left do not like it. They would much prefer a single-payer plan like Canadians have. • Muslims are exempt from the healthcare law. This whopper made the rounds in right-wing blogs and talk shows. Of course, it’s utterly absurd. • All non-U.S. citizens, including illegals, will get free healthcare. Another bit of pure mendacity from the tea party blogosphere. • Under Obamacare, "75% of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours.” Florida’s GOP Sen. Marco Rubio said that and many have repeated it, but it ain’t so. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey indicates less than 10% of small businesses will cut hours or get rid of workers because of Obamacare. • Obamacare will place a sales tax on real estate transactions, send out government agents for forced home inspections and produce the largest tax increase in the history of the world. These claims from right-wing emails and talk radio fantasists are completely false. Does it matter that almost all the right-wing opposition to Obamacare is based on lies and exaggerations? Politically, it doesn’t matter at all. If the base of the Republican Party gets behind a string of crazy ideas, do not count on the politicians who seek their votes to correct them. On the contrary, they will make those delusions their own and fight for them, no matter the cost to the country.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1380670677176</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 19:37:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380671531911-244</Id><Title>It's kind of funny</Title><Msg>Politicians have always been known to stretch the truth but until the tea billies got elected everyone assumed politicians wouldn't outright lie about anything an average voter would know was a complete lie.

He shops for grocery bargains, cooks budget-stretching stews and limits himself to one meal a day. "I cannot fathom how Rep. Fincher can get away with saying, 'The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat' when many of the recipients of food stamps are working longer hours than the Representative." Tarnisha Adams, who left her job skinning hogs at a slaughterhouse when she became ill with cancer, gets $352 a month in food stamps for herself and three college-age sons. She buys discount meat and canned vegetables, cheaper than fresh. Like Mr. Rigsby, she eats once a day — “if I eat,” she said. No matter what Congress decides, benefits will be reduced in November, when a provision in the 2009 stimulus bill expires.Yet as lawmakers cast the fight in terms of spending, nonpartisan budget analysts and hunger relief advocates warn of a spike in “food insecurity” among Americans who, as Mr. Rigsby said recently, “look like we are fine,” but live on the edge of poverty, skipping meals and rationing food. Surrounded by corn and soybean farms — including one owned by the local Republican congressman, Representative Stephen Fincher — Dyersburg, about 75 miles north of Memphis, provides an eye-opening view into Washington’s food stamp debate. Mr. Fincher, who was elected in 2010 on a Tea Party wave and collected nearly $3.5 million in farm subsidies from the government from 1999 to 2012, recently voted for a farm bill that omitted food stamp</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1380672981730</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 20:16:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380673362989-253</Id><Topic><Title>G0P Cl0wn H0use Districts Are Backw00ds Living Like 150 Years Ago</Title><Username>gop_clown_circus</Username><Timestamp>1380672541008</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 20:09:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gave yourself away again,chump.The squirrel meat slur is one of Junior's favorites.You really do need to broaden your vocabulary.LOL A few more brain cells would help too .LOL</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1380673362989</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 20:22:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380673704868-254</Id><Topic><Title>We are being lied to</Title><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1380671715693</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 19:55:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what you posted wonka "Libs have been cherry picking states that will have lower premiums citing CA and NY in particular.

It has artificially inflated premiums because it was company with deep pockets and not people that were paying for it.

U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, rejected Holder’s attempt to have the case thrown out of court. Obama had claimed executive privilege on the documents and House republicans filed a lawsuit. After five months of deliberation, the judge has decided to let the case go forward. The judge’s determination was: “This case presents the sort of question that the courts are traditionally called upon to resolve. Dismissing the case without hearing it would in effect place the court’s finger on the scale, designating the executive as the victor based solely on his untested assertion that the privilege applies,” The DOJ and the White House has two choices. They can appeal the case to the federal court of appeals or they can not appeal and the case will be tried with the same judge presiding. The DOJ gave no indication which way they will go. The Fast and Furious investigation covers as many as 2,000 guns sold to straw buyers and taken into Mexico. So far, they have been reported to have been used in over three hundred murders in Mexico and in the murder of border guard, Brian Terry.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1380679950032</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 22:12:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380680181933-274</Id><Title>IRS lie exposed by Lois Lerner's own words?</Title><Msg>Unearthed emails by IRS official appear to torpedo agency claims that targeting of conservative groups wasn't politically motivated</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1380680181933</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 22:16:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380680654253-275</Id><Title>The Benghazi lies are worse than you thought</Title><Msg>Yesterday John Kerry informed Congress that he would not be making the Benghazi survivors available to testify before Congress: Sharyl Attkisson of CBS News tweeted today that “Secy Kerry tells congress he will not honor the request to make Benghazi survivors available for questioning.” The stonewalling of the Obama Administration on the Benghazi survivors is incredibly frustrating, but made worse by the complete lack of interest by the mainstream media. Kerry has faced the question of the Benghazi survivors on numerous occasions and has effectively dodged the issue at every turn. In March, Secretary of State John Kerry was asked by Fox News correspondent James Rosen why nobody has “heard from” the Benghazi survivors. Kerry stumbled through the answer, saying “Well, I – I mean, I can’t tell you the answer to that.” Rosen pressed John Kerry on the issue by asking, “Will we hear from them?” Kerry responded: “I can’t tell you- I don’t know what the circumstances are of any requests to talk to them or not.”</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1380680654253</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-01 22:24:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380680964076-276</Id><Title>“There is no spying on Americans,”</Title><Msg>Obama told late-night comedian Jay Leno in an interview earlier this month.
