Many in the business community had urged Congress to avoid a shutdown and potential default because of its unsettling impact on the economy and the business climate. [...] “If you are as frustrated as we are, we hope you will remember that it is House Democrats who stood with you,” said the letter, cosigned by Rep. Steve Israel (D., N.Y.), chairman of the DCCC, and the committee’s finance chairman, Rep. Jim Himes (D., Conn.).”There is currently only one party in the House that is working to create an environment where our economy can grow and thriving businesses can create jobs.” Presumably many if not most of the businesses who receive the letter will ignore it because they still believe Republicans Are The Party Of Business, but they should remember that when it came down it, it was Democrats who voted to end the Republican shutdown, and it was Democrats who voted to take default off the table. And, at least as importantly, Democratic presidents have created more jobs than Republican ones—even if you only look at private sector jobs. Heck, even Political fact accepts this reality. Bottom-line: Democrats are better for the economy than Republicans</Msg><Username>gregu654</Username><Timestamp>1382459037077</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 12:23:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382459078437-88</Id><Topic><Title>House Democrats remind business groups that they were the ones who ended the GOP shutdown!!!</Title><Username>gregu654</Username><Timestamp>1382459037077</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 12:23:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Colbert shreds Fox News for assigning blame for the shutdown Cruz declared ‘a remarkable victory’</Msg><Username>junior_the32</Username><Timestamp>1382459078437</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 12:24:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382459170703-89</Id><Topic><Title>Typical Ted Cruz lie: CRUZ: People all over this country are losing their health insurance</Title><Username>jaysallstarss_alaska_rocks</Username><Timestamp>1382452779090</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 10:39:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My PCIP insurance is no longer being offered after January 2014 and my wife's Anthem Blue Cross insurance program costing $280/mo. is no longer being offered and a new policy can be purchased for $497/mo.

Miller declined to release the student's name out of respect for his family. "They are grieving parents and are going through" a challenging, difficult time, Miller said. But for whatever reason, the boy, whom authorities have not identified, took his parents' handgun to school, a federal law enforcement source said. Miller said Tuesday that authorities aren't positive where the gun came from, but believe it belonged to his parents.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382464165182</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 13:49:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382464239126-124</Id><Topic><Title>Good thing those parents bought a gun to protect their family,</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382464165182</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 13:49:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GOP- party of DIM WITS !</Msg><Username>the_fake_id_guy</Username><Timestamp>1382464239126</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 13:50:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382464293698-125</Id><Topic><Title>THE FAILED OBAMAWEBSITE SHOWS OBAMA CAN'T DO A DAMNTHING RIGHT!</Title><Username>gregu456</Username><Timestamp>1382458692911</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 12:18:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why aren't you defending your lord &amp; savior Hussein Obama?

In order to get as many seats as possible, the GOP concentrated democrats in a few districts but then spread out the GOP vote to come up with ratios in the gerrymandered districts with 52/48 % majorities. This worked great for the GOP, especially due to the usual low turnout in a non presidential election, but many pundits think with the demographic changes occurring the GOP may have permanently made themselves the minority party. A shift of 3% due to increased hispanic votes or voters outraged by the tea party takeover could make the GOP forever the minority party Watch how powerful the tea billies are when the GOP controls no branches of the Government, see just how much Nancy Pelosi bends to accommodate their outrageous demands, just saying, no?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382465374887</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 14:09:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382465669897-137</Id><Topic><Title>How's that FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR 0bamacare web site working' out?</Title><Username>proconsul_gallio</Username><Timestamp>1382459419879</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 12:30:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>or the 6 trillion Bush blew going after WMDs, just to put that in perspective for you mathematically challenged tea billies the money we spent developing the ACA web site was 0.007% of what Bush blew on his useless wars.

Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson of Florida sent a fundraising pitch equating the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan, which includes an image of a burning cross for the letter "T." The fundraising e-mail plays off an interview Grayson did last week with Al Sharpton on MSNBC after the federal government reopened following a 16-day shutdown. "The Tea Party is no more popular than the Klan," Grayson said in that interview — a transcript of which the Florida lawmaker posted on Twitter Monday night, along with link to a donation page. "Ask yourself this: Who else in American public life today is as honest and as blunt as this? Congressman Alan Grayson deserves your support, like no one else," reads the end of Grayson's message.

A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans' policies are too extreme. And according to the poll, Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. A majority of those questioned blamed congressional Republicans for the government shutdown and said the President was the bigger winner in the deal to end the crisis.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382472901225</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:15:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382473852164-238</Id><Title>tea billie lies on FAUX news</Title><Msg>1I decided to hit the pavement. I tracked down Hannity’s guests, one by one, and did my own telephone interviews with them. First I spoke with Paul Cox of Leicester, N.C. He and his wife Michelle had lamented to Hannity that because of Obamacare, they can’t grow their construction business and they have kept their employees below a certain number of hours, so that they are part-timers. Obamacare has no effect on businesses with 49 employees or less. But in our brief conversation on the phone, Paul revealed that he has only four employees. Why the cutback on his workforce? “Well,” he said, “I haven’t been forced to do so, it’s just that I’ve chosen to do so. I have to deal with increased costs.” What costs? And how, I asked him, is any of it due to Obamacare? There was a long pause, after which he said he’d call me back. He never did. There is only one Obamacare requirement that applies to a company of this size: workers must be notified of the existence of the “healthcare.gov” website, the insurance exchange. That’s all.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382473852164</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:30:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382473928734-239</Id><Topic><Title>tea billie lies on FAUX news</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382473852164</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:30:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>billies all upset about saving 60% and getting better coverage Next I called Allison Denijs. She’d told Hannity that she pays over $13,000 a year in premiums. Like the other guests, she said she had recently gotten a letter from Blue Cross saying that her policy was being terminated and a new, ACA-compliant policy would take its place. She says this shows that Obama lied when he promised Americans that we could keep our existing policies. Allison’s husband left his job a few years ago, one with benefits at a big company, to start his own business. Since then they’ve been buying insurance on the open market, and are now paying around $1,100 a month for a policy with a $2,500 deductible per family member, with hefty annual premium hikes. One of their two children is not covered under the policy. She has a preexisting condition that would require purchasing additional coverage for $600 a month, which would bring the family’s grand total to around $20,000 a year. I asked Allison if she’d shopped on the exchange, to see what a plan might cost under the new law. She said she hadn’t done so because she’d heard the website was not working. Would she try it out when it’s up and running? Perhaps, she said. She told me she has long opposed Obamacare, and that the president should have focused on tort reform as a solution to bringing down the price of healthcare. I tried an experiment and shopped on the exchange for Allison and Kurt. Assuming they don’t smoke and have a household income too high to be eligible for subsidies, I found that they would be able to get a plan for around $7,600, which would include coverage for their uninsured daughter. This would be about a 60 percent reduction from what they would have to pay on the pre-Obamacare market.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382473928734</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:32:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382474020343-240</Id><Topic><Title>tea billie lies on FAUX news</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382473852164</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:30:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and lie number three Finally, I called Robbie and Tina Robison from Franklin, Tenn. Robbie is self-employed as a Christian youth motivational speaker. (You can see his work here.) On Hannity, the couple said that they, too, were recently notified that their Blue Cross policy would be expiring for lack of ACA compliance. They told Hannity that the replacement plans Blue Cross was offering would come with a rate increase of 50 percent or even 75 percent, and that the new offerings would contain all sorts of benefits they don’t need, like maternity care, pediatric care, prenatal care and so forth. Their kids are grown and moved out, so why should they be forced to pay extra for a health plan with superfluous features? When I spoke to Robbie, he said he and Tina have been paying a little over $800 a month for their plan, about $10,000 a year. And the ACA-compliant policy that will cost 50-75 percent more? They said this information was related to them by their insurance agent. Had they shopped on the exchange yet, I asked? No, Tina said, nor would they. They oppose Obamacare and want nothing to do with it. Fair enough, but they should know that I found a plan for them for, at most, $3,700 a year, 63 percent less than their current bill. It might cover things that they don’t need, but so does every insurance policy.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382474020343</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:33:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382474112753-241</Id><Title>Cause stupid sells on FAUX news,</Title><Msg>there is a reason they went to court and got the legal right to lie on air and pretend they were reporting facts I don’t doubt that these six individuals believe that Obamacare is a disaster; but none of them had even visited the insurance exchange. And some of them appear to have taken actions (Paul Cox, for example) based on a general pessimistic belief about Obamacare. He’s certainly entitled to do so, but Hannity is not entitled to point to Paul’s behavior as an “Obamacare train wreck story” and maintain any credibility that he might have as a journalist. Strangely, the recent shutdown was based almost entirely on a small percentage of Congress’s belief that Obamacare, as Ted Cruz puts it, “is destroying America.” Cruz has rarely given us an example of what he’s talking about. That’s because the best he can do is what Hannity did—exploit people’s ignorance and falsely point to imaginary boogeymen.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382474112753</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:35:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382474706956-242</Id><Topic><Title>Cause stupid sells on FAUX news,</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382474112753</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:35:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cruz has been "brought (and bought) to your TV by the Heritage Fund"!</Msg><Username>av8lover</Username><Timestamp>1382474706956</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:45:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382474746465-243</Id><Topic><Title>tea billie lies on FAUX news</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382473852164</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:30:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh my it posts "two" itself all day. what a loser ROTFLOL.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1382474746465</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:45:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382474833801-244</Id><Title>Dumb.ivan has no friends so it posts to itself all day</Title><Msg>on a stock message board.
