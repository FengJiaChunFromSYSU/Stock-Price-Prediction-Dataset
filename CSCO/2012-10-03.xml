Again, that's why I said "fair OR NOT" Romney (and his handlers) present an image of being very out-of-touch with the voting public. 2. Of course Obama is wealthy. Who said he wasn't? What president isn't? FAIR OR NOT, the public still sees Obama as being much more in touch with the people. 3. And yes, they DO vacation "on the taxpayer's dime." HE'S THE PRESIDENT. He gets a stipend for travel to go with his relatively small salary. Would you rather he fly coach?!? This isn't Kyrgyztan!! 4. I said the REAL Mitt- the openly wealthy, openly moderate, openly humorous, and all-around-nice-guy Mitt- would have easily won. I would think if I was truly "parroting the far left talking points" I would have said that Mitt is a tax-cheating, clueless, classist, racist, professional corporate raider, with a hidden agenda to sell the American electorate to the highest bidder.

However, the Republican congressman's now-infamous remarks are not the first time he's made a scientifically questionable statement on abortion. As Slate's Amanda Marcotte reported Tuesday, Akin gave a speech on the House floor in 2008 denouncing abortion providers as "terrorists," claiming that they sometimes perform abortions on women who "are not actually pregnant": "It is no big surprise that we fight the terrorists because they are fundamentally un-American, and yet we have terrorists in our own culture called abortionists. One of the good pieces of news why we are winning this war is because there are not enough heartless doctors being graduated from medical schools. There is a real shortage of abortionists. Who wants to be at the very bottom of the food chain of medical profession? And what sort of places do these bottom-of-the-food-chain doctors work in? Places that are really a pit. You find that along with the culture of death go all kinds of other law-breaking: not following good sanitary procedure, giving abortions to women who are not actually pregnant, cheating on taxes, all these kinds of things, misuse of anesthetics so that people die or almost die." Akin's allegation of doctors performing abortions on non-pregnant women is particularly puzzling, since, by definition, an abortion cannot be performed if there is no pregnancy to terminate. Akin, a member of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, also gave a speech in 2005 on stem cell research, expressing his concern that a science-fiction story his daughter wrote about humans being harvested for body parts could become reality. "Oppose public funding that destroys little yous and mes, and oppose this harvest of destruction," he urged his congressional colleagues considering a stem cell research bill. Despite the overwhelming backlash to Akin's "legitimate rape" claim, the Republican has a good chance of beating incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) in next month's election. The latest polling shows Akin with a lead of one percentage point over McCaskill, and a number of Republicans, including Rick Santorum, Jim DeMint and Newt Gingrich, have come out in support of Akin in recent weeks.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1349277702255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 11:21:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349277751571-52</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking Fox News Stunner!</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1349272152321</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 09:49:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Per you libs...only fat old white men watch FOX....guess that includes you then,Jason.</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1349277751571</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 11:22:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349279044988-53</Id><Topic><Title>Colossal Advancement for CSCO Read Now!</Title><Username>edwardmoody35</Username><Timestamp>1349278113478</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 11:28:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She are on a unstoppable roll right at this moment.

The big story yesterday in Wingnuttia, was the Obama video that was going to blow this election wide open. Steve Benen tells the story. The whole mess just reeked of desperation. At issue was a speech Obama delivered in 2007, as a presidential candidate, not at some secret fundraiser, but in front of a large audience at Hampton University. Reporters covered the speech, which wasn’t seen as especially controversial, and all the major networks told the public about Obama’s remarks at the time. In other words, Drudge, Tucker Carlson, and Sean Hannity formed a strange sort of triumvirate to hype a five-year-old video that everyone already knew about, and which doesn’t include anything interesting anyway. Perhaps my favorite part of this silliness came when Carlson proudly boasted to Hannity on the air last night, “People will say this has already been reported. Well, actually, it hasn’t been reported. And I know because I reported on it the first time.” As I said, no shame at all. Issues aside, simply knowing that one side has serial liars like Carlson, Hannity, O’Reilly, Drudge, Savage, Levin, Malkin, Limbaugh and the other village idiots on Fox and beyond championing their cause is reason enough for anyone with a shred of decency and self-respect to question the entire conservative movement. Time to put this one up again.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1349293073118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 15:37:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349293088878-131</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT IF OBIMBO PUNCHES ROMNEY IN THE FACE, DURING THE DEBATE?</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1349286756226</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 13:52:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Kenyan fights like a girl, so much so that he has been running the entire country with no help from anyone.

"Now here's the thing, when 9/11 happened in New York City, they waived the Stafford Act – said, 'This is too serious a problem. We can't expect New York City to rebuild on its own'," Obama said, growing emotional. "And that was the right thing to do. When Hurricane Andrew struck in Florida, people said, 'Look at this devastation. We don't expect you to come up with y'own money, here. Here's the money to rebuild. We're not gonna wait for you to scratch it together – because you're part of the American family'." He continued: "What's happening down in New Orleans? 'Where's your dollar?

Gov. Blanco a Democrat had over a week warning of the storm track , didn't evacuate, like Louisiana did, didn't ask for aid. Black New Orleans Mayor Nagin didn't use his school busses to evacuate people, in fact about 1,000 busses got drowned parked in there lot instead of transporting needy people out of the storms way. Only a Race Baiter like Obama could fault the early failures on racism, the Mayor a black man was incompetent not racist. Sure the Feds were slow too but they got a late start because of the Governor not doing her job.

Some lackey at the State Dept. made a very bad decision in turning down Steven's request for more security. Once the tragedy occurred the admin. got in trouble by claiming it was spontaneous. Obama has capitalized on Bin Laden's death and claiming Al-Qaeda is close to defeat.The attack says Al-Qaeda is still viable and the video of the heathens chanting there are still one billion Bin Ladens makes a farce out of Obama's policies.That is why they tried to feed us the story about spontaneity and the video.

(COST) are beginning to shut pumps because of supply shortages that have driven wholesale fuel prices to record highs. Costco’s outlet in Simi Valley, 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, ran out of regular gasoline yesterday and was selling premium fuel at the price of regular, Jeff Cole, Costco’s vice president of gasoline, said by telephone. The company hasn’t been able to find enough unbranded summer-grade gasoline to keep its stations supplied, he said. Enlarge image A gas delivery in San Anselmo, California. Photographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The gasoline shortage “feels like a hurricane to me, but it’s the West Coast,” Cole said yesterday. “We’re obviously extremely disheartened that we are unable to do this, and we’re pulling fuel from all corners of California to fix this.”</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1349311897700</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 20:51:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349312193085-204</Id><Topic><Title>Did Obama ALLOW Ambassador to die for Political gain</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1349307480133</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 19:38:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fluteman why are you disguising as me ?</Msg><Username>fluteman_qreg</Username><Timestamp>1349312193085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 20:56:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349312290911-205</Id><Title>ANN ROMNEY LOOKS LIKE A FKNG OWL</Title><Msg>Is that all 250M can buy ?</Msg><Username>fluteman_qreg</Username><Timestamp>1349312290911</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 20:58:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349312379105-206</Id><Topic><Title>The Wall Street Criminals want to know if you are better off today than 4 years ago!</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349308022082</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 19:47:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just one more month indiana! you will never hear me mention Mitt again!</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349312379105</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 20:59:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349312982447-207</Id><Topic><Title>ANN ROMNEY LOOKS LIKE A FKNG OWL</Title><Username>fluteman_qreg</Username><Timestamp>1349312290911</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 20:58:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What an intelligent post!!!!!!

He needs a teleprompter or memorized response to be fluent. Otherwise he pauses after each word and makes no eye contact with his opponent. Obama did OK with his closing statement, he must have memorized it. Obama rambles between talking points, often loses concentration. I guess all those years hitting the Bong killed the little grey brain cells. Romney is fluent, knows the facts, speaks with authority on subjects, when asked for an example easily names 5. Romney could have brought up the Embassy and F &amp;F and other Obama weak spots but I think Romney kept this first debate on kitchen table talk. The moderator interrupted Romney much more than Obama, who got some real softball questions from the moderator. Even though Romney didn't get equal time, and I will be interested in how much more time Obama got. The rules were not followed. The Moderator bias showed. Even so the more time they gave Obama the more he looked like a boring rambling windbag. Romney doesn't need all his time anyway. Like Romney's closing remarks. Nothing flowery, just on target with what he wants to do as President. I hope Romney does this again. I also hope he corners Obama on more lies, distortions and broken promises. Obama is a second rate debater and Romney is used to debating Gingrich and holding his own.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349320156689</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 23:09:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349320257627-223</Id><Title>MEDIA SHILLS INFLUENCE USA ZOMBIES...........LOL WHY GREEN PARTY CANDIDATE NOT ALLOWED TO DEBATE?</Title><Msg>BOTH $UCKERS ...AMERICANS HAVE NO CHOICE Truth Has Fallen and Taken Liberty With It by PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS There was a time when the pen was mightier than the sword. That was a time when people believed in truth and regarded truth as an independent power and not as an auxiliary for government, class, race, ideological, personal, or financial interest. Today Americans are ruled by propaganda. Americans have little regard for truth, little access to it, and little ability to recognize it. Truth is an unwelcome entity. It is disturbing. It is off limits. Those who speak it run the risk of being branded “anti-American,” “anti-semite” or “conspiracy theorist.” Truth is an inconvenience for government and for the interest groups whose campaign contributions control government. Truth is an inconvenience for prosecutors who want convictions, not the discovery of innocence or guilt. Truth is inconvenient for ideologues. Today many whose goal once was the discovery of truth are now paid handsomely to hide it. “Free market economists” are paid to sell offshoring to the American people.
