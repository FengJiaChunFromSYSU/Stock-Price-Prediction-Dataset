Laura Bassett: "The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to review a lower court decision that prevents the state of Indiana from cutting Planned Parenthood out of its Medicaid program. Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) signed a bill into law in 2011 that prevents Medicaid recipients from being reimbursed for health services at Planned Parenthood because some of its clinics offer abortions. Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union challenged that law in court, and in October 2012, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals permanently blocked it because federal law guarantees Medicaid enrollees the freedom to choose any qualified health care provider. Indiana asked the U.S. Supreme Court in February to review the Seventh Circuit's decision, but the Supreme Court denied that request on Tuesday."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1369829864914</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 08:17:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369831265182-7</Id><Topic><Title>FANNIE MAE, FREDDY MAC - WOW !!

History During the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese Liberation Front and the PAVN used a network of supply routes that partially ran through Laos and Cambodia. As the War progressed, the U.S. ostensibly invaded both Cambodia and Laos in order to disrupt these routes. The Bombing The initial operation was authorized by then President Richard Nixon, but without the knowledge or approval of U.S. Congress. The bombings became public knowledge in 1973, after which they were stopped. The United States dropped upwards of 2.7 million tons of bombs on Cambodia, exceeding the amount it had dropped on Japan during WWII (including Hiroshima and Nagasaki) by almost a million tons. During this time, about 30 per cent of the country's population was internally displaced.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1369833736131</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:22:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369834145870-16</Id><Title>cisco really sounds like a whiny baby over Skype</Title><Msg>waaah, we can't compete with Microsoft, unfair!

Bernanke noted, “Despite this improvement, the job market remains weak overall.” His message is that the Fed alone can solve the problem of long-term job growth. So, the Fed has stated that it will keep “investing” billions every month until the U.S. reaches an unemployment rate of 6.5%. The Fed started this program in September 2012 when unemployment was at 7.8%. So, we have dropped .3% in seven months, with the unemployment rate at 7.5% as of April. If we were to continue at this current rate of .3% point drop every seven months, unemployment would reach 6.5% in about 28 months – or September 2015. ================================== Brenanke and the Kenyan will spend 85 bil a month buying bogus bonds while keeping the printing presses flying until the rain forests are bare for paper money and 6.5% UE is reached and that will never happen under the Kenyan's evil rule because he doesn't want the economy to grow, he's doing all he can to crush it, but if and when it gets close to 6% that will mean that there are a lot of part time low paying lawn mowing jobs filled by illegal aliens and when the Kenyan and Brenanke stop printing and raise interest rates we will witness the mother of all collapses, again, it will make the Dems destruction of the economy, which they tried to blame on Repubs, look like Candy Land. O'Braindead Kenyan is pure evil.</Msg><Username>ivanhoeofloxxly</Username><Timestamp>1369840630724</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 11:17:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369840695748-46</Id><Topic><Title>This is even worse than the Clinton market bubble...</Title><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1369839643812</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 11:00:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's doing it with Obama's tacit approval.

Michele Bachmann could quickly become a major problem for the Tea Party hero, experts tell Salon. “This is very serious,” said Craig Holman, a government ethics lobbyist at liberal-leaning watchdog group Public Citizen. “It’s not Watergate, or at least not yet, but these are a series of allegations that are each serious on their own, and when you put them all together, this could be a career ender for Michele Bachmann.” Ken Boehm, chairman of the conservative-leaning National Legal and Policy Center, told Salon that we should wait to see what investigators find — indeed, no wrongdoing has been reported so far — though he acknowledged the escalating scrutiny could be a major headache for the congresswoman down the line. The Iowa investigation, looking into whether the campaign improperly paid a state senator, is just one of at least three different probes examining a range of allegations related to Bachmann’s failed presidential campaign, including charges that she improperly used campaign funds to promote her book, that her campaign “launder[ed]” money, and that one of her staffers stole an email list from a home-school organization. Two former staffers, including her former chief of staff, have agreed to testify against Bachmann, which Holman said is “very unusual” and something that will push investigators at the Federal Elections Commission and the Office of Congressional Ethics, each of which reportedly has its own investigations into the campaign, to take the matter seriously.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369844925427</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 12:28:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369844976311-75</Id><Topic><Title>Ending the IRS scandal</Title><Username>hairyroid</Username><Timestamp>1369844487638</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 12:21:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does that have to do with the legal argument of getting Lerner to testify.

The policy was designed to hurt people and it's working as intended. The Washington Post ran a feature piece today on Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), who already recently got an earful on this. Earlier this month, a friend and former campaign volunteer stood up at one of the town hall meetings to tell Mulvaney that the defense cuts had cost him his job of five years with a large defense contractor. "I just want you to know that these cuts are real and they hurt me," said Jeffrey Betsch, a single father of three daughters, who was on the verge of being evicted from his home. All of this undermines the economy and none of this is necessary. Even the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee recently called the sequestration policy "idiotic." But it continues anyway, doing deliberate harm, because congressional Republicans will neither compromise nor turn it off.</Msg><Username>dimwitty_family</Username><Timestamp>1369845043853</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 12:30:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369845606740-77</Id><Topic><Title>This is even worse than the Clinton market bubble...</Title><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1369839643812</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 11:00:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anti-American GOP pukes are now praying for a crash!</Msg><Username>belongsinamuseum</Username><Timestamp>1369845606740</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 12:40:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369845762799-78</Id><Topic><Title>Ending the IRS scandal</Title><Username>hairyroid</Username><Timestamp>1369844487638</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 12:21:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Appears some on this board are afraid of Lerner's testimony.

Given then-Sen. Barack Obama's sketchy past, she said, "What it is that Barack Obama really believes?" Democrats gave her opponent $8 million in 10 days, but she won anyway. This was Bachmann's role — to recite the vague conspiracy theories you read in forwarded emails on cable news — from then till Wednesday, when she announced she's quitting Congress. For a while, the Republican Party found her quite useful. Until it didn't any more. And now Michele Bachmann is going home. Crazy worked really well for Bachmann for a while. She raised a ton of money, the vast majority of it from small donors. Her most important message was to justify all-out opposition to Obama — otherwise, America would crumble. "If you look at FDR, LBJ, and Barack Obama, this is really the final leap to socialism," she said in 2009. "But we all know that we could turn this around and we can turn this around fairly quickly." She rallied against Obama's "gangster government" in April 2010, saying, "It's time for these little piggies to go home." Bachmann rejected claims that Tea Partiers were motivated by racism: "Racism is real. Racism is ugly. You hate racism, I hate racism," she told Sean Hannity in July 2010. Obama's spending showed his "infantilism," she said in September 2010, but on Election Day, "Liberty will be refreshed in our country."</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1369848558055</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 13:29:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369848741653-96</Id><Topic><Title>How the GOP Ran Out of Use for Michele Bachmann</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1369848558055</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 13:29:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Desperate,huh phony.

Lincoln Chafee is joining the Democratic Party ahead of his bid for a second term, two Democratic officials said Wednesday, confirming a move that Chafee has been talking about for months. Chafee served in the U.S. Senate as a Republican but left the GOP in 2007. He was elected as the nation's only independent governor in 2010. The officials said Chafee plans to change his registration to join the party. They weren't authorized to disclose the information publicly ahead of any announcement from Chafee and spoke on condition of anonymity. Chafee's staff did not immediately confirm his plan. Chafee has been saying for months that he was thinking about the switch, noting that he shares many positions with Democrats and that joining the party will help with fundraising. He is a supporter of President Barack Obama and spoke at last year's Democratic National Convention.</Msg><Username>philsimmsap</Username><Timestamp>1369854189993</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:03:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369854376182-113</Id><Topic><Title>BACHMAN, A distraction...IRS is for real!!!! and Holder is going to jail for perjury...so will top IRS agents...WATCH!!!!</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1369849973075</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 13:52:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does not matter liberals loved to be lied to (see liberal heros the clintons)</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1369854376182</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:06:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369854520571-114</Id><Title>guant bay is not moral</Title><Msg>but this is without a trial?

That includes the majority, albeit slim, of Republicans. Nearly six in 10 Americans believe that the federal government should provide funds to states affected by natural disasters without having to cut spending in other areas to do so, according to a new Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll. Fifty-nine percent of all respondents say federal emergency aid need not be offset by cuts in other parts of the budget—a number that includes a majority (52 percent) of self-identified Republicans as well as nearly seven in 10 Democrats. Here's another tidbit from the poll: Republicans who self-identify with the tea party still support disaster funding without offsets, 49-42. Tom Coburn is seriously on his own with this one. For the moment, it's a moot question: There's enough in FEMA's accounts to pay for Oklahoma relief. But natural disaster season is still ahead of us, with plenty more tornadoes, wildfires and hurricanes to deplete those funds. Don't expect Republicans to heed this polling, however.
