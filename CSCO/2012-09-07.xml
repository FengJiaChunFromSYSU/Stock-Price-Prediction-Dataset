THE FACTS: "This is true," said Bryan Cook, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the American Council on Education. "How much of a savings is not clear." Large increases in federal Pell Grants, GI Bill benefits and the 2009 American Opportunity Tax Credit led to a significant increase in the amount of aid provided to students who qualify for these benefits. The current per year maximum Pell Grant is $5,550 — $900 higher than it was in 2008 for a program that serves more than 9 million students. Under the Obama administration, Congress passed legislation requiring all federal loans be issued through the Education Department; previously, they were also issued by private lenders. This will also probably mean students pay less in the long term.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1347019615752</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:06:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347019655832-29</Id><Title>Romney's promise to restore Obama's $716 billion in Medicare cuts could have unintended consequences for the program.

The address was packed with facts and figures, as well as political claims and arguments. Here’s a fact check of some of Clinton’s statements. CLAIM: “For 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats, 24. In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private sector jobs. So what’s the job score? Republicans, 24 million; Democrats, 42 (million).” ANALYSIS: The claim is accurate, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s the breakdown: Kennedy-Johnson: 12.1 million jobs added; Nixon-Ford: 8.4 million jobs; Carter: 9 million jobs; Reagan-Bush: 16.1 million jobs; Clinton: 20.8 million jobs; Bush: 646,000 jobs lost; Obama: 332,000 jobs added through July of this year.

If you subtract the revised job reports from the released data today only 40,000 created in two months.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1347036187072</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:43:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347036855418-105</Id><Topic><Title>facts: bush doubled UE, obammy bringing it down</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1347024422221</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:27:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it is just common sense. liberals talk about things that dont matter-children get distracted very easily. seems like obama knows this and has been playing games with their little minds. just like clint eastwood...I wont vote for him either after that crappy talk. idiots</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1347036855418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:54:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347036982940-106</Id><Topic><Title>Obama celebrates that the citizen median income is down 5%</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1347032052790</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:34:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they lost 40% of their house hold wealth under obama what is another 5%</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1347036982940</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:56:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347037315474-107</Id><Title>mitt said he wants to lower EVERYONES even the middle class tax rate</Title><Msg>liberals call it a tax break for the rich hahahahahaha. obama has them eating out of his hand. little lemmings cant hear.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1347037315474</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 13:01:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347038075136-108</Id><Title>obama's job numbers</Title><Msg>good grief. every job "created" under obama cost tax payers 250k per job.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1347038075136</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 13:14:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347038933549-109</Id><Topic><Title>mitt said he wants to lower EVERYONES even the middle class tax rate</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1347037315474</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 13:01:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fact checking has rated that pants on fire, Ryan's plan raises taxes on the middle class an average of 2k while cutting taxes on the ultra wealthy (Mitt's rate goes to 0.86%) oh and guess what with no estate taxes his family becomes rich forever</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347038933549</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 13:28:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347038972582-110</Id><Topic><Title>mitt said he wants to lower EVERYONES even the middle class tax rate</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1347037315474</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 13:01:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he put the largest tax increase on the middle class while in office.

On the campaign trail, Republican nominee Mitt Romney seemed buoyed by the news, urging his audience not to watch television, read newspapers, or log on to the Internet between now and Election Day. Mr. Romney attempted to rebut Vice-President Joe Biden’s biggest applause line from last night by telling supporters, “On Day One of my Presidency I will kill General Motors and bring Osama bin Laden back to life.” As for President Obama’s biggest applause line, “I am the President of the United States,” Fox News said they were fact-checking it. With the fall campaign officially begun, both Obama and Romney must now spend hundreds of hours and millions of dollars to become President of Ohio. Only sixty days remain until the election, or in Paul Ryan’s words, “Forty days.” .</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1347043815897</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 14:50:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347044409973-139</Id><Topic><Title>Romney, if elected, vows to kill GM and bring Osama bin Laden back to life</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1347043815897</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 14:50:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>now that's funny</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347044409973</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:00:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347044451774-140</Id><Title>Mitt thinks the military is full of fools</Title><Msg>In 2007, when asked why not a single one of his five sons has ever served in the military, Mitt explains that they serve their country by helping their dad get elected.

The move would let states change minimum eligibility, standards of care, and federal rules that now protect adult children from being billed for their parents’ Medicaid care. Now, like a vast majority of the nation’s 1.8 million nursing home residents, Mrs. Lull, a retired schoolteacher with dementia, counts on Medicaid to cover most of her bill. But her daughter Rena, 66, also a retired schoolteacher with a lifetime of savings, no longer knows what she can count on in her own old age. “I get choked up thinking about this,” she said, recalling how her widowed mother had depleted $300,000 on five years of care in the community and one year in the Otsego Manor nursing home, before qualifying for Medicaid. “I’m so scared about what’s going to happen to me.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347047908502</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:58:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347048966938-150</Id><Topic><Title>Romney /Ryan</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347047908502</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:58:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“I get choked up thinking about this,” she said, recalling how her widowed mother had depleted $300,000 on five years of care in the community and one year in the Otsego Manor nursing home, before qualifying for Medicaid. “I’m so scared about what’s going to happen to me.” how could obama let that happen.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1347048966938</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 16:16:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347049315782-151</Id><Topic><Title>Romney /Ryan</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347047908502</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:58:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>brain dead baggers fail reading comprehension (and spelling) guess you missed this #$%$br /&gt; will face uncharted territory if Republicans carry out their plan to replace Medicaid with block grants that cut spending by a third over a decade.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347049315782</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 16:21:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347049801436-152</Id><Title>ANOTHER BAD DAY FOR CISCO</Title><Msg>DID THEY LOWER THE DIVIDEND?</Msg><Username>scott4usa</Username><Timestamp>1347049801436</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 16:30:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347049977873-153</Id><Topic><Title>Romney /Ryan</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347047908502</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:58:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you mean the same grants that put obama and manchelle through college. wish my college was free because of my skin color. must be nice. so if you are poor you dont have to pay for things and if you are rich you pay for everyones stuff?
