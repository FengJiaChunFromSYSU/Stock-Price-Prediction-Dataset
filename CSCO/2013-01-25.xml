Milli Vanilli Gate Milli Vanilli was a pop and dance project created by Frank Farian in Munich, Germany, in 1988. The group was formed with Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus. The group's debut album Girl You Know It's True achieved international success and earned them a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on February 21, 1990.[1] Milli Vanilli became one of the most popular pop acts in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

But the target of public anger should not be Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose conduct has been exemplary ever since the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three of his brave colleagues lost their lives last September. Far more deserving of scorn are the likes of Rand Paul (R-KY), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and all the other grandstanding, conspiracy-mongering, ill-informed politicians who questioned her Wednesday on Capitol Hill. Four months after the tragedy occurred, Republicans on both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee still seem to be obsessed with the talking points provided to UN Ambassador Susan Rice before she appeared on television to discuss the incident. According to Republican folklore, unsupported by facts, the Obama White House engaged in a conspiracy to conceal the true nature of the terrorist attack by mischaracterizing it as a “demonstration.” The continuing focus on that trivial issue – long since explained by Rice herself, as well as retired General David Petraeus and others, under oath – understandably provoked an exasperated Clinton to scold Johnson, one of the dimmer idols of the Tea Party. When the Wisconsin Republican began to harp on this topic yet again – interrupting her answer, after stupidly asserting that Clinton could have resolved any questions about the attack with “a very simple phone call” to the burned-out Benghazi compound – she responded sharply: With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because there was a protest or was it because there were guys who went out for a walk one night who decided they would kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and to do everything we can to make sure it never happens again. No doubt Clinton’s utterly sane retort will undergo dishonest editing, in the style of James O’Keefe, to make her sound cavalier or arrogant. But it is the Republicans in Congress whose attitude toward the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and his fallen comrades has seemed cynical and false, ever since they first sought to exploit the incident politically during the presidential campaign. Meanwhile, having historically supported reductions in federal spending on diplomatic security, they have done nothing useful so far to enhance the safety of Americans serving abroad. Worse still, their questions to Clinton indicate that very few of them, even at this late date, have bothered to learn the basic facts surrounding the Benghazi incident. By contrast, Clinton has assumed responsibility in a meaningful way ever since September 11 – which is to say that she has taken action to ensure a serious response. As required by law, she empowered an independent investigation, which resulted in dozens of recommendations for improved security and held several high-ranking State Department officials to account for the lapses in Libya. It is worth noting that Thomas Pickering, the distinguished former diplomat who led the probe, fixed culpability for the security flaws at Benghazi at “the assistant secretary level,” rather than with Clinton herself. Nobody in Washington understands the workings of the U.S. foreign service better than Pickering, who served in top positions under both presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Certainly not Johnson or Paul, who rather comically asserted that “if [he] were president,” he would have fired Clinton. Always hard to imagine, a Paul presidency seemed even more remote when he quizzed her about obscure right-wing conspiracy theories involving Syria, Turkey, and Libya. As Joan Walsh observed in Salon, those irate and ignorant inquisitors on Capitol Hill appeared small and peevish in their confrontation with Clinton, a woman whose serious, diligent, tireless approach to public service has armed her with an enduring popularity at least three times greater than her Republican adversaries in Congress. Their feeble attempts to cut her down, echoed by the usual loudmouths on radio and cable television, only make her bigger.

While we're still waiting for experts to come up with a definitive answer as to why people are gay or straight (and we may never know), we've never come across anyone -- other than Jones -- who thinks it is due to juice boxes.

Authorities at the time called it the biggest seizure of heroin ever found in central Florida. The seized plane belonged to 70-year old Wallace J. Hilliard of Naples, FL., multi-millionaire businessman, self-styled Mormon Bishop, and the newly-discovered secret owner of Huffman Aviation at the Venice Airport since its purchase in 1999, just months before terrorists began arriving in force in Southwest Florida. Hilliard was already well-known in aviation circles as the 'money man' and deep-pocketed financial backer of Rudi Dekkers, according to local aviation observers like chief flight instructor Tom Hammersly, who taught at the Venice Airport while the two flight schools there experienced a flood of Arab student pilots. "What we heard was that he (Dekkers) had somebody in Naples backing him financially. We all knew that the money he (Dekkers) flaunted was not even his money, that he was just a 'front' man for the man who had the money," stated Hammersly in an interview in "Mohamed Atta &amp; the Venice Flying Circus." Though in his many media appearances Rudi Dekkers portrayed himself as both president and owner of Huffman Aviation, this claim, like so many other Dekkers’ pronouncements, is untrue. Lying on and off-the-record Court documents filed in August at the Sarasota Courthouse reveal that the so-called 'Magic Dutch Boy' never completed the Huffman sale, ‘neglecting’ to pay for his shares of stock in the resulting corporation. While terrorist student pilots flew in veritable squadrons (as many as sixteen at a time) over Venice, Wally Hilliard had been Huffman Aviation's true owner. Nor is this the first time Rudi Dekkers has ‘neglected’ to pay for shares in business ventures. In 1995 in The Netherlands, the MadCowMorningNews has learned, Dekkers incorporated a company and never paid for his shares of stock in it either. A Dutch court adjudged Dekkers guilty in that case of acting "in a manifestly improper fashion," and said that "his manifest failure to properly manage the company was an important cause of (the firm's) bankruptcy." As a result, Rudi Dekkers, a man who was invited to testify before the Congress of the United States of America on his thoughts on preventing future terrorist attacks, is today a fugitive from justice in his native Holland. And while Rudi Dekkers busied himself training thousands of young Arab men to fly, from his base in Naples, just a short helicopter ride south of Venice, his partner Wally Hilliard was running a charter jet service called Plane 1 Leasing which provided the jet carrying 30 pounds of heroin. "Celebrity Endorsement as Double-Edged Sword" At the same time their planes were flying back and forth from Venezuela with illegal cargo Hilliard's charter service was also, unbelievably, being utilized at virtually no cost––despite the fact that rentals for Lear jets can run as high as $1,800 an hour––by Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Even stranger, both Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris were providing celebrity endorsements to Hilliard's operation well after the company's Lear (N351WB) had been busted by DEA agents armed with machine guns. Pretty poor advance work, at the very least... One would think a sitting Governor seems well-advised to steer well clear of anything to do with heroin trafficking. Yet Governor Jeb Bush honored Hilliard's operation––called at various times Florida Air, Sunrise Airlines and Discover Air––with a personal visit, even posing for photos with the "Discover Air family." The company promptly commemorated the memorable event by posting pictures of the visit on their website. Finally somebody in the Bush camp realized their lethal potential exposure, and the webpage was hastily taken off the Discover Air site. Getting Google-ed But they didn't reckon with Google's heralded cache system. So today you can see the page in all its former glory. Alas for Discover Air, soon after beginning operations they were forced to see their shortcomings in headlines, like this June 28, 2001 doozy from the hometown Orlando Sentinel: AIR SERVICE TO MIAMI FLOPS; NOT ONE PERSON BOUGHT A TICKET, SO DISCOVER AIR HALTED PLANS FOR FLIGHTS FROM DAYTONA BEACH. Having "not one person buy a ticket" would seem to be hugely embarrassing to a fledgling airline... if scheduled passenger service was the true aim of the Enterprise. Katherine Harris' endorsement of the Hilliard/Dekkers operation must also be providing her with some bad moments today: "As one of Florida's top politicians, Katherine Harris doesn't have much time to do a lot of personal traveling," read the Sarasota Herald Tribune's chatty lead. "But twice in the past month or so, the secretary of state --who received national attention for her role in the November presidential election -- has taken the 75-minute plane ride from her current home in Tallahassee to her old stomping grounds in Sarasota. Her choice of airline? Florida Air, a start-up commuter airline based here, grasping to be an air-taxi for the entire state." 'She has taken the airline twice,' Harris spokesman Ben McKay said. 'She appreciates the convenience that Florida Air offers.'" Since at the same time then-Florida Secretary of State Harris was "appreciating their convenience" Florida/Discover Air had been flying passengers without holding an air carrier certificate, Ms. Harris' reputation as a stickler for the letter of the law can be said to have suffered something of a beating. Is it just incredible bad luck that these two prominent Florida politicians endorsed an operation that both trained murderous terrorists AND brought heroin into America?</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359130781786</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:19:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359130843770-60</Id><Title>New board idiot</Title><Msg>alsmith posted yesterday that Nixon was in charge of the My Lai massacre.

Most of the victims were women, children, infants, and elderly people. Some of the women were gang-raped and their bodies were later found to be mutilated[2] and many women were allegedly raped prior to the killings.[3] While 26 U.S. soldiers were initially charged with criminal offenses for their actions at Mỹ Lai, only Second Lieutenant William Calley, a platoon leader in Charlie Company, was convicted. Found guilty of killing 22 villagers, he was originally given a life sentence, but only served three and a half years under house arrest. The massacre took place in the hamlets of My Lai and My Khe of Son My village.[4][5] The event is also called the Son My Massacre, especially in the Vietnamese state media. The U.S. military codeword for the "Viet Cong stronghold" was "Pinkville".[6] The incident prompted global outrage when it became public knowledge in 1969. The massacre also increased domestic opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Three U.S. servicemen who had tried to halt the massacre and protect the wounded were initially denounced by several U.S. Congressmen as traitors. They received hate mail and death threats and found mutilated animals on their doorsteps. The three were later widely praised and decorated by the Army for their heroic actions.[</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359131466132</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:31:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359131486895-63</Id><Topic><Title>Republican's great hope for the White House in 2016,Jeb Bush</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359130781786</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:19:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hmmmm alsmith cuts and pastes just like dumbivan.</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1359131486895</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:31:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359131595666-64</Id><Topic><Title>Republican's great hope for the White House in 2016,Jeb Bush</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359130781786</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:19:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hmmmm alsmith cuts and pastes just like dumbivan.

Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin’ and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin’ kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and I’d drink the syrup, I was this side of death. Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. Poop, #$%$ the whole shot. My pants got crusted up.” Years later the National Rifle Association board member went on to tell Creem magazine that he also snorted a line of crystal meth before attending his physical examination, giving him a “big, juicy 4F,” meaning failure and rejection from service.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359132146982</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:42:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359132320406-68</Id><Topic><Title>Reminder</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1359128950245</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 10:49:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>prosperity, stock market up 6% so far this year Not prosperity, stock market collapses 40% under Bush, job losses of 800,000 a month, not prosperity, not thriving get it now? still having trouble?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359132320406</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:45:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359132422505-69</Id><Topic><Title>Draft dodgers are Texas heros, Here is your Vietnam hero, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359132146982</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:42:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nugent is a disgusting POS to this day and sounds like a sick alley cat when he sings.No wonder he's a rightwing hero,I mean zero.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359132422505</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:47:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359132897509-70</Id><Topic><Title>New board idiot</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1359130843770</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:20:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did you leave Dora?</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359132897509</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:54:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359133345315-71</Id><Title>Obama violates the Constitution AGAIN...</Title><Msg>...With the three recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board.

January 25, 2013 By mario piperni Do Dems have a chance in picking up a senate seat in 2014 as teabaggers pick off another semi-moderate Republican? Maybe. Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), one of the Republicans most vulnerable to a conservative primary challenge, will retire in 2014 rather than seek a third term. Chambliss denied in a statement Friday morning that the potential primary was a factor in his decision, saying he was confident he would have won re-election. Despite his largely conservative record, Chambliss has attracted conservative ire for his interest in bipartisan compromise. His recent public break with anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist earned him particular scrutiny. He also struggled in the 2008 election, forced into a runoff with Democrat Jim Martin. As long as the Tea Party has a say in matters, compromise will continue to be a 4-letter word in Republican politics. The best part of this story is the polling which indicates that Herman Cain, should he decide to run (he says he won’t), would be a serious contender in a Republican primary for Chambliss’ seat. How beautiful would that be! Memories of Sharron Angle come to mind. If there is a God, there will be a Herman Cain campaign to mock in 2014.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359139261603</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 13:41:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359139303223-107</Id><Topic><Title>WITH RECENT COURT DECISION, HOW LONG TIL BAMA IMPEACHED?</Title><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1359135855514</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 12:44:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"remember how the last Impeachment of of a sitting president went for the Returds" Oh I/we remember it quite well mofo99 LOL!

Cathrynn Brown has introduced a bill that would charge the victims of rape with a felony for "tampering with evidence" if they get an abortion should their rape result in pregnancy. “Tampering with evidence shall include procuring or facilitating an abortion, or compelling or coercing another to obtain an abortion, of a fetus that is the result of criminal sexual penetration or incest with the intent to destroy evidence of the crime," the bill says. Third-degree felonies in New Mexico carry a sentence of up to three years in prison. Pat Davis of ProgressNow New Mexico, a progressive nonprofit opposing the bill, called it "blatantly unconstitutional" on Thursday. “The bill turns victims of rape and incest into felons and forces them to become incubators of evidence for the state,” he said. “According to Republican philosophy, victims who are ‘legitimately raped’ will now have to carry the fetus to term in order to prove their case.“ The bill is expected to fail as both New Mexico chambers have Democratic majorities.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359141303432</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 14:15:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359141370338-114</Id><Topic><Title>Federal court spanks Barry</Title><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1359138439460</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 13:27:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't worry, the GOP will make sure that the federal courts are non-functioning as they furlough all federal court employees, which is their objective!</Msg><Username>oscar_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1359141370338</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 14:16:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359141749893-115</Id><Title>Democrat values</Title><Msg>Dem Robert Menendez who chaired the Benghazi hearing with Hillary is under investigation for sex with a 16 year old #$%$ in South America.

So yesterday was the day Hillary Clinton finally testified on the Benghazi tragedy at hearings in both the House and the Senate. The Republicans have been after her for months now to get it done, but things happened, including Influenza and her fall and subsequent hospitalization for a concussion in late December. (A clear stall, wicked lady. Hmmpph!) No surprise, was it, that if the Republicans pushed that hard to get her on the stand, it would be theater less like Shakespeare's Globe and more like Gonzo Gaiety. Satisfying, isn't it, that they didn't disappoint? I don't know about you, but they far exceeded my expectations. Those rascals did what they set out to do and the results were pretty much as predicted (by some of us. Yea, verily, most of us). Hillary the Indomitable chewed them up and spit them out, one by one. I watched in horrified awe as they each entered the arena--impatient, it seemed, to become her next victim. What were they thinking? Kentucky's whippersnapper-in-residence, Rand Paul, probably couldn't know that lecturing in slow-drawl ("I'm glad that you're accepting responsibility. I think ultimately with your leaving that you accept the culpability for the worst tragedy since 9/11. And I really mean that"), was about as effective as my then-six-year-old #$%$uming some sense of superiority by shouting, "I hate you!" He must not have been looking at Hillary when he said it, because, already oblivious to his own sense of proportion when it comes to tragedies (Really, Randy? 'The worst tragedy since 9/11'?? Let's just look.), he went on: "Had I been president and found you did not read the cables from Benghazi and from Amb#$%$ador Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post. I think it's inexcusable." Well, now, sonny, you'd best get hold of yourself. "Inexcusable" is a mighty strong word. It's been known to come back 'round and bite a busy body in the #$%$. Ron Johnson, Republican senator from Wisconsin, harped on and on about the initial protest reports until Hillary forcefully reminded him, "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk that night who decided to kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator." (Johnson the senator later told a radio host, "It was theatrics. She didn't want to answer questions so she makes a big show of it.") Later, John McCain tells Hillary her answers are "unsatisfactory" and then goes back to questioning why the State Department called the attacks "a protest" way back in September when it turns out they weren't. (Note to John: See Hillary's answer to your good friend and colleague, Ron Johnson, above. Now get outta here.) These hearings were not set up to get answers to the Benghazi raid, they were set up to get Hillary. Everybody inside and outside those rooms knew that--the Republicans bent on bullying her; the Democratic Greek Chorus determined to defend her, the millions of watchers hoping to see a catfight. Everybody got what they wanted. And in the end Hillary took the blame, told the truth and won the day. Because she's Hillary and they're so not. When the low-brow Rand Paul asked Hillary about the sales of arms to Turkey, you could see the incredulity on her face. Jaw-dropping stupidity much, Dr. Paul? Of course I would expect no less from a man too stupid to p#$%$ his medical boards, forcing him to create his own board and declare himself certified. He's not a doctor; but he plays one in Kentucky.

Two relationships (one with his wife and one with “muse” Pele Massa, who was 17 when they started dating) were ended due to Ted’s infidelity while on the road, often with underage women. But Ted justifies his behavior with one of his trademark funny expressions: “alternative flesh management.” Oh, we know. We understand. That's just one source. Here's another. Courtney Love phoned into the Howard Stern Show on Monday before eventually coming into the studio where she made the shocking allegation that one of the first times she had oral sex was with Ted Nugent. She said she was young and she didn’t want to say exactly how old she was, but eventually confessed she was 12-year-old — which would have made Nugent approximately 28 years old at the time. The New York Post attempted to contact Nugent for a response but was unsuccessful. Moderators at Nugent’s official forum deleted the only thread asking about the topic as evidenced by the forum’s search giving a file not found error for the matched thread. She added it was a long time ago and she didn’t even have breasts yet. OK. So that's just two sources that say that Ted Nugent not only had sex with underaged girls, but bragged about it, and one of those girls was a 12-year old Courtney Love. In the slideshow section, we have a screencap from the October 2000 edition of Spin Magazine that tells how "Bring 'Em Young" Nugent talked a girl's parents into making him her legal guardian... but that's just another source, isn't it.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359146460290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 15:41:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359146583430-141</Id><Topic><Title>Ted texas hero, like Lance Armstrong</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359146460290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 15:41:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>most gun nuts are sickos like Ted</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359146583430</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 15:43:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359146969448-142</Id><Topic><Title>Cisco Systems, Inc.

Investigators said 27-year-old Byaer Johnson apparently entered the home to visit his young daughter. At point, they say, he was asked to leave, then picked up his handgun and shot his daughter in the face. The girl was rushed to Cooper University Hospital where she is listed in critical but stable condition, according to CBS Philly. Authorities said the girl could suffer paralysis as a result of her injuries. Investigators say that after allegedly shooting his daughter, Johnson pointed the gun at a 28-year-old man in the home and pulled the trigger, but the weapon jammed. The man reportedly wrestled with Johnson, obtained his gun and then fired it at him, hitting Johnson in the buttocks. Police found Johnson running toward an apartment complex and took him into custody, CBS Philly reports. The 28-year-old man is not expected to be charged in the shooting attack. Johnson is being treated for his injury and is expected to be transferred to the Camden County Jail. He faces charges of criminal attempted murder and other weapons offenses.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359155002117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 18:03:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359155352334-159</Id><Topic><Title>Man uses gun to protect his 11 year old daughter</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359155002117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 18:03:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmmm.

You can't turn off the "free money" spigot now. Someone else will pay. It must be done slowly so as not to induce riots. The zombies won't even notice it over time. $4 gasoline is accepted now. No complaints. Blame your predecessor for everything that you cannot fix. Shout down the opposition as idiots. Bash the opposition for being obstructionist. Gradually rule by executive fiat due to "the crisis." Marginalize and eliminate opposition until you have assumed total control. Housing in decline. Joblessness. People nursing old cars.

In the 30-second commercial, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr. says personal safety is no longer a spectator sport. "I need you in the game," he says. "With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option," he adds. "You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back. ... Consider taking a certified safety course in handling a firearm so you can defend yourself until we get there."

The story said that after eating $208 worth of food at a fancy NYC restaurant, the Italian 'tourist' realized that he 'forgot' his wallet and offered his iphone as collateral when that failed he asked that a busboy from the restaurant follow him to get the money from the hotel room. From the way the story is written and the deceitful title, I'm presuming that yahoo wants sympathy for this guy. The more accurate title of the story should be tourist arrested for not paying his $208 restaurant bill. I frequently travel to foreign countries and always have my passport and wallet with me because spending money is a must as a tourist in a foreign country. I suspect this 'Italian tourist' (no passport was mentioned in yahoo story) was trying to get a free meal from this upscale restaurant and I suspect his shifty behavior caught the attention of the restaurant manager. The iphone that he offered could have been stolen. If this 'tourist' really wanted to payup he would have offered his passport as collateral. An upscale restaurant that is frequented by tourists is not stupid. If I were a manager who semi-believed this guy, I'd tell the guy that I'll let him go get the money if he'd give me his passport as collateral and I'd tell him that I'm going to verify with the hotel that the name on the passport is staying in a room at that hotel and hasn't checked out. But why bother with such nonsense when everyone else including other tourists has their wallet and pays their bill? The restaurant did the right thing by calling the cops who would file a report and verify the identity of this guy. No 'tourist' goes to an expensive restaurant for the first time without their wallet and passport unless they are trying to scam the restaurant. At a minimum stupidity has consequences.</Msg><Username>super_samoann</Username><Timestamp>1359171105535</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:31:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359171461611-178</Id><Topic><Title>YAHOO NEWSTORY -ITALIAN TOURIST ARRESTED FOR 'FORGETTING HIS WALLET'</Title><Username>super_samoann</Username><Timestamp>1359171105535</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:31:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I read the story and it seems that most of the bloggers expected the restaurant to give this 'Italian tourist' a free meal despite the fact that this 'tourist' did not have a passport. I agree that the restaurant did the right thing by calling the cops when the guy won't pay his $208 bill. In my opinion, nobody goes to expensive restaurants without their wallet unless they are trying to bum a free meal off the restaurant.</Msg><Username>giggling_democrat_hyeena</Username><Timestamp>1359171461611</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:37:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359171616758-179</Id><Title>California and Texas</Title><Msg>CALIFORNIA: The Governor of California is jogging with his dog along a nature trail. A Coyote jumps out and attacks his dog, then bites the Governor. 1. The Governor starts to intervene, but reflects upon the movie "Bambi", and realizes he should stop because the Coyote is only doing what is natural. 2. He calls animal control. Animal Control captures the Coyote and bills the State $500 testing it for diseases and $1,000 for relocating it. 3. He calls a veterinarian. The Vet collects the dead dog and bills the State $2,000 testing it for diseases. 4. The Governor goes to hospital and spends $3,500 getting checked for diseases from the coyote and on getting his bite wound bandaged. 5. The trail gets shut down for 6 months while the Dept. of Fish &amp; Game conducts a $100,000 survey to make sure the area is now free of dangerous animals. 6. The Governor spends $50,000 in state funds implementing a "Coyote awareness program" for residents of the area. 7. The State Legislature spends $2 million to study how to better treat rabies and how to permanently eradicate the disease throughout the world. 8. The Governor's security agent is fired for not stopping the attack. The State spends $200,000 to hire and train a new agent with additional special training on the nature of Coyotes. 9. PETA protests the Coyote's relocation and files a $100 million suit against the State. TEXAS: The Governor of Texas is jogging with his dog along a nature trail. A Coyote jumps out and attacks his dog. 1. The Governor shoots the coyote with his State-issued pistol and keeps jogging. The Governor has spent $0.50 on a .45 ACP hollow point cartridge. 2. The Buzzards eat the dead coyote. And that, my friends, is why California is broke and Texas is not.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1359171616758</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:40:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359172920357-180</Id><Title>DUMB.IVAN EATS PECKERMEAT</Title><Msg>tons and tons OF IT, he and juniorsassmate eat each others u c.
