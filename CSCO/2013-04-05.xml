"When he didn't like a film, he was honest; when he did, he was effusive — capturing the unique power of the movies to take us somewhere magical. "Even amidst his own battles with cancer, Roger was as productive as he was resilient — continuing to share his passion and perspective with the world. "The movies won't be the same without Roger, and our thoughts and prayers are with Chaz and the rest of the Ebert family."

As a kid I knew that McDonalds was not going to substantially improve my standard of living unless I became a franchise owner. There are lots of jobs that pay alot better than a McDonalds manager. So anyone of the minimum wage workers whose only ambition is to take orders or flip burgers and to be as lazy as possible for a lifetime and expect McDonalds to pay them the same salary as a surgeon or engineer is a moron and a fool. Of course I got trade school training in plumbing which paid alot better than McDonalds burger flipping with the intent of eventually owning my own plumbing company. Now I own my own plumbing business and I live very comfortable. To achieve a nice standard of living requires desire, drive, goals and alot of effort and work. It is not for lazy bums who have no skills, no drive, no desire, and expect everything handed to them for choosing to be a loser.</Msg><Username>wet_my_beak</Username><Timestamp>1365139263129</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 01:21:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365143631434-9</Id><Topic><Title>UNIONIZED FAST FOOD WORKERS STRIKE DEMAND WAGES BE DOUBLED IMMEDIATELY</Title><Username>citizens_against_toxic_waste</Username><Timestamp>1365138026641</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 01:00:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Undocumented Imigrant Janitors should be paid a minimum wage of $150 per hour plus one month of paid vacation every year plus 10 paid federal holidays every year plus employer pays for 50% of imigrants mortgage and utilities every month plus free health insurace every year which includes full dental, vision ect plus one month of sick leave every year which accumulates if not used.

On Monday, CCUR will unveil breakthrough technology that will allow cable TV companies to monetize the 6.8 billion annual free on demand video streams being watched worldwide. CCUR will allow them to insert targeted personalized video ads into free on demand videos "on the fly" while they are being streamed! CCUR is trading at very low valuation and could become a takeover target with #1 market share in video on demand (VOD) technology space! Time Warner Cable is now using the 6th generation of CCUR's technology. CCUR won Emmy Award for their "start over" technology that they deployed in the U.S. for Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House. Soon, CCUR will launch their patented cloud based network DVR technology that will eliminate the need for physical DVR devices and make them obsolete like VCRs. CCUR's business is about to boom as cable TV companies get ready to invest heavily to upgrade their infrastructure to support multi-screen video delivery. Virgin Media (VMED) the largest cable TV company in the UK with an enterprise value of $23 billion just announced that they are currently deploying CCUR's MediaHawk technology to support a new service called Virgin TV Anywhere, which will allow VMED's 3.8mm subscribers to watch on demand content from any location using their tablet, smartphone, or other IP connected device! CCUR's EPS is rapidly growing on a quarter-to-quarter basis and last quarter was up 100% from previous quarter and 300% from two quarters ago.</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1365165163142</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 08:32:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365165555686-21</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO strong sell</Title><Username>pn1409</Username><Timestamp>1365164383586</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 08:19:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>x-divy was yesterday.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1365165555686</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 08:39:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365165634681-22</Id><Title>Been telling you all that economy is in state of collapse</Title><Msg>Western financial system collapsed, and remains that way.

In recent decades, corporate tax revenue has plunged, falling from about 6 percent of gross domestic product in the 1950′s to less than 2 percent today, due to a proliferation of corporate tax breaks and the use of offshore tax havens. According to the Congressional Budget Office, in fact, corporate tax receipts as a share of corporate profits have hit their lowest point in 40 years: Corporate tax receipts as a share of profits are at their lowest level in at least 40 years. Total corporate federal taxes paid fell to 12.1% of profits earned from activities within the U.S. in fiscal 2011, which ended Sept. 30, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That’s the lowest level since at least 1972. And well below the 25.6% companies paid on average from 1987 to 2008.Tax avoidance from corporations and wealthy individuals has a cost for individual taxpayers and small businesses, according to a new report from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.

The Obama Administration has complete control over its prioritizing (canceling White House Tours), but avoided so to maximize political gain blaming republicans for any adverse effects: The resent Medicare reduction on coverage of Oncology Drugs, turning away seniors without chemotherapy treatment at cancer clinics. HHS's Kathleen Sebelius could have avoided this issue but decided to totally politicize it. 2) The recent payroll tax increase was the result of the TEMPORARY Social Security payroll tax reduction expiring 12/31/2012, of which BOTH sides of the political isle agreed to. The reset returns the Social Security withholding to its normal rate. Most economist agree that it is necessary to help the trust fund!!!!!!

The Common Core academic standards were both developed and adopted by the states, and they have widespread bipartisan support. GOP leaders like Jeb Bush and governors Mitch Daniels, Chris Christie, and Bill Haslam have supported the Common Core standards because they realize states must stop dummying down academic standards and lying about the performance of children and schools. In fact, South Carolina lowered the bar for proficiency in English and mathematics faster than any state in the country from 2005 to 2009, according to research by the National Center for Education Statistics. “That’s not good for children, parents, or teachers. I hope South Carolina lawmakers will heed the voices of teachers who supported South Carolina’s decision to stop lowering academic standards and set a higher bar for success. And I hope lawmakers will continue to support the state’s decision to raise standards, with the goal of making every child college- and career-ready in today’s knowledge economy.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365177654903</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:00:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365177672437-74</Id><Title>MORNING AFTER PILL made available to all ages</Title><Msg>no script. guess what liberals abortion is murder, rape is not an excuse and there is no war on women. what now dumb dumbs. liberals cant kill children anymore.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1365177672437</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:01:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365177728636-75</Id><Topic><Title>tea billies working to make sure kids are stupid enough to vote GOP</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365177654903</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:00:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maybe they can have filet minion?</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1365177728636</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:02:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365177863074-76</Id><Topic><Title>tea billies working to make sure kids are stupid enough to vote GOP</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365177654903</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:00:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wasn' t it mostly black democrats in Atlanta who were altering test scores and doing other illegal tricks to make money at the children's detriment??</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1365177863074</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:04:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365177904022-77</Id><Title>CSCO is one of the worst companies to try to contact Investor Relations see message</Title><Msg>I tried to call Investor Relations and all you get is a voice mail and they tell you they will get back to you in one business day.

They did nothing. Why should shareholders suffer becasuse another company is not doing well. It is also time that CSCO had a real investor relations department with live people who answer the phone.

Set aside the religious aspect of this ideology (The White Church supporting slavery), Black Liberation Theology promotes and concentrates the belief that capitalism is the root cause slavery, segregation, and black repression. The rise of BLT in the 1960's led many black leaders to become anti-capitalist marxist socialist, including the far left socialist beliefs of Martin Luther King. Obama's anger is from the mentoring he received from Bill Ayers and the teachings of Saul Alinsky ("Rules For Radicals"), he gives the appearance of anger but looks more like to be selective outrage or even phony outrage to achieve a political end.</Msg><Username>generic_erick</Username><Timestamp>1365178334373</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:12:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365178642738-82</Id><Topic><Title>tea billies working to make sure kids are stupid enough to vote GOP</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365177654903</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:00:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes I made a misspelling dead, happens let's review a few of yours flay around on Air force one plays round of golf with friends then off to NCAA game. aberham lincolon freed the slaves giveing + discusting + thing instead of think yes dead everyone makes some mistakes but you are a veritable moron when it comes to the english language</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365178642738</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:17:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365179680511-83</Id><Topic><Title>tea billies working to make sure kids are stupid enough to vote GOP</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365177654903</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:00:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Everybody misspells or makes typos,Dumb.But few take great delight in tee heeing others for those mistakes like you do.
