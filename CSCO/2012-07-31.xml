Transparency, Gitmo, Deficit reduction, jobs, uniting the country.

GW Bush inherited a recession and the Nasdaq bubble POP from Clinton, he endured 911, got through one of the worst natural disasters( Katrina ) , and he STILL average 5.3% UE for 8 years. I don't remember him constantly blaming everything else for what went wrong. For crying out loud Virtual, I think it's high time you guys stop making excuses and blaming the other guy and call it as it is. Obama says he inherited a mess, YET no one ever mentions the fact that HE was a US Senator and his party controlled congress for the last 2 years of Bush's 2nd term. How is EVERYTHING Bush's fault leading up to Obama when the Democrats controlled 2/3's of the country for 2007 and 2008. You are right, it's time for a little objectiveness.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1343736457164</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 08:07:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343736561073-8</Id><Title>Cisco closes NDS Acquisition</Title><Msg>Of all the silly companies Cisco has bought, I think this is one of the better ones.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1343736561073</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 08:09:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343737352700-9</Id><Topic><Title>you would think after the comments from Chambers, Cisco would trade above $16</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1343736239529</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 08:03:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think Chambers little interview on Fox News yesterday will give the stock a bit of a floor to rally from into earnings.

When the jury delivers a not guilty verdict, be ready for the resulting violence that will be headed our way when the apes don't get what they want. I'm wondering if the obaminator will push for this case to be adjudicated just before November 6th? This is as much an election gift to obama as was the housing market collapse of 07/08.

Instead, all I can say is: Oy, Mitt. Oy. Romney, as always, looked the part of President. But then he ad-libbed his way to insulting the British on the eve of the Olympics and, more seriously, denigrating the Palestinians in prepared remarks while in Israel. Flubbing a question on the London Games? Embarrassing, but no harm, no foul. In the tinderbox that is the Middle East, though, every careless spark runs the risk of doing lasting damage.” The Daily News in another item: “He's angered the Brits, infuriated the Palestinians, and now he’s going after the Russians. Globe-trotting GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was expected Tuesday to deliver a Cold War-type smackdown of the Russkies — and, by extension, President Obama — with a ‘value of liberty’ speech at Warsaw University.” The Guardian headlines that Romney is looking to “rekindle cold war spirit.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343753563615</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 12:52:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343753576578-50</Id><Topic><Title>To see the future of America and Obama care look</Title><Username>eagle1776321</Username><Timestamp>1343753208894</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 12:46:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>agree...gov cant even run itself and that is what they do. if a company had debt like the gov they would simply not exist.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1343753576578</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 12:52:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343753620210-51</Id><Topic><Title>mitt tells the world you can kiss my #$%$</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343753563615</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 12:52:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pukes like that, they wan't to see another war in the Middle East</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343753620210</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 12:53:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343753850477-52</Id><Topic><Title>mitt tells the world you can kiss my #$%$</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343753563615</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 12:52:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>war is part of mans nature...it is here to stay, liberals think they can play god and make people do what is not in their nature.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1343753850477</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 12:57:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343754007332-53</Id><Topic><Title>You have the right to protect yourself, most of the time</Title><Username>cages_are_the_enemy</Username><Timestamp>1343749144706</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 11:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>obama should worry about getting a budget passed. zimm case is just a way to distract us from the real problems we face.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1343754007332</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:00:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343754194442-54</Id><Topic><Title>Republcian Gov'nrs produce NO JOBS</Title><Username>pierre_narusse</Username><Timestamp>1343741353838</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:29:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>have you seen obamas job numbers? also make sure to look at them when he had the majority house.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1343754194442</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:03:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343755514161-55</Id><Title>Mitt kind of scary</Title><Msg>how he keeps shooting himself in the foot overseas, I'm starting to think McCain maybe right Palin is a better candidate then Mitt, but then again any retard with #$%$ is as good as Palin</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343755514161</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:25:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343755946504-56</Id><Title>CSCO deserves to be way higher</Title><Msg>Let us hope earnings on 15th will set the rally</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1343755946504</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:32:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343756212120-57</Id><Title>Cisco showing some relative strength</Title><Msg>3 decent days in a row and bucking the markets in the last 2.

"And as I come here, and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things." In the interview with Fox News, Romney played down his perceived gaffes during his foreign tour over the last week, including his comment to NBC News that he found London's Olympic preparations "disconcerting." He accused the media of being more interested in "finding something to write about" than focusing on real issues. "They'll instead try to find anything else to divert from the fact that these last four years have been tough years for our country," Mitt Romney said.

And it doesn't matter whether workers quit voluntarily or were laid off through no fault of their own. "Although it has long been theorized that the simple fact of being unemployed carries a stigma, the idea has never really been tested outside some studies by economists who have focused on the duration issue," said Geoffrey C. Ho, a doctoral candidate at the UCLA Anderson School of Management who co-authored the article. "We found bias against the jobless, among human-resource professionals as well as among the broader public, virtually from the outset of unemployment," Ho said....To illustrate "a psychological stigma against the unemployed," the new research paper's epigraph is a line from a piece Ben Stein wrote for the conservative American Spectator in 2010: "The people who have been laid off and cannot find work are generally people with poor work habits and poor personalities."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1343765721576</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 16:15:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343766014130-81</Id><Topic><Title>This won't help the Republican voters</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1343765721576</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 16:15:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More jibberish from the left.

Over the past 12 months, Cisco generated $11.2B in cash from operations and spent ~$1.1B in capex. Cisco also spent $4.2B in share repurchases and another $1.4B in dividends. After these financial commitments, Cisco has ~$4.5B annually left to increase its dividend payments over time. A dividend increase to 5.0% based on the current stock price would mean a quarterly dividend payment of $0.20, which would come out to a cash payment of ~$4.3B annually or an additional ~$2.9B, which is still less than the $4.5B in cash generated after capex, buybacks and current levels of dividend payments. We do, however, recognize that cash generation does not all result in domestic cash and Cisco does have to manage its onshore and offshore cash.</Msg><Username>for_the_idiots</Username><Timestamp>1343774354386</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 18:39:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343774392643-94</Id><Topic><Title>Has the Obama White House released any secrets lately?</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1343773147597</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 18:19:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even Dem Dianne Feinstein, chairman of the Senate intelliigence committe said Obama needs to come to terms with the fact that someone in his administration is leaking sensitive information.

Ted Cruz election sends a wakeup call to those who didn't get it when Scott Walker beat the Unions, when Sen. Luger lost his seat, and when all the others Palin and Demint backed won recent elections. All Rino's must be quaking in there underwear that they won't be challenged in a primary by the Tea Party Patriots.

These are hilarious posts. If only they were true and we COULD move all Democrats into work camps to help them learn the virtue of discipline, hard work, honest labor and the smart, sharp pain of the horse whip as it lashes across their boney shoulders to help them remember the bad old days and how good they have it then!!!!</Msg><Username>schnitlerbeim</Username><Timestamp>1343791029107</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 23:17:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343791373793-112</Id><Topic><Title>only in bird brains rabbit hole</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343790919170</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 23:15:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you Ivan! It is good to get accolades from those who fear and respect you, even though you do disagree most disagreeably. Still and all, you are a good and decent man and will make a great potato harvester! Get those back muscles limbered up, since Romney will need millions of you guys working all across Idaho for the good of our great nation. We'll have a rough time the first two years, since Obimbo has it so screwed up, so to make sure you Democrats have a warm place to sleep and lots of food on the table, we will generously provide all you need for 5-10 years, depending on your tax payments. If you've paid no taxes for the past four years, you'll do at least 10 years of potato work, maybe 15. If you have paid some taxes, you might get out of the potato fields in 5 years and moved to the lovely tropical island of Cuba!!! Where we will be running their sugar cane production using over weight Democrats, as part of our new healthcare law. Obesity is a major problem and it's been discovered that only a few years in a sugar plantation, on Democrat rations, CURES OBESITY..!!! and we love you, and we know what's best for you. Obimbo pretends to know, be we REALLY KNOW!!! just what's best for you, like Michelle Obimbo wants you to eat more veggies....we don't care what you eat!!! As long as you work your 18 hour shift hauling sugar cane, and hacking with those dull machetes we provide...don't want you to cut your self!!!....WE KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU!!!!!</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1343791373793</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 23:22:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343791456036-113</Id><Topic><Title>Ted Cruz wins Palin wins 7 out of 7</Title><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1343784093221</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 21:21:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cruz now has 60 percent of the vote and more.
