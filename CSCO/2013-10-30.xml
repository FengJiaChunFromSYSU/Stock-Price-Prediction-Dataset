Many of those people got those high deductible plans because of their low premiums. They got them because that was all they could afford. Anyone with two brain cells and an attention span that longer than a fruit fly knows that aside from the 60 or so million Americans who were uninsured there was another equally large group of people who were UNDERINSURED by these #$%$ plans the ACA has deemed unfit. Insurance or rather QUALITY insurance was for roughly 1/3 of our population simply unaffordable. So millions of Americans will be booted off their #$%$ insurance plans and will be forced to buy a plan from an exchange which will have better benefits and very likely will get govt subsidies to help pay for a portion of those plans. Better AND more affordable plans (once subsidies are factored in).

Now instead of paying hundreds to thousands per month and having a deductible also in the thousands while having a plan that barely covers anything people will now have the opportunity to get better coverage. It’s outrageous is what it is. Under the new health law, health insurance companies are being forced to use the money for coverage instead of profit. President Obama obviously hates insurance company CEOs and American citizens’ right to be screwed over.Free Wood Post caught up with a few outraged citizens: “My current health plan is being dropped and now I’m forced to find a new plan,” said Judy Forrestsmith. “Before I was paying $1500 per month with a $5000 deductible and barely any prescriptions covered, and now this president made it so I have preventative coverage included, prescription benefits, I can’t be denied, I get a subsidy to pay for my care, there’s no cap on coverage, and I won’t have to file for bankruptcy if something happens to me. I mean really, who does he think he is? What if I want to pay those insurance companies $18,000 per year, $5000 more out-of-pocket, and be denied coverage if I seem too expensive? Now I don’t have that choice!” Edgar Millonsty said, “All I want is to have the ability to be denied again and pay way more than I receive back in coverage. Is that too much to ask? I’m getting really tired of this dictatorship telling me I should be paying less and receiving more. It’s just undercover Marxism.” “First they’ll make sure we have health care then what’s next, maintaining our voting rights? Allowing homosexuals to be seen as equal and not get taxed more? Use money for education instead of war?” said Larry Belittleton. ” I can’t believe we would have a president who cares more about the people than profit. It sickens me.” The new health care law going into effect has people who enjoy being screwed over extraordinarily angry, and they should be. Now, with health insurance companies being forced to actually provide coverage people will no longer just be throwing their money away and padding the pockets of insurance company CEOs’ pockets.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1383137762686</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 08:56:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383138136519-11</Id><Topic><Title>best markets ever under obama</Title><Username>juniors_a_genius</Username><Timestamp>1383137247659</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 08:47:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too bad for your logic that Obama has nothing to do with it.

The last nine times that Virginia voters selected a new governor, they went against the party in the White House. So during the Clinton years, the Old Dominion elected Republicans George Allen and Jim Gilmore; during the George W. Bush years, they voted for Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. And four years ago, with Barack Obama living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, they tapped Republican Bob McDonnell. Barring an unforeseen cataclysm, they will break that streak, and decisively. With less than two weeks before Election Day, polls show Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli, the commonwealth's attorney general, fading against Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe. Yes, that Terry McAuliffe – the Beltway hack Clinton fundraiser whose inescapable grinning visage during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries conjured up memories of Cesar Romero's Joker from the 1960s series, "Batman." At a time when Virginia has ascended to the ranks of the critical swing states – it went for Obama in 2008 and 2012 after voting for the GOP candidate the 10 previous elections in a row – the problems facing the state's Republican Party mirror those of the national party. "What's happened is a microcosm nationally," says Tom Davis, a Republican former member of Congress who now lobbies for Deloitte. "We took a red state, turned it into a purple state and are turning it into a Democratic rout." [Check out U.S. News Weekly, an insider's guide to politics and policy.] This is a problem with which Davis is intimately familiar and has long foreseen. A moderate Republican – he now heads the centrist Republican Main Street Partnership – with an encyclopedic knowledge of congressional districts and the political landscape both nationally and in Virginia, he has been chastised by the hard right as a "RINO" (that's movement conservative</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1383144035388</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 10:40:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383144077752-33</Id><Topic><Title>Missing morons.</Title><Username>qenuine_juniorsclasmate</Username><Timestamp>1383140929921</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 09:48:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL Love it!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>qenuine_juniorsclasmate</Username><Timestamp>1383144077752</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 10:41:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383144198059-34</Id><Topic><Title>Missing morons.</Title><Username>qenuine_juniorsclasmate</Username><Timestamp>1383140929921</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 09:48:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They all showed up,except alsmith.lolololololol He'll be here soon probably.lololololol What an idiot!!!!!</Msg><Username>qenuine_juniorsclasmate</Username><Timestamp>1383144198059</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 10:43:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383144250057-35</Id><Topic><Title>woopsie</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1383144035388</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 10:40:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"RINO" (that's movement conservative for "Republican In Name Only") as he has warned that the party has become too beholden to its extremes. "I hate to say, the day of reckoning is here," he says. "I hope we use this as a learning moment." The day of reckoning indeed. The Virginia governor's race is a perfect illustration of what happens when a party's crank wing – in the GOP's case the tea party zealots currently running the show – gets too much power. Start with the candidate: Cuccinelli has earned a reputation as a tea party darling and conservative crusader. He was the first attorney general to file suit against Obamacare and a vocal opponent of a path to citizenship in immigration ("I no longer consider [George W. Bush] the head of my Republican Party," he wrote back in 2007 when that president tried to pass an immigration reform bill). He has supported a "personhood" bill which would declare that life begins at fertilization (making all abortions murder and possibly illegalizing some forms of birth control) and has declared the Environmental Protection Agency an "agency of mass destruction." And voters have noticed. A Washington Post/Abt-SRBI poll released yesterday found that 54 percent of likely voters believe Kuccinelli is too conservative. Similarly a Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that 51 percent of likely Virginia voters believe Cuccinelli to be "too conservative" to be governor. "Enough Virginians decided that Ken Cuccinelli is an unacceptable choice to be governor, and Terry McAuliffe is just the lucky bloke facing off against him," says Geoffrey Skelley from the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. As if to drive home Cuccinelli's right wing bona fides, the party – working through a convention instead of a primary process, thus guaranteeing a more conservative slate – nominated a candidate for lieutenant governor who is arguably even further out there.

With 55.38 million shares outstanding - GRO received $0.15 per share in cash from its PGW investment this past year! PGW.NZ is now projecting a large earnings increase this year and said they will continue paying out cash dividends every six months that will increase/decrease based on earnings/cash flow. In fiscal 2013, PGW.NZ earned EPS excluding non-cash writedowns of NZ$0.02 and free cash flow of NZ$0.042 per share. PGW.NZ dividend of NZ$0.032 per share equaled 76% of free cash flow. This fiscal year, analysts project PGW.NZ to double EPS to $0.04. If PGW.NZ's free cash flow also increases by NZ$0.02 to NZ$0.062 and PGW.NZ pays out 76% of free cash flow in dividends once again, PGW.NZ could pay NZ$0.047 per share in dividends and if so - GRO would receive $12 million or USD$0.22 per share in cash from PGW! With GRO currently $1.30, it's trading for only 5.9X the cash they will likely receive this year from PGW! A fair valuation would likely be 10-15X projected USD$0.22 per share in cash to be received this year from its PGW.NZ dividends - for a share price of $2.20 to $3.30! Disclaimer: We own 550,000 shares of GRO and intend to sell these shares once GRO reaches much higher prices.</Msg><Username>raifdfn</Username><Timestamp>1383144276142</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 10:44:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383144291451-37</Id><Topic><Title>Missing morons.</Title><Username>qenuine_juniorsclasmate</Username><Timestamp>1383140929921</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 09:48:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i bet you do queenie joe ROTF!!</Msg><Username>juniors_a_genius</Username><Timestamp>1383144291451</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 10:44:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383144310247-38</Id><Topic><Title>Missing morons.</Title><Username>qenuine_juniorsclasmate</Username><Timestamp>1383140929921</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 09:48:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Missing morons Where are Junior, Dumb,alsmith, and all the Magoos this morning.

But I'm not an obsessive, stalking pile of poo like you are, BAGGER. 24 hours. I doubt you will be able to do it. Think about your life. You now claim after all of the lies about your financial wealth, and it turned out you had no stock, no savings, no nothing, but an overblown mortgage, when you bought a house at the peak of the bubble. Haha your timing always sucks. Like your new life as an almost street bum, you're that near the street. Do you WANT to be out in the street, BAGGER? And by-the-way, you stupid, obsessive, #$%$. If someone responds to one of the stupid FB comments you make? It doesn't mean they expect you to obsessively reply to that single comment ten times, adding thought after thought. Nobody gives a sheet about it, and it was just some other loser who you know being nice. I own you. On your feet, or in the street, or on the beat. Anywhere. On a basketball court, on a tennis court, in a court of law, anywhere. PUNK. Obsess now but time for you to learn. 24 hours.

Bush and talk about renewing the controversial USA Patriot Act. Several provisions of the act, passed in the shell shocked period immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, caused enough anger that liberal groups like the American Civil Liberties Union had joined forces with prominent conservatives like Phyllis Schlafly and Bob Barr to oppose renewal. GOP leaders told Bush that his hardcore push to renew the more onerous provisions of the act could further alienate conservatives still mad at the President from his botched attempt to nominate White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. “I don’t give a #$%$,” Bush retorted. “I’m the President and the Commander-in-Chief. Do it my way.” “Mr. President,” one aide in the meeting said. “There is a valid case that the provisions in this law undermine the Constitution.” “Stop throwing the Constitution in my face,” Bush screamed back. “It’s just a #$%$ piece of paper!” I’ve talked to three people present for the meeting that day and they all confirm that the President of the United States called the Constitution “a #$%$ piece of paper.” And, to the Bush Administration, the Constitution of the United States is little more than toilet paper stained from all the @#$% that this group of power-mad despots have dumped on the freedoms that “#$%$ piece of paper” used to guarantee. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, while still White House counsel, wrote that the “Constitution is an outdated document.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1383155050814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 13:44:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383155482429-119</Id><Title>Thank you blacks who voted for Obama because he is half-black!</Title><Msg>You've really hurt yourself while making me wealthier!

Though I have no idea as to the factual accuracy of the matters presented in gfo99's post, I do know that both parties have largley abandoned constitutional principles in favor of expediency where it has benefited them politically to do so. Don't get me wrong. I do realize that the progressive/liberal effort to dismantle the Constitution has been far more systematic and longer lasting than the relatively fewer and more isolated instances where Republicans have been the culprit. But it is undeniable that, at this point in time, the problem of Constitutional disrespect has no party boundaries.</Msg><Username>raouldesvernine</Username><Timestamp>1383155852871</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 13:57:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383155952390-123</Id><Topic><Title>Thank you blacks who voted for Obama because he is half-black!</Title><Username>crybaby_blacks</Username><Timestamp>1383155482429</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 13:51:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I voted for the Black Obama, I think he would even more likeable if he dyed his hair blonde.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1383155952390</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 13:59:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383156030970-124</Id><Topic><Title>We already know what Hillary thinks of the disastrous 0bamacare rollout...</Title><Username>proconsul_gallio</Username><Timestamp>1383155546344</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 13:52:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can always count on you for something really stupid.lololololol</Msg><Username>juniorsuckslittleboys</Username><Timestamp>1383156030970</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 14:00:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383156360635-125</Id><Topic><Title>We already know what Hillary thinks of the disastrous 0bamacare rollout...</Title><Username>proconsul_gallio</Username><Timestamp>1383155546344</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 13:52:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I visit several boards.All have some idiots on them but Junior is far and away the worst.

With less than a week left in the New Jersey senate race, Republican Steve Lonegan is 12 points behind Cory Booker but that didn’t stop Lonegan from saying the following. “When I win, Obama will fold. [...] My victory in this election on Wednesday will send a message to Barack Obama, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi that the American people want an end to Obamacare and the rest of the President’s radical agenda,” said Lonegan. “Republicans need to hold firm because seven days from today when Bob Menendez escorts me down the Senate aisle for my swearing in, the message about what our party should do will be clear for all.” The relevant thing to note here is that Lonegan got ‘Barack Obama’, ‘Harry Reid’, ‘Nancy Pelosi’, ‘Obamacare’ and ‘radical agenda’ all into the same sentence. This is important because when addressing right-wing loons, there is no need to bring up real ideas on how to solve the big problems. A little trash talk on how you’ll take down Obamacare by your mere presence in the Senate and a mention of Obama, Reid and Pelosi as dangerous individuals out to destroy your beloved country and you’ve made your little Fox-bots content and secure. Poll numbers indicating that Lonegan will be crushed next Wednesday by Booker can be conveniently ignored…as can every other fact that messes with a winger’s narrative. Very much like Republicans who believed that their internal polls showed Romney defeating Obama last November, Lonegan has his own internal poll numbers that have him edging out Booker. And once that happens, well hey, the dynamics on the shutdown and Obamacare will shift dramatically. President Obama and Reid will no doubt relent, get down on their knees and repeal the Affordable Care Act rather than have to deal with the mighty and invincible Steve Lonegan in the Senate. And that’s how it’s going down next Wednesday…if not in everyone’s mind, at least in Steve Lonegan’s.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1383156889693</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 14:14:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383156987749-127</Id><Topic><Title>We already know what Hillary thinks of the disastrous 0bamacare rollout...</Title><Username>proconsul_gallio</Username><Timestamp>1383155546344</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 13:52:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior is a lonely loser .

LOL In an opinion piece titled "Our choice for governor in 2013: None of the above," the Richmond Times-Dispatch said it could not "in good conscience endorse a candidate for governor." The Times-Dispatch has a history of endorsing Republicans to win Virginia's Executive Mansion and endorsed Mitt Romney for President in 2012. But the paper criticized Cuccinelli, the state's attorney general, for his stances on social issues, specifically citing his opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. "[Cuccinelli] pursues his divisive agenda with a stridency that was unbecoming in an attorney general and would be unbecoming in a governor," the paper wrote.
