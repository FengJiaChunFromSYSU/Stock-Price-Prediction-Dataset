According to the University of Chicago's General Social Survey, in 1977, 54% of American households had guns. By 2010, the number had fallen to 32%. Yet gun sales are at record highs. That means that existing gun owners are buying more and more guns. It's not enough to have a hunting rifle over your mantle; you need an entire arsenal, just in case the government falls, society disintegrates, and you have to protect your cave -- sorry, your home -- from the marauding hordes. That's exactly what the gun manufacturers want you to think, so you keep buying. They know that hunting will never again be the pastime it once was, and as more Americans move from rural areas to the suburbs and cities, their natural market withers. Opinion: The case for gun rights is stronger than you think That "responsible gun owner" politicians talk about, the one who reverentially passes down to his son the bolt-action rifle his father gave him? That guy isn't good for business. The manufacturers need the other guy, the one who fears he may not be all the man he could be. Whenever that anxiety gets to be too much, he can go down to the gun store and buy another gun, and another, and a few more after that. He'll get thousands of rounds of ammunition too, because you never know what might happen. Then he'll go home and nod with satisfaction at his own little armory, telling himself that when the time comes for him to become the hero of his own action movie, he'll be ready. He's got his Man Card. And maybe he needs one or two more guns. Just to be sure.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1356074445107</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 02:20:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356074891368-8</Id><Title>WHEN ARE WE GOING TO DECLARE ADAM LANZA A MUSLIM ?</Title><Msg>You know he had to be, or so goes Faux News</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1356074891368</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 02:28:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356076558622-9</Id><Title>STIGLITZ CALLS BERNANKE A THIEVING JOOHW</Title><Msg>Deepak Narula’s mortgage-bond fund is up 39 percent this year.

And then the president's going to be the savior...If we go over the fiscal cliff, the president just comes back and says, 'Okay, we're going to give tax cuts to everybody under $250,000.' Who's going to vote against that? Everybody'll vote for thatl! Everybody! Because it will be just a fait accompli. You won't be voting on whether you're going to do away with a tax cut, you're going to be reimposing tax cuts for everybody under $250,000. So the Republicans are in an untenable situation. Either we do something that's gonna help the economy...or the president just says, well, those guys, those Republicans are just killing everything. They're gonna make taxes go up on 98 percent of people and then he comes back in 3 or 4 weeks when he gives his state of the union message and says I'm going to reimpose those tax cuts, and then if the economy goes to hell, everyone's going to say, 'It's those Republicans.'"

Plan B, which would only raise tax rates on incomes over $1 million (giving 0.3 percent of households an average tax cut of $50,000,) falls far short of the revenue goals laid out by the White House at the outset of negotiations. As a result, President Obama has said that he will veto the bill if it gets to his desk — which it likely won’t, because Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has called it a “pointless political stunt” that won’t even get to the Senate floor for a vote. Nonetheless, earlier today House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said the Republicans have the votes to pass the plan, which he insists is the “nation’s best option.” But according to the poll, the majority of Americans disagree with Rep. Cantor. Not only do 53 percent of Americans say the GOP’s policies are too extreme — up 17 points from two years ago — but an equal 53 percent believe that the Republicans need to compromise more than the Democrats by giving up more of the proposals they support. Plan B is a perfect example of the type of plan that respondents to the poll panned; as the Washington Post‘s Greg Sargent points out, in the last election voters rejected the ideas in the proposal, which he says “simply repackages a range of conservative ideas that would redistribute wealth upwards” by retaining large estate tax cuts and blocking limits for itemized deductions on the wealthy. If Boehner and Obama cannot reach a compromise and the country goes off the “fiscal cliff,” the CNN/ORC poll finds that 48 percent of Americans would blame the Republicans in Congress, up three points from a month ago. Just 37 percent would blame President Obama. Additionally, Obama is personally far more popular than Boehner; the poll shows the president’s job approval at 52 percent, compared to Speaker Boehner’s 34 percent approval rating. The poll did have some good news for Republicans; it shows that a slight majority of 51 percent want the GOP to keep control of the House. However, it is important to note that in the last election Democrats won the popular vote for House seats, but Republicans kept control because following their 2010 victory, they gerrymandered key states by taking advantage of the post-census redistricting that takes place once every 10 years.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1356090182279</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 06:43:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356091089736-16</Id><Title>CSCO would certainly come to be the ticker to pay attention to this month.</Title><Msg>Has any person looked over the articles being released?

Most households has some sort of budget, even if its one you keep in your head. Maybe congress in this case the Democrat Led Senate who should address entitlements and getting some of those 50% ers to pay some taxes. The rich taxes Obama proposed come to 2 days worth of expenses to keep the Federal government spending going. Just Obama picking of his friends the rich, because the American people buy into his class warfare propaganda. I think everyone should take less entitlements, and I would be for a broad based tax increase once the government spending and waste is cut. Also, lets bring home the troops from Europe and Asia, that have been there since WWII. We should cut foreign aid, the UN and stop acting like this is the Regal USA, we are now 16 trillion in debt and can't pay our bills.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1356113254108</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 13:07:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356113302143-126</Id><Topic><Title>why put cops in the schools?</Title><Username>rationalthought11</Username><Timestamp>1356112404557</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 12:53:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PS, if it's a man, aim for his peter.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1356113302143</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 13:08:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356113322050-127</Id><Topic><Title>JUNIOR'SASSMATE refer to Rational As the "North Pole" And Dumb as the "South Pole" cuz</Title><Username>mrjasongayby</Username><Timestamp>1356113059497</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 13:04:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior loves squatting right in the middle of a bukake circle with his mouth wide open!!!!!</Msg><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1356113322050</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 13:08:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356113330490-128</Id><Title>Hey Lets Ban schools, if the kids were not at school this would not have happened</Title><Msg>Obviously the problem is not assault weapons, the ""problem is schools""", SO the answer must be more assault weapons for everyone and no schools for anyone.</Msg><Username>frankleyfeed</Username><Timestamp>1356113330490</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 13:08:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356113484464-129</Id><Topic><Title>why put cops in the schools?</Title><Username>rationalthought11</Username><Timestamp>1356112404557</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 12:53:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior loves to yank his crank in the bushes at an elementary school.

There are over 300 million guns owned in America, so getting one illegally is not a problem if you want to bad enough. The statistics John Lott has in his books prove states like CT. with tuff gun laws have more crime than places where its easy to carry. Criminals are not in data bases, don't care about laws, won't obey them. People with mental illnesses, don't care about laws, won't obey them. Only having someone around with a weapon to shoot them down to protect the general populace makes sense.

Of course, the NRA opposes them. The National Rifle Association (NRA) is calling on its membership to help repeal a 1989 law that created the Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP). A state-of-the-art database that is second to none in the nation, the VFTP works in conjunction with the FBI’s National Instant Background Checks System (NICS) to check the background of those purchasing firearms in the Commonwealth of Virginia [...] In an August 18 alert to its members, the NRA described the VFTP as “obsolete and unnecessary.” [...] This is not the first time the NRA has attempted to undermine the background check system for firearm purchasers. After the Brady Act was signed in 1994, the NRA funded lawsuits in nine different states that sought to have the law struck down as unconstitutional. The NRA argued that states could not be compelled to submit records to the federal background check system maintained by the FBI. The Supreme Court agreed with that principle, but rejected the NRA’s argument that “the whole statute must be voided.” In large part because of this litigation, millions of records are missing today from NICS that otherwise would be stopping dangerous individuals from buying guns. Sixty-three percent of Americans support banning assault rifles, only 32 oppose. That includes a majority of conservatives and gun owners. But of course, the NRA is opposed. Sixty-nine percent of Americans support banning internet sales of guns and ammo. The NRA is financially vested in such sales. Seventy-six percent of Americans support closing the gun-show loophole, only 19 percent oppose. Seventy-one percent of conservatives agree. Logically, the NRA sits with the 19 percent fringe. Only five percent of Americans oppose banning gun ownership for convicted violent felons. Naturally, the NRA sits with that five percent fringe. Heck, they're even okay with potential terrorists buying and owning guns! Sixty-four percent of Americans support banning magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, including a majority of conservatives and gun owners. Too bad the NRA opposes that too.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356130842701</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 18:00:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356130952950-207</Id><Topic><Title>Obama to talk about Fiscal cliff at 5pm</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1356125259224</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 16:27:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Low T.

"The last thing we need are the George Zimmermans of the world patrolling our schools," said Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center, referring to the neighborhood watch volunteer charged with killing unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Florida.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356132157833</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 18:22:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356132314347-218</Id><Topic><Title>NRA so far out of touch</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356130842701</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 18:00:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The NRA sounds as bad as liberal newspapers.

Emerson, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded in 2001 that:[41] there are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used to describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or 'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of themselves [or 'himself'] and the state,' or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service.
