"They also want to block grant Medicaid and cut it by an third over the coming ten years... Lot of folks don’t know it, but nearly two-thirds of Medicaid is spent on nursing home care for Medicare seniors who are eligible for Medicaid." With the huge cuts Romney and Ryan imagine, seniors -- possibly millions of seniors -- will kicked out of the convalescent homes they're currently in or denied long-term coverage. When Romney and Ryan say their Medicare plan doesn't affect anyone over 55, they're floating a fantasy. But if they make that claim about their Medicaid cuts, they're simply lying.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1347195935512</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 09:05:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347196493058-4</Id><Title>How's that DOMA working out fer ya?</Title><Msg>Vermont Joins States' Challenge to DOMA MONTPELIER, Vt. — Vermont's attorney general has joined Connecticut and New York in asking a federal appeals court to rule that the law defining marriage as between a man and a woman is unconstitutional. Attorney General William Sorrell said Friday that the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA, deprives same-gender couples of federal benefits and unfairly discriminates against them. The three states filed their briefs in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. "These married couples -- our friends and neighbors in Vermont -- have every right to fair and equal treatment by the federal government," Sorrell said in a statement. "Instead, they are denied Social Security benefits, tax exemptions, and health and retirement benefits." Sorrell said Vermont, New York and Connecticut, all states where gay marriage is legal, filed a brief in a case brought by a New York woman who had to pay $350,000 in estate taxes when her partner died. New York had joined the case in 2011. The federal government said last year it would stop defending DOMA. Several federal judges have ruled the law is unconstitutional, including one in Massachusetts. In June, a U.S. district judge in New York said DOMA's effort to define marriage is illegal because it intrudes upon the states' business of regulating domestic relations. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. Maryland and Washington state have public votes on gay marriage this fall. Voters in Maine also will address the issue in November, three years after a referendum overturned a gay marriage law passed by the Maine Legislature. And in Minnesota, voters will decide on a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage there. The political parties took stands on laws barring same-sex marriages in platforms adopted at their recent national conventions. The Democratic platform supports the movement to get equal treatment under the law for same-gender couples. The Republican platform affirms the rights of states and the federal government not to recognize same-sex marriage. It also backs a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. © Copyright 2012 The Associated Press.

Why didn't he do so. Well he knew it would be felt more in the middle class getting $4000 tax increases, and it would tank the fragile economy. He didn't do it also, because he knew his ignorant lefties like Virg , goo and babycakes, would rally to him if he just said the name Bush anything. Now Obama doesn't talk about repealing the Bush tax cuts, he says Romney wants to raise taxes. Well Obie its either your desire to raise taxes $4k or some ficticious Romney tax increase. Romney lowered taxes and balanced every budget in Mass. and he started with deficits. Romney never raised taxes, he just didn't flap his lips, he has a record of lowering taxes. Obama has a record of stealing $716 billion from medicare, and running up $5 trillion more debt. If there is any reason to raise taxes its because Dems won't pass any budget, won't come up with one of their own and spend money they don't have like a degenerate gambler at a casino.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1347215053575</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 14:24:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347216525742-36</Id><Topic><Title>At this point Gallup had Carter beating Reagan</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1347165983356</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 00:46:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny,Magoo,last week when Obama was down in the polls you didn't say that.

Bush’s right-hand man and now is a top political adviser to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. R. Glenn Hubbard and Greg Mankiwled Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. Now they are Mr. Romney’s economic brain trusts. The same can be said for his foreign policy team, where Mr. Romney boasts a number of faces from the Bush old guard, including former CIA Director Michael V. Hayden and former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. Today, they are the former Massachusetts governor’s go-to guys on counterterrorism. Mr. Romney’s corps of advisers, in fact, is heavily salted with figures who surrounded the 43rd president as he watched over massive increases in federal spending, the creation of more government programs and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the nation-building efforts that followed. These moves helped give life to the tea party movement’s battle cry of limited government that has reshaped the political landscape. The choices threaten to complicate Mr. Romney’s vow on the campaign trail to lead the nation on “a different course, a new course unlike any of our past,” and appear to play into the message that President Obama is touting on the stump: that Mr. Romney wants to drag the nation back to the era of deregulation and trickle-down economic thinking that sparked the financial crises in the first place. “There are a couple of new faces, but not nearly as many as there should be,” Republican strategist Michael McKenna said. “The terrible thing is that [Mr. Romney] is helping Obama make his case: ‘Hey, we are going back to the Bush administration.’ “ The danger for Mr. Romney is that he risks reminding voters too much of the days of the former president, who oversaw major defeats for his party in the 2006 and 2008 elections and who left office with an approval rating of 22 percent in the final CBS/New York Times poll of his presidency. The bitterness has not abated. In a CNN/ORC poll, 57 percent said Mr. Bush and other Republicans are more responsible for the nation’s economic woes, while 29 percent said Mr. Obama and other Democrats bear the blame.

(AP) — If President Barack Obama was looking for a lift in Florida, he got one from Scott Van Duzer. The 46-year-old, six-foot-three Republican gave Obama a bear hug, raising him off the ground as Obama marveled at the man's strength — and enthusiasm. Van Duzer owns the Big Apple Pizza and Pasta Italian Restaurant where Obama stopped on Sunday during a Florida bus swing. He also runs a foundation that helps collect blood for the ill; he has received White House commendations for his work. As he entered, Obama admired Van Duzer's biceps, saying "Look at these guns!" Said Obama: "The guy's just got a big heart, along with big pecs." Of his embrace, Van Duzer said: "I was overwhelmed when I saw him." He said Obama had his vote.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347227363414</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 17:49:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347228650872-55</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's team is the same team Bush W had</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347225688224</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 17:21:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I once watch NBC but as the Liberal Press goes I got elsewhere.
