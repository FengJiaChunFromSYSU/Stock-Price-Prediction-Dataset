The only voters that will matter to Congress are young people and young illegal aliens who will be paying most of the income taxes. If you took 100% of a young persons paycheck it would not be enough to pay for retiree social security checks for all the baby boomers. Most of these young people will riot if they are forced to pay all the $60 trillion dollars of "I owe you's" that the Congress has put in the social security trust fund after Congress stole all the social security money from people who worked their entire lives paying into social security. These future retirees have unfortunately outlived their usefullness as congresses piggy bank. It is impossible to pay back all the "I owe you's" and Congress will be perfectly happy to tell future retirees "sorry but we dont have the money to pay you the social security you are owed". Democrats desperately want to import enough illegal aliens, give the illegals welfare and give them amnesty so they can vote democrat. GOP wants to be a watered down democrats and are beginning to see that future illegal alien votes will be important to them as well. Illegal aliens will replace retirees as the most important voting block for both parties.</Msg><Username>black_congressional_cacas</Username><Timestamp>1355807904155</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 00:18:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355808819813-2</Id><Title>Guns..change of heart..used to be on the fence</Title><Msg>Until Friday, I was on the fence.

An assault rifle, used by a person, that guns down 6 year olds! Are you kidding me? Assault rifle ban, high volume clip ban, semi automatic weapon ban. What are these gun nuts arguing for? Some whack paranoid crazed idea that they have to "defend"themselves from the government? They will be put in concentration camps if they vote the wrong way or support the wrong people?Ok, Ok...Ivan should be put in a re-education camp, but besides that.... Sick, sick, sicko.

We hear the staccato bursts of semi-automatic fire echoing off the walls of a supposed place of safety. We register not only the terror but the bewilderment on the faces of tiny survivors as they are marched, hands on the shoulders of kids in front of them, from the grounds of Sandy Hook Elementary School. Last week's Newtown, Conn. massacre reminds us that America is emphatically not, as President Obama and the rest of us would wish it to be, "better than this." Indeed, we are the only First World nation that has routinized a failed response to gun violence -- weak, craven, ineffectual. It's not that other parts of the world are immune from "rampage violence." It's just that when it does happen those other countries tend to take action, while the U.S. dithers, continuing to far outstrip the rest of the developed world in rates of mass murder. In keeping with a tradition of both public and private grieving, we light our candles and gather to weep with others on street corners and in houses of worship. We cry tears into the sink as we rinse out our coffee mugs, or transfer clothes from washer to dryer. We write editorials, such as this one, bemoaning the "gun culture," inadequate laws and controls, and our society's failure to help, or at least protect us from, those suffering dangerous forms of mental illness. Then, for those of us who did not lose our own children, we return inexorably to the habits of daily living. With absolutely nothing accomplished. We are in denial about our duty to stop gun violence. We're awed by what we perceive to be the power of the National Rifle Association, and the political clout of those members of congress whose loyalty has been purchased by the NRA. So we wait. We wait for the next slaughter, knowing it will surely come. Nothing has changed, nothing will change. Not unless we resolve to become, in the president's aspirational words, "better than this." How do we accomplish that? Through repeal of the Second Amendment, and the enactment of a new constitutional amendment. The Second Amendment -- elevated to a state of holiness, its problematic comma debated for decades and "resolved," for the moment, by the Supreme Court -- is a relic. It made sense when it was written. It does not make sense now. What would a new "right to bear arms" amendment look like? If I were writing it, it would contain provisions for: • Registration of all firearms; • Licensing of all gun owners, predicated on completion of a background check and a passing score in a reputable gun-safety course; • Safe and secure storage and transport of all firearms; • Criminal and civil penalties for owners whose guns have fallen negligently into the hands of violent felons, minors, the mentally ill; • Ban on all assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, except for those possessed by the military and law enforcement; • Ban on so-called "armor-piercing" handgun bullets; • The elimination of the infamous gun-show loophole in the Brady bill. Seven years ago I included a chapter in my book, Breaking Rank, entitled, "Getting a Grip on Guns." I wrote then that Senator Barry Goldwater had argued some 35 years earlier against gun control because "it would take 50 years to get rid of [them]." I'm not advocating getting rid of guns. I'm talking about controlling them. Robustly, effectively. Imagine how far down the road, how much safer -- how much more free -- our country would be if we had committed to sensible gun control measures when Goldwater made that statement. We enacted alcohol prohibition through a constitutional amendment (the Eighteenth). Thirteen years later we struck it down with a constitutional amendment (the Twenty-first). If legal sanctions can allow grownups to enjoy a cocktail, why can we not enact a constitutional protection that will drastically reduce the number of killings of innocent citizens, including the most innocent of all, our children?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355861875818</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:17:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355862439425-122</Id><Topic><Title>Utah 6th grader takes gun to school, says parents encouraged him</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1355861891149</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:18:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the parents encouraged him, hopefully after they throw the kid out of school for life they will arrest and prosecute the parents, call social services and take the kid away from the parents</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355862439425</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:27:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355862551278-123</Id><Topic><Title>Repeal the first and second ammendment!</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355861875818</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:17:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why not bring the cheif down here so we can question him on the volumes of articles he has written about the mentally ill?

That’s a stark contrast with President Obama’s 47 percent approve/45 percent disapprove rating when it comes to handling the cliff talks. Taking a step back, just 25 percent of people approve of how Congressional Republicans are broadly doing their job; Obama’s job approval stands at 54 percent. * On each of the five issues tested in the poll, Obama has leads ranging from four to 26 points over Congressional Republicans on which side people trust more to do a better job. That includes an 18-point Obama lead on handling the economy and a 26-point Obama lead on protecting the middle class. Obama’s smallest edge over Republicans in Congress is on handling the budget deficit, where he has just a four-point margin. * A plurality (47 percent) said that Congressional Republicans would be more to blame if the country went over the fiscal cliff while 31 percent said they would blame President Obama more. Those numbers are generally consistent with data from a Post survey conducted earlier this month that showed 53 percent would blame Republicans more and 27 percent would blame Obama. What all of these numbers make clear is that Republicans are terribly positioned in a public relations battle with the President over the fiscal cliff (or anything else) any time soon. As we noted last week, Republicans have a major brand problem that drastically limits their ability to convince the American public of the rightness of their ideas. The general perception of the GOP is disastrously bad and it seems highly unlikely that hurtling off the fiscal cliff would do anything to improve it. (Three quarters of respondents in the Post-ABC poll said that Congressional Republicans have not been willing enough to seek compromise with President Obama on the details of a budget deal.)</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355864158781</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:55:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355864297689-134</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like Obama is going to take us over the cliff.</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355863664617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:47:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Public is still jaded about how the GOP tried to get us to default on our debt like a third world country, it reminded them of Newt shutting down the Gov because he had to exit from the back of the plane</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355864297689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:58:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355864405379-135</Id><Title>csco</Title><Msg>go csco gooooooooooooo</Msg><Username>anvilhoof</Username><Timestamp>1355864405379</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:00:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355864504259-136</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals are so stupid</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355863279784</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:41:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>kind of funny how you baggers went from 100% positive you would take the White House, the Senate and pick up seats in the house and now you are declaring victory because you didn't lose the house yet, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355864504259</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:01:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355865276576-137</Id><Title>Gun nuts are right about one thing though</Title><Msg>assault weapons ban is just the beginning of gun control, But Statement No. 2 is clearly a “fact question,” as we used to say, not an opinion one. Either Americans possessed broad gun rights for most of our history, or they didn’t. True or false? It’s false. Indeed, the truth is precisely the opposite: Until the very recent past, individual gun rights were severely restricted. Believe it or not, the entire concept of “gun rights” – that is, of citizens’ unbridled freedom to buy and own firearms – is largely a creation of our own times. Yes, the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the “right to bear arms.” But if that means individual citizens – as opposed to state militias – can carry firearms anywhere they want, someone forgot to tell our 19th-century forebears. As law professor Adam Winkler has found, 10 states passed laws in the 1800s barring the possession of concealed weapons. One of them was Texas, the lodestar of the gun-rights movement today.

The country continues to heal from Bush's Bushwacking. Barack Obama hardened up his commitment to imposing restrictions on gun ownership on Tuesday, with the White House promising to support a bill to ban assault weapons of the type used in the Newtown school shootings. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama supported reinstating the ban, which was first introduced in 1994 but was allowed to lapse in 2004 by the Bush administration. The pledge came amid criticism of the president that he has failed to be specific about which gun controls he would support. Even in his speech at the Newtown vigil on Sunday in which he signalled that the issue would be a priority he did not mention guns specifically, and on Monday Carney spoke only in broad, vague terms about gun control. But on Tuesday Carney said Obama will support a bill that the Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein said she will introduce in January to curb the sale of automatic- and semi-automatic weapons. Feinstein was responsible for the original 1994 bill. Carney went further, saying that Obama was also considering support for the closure of a loophole that allows easy sale at gun shows. Buyers are not subjected to the same background checks and demands for various forms of ID at these shows that they would if buying from a licensed gun store. In yet another measure, Carney also signalled support for taking action to restrict ammunition clips, reducing the number of bullets to single figures, making mass killings more difficult. Obama is "interested in looking at" this, Carney said. "He is actively supportive of, for example, senator Feinstein's stated intent to revive a piece of legislation that would reinstate the assault weapons ban," Carney said. "He supports and would support legislation that addresses the problem of the so-called gun show loophole, and there are other elements of gun legislation that he could support … high capacity ammunition clips, for example. That is certainly something he would be interested in looking at," he said.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355866605084</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:36:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355866967243-146</Id><Topic><Title>Obama has things going so good that</Title><Username>eagle1776321</Username><Timestamp>1354725622955</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 11:40:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow if that happens the DJI will go to 25,000</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355866967243</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:42:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355867039288-147</Id><Topic><Title>Told you months ago</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355866605084</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:36:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What?

Shinzo Abe, the incoming prime minister, is attempting a takeover of the supposedly independent Bank of Japan. Abe is demanding the bank change its inflation target from 1 percent to 2 percent and wants the bank to begin "unlimited" monetary easing. That means buying a lot more government bonds. He also wants a weaker yen, which can be achieved if the BOJ starts buying foreign bonds. He has told the BOJ that it must "reach an appropriate decision, accepting the results" of the recent election, in which Abe's party won a landslide. Just to make sure you understand this: Abe has said he will revise the law that makes the BOJ independent if it doesn't do as he says. He will be able to nominate successors for the top three BOJ officials in March and April. Huh? This is a dictate, not a negotiation. You will remain independent, as long as you do what I tell you. Orwell would be proud. We're turning Japanese and Greek at the same time.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1355873280689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 18:28:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355874320978-175</Id><Title>Republicans are Gun Crazy.....</Title><Msg>Republicans are Postal</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1355874320978</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 18:45:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355874412199-176</Id><Title>Guns made to Kill..Airplanes made to Fly</Title><Msg>Gun killings are No Accidents.....</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1355874412199</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 18:46:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355874483983-177</Id><Topic><Title>ONCE AGAIN, YOU HEARD IT FIRST FROM WALTER....CHINA....</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1355860853542</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:00:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>China export economy is imploding.
