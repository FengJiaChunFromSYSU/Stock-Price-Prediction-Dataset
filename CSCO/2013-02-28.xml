BuzzFeed later reported that the official was Gene Sperling, who heads President Obama's White House Economic Council. Woodward has repeatedly accused the White House of "moving the goal posts" in the fight over the looming budget sequester. He has been challenged on the facts of his assertions many times, but has not strayed from them.</Msg><Username>fallis.1942</Username><Timestamp>1362027890550</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 00:04:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362045217078-2</Id><Topic><Title>Not All Republicans Are Racists- But All Racists ARE Republicans</Title><Username>sand_core</Username><Timestamp>1362014947488</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 20:29:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and pecker puller at that!</Msg><Username>shwdl</Username><Timestamp>1362045217078</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 04:53:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362045356574-3</Id><Topic><Title>He is MAD - MAD - MAD</Title><Username>doyoulikeneruda</Username><Timestamp>1362022314385</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 22:31:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HE NEEDS 2 VISIT THE DOWNLOWCLUBS!</Msg><Username>shwdl</Username><Timestamp>1362045356574</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 04:55:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362050060221-4</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO Upgraded to STRONG BUY (EXCLUSIVE REPORT)</Title><Username>jake.lees</Username><Timestamp>1361366193772</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:16:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice one</Msg><Username>brownrichard417</Username><Timestamp>1362050060221</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 06:14:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362055324726-5</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see this report yet?

If we only knew what a liar he would be. "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America 's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America 's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, "the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better."

So, of course, 65 dollars an hours destroys all 'minimum wage jobs' and lots of others as well!!! Those skilled RN's working for 35 dollars an hour, find themselves out of job when minimum goes to 65 dollars an hour...business everywhere shut down and prices of those surviving, sky rocket to deal with the artificial interference with market forces. So, your drooling, gurgling laughter at the 65 dollars an hour minimum, should open your eyes to the same damaging impact ANY MINIMUM WAGE INTRODUCES! ALL FEDERAL MANDATES, LIKE THIS, DISTORT THE REALITY OF A MARKET SYSTEM, that unfettered, is the engine of universal success, prosperity and widening affluence all across society. Even the Chinese Communists, so much brighter than dull Democrat, have unfettered the 'market system' despite their persistent interference to allow the incredible growth of the Chinese economy. Of course, dull, damaged, drooling Democrat, prefers the Greek economy, a broken, savaged, useless, wasted, bloated centrally controlled economic system that drains the very life of an economy, until the people lay broken, crippled and starving in the gutter...

The closing argument from William Voegeli, a senior editor at the Review, is particularly worth considering, as it speaks unusually clearly to a key tension in the Republican coalition. The Republican Party already has a substantively admirable agenda that, if implemented, would point America in the right direction. The Paul Ryan fiscal framework, which House Republicans overwhelmingly endorsed and which Kabaservice and Frum have criticized, will suffice as a shorthand version of that agenda. I take its essential feature to be that federal spending on entitlement and discretionary domestic programs, which has grown steadily as a proportion of our growing economy for the past eight decades, should account for a declining proportion of a growing economy over coming decades. America, that is, will bend its domestic spending curve downward until it comports with revenues from a tax system no more burdensome than the historic average. An important vehicle for realizing that change will be to means-test and voucherize entitlement programs. And here’s David Frum’s response: Post-2008 hard-right conservatives did rally around one new idea: the Ryan plan praised above by William Voegeli. And what was the Ryan plan? Simply this: a plan to load almost all the burden of fiscal adjustment onto Americans under age 55, while largely exempting Americans over age 55. Even beyond the Ryan plan, the Tea Party championed causes dear to the hearts of retirees and near-retirees. Remember, the issue that launched the Tea Party in the summer of 2009 was…opposition to Medicare cuts for current beneficiaries. That’s a strange rallying cry for a purportedly limited government movement. Once you begin to think of the Tea Party as a vehicle for advancing the economic interests of the old against the young, though, a lot of otherwise mysterious behaviors suddenly begin to make sense. Frum’s critique, put simply, is that demographics are destiny for political parties. A party made up of old people will have trouble cutting Medicare, and lo and behold, today’s Republican Party, despite believing Medicare the key cause of our budgetary troubles, is even more protective of its near-term spending than the Democrats. A party so reliant on elderly voters could hardly be otherwise. But demographics don’t just drive political parties. They also drive policy. And what’s striking about Voegeli’s agenda is its distance from the demographic realities driving American policy. Consider what Voegeli said again. The “essential feature” of the conservative agenda is that “federal spending on entitlement and discretionary domestic programs…should account for a declining proportion of a growing economy over coming decades.” There are no numbers in that sentence, but the clue comes shortly thereafter, when he writes that America “will bend its domestic spending curve downward until it comports with revenues from a tax system no more burdensome than the historic average.” The need to stick close to the historical tax average is a common conservative talking point, and it typically means revenues around 18 percent of GDP, though that number has only been sufficient to balance the budget in three of the last 50 years. The problem is that America’s demographics have no intention of holding true to their 50-year average. As Ed Kleinbard, a tax professor at USC, points out, the share of the country over 65 will increase by a third in the next 10 years alone. That means a greater share of the country depending on the government — and, worse even than that, a greater share depending on the government for expensive health-care services. The idea that we can support America in 2025 with the tax code America had in 1975 is foolishness. But it’s foolishness that the Republican Party has yoked itself to, and that requires it to make heroically absurd policy assumptions. Even Ryan’s budget can’t credibly argue that Medicare and Social Security spending won’t grow as a percentage of the economy. Both increase under the path he’s laid out. And so he instead argues that Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program will fall by half in the coming decades, which is not possible unless we are going to throw many millions of people out of those programs. Even less likely than that, he says that everything that isn’t health-care spending or Social Security will fall by about 75 percent. These aren’t reasonable assumptions, of course, but they’re also not popular ones. In order to protect seniors, he’s gutted everything else in the budget.

When interest rates go up, the interest payments on Obama's debt will be $800 BILLION a year. 40% of all of Obama's spending is on borrowed money. He has maxed out the credit card. He got his tax increase. Now it time to cut spending. There is so much wasteful government spending. Cutting the waster first should be our top priority. Exterminating the illegal aliens who are stealing government money is the second priority.

"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, "the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better."

WHY is the USA Going BANKRUPT? Informative and mind boggling! You think the war in Iraq was costing us too much? Read this: We have been hammered with the propaganda that it was the Iraq war and the war on terror that is bankrupting us. I now find that to be RIDICULOUS. I hope the following 10 reasons are forwarded over and over again until they are read so many times that the reader gets sick of reading them. 1. $11 Billion to $22 billion is spent on welfare to illegal aliens each year by state governments. 2. $22 Billion dollars a year is spent on food assistance programs such as food stamps, WIC, and free school lunches for illegal aliens. 3. $2.5 Billion dollars a year is spent on Medicaid for illegal aliens. 4. $12 Billion dollars a year is spent on primary and secondary school education"for children here illegally and they cannot speak a word of English! 5. $17 Billion dollars a year is spent for education for the American-born children of illegal aliens, known as anchor babies. 6. $3 Million Dollars a DAY is spent to incarcerate illegal aliens. 7. 30% percent of all Federal Prison inmates are illegal aliens. 8. $90 Billion Dollars a year is spent on illegal aliens for Welfare &amp; social "services by the American taxpayers. 9. $200 Billion dollars a year in suppressed American wages are caused by the illegal aliens. The total cost is a whopping $ 338.3 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY; IT IS$338,300,000,000.00 WHICHWOULD BE ENOUGH TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY FOR THE CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY.

I think we all agree with the President: America is not a deadbeat nation. We are a nation that has long prided our sense of innovation and entrepreneurship. The vast majority of us lives within our means and pay our bills on time. We pay our taxes on time. We should expect that our government, funded by our tax dollars, would do the same. However, yesterday it was announced the White House will once again miss the legal deadline for sending a budget to Congress. In a letter to House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the White House said it would send the president’s budget “as soon as possible.” Did Obama mention that this is the fourth time the Administration has missed the deadline? In fact, since assuming office in January 2009, the President has delivered only one budget on time. What would happen to your family if you missed the deadline for filing your taxes four out of the last five years? What would happen to your business if you missed filing a financial disclosure form for the Securities and Exchange Commission? Time to do your job Mr. Obama be a leader not a blamer and excuse maker.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1362079118874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 14:18:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362079189363-157</Id><Title>Obama Gas over $5 bucks in La!

Kim Jung Un had NO military experience whatsoever before Daddy made him a four-star general in the military. This is a snot-nose twerp who has never accomplished anything in his life that would even come close to military leadership: he hasn't even so much as led a Cub Scout troop, coached a sports team or commanded a military platoon. So guess what is next? They make him the "beloved leader" of North Korea . Terrific! Oh, well; I'm sorry. I just remembered that we did the same thing here in the USA . We took an arrogant community organizer who has never worn a uniform and made him Commander-in-Chief; a guy who has never had a real job, worked on a budget or led anything more than an ACORN demonstration, and made him the leader of the USA .</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1362092404477</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 18:00:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362093547078-212</Id><Topic><Title>Teddy has a shovel ready</Title><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1362090682134</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 17:31:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cheney doing great with his new heart .May run for president now.Will you campaign for him with me,Junior.I'll mail you a bumper sticker!!</Msg><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1362093547078</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 18:19:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362093820497-213</Id><Topic><Title>Thugs in the white house</Title><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1362090415329</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 17:26:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you in the D.R. right now???????LOL</Msg><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1362093820497</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 18:23:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362094361966-214</Id><Title>REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN TAKING OVER DEMOCRATIC THUG CITY OF DETROIT!!</Title><Msg>WOW!

He had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't find a ringer who could ensure a Super Bowl win. Then one night while watching CNN he saw a war-zone scene in Afghanistan . In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Afghan Muslim soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away. KABOOM! He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney. KA-BLOOEY! Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph. BULLS-EYE! "I've got to get this guy!" Coach said to himself. "He has the perfect arm!" So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Bears go on to win the Super Bowl. The young Afghan is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother. "Mom," he says into the phone, "I just won the Super Bowl!" "I don't want to talk to you, the old Muslim woman says."You are not my son! "I don't think you understand, Mother," the young man pleads. "I've won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans." "No! Let me tell you!" his mother retorts. "At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get raped!" The old lady pauses and then tearfully says, "I will never forgive you for making us move to Chicago !"</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1362111038883</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 23:10:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
