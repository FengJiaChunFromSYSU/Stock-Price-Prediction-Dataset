Those that voted to give the Halfrican a chance, and "show the world Americans are less racist than say Europeans" because they have never elected even a half black. Well the fact that Obama is a worse failure than Carter, must make some of those who voted for the least vetted, least accomplished and experienced President ever fell responsible to right their mistake this time around. Voting for Obama was just like giving him a Nobel prize without having deserved it. The Presidency is not an entry level job. I don't see how Obama got past the interview. No Resume, no job experiences, awful association, awful references, and most are questionable. This time the Bradley effect may be citing Obama so called likability. This is #$%$ this guy has demonstrated he cannot get along even with his own party. We have 4 years of playing the race card, not prosecuting Black Panthers, calling a white cop doing his job names, even his own Granny who gave him a posh and privileged childhood, was called a typical racist white person. The tell them what they want to hear when it comes to pollsters asking opinions, may be responsible for these likability number not falling in the face of $100 million in nasty, factually false Obama attack ads against Romney and Ryan. If calling a nice religious guy like Romney a murderer, when the woman died 7 years after Romney left Bain, had health insurance, and her husband refused a buyout. If blaming Romney for Bain decisions made two years after he left Bain to outsource, decisions that were made by an Obama financial bundler who was Bain CEO. If being rich and not paying taxes which can't be true or the IRS would be prosecuting Romney If this is a nice guy , accusing Ryan of wanting to kill old people, while he and his mom both took care of Granny when she developed dementia, If this is a nice guy, the same guy who treated Oprah so bad, who treated Netanyahu and the Dali Lama so badly, and can't get along with most Dems. Then the Bradley effect may be alive. and none of these polls are showing the true opinion of Obama.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1346562723029</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 01:12:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346574665708-4</Id><Title>OK CLASS!

Three percent (3%) prefer some other candidate, and five percent (5%) are undecided. Usually the challenger get 80% of the undecided vote, that would add 4% to Romney's margin. I expect Obama to get a bounce, but this 8% Romney margin will be hard for Obama to overcome. Two factors, Romney is first now gearing up his Ads, and he will chew Obama up in the debates. Also, the Bradley effect may be another 2% for Romney. Its over you libs, its over.

"We make money for them, if you just tell them, they'll keep us on," she said. I said that the whole point of the merger was to make money for the stockholders, not to reward us for doing a good job. She told me how unfair that was. Finally I said, "I hear you on the phone every week, moving the money around in your 401K because you expect to make 13 percent interest. Don't you get it? It's people like you who cost us our jobs. Everyone in the stock market who expects to make a killing, instead of a reasonable return. Every time you move your money, you make it more likely someone else is going to lose their job." She simply didn't believe me. I thought of her when I read this from Matt Taibbi: Are you kidding? Mitt Romney was the guy that fired you from that $22.50 an hour job, and helped you replace it with two $9 an hour jobs! He was a pioneer in the area of eliminating the well-paying job with benefits and replacing it with the McJob that offered no benefits at all. One of the things that killed him in the Senate race against Ted Kennedy were Kennedy ads that reminded voters that Mitt’s takeovers resulted in slashed wages and lost benefits. He was exactly the guy that eliminated that classic $22.50 manufacturing job, like in the case of GST Steel, where Bain took over with an initial investment of $8 million, paid itself a $36 million dividend, ended up walking away with $50 million, and left GST saddled with over $500 million in debt. 750 of those well-paying jobs were lost. What kinds of jobs were left for those fired workers to look for? Well, in the best-case scenario, you might have found one at Ampad, another Bain takeover target, where workers had their pay slashed from $10.22 to $7.88 an hour, tripled co-pays, and eliminated the retirement plan. So a guy who eliminated hundreds of $22 an hour jobs and slashed hundreds more jobs to below $9 an hour blasts Barack Obama for not giving you the better life you deserved, after you lost your $22/hour job and had to take two $9/hour jobs. Are we all high or something? Did that really just happen?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1346601692995</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 12:01:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346601964023-13</Id><Title>Mitt is Unfit= show your taxes!!!</Title><Msg>Dont show taxes= no vote</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1346601964023</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 12:06:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346602017313-14</Id><Topic><Title>romney a ;pathetic old liar</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1346582621415</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 06:43:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ts a FACT,,for sure</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1346602017313</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 12:06:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346602182696-15</Id><Title>Today's Internets, all powerful, all massive</Title><Msg>Sunday, September 02, 2012 GOP Exists in Alternate Universe at Bizarre, Lie-Filled Convention By MARC McDONALD Recently, I had a political discussion with a right-wing acquaintance. Sometimes I wonder why I bother. During the argument, my acquaintance called Obama an "idiot." When I asked for some proof of this, he replied, "Well, Obama said 'Internets' in an interview. He thinks it's called 'Internets.' That's really stupid." Having grown weary of the discussion, I didn't even bother to challenge my acquaintance's contention. I did, though, think it was a bit odd. After all, the use of the term "Internets" was a well-known Bush blunder. Bush made the blunder during a debate with Al Gore, in 2000. Amazingly, Bush made the mistake again in 2004, during a debate with John Kerry. It was the second screwup that was widely ridiculed in the media. "Was Rush now trying to somehow make the claim to his audience that this was in fact Obama's mistake?" I wondered. Doing a little research on the Internet revealed that Obama once indeed did say "Internets." However, there was a big, big difference between the screwups made by Obama and Bush. After all, when Obama said "Internets" he quickly corrected himself a few words later in the same sentence. Obama is one of the most eloquent and intelligent speakers I've ever heard. But the fact is, like all modern U.S. presidents, he has an array of video cameras recording his words for hours every day. Given the grueling demands of his job and the stress that comes with it, it really shouldn't be surprising that he (or any president) might have an occasional verbal stumble. I mean, the only reason we don't have evidence of verbal stumbles by the likes of Washington and Jefferson is that there were no video cameras around in the 18th century. Anyway, this whole episode got me to thinking. The Right-Wing in this country has built up such a formidable propaganda network that wingnuts can happily dwell within it and never be exposed to the Real World of actual facts, science, logic, reason and truth. It's clear that my right-wing acquaintance got his "Obama said 'Internets'" quote from the likes of Drudge and he has never even heard about Bush's far more famous (and uncorrected) blunder. So Obama must be stupid, right? After all, Rush says so. Such is the mind of the Right-Winger these days. Which brings me to my main point. Politicians in America have historically never been the most honest class of people in the nation. But today's Republicans has set a new record for outrageous and blatant lies. It's gotten so bad that even the drowsy mainstream media has awoken from its usual slumber and started pointing out these outrageous lies. For example, at the GOP convention, Paul Ryan trotted out his outrageous lie that Obama had supposedly promised to save a Wisconsin GM plant that later closed. Ryan no doubt thought that this latest lie wouldn't be scrutinized by a media that has allowed so many other GOP lies to pass unchallenged. No doubt, Ryan was stunned when numerous mainstream media outlets across the nation picked apart his GM fable and exposed it for the lie that it was. (As it turns out, the Wisconsin GM plant closed before Obama even took office). Other GOP convention lies were similarly exposed by the media ("Obama has slashed Medicare!" "Obama is responsible for the U.S. credit downgrade!") I'm sure that the GOP is stunned by the recent fact-checking by a newly vigilant media. (And frankly, I'm as stunned as the GOP is, after watching the media let Republicans lie through their teeth for many years). I guess the question now is this: why, in this election cycle, does the GOP have such contempt for the truth (especially when it can no longer get away with it?) The answer to that question is simple. Because the GOP knows that, in fact, it can get away with it. This article's opening anecdote is proof positive of that. As that anecdote demonstrated, there are still many, many right-wingers out who get all of their news and info from the Fox/Drudge/Rush GOP Propaganda Network. My right-wing acquaintance has never even heard that it was in fact Bush who made a fool of himself with his infamous "Internets" remarks. And my right-wing acquaintance will never even hear the mainstream media's debunking of Ryan's claims about the Wisconsin GM plant's closure. After all, he sure as hell isn't going to ever hear about it on Rush's show. Such is the power of today's Great Right-Wing Propaganda Network. It is all-powerful, it is massive, it is everywhere, and it is 24 hours a day. If you are a wingnut getting your "news" from it, you'll never even feel the need to venture out in the Real World and expose yourself to any other news outlet. And you'll happily continue to live in an alternate universe, where Obama will always be a Socialist Muslim Kenyan whose birth certificate is a fraud.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1346602182696</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 12:09:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346602988816-16</Id><Title>They're a "witness protection program"</Title><Msg>Maher: How Can We Trust Republicans With the Future When as Far as I Can Tell, the World Ended the Year Reagan Left Office?

The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those wh...o are listening to liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: On January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took control of Congress: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies had SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION! Remember that day...? January 3rd, 2007 was the day Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney), for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (but...the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? -- OBAMA!!! And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY!!!! So when someone tries to blame Bush... REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car, but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel while they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets are not passed in the White House. They are passed by Congress, and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. Obama has now gone 1,000 days without a budget, and is still blaming it on the Republicans! In that first year, Congress had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending when Bush, somewhat belatedly, got tough on spending increases. For FY 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed Lame Duck President George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of those massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself and a Democratic Congress. In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is: "I inherited a deficit that I voted for, and then I expanded that deficit four-fold since January 20th 2009."</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1346622593914</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 17:49:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346623469786-25</Id><Topic><Title>Replacing something with two is better, right?</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1346601692995</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 12:01:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Getting labor costs down to a level that represents the worth of the labor input is the sign of a good business man.

The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those wh...o are listening to liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: On January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took control of Congress: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies had SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION! Remember that day...? January 3rd, 2007 was the day Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney), for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (but...the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? -- OBAMA!!! And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY!!!! So when someone tries to blame Bush... REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car, but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel while they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets are not passed in the White House. They are passed by Congress, and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. Obama has now gone 1,000 days without a budget, and is still blaming it on the Republicans! In that first year, Congress had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending when Bush, somewhat belatedly, got tough on spending increases. For FY 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed Lame Duck President George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of those massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending.
