Don't tell me Obama isn't raising taxes on the middle class. Most people thru their investing or 401k have cap gains and he is going to hit us on risk capitol, we already paid taxes on at least a couple of times.

Look to your future, lock down. Prepare for anarchy. Time line uncertain, anarchy inevitable. Governments, of little integrity and great mush mouth ability, can dance on the precipice for months and months and months. Best prediction, about 20 months...at 100 billion deficit a month, that's another two TRILLION DOLLARS....then it goes down like the World Trade Center...big surprise, all at once...then everything freezes. No need to dig a hole, but find your clan, develop your tribe, stay connected, make new like minded friends...obey the law.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1354044972381</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 14:36:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354045184709-78</Id><Title>He did it again!!!</Title><Msg>Wonder what a "MISSES CAREY" is??LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL It just never stops with this idiot Junior LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL</Msg><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1354045184709</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 14:39:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354045212506-79</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO Analyst Report Revealed</Title><Username>aliceking267</Username><Timestamp>1353345615099</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 12:20:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great alert</Msg><Username>davidandersoons</Username><Timestamp>1354045212506</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 14:40:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354045751702-80</Id><Title>Reid opened his mouth and the markets dropped</Title><Msg>hopefully these buffoons learn and remember what happened in 2008</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1354045751702</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 14:49:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354046568117-81</Id><Topic><Title>He did it again!!!</Title><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1354045184709</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 14:39:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh my!!!!

Cox is former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Archers is former chairman of the House Ways &amp; Means Committee. “As Washington wrestles with the roughly $600 billion fiscal cliff and the 2013 budget, the far greater fiscal challenge of the U.S. government's unfunded pension and health-care liabilities remains offstage,” the duo writes in The Wall Street Journal. Editor's Note: Use This Single Loophole to Pay Zero Taxes. See Video Economists generally focus on the amount of the budget deficit and government debt and their ratio to GDP. Thus the debt officially totals $15.96 trillion, more than 100 percent of GDP. And the budget deficit officially totals $1.1 trillion, 7 percent of GDP. But, “the actual liabilities of the federal government — including Social Security, Medicare, and federal employees' future retirement benefits — already exceed $86.8 trillion, or 550 percent of GDP,” Cox and Archer write. And “for the year ending Dec. 31, 2011, the annual accrued expense of Medicare and Social Security was $7 trillion. Nothing like that figure is used in calculating the deficit. In reality, the reported budget deficit is less than one-fifth of the more accurate figure.” The issue is one of accurate balance sheets, the duo states. “Were American policy makers to have the benefit of transparent financial statements prepared the way public companies must report their pension liabilities, they would see clearly the magnitude of the future borrowing that these liabilities imply. Borrowing on this scale could . . . bankrupt the entire federal government.”</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1354067308914</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 20:48:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354067850199-117</Id><Topic><Title>Actual US debt is almost 87 trillion dollars</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1354067308914</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 20:48:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am thinking of buying florida in 20 years, all of it, so I am actually in debt 200 trillion dollars, LOL baggers are so stupid by this stupid logic every single insurance company in the world is completely bankrupt. After all they are likely to experience losses in the future, add all those losses together and they greatly exceed the amount of assets the insurance companies have currently. but the way the world actually works, (now this would be the real world not the alternate bagger reality) is if you are going to add up future liabilities and not even bother to discount them to net present value you have to add up future income and not discount them. thanks for playing, you win a free toaster for being galactic-ally stupid, but Rhonda wins every time she posts.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354067850199</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 20:57:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354067928153-118</Id><Topic><Title>Carney didn't tell O'Butcher what to say</Title><Username>blindboa</Username><Timestamp>1354067089266</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 20:44:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>New here.

Here for 7 hours the WH watched Americans being attacked did nothing while the Ambassador was raped, killed, and his body was dragged. Your probably right the American People ain't so smart, the only care about Obamaphones, food stamps and welfare. They have no pride, and care nothing about the people who risk their lives for them.
