From The Guardian today: "The Sensata plant in Freeport is profitable and competitive, but its majority owner, Bain Capital, has decided to ship jobs to China – and forced workers to train their overseas replacements The shock of losing a precious job in a town afflicted by high unemployment is always hard. A foundation for a stable family life and secure home instantly disappears, replaced with a future filled with fears over health insurance, missed mortgage payments and the potential for a slip below the breadline. But for Bonnie Borman – and 170 other men and women in Freeport, Illinois – there is a brutal twist to the torture. Borman, 52, and the other workers of a soon-to-be-shuttered car parts plant are personally training the Chinese workers who will replace them........" Romney founded the company and continues to reap millions in profits from it every year. He's a menace to society.</Msg><Username>barjonicat</Username><Timestamp>1345609760130</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 00:29:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345612951283-3</Id><Title>YOU KNOW WHY REPUKES ARE FOR RAPE...</Title><Msg>It is the only way they can get laid.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345612951283</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 01:22:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345616236768-4</Id><Title>Why Yahoo not post message sometimes?</Title><Msg>I try to post on other Yahoo board...Yahoo no do.

More unemployment through austerity measures. 2. Taking from the poor to give to the rich. Higher federal taxes on lower income taxpayers, slashing medicaid, food stamps, and children's health care in order to give up to a $500k tax cut to millionaires and billionaires. 3. Turns Medicare into vouchers that won't keep up with the rising cost of health care and shifting the burden onto seniors, ending their guaranteed health care, and leaving them at the mercy of private insurers. By contrast, Obama's Affordable Care Act saves money on Medicare by reducing payments to providers such as hospitals and drug companies. 4. Add money to defense spending. The plan would add money to defense spending while cutting spending on education, infrastructure, and basic research and development. 5. Debt: The Romney-Ryan budget doesn't even reduce the federal budget deficit. While adding to military spending, giving tax cuts to the rich, and stifling economic growth by cutting spending too early, the plan would push public debt to over 175% by 2050. No wonder Mitt Romney doesn't want to talk about his budget until after the election!</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1345646692409</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:44:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345646837761-33</Id><Topic><Title>Obama DOWN in Most States Now -Rasmussen polling</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1345645291165</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:21:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rasmussen is a very GOP poll.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1345646837761</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:47:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345647032683-34</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt says "I'll talk about my budget after elections"</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1345646692409</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:44:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>obama already raised middle and lower class taxes. and he does not have a budget or cant pass one through his own party. get a clue america does not want to look at the ugly truth that if we pass a budget we get another credit downgrade making our borrowing costs higher add yet to more debt. obama spent 6 trillion and counting who will pay for that? he makes you think that raising upper class taxes pre-bush will pay for it? hahahahahahaha that will add 4 billion a year to fed intake. obamas government cost about 5 billion a day to run. and you thought bushes math was "fuzzy". hahahahahahahahaha wait 2012 will be the most miserable year for middle and lower class.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345647032683</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:50:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345647061497-35</Id><Title>The GOP platform, must be proud</Title><Msg>“They don’t want this rubbing off on Romney,” Davis said.

Ted Poe took it one step further. “The vice presidential debate between Paul Ryan and Joe Biden will be like Einstein debating Forrest Gump,” Poe said, according to the Houston Chronicle. While no one, probably not even the vice president, can predict what’s going to come out of his mouth at any given moment, it’s worth remembering that his 2008 debate with Sarah Palin was also preceded by hand-wringing among Democrats who fretted about the prospects of a truly cringeworthy Biden moment. Yet Biden fared well both in terms of style and substance. Fears of a serious gaffe, or worse, that he might appear condescending, proved unfounded. Guess Ted Poe never saw the movie, Forest Gump wins every time.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345650002664</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:40:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345650593592-44</Id><Topic><Title>Forest Gump</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345650002664</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:40:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Everybody said Palin won the debate.

(CNN) -- The recent West Nile virus outbreak is the largest ever seen in the United States, according to new numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of cases so far this year is the highest recorded since the disease was first detected in the United States in 1999. As of August 21, 38 states had reported human infections. The cases reported to the CDC total 1,118, including 41 deaths. "The peak of West Nile virus epidemics usually occurs in mid-August, but it takes a couple of weeks for people to get sick, go to the doctor and get reported," said Dr. Lyle Petersen, the director of the CDC's Vector-Borne Infectious Disease Division. "Thus we expect many more cases to occur." Petersen said that the reason for the high number of cases this year is unclear, but that unusually warm weather could have fostered favorable conditions for the disease's transfer to humans. About 75% of the cases are in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Dakota and Oklahoma. Texas has been at the epicenter of the outbreak, with 586 confirmed cases and 21 deaths, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345655060827</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 13:04:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345655248237-61</Id><Title>dear obama</Title><Msg>thank you fro the largest tax increase in american history -middle class</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345655248237</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 13:07:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345655316949-62</Id><Title>mitt continues to transfer wealth from the middle class</Title><Msg>to himself and China, he may not work there anymore but he still benefits from sending jobs overseas, In the most recent news in that vein, The Guardian reports that Bain has for months been dismantling and shipping to China, "piece by piece," a car parts plant, of which it is majority owner, in Freeport, Ill. -- even as it requires the workers to train personally their Chinese replacements, who have been flown in by management. "It's not easy to get up in the morning, training them to do your job so that you can be made unemployed," Bonnie Borman told the paper. Borman, 52, has worked at the Sensata auto sensors plant for 23 years. She has three children and predicts that soon, "I am going to be competing for minimum wage jobs with my own daughter." Although Romney left Bain around the turn of the century -- pinpointing the exact year is difficult, which has itself become a source of controversy -- he maintains financial ties to the company, HELLO receiving millions of dollars annually in profits from buyout and investment funds. Which means that Romney stands to gain if Bain's plan to cut costs at Sensata by eliminating U.S. jobs succeeds in increasing profitability. Needless to say, such an arrangement strikes the company's current employees as deeply unjust. "I understand business needs to make a profit," Tom Gualrapp told The Guardian. "But this product has always made a ton of money. it's just that they think it is not enough money. They are greedy." Gaulrapp, 54, is a 33 year veteran of the plant, and says that homelessness "is a real possibility" in his near future.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345655316949</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 13:08:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345655522156-63</Id><Topic><Title>Classic liberal quotes</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345653986075</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 12:46:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I did not inhale I did not have sexual relations with miss piggy. -billy clinton liberals think we are all stupid.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345655522156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 13:12:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345655529287-64</Id><Title>why mitt will lose</Title><Msg>Pounding by Democrats on Romney's refusal to release more than two years of his tax returns has taken a significant toll.

Particularly when you assign me other ID's. I don't see the point of having multiple IDs unless one is delivering a parody of an existing user, which I've never done. There is no reason for me to generate a new ID since I end up on top 99% of the time, so why would I. As a matter of fact, the only thing that any repuke here produced that gave me a chuckle in the last 3 years was the one about me being a product of an illegal rape and the only thing we had to find out was which horse it was ! That was pretty funny, but really between all of you it took you 3 years to generate a single ONE. ???? Pleeeeease. There is only one surfandski, the one that has been bashing your heads like a cheap pin~nata for all these years. No need to be anything else because I like you to feel my boot up your ahzz. Unfortunately it looks like I am going to have to wait another 3 years to get a laugh. You guys are sooooooooooooooooooo lame.

From Lubbock's Fox 34 News: "He's going to try to hand over the sovereignty of the United States to the UN, and what is going to happen when that happens?," Head asked. "I'm thinking the worst. Civil unrest, civil disobedience, civil war maybe. And we're not just talking a few riots here and demonstrations, we're talking Lexington, Concord, take up arms and get rid of the guy. "Now what's going to happen if we do that, if the public decides to do that? He's going to send in U.N. troops. I don't want 'em in Lubbock County. OK. So I'm going to stand in front of their armored personnel carrier and say 'you're not coming in here'. "And the sheriff, I've already asked him, I said 'you gonna back me' he said, 'yeah, I'll back you'. Well, I don't want a bunch of rookies back there. I want trained, equipped, seasoned veteran officers to back me."
