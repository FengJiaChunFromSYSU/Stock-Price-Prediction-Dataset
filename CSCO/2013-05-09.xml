What amazed me is when Hillary said "what does it matter now". Truly an arrogant individual. Now the Dems in Congress play the cover up game, thinking the #$%$ in America will play the cover up game too, instead of finding the truth. Americans found more truth with the Lybian president and only 4 people protecting the Ambassador. Thats crazy. My guess and of course this is just speculation the Ambassador was gay and probably refused to perform oral sex so Obama had him killed. Many do not want to know that Obama is a non reciprocate oral sex gay fanatic. Just my read on the Ambassador's killing of course.</Msg><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1368108601594</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:10:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368108731175-30</Id><Topic><Title>THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTACK, WHERE IS THE GOVERNOR. ..</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1368080160799</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 02:16:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes , let's compare all of america to my white trash backyard !</Msg><Username>goofyteabillies</Username><Timestamp>1368108731175</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:12:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368109235924-31</Id><Topic><Title>"What difference at this point does it make?!"</Title><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1368108566756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:09:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another lib saying per Jay Carney.."

After meandering around for a bit, Issa finally got to the hearing’s grand revelation — Benghazi was a terror attack: ISSA: I think the American people learned today from these brave witnesses, these whistleblowers, that the facts as we were told before during and after the attack at Benghazi simply aren’t what they really were. The acting ambassador after Ambassador Stevens was murdered, what they did told us in great detail about what happened that day and what happened in the days to follow and why we should know that he knew and everyone else in the mission new from the moment it happened, from the get-go, as he said, that this was a terrorist attack. Greg Hicks’ testimony didn’t have much to do with what Issa himself said the mission of the hearing would be: expose more Obama administration failures and perhaps even some kind of cover-up (of what, is unclear exactly). “Our hearing will examine new facts about what happened and significant problems with the administration’s own review of Benghazi failures,” Issa said previewing the hearing last month. “This committee will expose what they did and hold them accountable to the public.” Issa’s hearing didn’t expose anything, except perhaps how fact-free a number of right-wing Benghazi conspiracy theories are, including the idea that Clinton personally signed off on cables denying additional security for the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi.

House Speaker John Boehner explains. “We’ve got 70 new members who have not had an opportunity to vote on the president’s health care law,” Boehner said. “Frankly they’ve been asking for an opportunity to vote on it.” Well, then. By all means. It's not like it's costing American taxpayers something like $1.45 million to have that meaningless vote. Oh, wait. Yes, it is! It's exactly like it's costing us $1.45 million for that repeal vote. Last July, when CBS News tallied it up using the CRS figure of $24 million per work week in the House, they figured that the House had spent 80 hours on 33 repeal votes, for a grand total of $48 million. That's $1.45 million per vote. There have been another three repeal votes since then, for another $4.4 million to the tally. So, we're at a grand total of $52.4 million wasted on futile Obamacare repeal votes, just in the House. And that's being generous to the Republicans, not counting committee time wasted on this, the opportunity cost of delaying other work, etc. It's probably a lot closer to $55 million. And if you ask those 70 new GOP members who are insisting on having their turn to cast a meaningless vote on settled law why they want to be in Congress, they'll tell you it's to stop big government from wasting taxpayer dollars.</Msg><Username>goofyteabillies</Username><Timestamp>1368121201520</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 13:40:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368121353347-70</Id><Title>Agreeing with McCain on cable bill</Title><Msg>At first blush, this bit of legislation coming out of Sen.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) is working on legislation that would pressure cable and satellite TV providers to allow their customers to pick and choose the channels they pay for, his office confirmed on Wednesday [...] In addition to pressuring cable providers to offer channels a la carte, McCain's new bill would bar TV networks from bundling their broadcast stations with cable channels they own during negotiations with the cable companies, according to industry sources. So for example, the Disney Company, which owns both ABC and ESPN, could not force a cable provider to pay for ESPN in order to carry ABC. The industry officials said the bill would also end the sports blackout rule, which prohibits cable companies from carrying a sports event if the game is blacked out on local broadcast television stations.</Msg><Username>goofyteabillies</Username><Timestamp>1368121353347</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 13:42:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368121374683-71</Id><Title>Why is CSCO trading so cheap?

Darrell Issa (R-California), “Hillary Clinton’s suspiciously high poll numbers and what can be done to make them lower.” “With the help of Fox News, we have brutally attacked Hillary Clinton for months, and yet she remains more popular than ever,” Rep. Issa said. “This committee needs to know how that happened, and how we can keep it from happening in the future.” Rep. Issa pointed to recent polls showing the former Secretary of State trouncing every potential G.O.P. Presidential candidate, “even a skinnier version of Chris Christie.” “We demand an answer to one simple question,” he said. “What does Secretary Clinton know that none of us knows?” In his boldest allegation of the day, Rep. Issa accused Secretary Clinton of “cynically using her post as Secretary of State to become wildly popular with the American people.” “I invite her to these hearings to answer those charges,” he said. Wrapping up for the day, Rep. Issa warned the former Secretary of State that he was just getting started: “Once we Republicans decide to investigate someone, we don’t stop. If Secretary Clinton doesn’t believe me, she should ask her husband.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368129909416</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:05:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368129964264-129</Id><Topic><Title>"The Big Benghazi Theory- ""if""</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368129825093</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:03:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The fact that you get your news from Jon Stewart speaks volumes about your low level of intelligence.</Msg><Username>tljarvis1968</Username><Timestamp>1368129964264</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:06:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368130064288-130</Id><Topic><Title>"The Big Benghazi Theory- ""if""</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368129825093</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:03:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you get yours from Hee haw commercials</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368130064288</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:07:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368130081143-131</Id><Topic><Title>"The Big Benghazi Theory- ""if""</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368129825093</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:03:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hillary is americas next president</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368130081143</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:08:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368130134884-132</Id><Topic><Title>IF FRITO-LAY CONVERTED ALL DEMOCRATS TO SNACK FOOD, WOULD AMERICA.......</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1368128670321</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 15:44:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Walter, brilliant thought. signed, Walterbyrdman11....(me)</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1368130134884</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:08:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368130169507-133</Id><Topic><Title>What the Benghazi hearings are really all about</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368129909416</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:05:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Posting trash like this shows why you have no credibility.

About 56 percent of adults surveyed said they had a positive opinion of Clinton versus 29 percent who view her negatively, according to a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday. On the Republican side, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky – both potential presidential candidates – are closely matched in popularity. Rubio is viewed positively by 28 percent of adults compared to Paul's 27 percent. About 16 percent of people say they have a negative view of Rubio versus 23 percent for Paul. Rubio and Paul are seen as rising stars in their party, with Rubio about to go on a media blitz promoting an immigration reform package he helped craft and Paul making a high-profile appearance at Howard University in an attempt to reach out to black voters. George W. Bush remains an unpopular figure, according to the poll. About 35 percent of people say they have a positive opinion of him versus 44 percent who have a negative one.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368131364869</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:29:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368131589469-147</Id><Title>Attacks on Hillary should really help the GOPERS</Title><Msg>get the women to vote for them, LOL can any of you tea billies pronounce misogynist?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368131589469</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:33:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368131760871-148</Id><Topic><Title>benghazi nonsense</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368113933513</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 11:38:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>talking points were signed off by Petraeus, I think he was a GOPER hero, funny how he was covering up for Obama, LOL WASHINGTON — David H.

Corsicana police on Thursday identified the victim as Kinsler Davis. Police Chief Randy Bratton says the father called 911 on Wednesday night to report the shooting. The wounded boy was transported to a Corsicana hospital and then on to a Dallas hospital where he died later Wednesday. Bratton says the boy apparently found a handgun in a bedroom.

They could have easily sent in troops and aircraft to save those 4 Americans but chose to watch them die on closed circuit tv and laugh about it then go campaign in Vegas and plan their cover-up. Hussein FLAT OUT LIED to the WORLD at the U.N. when he tried to spew his evil propaganda about the video and Hillary FLAT OUT LIED to the Nation when SHE tried to spread her USUAL lies and racist Rice tried to spew her FLAT OUT LIES 5 TIMES on different tv shows. Too bad none of their anti American fascist leftist lib follower care about how much they FLAT OUT LIE or how many Americans they murder.
