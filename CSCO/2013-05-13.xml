Those found guilty of racketeering can be fined up to $25,000 and sentenced to 20 years in prison per racketeering count. In addition, the racketeer must forfeit all ill-gotten gains and interest in any business gained through a pattern of "racketeering activity." RICO also permits a private individual harmed by the actions of such an enterprise to file a civil suit; if successful, the individual can collect treble damages (damages in triple the amount of actual/compensatory damages). When the U.S. Attorney decides to indict someone under RICO, he or she has the option of seeking a pre-trial restraining order or injunction to temporarily seize a defendant's assets and prevent the transfer of potentially forfeitable property, as well as require the defendant to put up a performance bond. This provision was placed in the law because the owners of Mafia-related shell corporations often absconded with the assets. An injunction and/or performance bond ensures that there is something to seize in the event of a guilty verdict. In many cases, the threat of a RICO indictment can force defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges, in part because the seizure of assets would make it difficult to pay a defense attorney. Despite its harsh provisions, a RICO-related charge is considered easy to prove in court, as it focuses on patterns of behavior as opposed to criminal acts.[4] There is also a provision for private parties to sue. A "person damaged in his business or property" can sue one or more "racketeers". The plaintiff must prove the existence of an "enterprise". The defendant(s) are not the enterprise; in other words, the defendant(s) and the enterprise are not one and the same. There must be one of four specified relationships between the defendant(s) and the enterprise: either the defendant(s) invested the proceeds of the pattern of racketeering activity into the enterprise; or the defendant(s) acquired or maintained an interest in, or control over, the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity; or the defendant(s) conducted or participated in the affairs of the enterprise "through" the pattern of racketeering activity; or the defendant(s) conspired to do one of the above. In essence, the enterprise is the illegal device of the racketeers. A civil RICO action, like many lawsuits based on federal law, can be filed in state or federal court.[5] Both the federal and civil components allow the recovery of treble damages. Although its primary intent was to deal with organized crime, Blakey said that Congress never intended it to merely apply to the Mob. He once told Time, "We don't want one set of rules for people whose collars are blue or whose names end in vowels, and another set for those whose collars are white and have Ivy League diplomas."[4] Under the law, the meaning of racketeering activity is set out at 18 U.S.C. § 1961. As currently amended it includes: Any violation of state statutes against gambling, murder, kidnapping, extortion, arson, robbery, bribery, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in the Controlled Substances Act); Any act of bribery, counterfeiting, theft, embezzlement, fraud, dealing in obscene matter, obstruction of justice, slavery, racketeering, gambling, money laundering, commission of murder-for-hire, and several other offenses covered under the Federal criminal code (Title 18); Embezzlement of union funds; Bankruptcy fraud or securities fraud; Drug trafficking; long-term and elaborate drug networks can also be prosecuted using the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute; Criminal copyright infringement; Money laundering and related offenses; Bringing in, aiding or assisting aliens in illegally entering the country (if the action was for financial gain); Acts of terrorism. Pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity. The U.S. Supreme Court has instructed federal courts to follow the continuity-plus-relationship test in order to determine whether the facts of a specific case give rise to an established pattern. Predicate acts are related if they "have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events." (H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.) Continuity is both a closed and open ended concept, referring to either a closed period of conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1368430629672</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 03:37:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368430669881-3</Id><Topic><Title>Bringing in, aiding or assisting aliens in illegally entering the country is a crime covered by the RICO-act</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1368430629672</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 03:37:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AccessHealthSource On August 31, 2010, eleven defendants were indicted on RICO charges for allegedly assisting AccessHealthSource, a local health care provider, in obtaining and maintaining lucrative contracts with local and state government entities in the city of El Paso, Texas, “through bribery of and kickbacks to elected officials or himself and others, extortion under color of authority, fraudulent schemes and artifices, false pretenses, promises and representations and deprivation of the right of citizens to the honest services of their elected local officials” (see indictment).[23]</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1368430669881</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 03:37:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368430703796-4</Id><Topic><Title>Bringing in, aiding or assisting aliens in illegally entering the country is a crime covered by the RICO-act</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1368430629672</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 03:37:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kwame Kilpatrick The former mayor of Detroit, Kwame Kilpatrick and his childhood friend Bobby Ferguson were convicted on March 11, 2013 under the RICO statute of using his office to run a criminal organization to extort bribes in exchange for city contracts.

In 2008, two non partisan groups released a study that determined that President Bush and his top aides made 935 false statements about the security risk posed by Iraq in the two years following September 11, 2001. The study’s conclusions were further reinforced when former Bush White House press secretary Scott McClellan wrote, “top Bush aides had outlined a strategy for carefully orchestrating the coming campaign to aggressively sell the war… In the permanent campaign era, it was all about manipulating sources of public opinion to the president’s advantage.” (What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington’s Culture of Deception) These statements were part of a deliberate campaign, according to the study conducted by the Center for Public Integrity and the Fund for Independence in Journalism. They concluded, “The false statements dramatically increased in August 2002, with congressional consideration of a war resolution, then escalated through the mid-term elections and spiked even higher from January 2003 to the eve of the invasion… In short, the Bush administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information that it methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against Iraq on March 19, 2003.”</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368453282127</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:54:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368453339509-29</Id><Topic><Title>How we doing?</Title><Username>lucenatraveler</Username><Timestamp>1368453062050</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:51:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looks like one sad soul isn't happy today.

Draft audit shows IRS non-profit scrutiny extended beyond 'tea party' and 'patriot' keywords Washington Post: At various points over the past two years, Internal Revenue Service officials singled out for scrutiny not only groups with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names but also nonprofit groups that criticized the government and sought to educate Americans about the U.S. Constitution, according to documents in an audit conducted by the agency’s inspector general. The documents, obtained by The Washington Post from a congressional aide with knowledge of the findings, show that the IRS field office in charge of evaluating applications for tax-exempt status decided to focus on groups making statements that “criticize how the country is being run” and those that were involved in educating Americans “on the Constitution and Bill of Rights.” Other flags included mentions of Federal debt and "9/12," which as you may recall was a Glenn Beck™ thing. Predictably, Republicans seizing on this as a political issue, but condemnation of political targeting goes across the political spectrum. Even the IRS itself acknowledges, there's no defending what took place. The appendix of the inspector general’s report — which was requested by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and has yet to be publicly released — chronicles the extent to which the IRS’s exempt organizations division kept redefining what sort of “social welfare” groups it should single out for extra attention since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. That decision allowed corporations and labor unions to raise and spend unlimited sums on elections as well as register for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, as long as their “primary purpose” was not targeting electoral candidates.</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368460681171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:58:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368460800747-66</Id><Topic><Title>head of IRS is a bush appointed republican</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368455154694</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 10:25:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior is always good for a laugh.Can't take him seriously.</Msg><Username>hairyroid</Username><Timestamp>1368460800747</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:00:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368460862541-67</Id><Topic><Title>head of IRS is a bush appointed republican</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368455154694</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 10:25:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>beat you like a baby seal today harey carey</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368460862541</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:01:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368460951466-68</Id><Topic><Title>head of IRS is a bush appointed republican</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368455154694</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 10:25:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Enjoy.LOL</Msg><Username>hairyroid</Username><Timestamp>1368460951466</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:02:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368461032001-69</Id><Title>USING IRS AS A WEAPON.....politicization of tragedy is a common Obama behavior, but</Title><Msg>weaponization of bureaucracy is more of a 'Chicago-Style' of thuggishness.

The underlying narrative is it says this bunch of technically pure nonpolitical and then they produce a product which is then doctored by a bunch of political people either at State or at the Whitehouse; my reading of the evidence is that a very terrible event happened at a CIA, basically a CIA facility, they went into intense blame shifting mode, trying to shift responsibility onto the State Department, onto anywhere else, and the State Department pushed back. They said no, it is not our fault. It’s you facility. And so they push back and they say why we are suddenly releasing information that we haven’t been releasing so far. So the CIA was super aggressive, there was some pushback, out of that bureaucratic struggle all the talking points were reduced to mush and then politics was inserted into it. So I don’t think we should necessarily say this is politics intruding on a CIA pure operation.</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368461477020</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:11:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368462057602-74</Id><Title>IRS targets</Title><Msg>Tea party believers , the IRS formally apologized for it.

The FBI said in a Monday statement that it believes "the lives of several local residents were potentially saved" by the search and arrest.

OBAMA vowed action if charges of "outrageous" IRS political bias turn out to be true</Title><Msg>President Barack Obama said Monday that he first learned the IRS may have improperly targeted conservative political groups when the news broke late last week and vowed action if charges of "outrageous" political bias turn out to be true. If Internal Revenue Service officials improperly examined the tax-exempt status of groups with conservative leanings, "then that’s outrageous, and there’s no place for it, and they have to be held fully accountable," Obama said during a joint question-and-answer session with British Prime Minister David Cameron in the East Room in the White House. But Obama emphasized that an investigation was underway and that he did not want to rush to judgment. "You don’t want the IRS ever being perceived to be biased and anything less than neutral in how they operate," the president said. The IRS must have "absolute integrity."</Msg><Username>mister_common_sense</Username><Timestamp>1368465458425</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:17:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368465488114-116</Id><Title>MAYBE WE SHOULD BLAME THE FORMER HEAD OF THE STATE DEPT???</Title><Msg>No,that would make too much sense.Wasn't she appointed by Obama?

Owens emphasized that there is nothing in the IRS rules that prohibits tax-exempt educational nonprofits from attacking specific companies or from zeroing in on one company—as long as there is no private benefit to that company's competitor—so Media Matters' increasing focus on Fox News over the past few years does not trigger a violation.</Msg><Username>ubiquitous_board_troll</Username><Timestamp>1368468963840</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:16:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368468978352-205</Id><Topic><Title>Imagine Black People Eating Lobster</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368468678745</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:11:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DING DING DING ROTF!!!!</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1368468978352</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:16:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368468994070-206</Id><Title>The Bush Apology Tour</Title><Msg>Former U.S. President George W.

One interesting thing about the voters who think Benghazi is the biggest political scandal in American history is that 39% of them don't actually know where it is. 10% think it's in Egypt, 9% in Iran, 6% in Cuba, 5% in Syria, 4% in Iraq, and 1% each in North Korea and Liberia with 4% not willing to venture a guess. I guess these numbers aren't really that big a shock: If you're so dumb that you think Benghazi is the biggest scandal ever, it's not surprising if you don't know where it is.

It does not advocate moral rectitude or understand the critical role of morality in human relating. The liberal agenda does not comprehend an identity of competence, appreciate its importance, or analyze the developmental conditions and social institutions that promote its achievement. The liberal agenda does not understand or recognize personal sovereignty or impose strict limits on coercion by the state. It does not celebrate the genuine altruism of private charity. It does not learn history’s lessons on the evils of collectivism.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368476677140</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:24:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368476883837-344</Id><Topic><Title>We finally got enough evidence to impeach Obama</Title><Username>ntack5</Username><Timestamp>1368476661660</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:24:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the fact that he feels he needed to talk about it shows guilt.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368476883837</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:28:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368476938666-345</Id><Topic><Title>We finally got enough evidence to impeach Obama</Title><Username>ntack5</Username><Timestamp>1368476661660</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:24:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did you impeach him yet?

It is a government everywhere doing everything for everyone. The liberal motto is “In Government We Trust.” To rescue the people from their troubled lives, the agenda recommends denial of personal responsibility, encourages self-pity and other-pity, fosters government dependency, promotes sexual indulgence, rationalizes violence, excuses financial obligation, justifies theft, ignores rudeness, prescribes complaining and blaming, denigrates marriage and the family, legalizes all abortion, defies religious and social tradition, declares inequality unjust, and rebels against the duties of citizenship. Through multiple entitlements to unearned goods, services and social status, the liberal politician promises to ensure everyone’s material welfare, provide for everyone’s healthcare, protect everyone’s self-esteem, correct everyone’s social and political disadvantage, educate every citizen, and eliminate all class distinctions. With liberal intellectuals sharing the glory, the liberal politician is the hero in this melodrama. He takes credit for providing his constituents with whatever they want or need even though he has not produced by his own effort any of the goods, services or status transferred to them but has instead taken them from others by force.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368477221381</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:33:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368477358731-351</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368476677140</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:24:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It should be apparent by now that these social policies and the passions that drive them contradict all that is rational in human relating, and they are therefore irrational in themselves. But the faulty conceptions that lie behind these passions cannot be viewed as mere cognitive slippage. The degree of modern liberalism’s irrationality far exceeds any misunderstanding that can be attributed to faulty fact gathering or logical error. Indeed, under careful scrutiny, liberalism’s distortions of the normal ability to reason can only be understood as the product of psychopathology. So extravagant are the patterns of thinking, emoting, behaving and relating that characterize the liberal mind that its relentless protests and demands become understandable only as disorders of the psyche.

The nature of these failures is detailed below. Among their consequences are the liberal mind’s relentless efforts to misrepresent human nature and to deny certain indispensable requirements for human relating. In his efforts to construct a grand collectivist utopia—to live what Jacques Barzun has called “the unconditioned life” in which “everybody should be safe and at ease in a hundred ways”—the radical liberal attempts to actualize in the real world an idealized fiction that will mitigate all hardship and heal all wounds. (Barzun 2000). He acts out this fiction, essentially a Marxist morality play, in various theaters of human relatedness, most often on the world’s economic, social and political stages. But the play repeatedly folds. Over the course of the Twentieth Century, the radical liberal’s attempts to create a brave new socialist world have invariably failed. At the dawn of the Twenty-first Century his attempts continue to fail in the stagnant economies, moral decay and social turmoil now widespread in Europe. An increasingly bankrupt welfare society is putting the U.S. on track for the same fate if liberalism is not cured there. Because the liberal agenda’s principles violate the rules of ordered liberty, his most determined efforts to realize its visionary fantasies must inevitably fall short. Yet, despite all the evidence against it, the modern liberal mind believes his agenda is good social science. It is, in fact, bad science fiction. He persists in this agenda despite its madness.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1368477449472</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:37:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368477469337-354</Id><Topic><Title>Watergate was nothing,</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1368476139305</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:15:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Watergate was a criminal event and people went to prison got it.

The latest findings from Pew Research Center released on Monday found that only 44 percent of Americans were following the hearing "very" or "fairly" closely. By contrast, 56 percent said they followed the hearing either "not too closely" or "not at all." Those numbers are largely unchanged from Pew's findings on the question in January, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified on Benghazi.

The criminal contempt charge passed on a vote of 255 yeas to 67 nays – 17 Democrats voted with Republicans in favor of contempt, and two Republicans — Reps. Scott Rigell of Virginia and Steven LaTourette of Ohio — voted no. More than 100 Democrats declined to vote for or against the charges, and instead staged a walkout of the House chambers to protest the action. the executive privilege claim and the documents being withheld will either show the White House was involved in the fallout and cover-up of the operation, or that the president’s executive privilege claim is frivolous.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1368490892182</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 20:21:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368491610578-403</Id><Title>Honeymoon must be over, Obama: "Why is everyone picking on me?"</Title><Msg>US Gov't Secretly Spied on Reporters In a startling revelation, a global news organization says the Obama administration secretly collected records of many journalists.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1368491610578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 20:33:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368494346969-404</Id><Topic><Title>Honeymoon must be over, Obama: "Why is everyone picking on me?"</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1368491610578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 20:33:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Could the immortal one be mortal after all??</Msg><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1368494346969</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 21:19:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368494739005-405</Id><Topic><Title>Honeymoon must be over, Obama: "Why is everyone picking on me?"</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1368491610578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 20:33:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Benghazi, IRS, and AP phone records in the news today.
