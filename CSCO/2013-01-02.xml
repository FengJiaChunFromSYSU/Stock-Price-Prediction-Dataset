Some five million fraudulent home mortgages are in the hands of illegal aliens, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. It's not known how many of those have contributed to the subprime housing mortgage meltdown, but it has affected every state, including Arizona. The problem began years ago when banks were forced to give mortgages without confirming social security numbers or borrower identification. As a result, illegal immigrants were able to obtain home mortgages which they could not afford. One illegal alien was arrested this year in Tucson after allegedly using a stolen social security number to buy two homes and rack up over $780,000 in bad debt.</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1357135949872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 09:12:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357136028365-34</Id><Topic><Title>Isn't ID theft a little more serious then</Title><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1357135949872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 09:12:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, almost forgot the 11million illegals in the USA number hasn't changed in over 15 years.

Actually, they're winning. To see this, you just need to step back and look at the tax deal and the country's fiscal trends from a broader perspective. Yesterday, the government voted to extend almost all of the Bush Tax Cuts permanently. Not temporarily, as a stimulus measure. Permanently. Ever since the Bush Tax Cuts were first enacted in 2001, one goal of the Republican party has been to "make the Bush Tax Cuts permanent." For most of the last decade, this goal has seemed like an extremist view: Making the Bush Tax Cuts permanent would drastically reduce the federal government's revenue. It would also increase inequality and balloon the national debt and deficit--so how could we possibly justify doing that? And yet now, suddenly, almost all of the Bush Tax Cuts are permanent. And the definition of "rich" in America has been significantly increased: The only Americans subject to a minor increase in income taxes will be households making more than $450,000 a year. The Republicans also got another good deal for America's investor and owner class, making the Bush dividend tax cut permanent. This saves a lot of money in tax bills for America's wealthier investors. And the tax deal even socked it to the working class. How? By not extending the payroll tax cut. This payroll tax cut added an extra $2,000 a year in the pockets of everyone who works for their money. The payroll tax hits everyone who earns wages, including the richest Americans, but it's a highly "regressive" tax: It takes a much bigger percentage of the income of those who earn less than $110,000 a year than it does from the richest Americans. So the Republicans have won a battle there, too</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357148605768</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 12:43:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357148901347-105</Id><Title>obama has been talking about helping the middle class</Title><Msg>for 5 years...now they get HC taxes and payroll taxes bringing home less pay. sad really.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357148901347</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 12:48:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357148981824-106</Id><Topic><Title>one of the Najarian brothers sold everything ahead of the Fiscal Cliff</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1357130027981</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 07:33:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're right fluteman.

Participants consisted of a group of homophobic men (n = 35) and a group of nonhomophobic men (n = 29); they were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the Index of Homophobia (W. W. Hudson &amp; W. A. Ricketts, 1980). The men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual, male homosexual, and lesbian videotapes, and changes in penile circumference were monitored. They also completed an Aggression Questionnaire (A. H. Buss &amp; M. Perry, 1992 ). Both groups exhibited increases in penile circumference to the heterosexual and female homosexual videos. Only the homophobic men showed an increase in penile erection to male homosexual stimuli. The groups did not differ in aggression. Homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individual is either unaware of or denies.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357151241514</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 13:27:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357151242097-131</Id><Title>These rightwing teabillies,regular Pukes are SO</Title><Msg>easy it's almost criminal to tease them.ALMOST!!</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1357151242097</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 13:27:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357151245549-132</Id><Title>Just have to ask;</Title><Msg>how many people on this board believes Junior and dumb are idiots?</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1357151245549</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 13:27:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357151291374-133</Id><Topic><Title>dems true agenda</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357150154387</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 13:09:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumb cant focus. new it is an english teacher. sounds to me like you wont get rich playing english teacher on a stock message board either. keep up the good work.

WASHINGTON -- Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) is going after his fellow House Republicans after party leaders pulled a Hurricane Sandy relief bill from a floor vote on Tuesday, saying that New York and New Jersey residents should stop giving these lawmakers political contributions. "I'm saying right now, anyone from New York or New Jersey who contributes one penny to congressional Republicans is out of their minds," he said in an interview on Fox News. "Because what they did last night was put a knife in the back of New Yorkers and New Jerseyans. It was an absolute disgrace." The House adjourned on Tuesday night without passing the $60.4 billion Sandy relief package that the Senate approved last week. The 113th Congress will be sworn in on Thursday, meaning that the House and Senate would have to restart the entire legislative process if it takes it up. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) told CNN that money will be approved in the next Congress. "FEMA has plenty of money, there's no immediate needs," he said, referring to the federal agency that distributes disaster relief. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate said in early December that the agency had $4.8 billion to distribute and could fund Sandy programs through early spring -- a comment that House Republicans have pointed to as a reason not to rush the bill. But President Barack Obama on Wednesday called on House Republicans to bring the bill to a vote immediately. "When tragedy strikes, Americans come together to support those in need," the president said in a statement. "I urge Republicans in the House of Representatives to do the same, bring this important request to a vote today, and pass it without delay for our fellow Americans." In a CNN interview Wednesday morning, King criticized Rogers for his comment. "First, he doesn't know what he's talking about," said King on CNN. "Besides that, Hal Rogers has no problem coming to New York and raising money to put money in his pocket when he wants to raise it from New Yorkers. Secondly, the FEMA money was limited to $31,000 [for individuals]. That's not going to rebuild businesses." "Hal Rogers can play his game. He can suck up to the Republican speaker if he wants to, but ... stay out of New York. Raise your money down in Kentucky," he added. King also raised the possibility that he would vote against reelecting House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to his leadership post in the 113th Congress, saying, "My world turned upside-down last night, so I'm holding every vote in abeyance for now." King has been one of the most vocal lawmakers criticizing House leadership for the move, although he is far from alone. Reps. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) and Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) have denounced the GOP leadership, while Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) apologized to his constituents on the House floor for the lack of passage, saying, "I did all I could." New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) has announced he will hold a press conference at 2:00 p.m. about the issue. Part of the reason that members seem so upset is that they felt like they were duped and given the run-around. "I was chasing the Speaker all over the House floor last night, trying to talk to him and his staff," said King on CNN. "He kept telling me wait until the vote is over, wait until the fiscal cliff vote is over, everything will be taken care of. And then he was gone. He refused to meet with us. He actually yelled at Congressman [Frank] LoBiondo, saying, 'I'm not meeting with you people.'" Amid the outrage, Boehner is scheduled to meet with members of the New York and New Jersey delegation at 3:00 p.m. Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told The Huffington Post that the speaker is "committed to getting this bill passed this month."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1357154502335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:21:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357154541234-182</Id><Topic><Title>Cisco has a 2 day 4% move</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1357151830908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 13:37:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I dont see the word "ivan" anywhere in my post ??

The percentage of Americans satisfied with the direction of the country stands at a paltry 23 percent in a poll taken Dec. 14-17. By a margin of 50 to 47 percent, respondents said the country's best years are over. Fifty percent of respondents said it is somewhat or very unlikely that today's youth will have a better life than their parents. That pessimism and negativity extends to the president, according to the poll. When respondents were asked to choose adjectives to describe their feelings about the president's re-election, the poll showed the excitement and pride many Americans felt about the president's first term has diminished. Sixty-seven percent of respondents in November 2008 said they felt optimistic about the president's election and the same percentage said it made them feel proud. Last month those numbers fell to 52 percent for optimistic and 48 percent for proud. Forty-three percent of Americans surveyed also said they feel pessimistic about the president's re-election and 36 percent said it made them feel afraid—both increases from 2008.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357159080823</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 15:38:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357159102848-213</Id><Topic><Title>Moodys news alert</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1357156586439</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:56:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This nation will suffer much worst than 911 under this fraud #$%$ pocket filled pos.

McConnell left the Senate for the night, and Reid's staff said they'd get back to him by mid-morning. The White House sent Reid a list of suggested concessions as his staff debated what to send back to McConnell. Reid looked over the concessions the administration wanted to offer, crumpled up the paper and tossed it into his fireplace.

If you felt at risk of harm in a park or on the street, you could use lethal force to defend yourself. The shooting of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., drew national attention to these laws. Now, researchers who've studied the effect of the laws have found that states with a stand your ground law have more homicides than states without such laws. "These laws lower the cost of using lethal force," says Mark Hoekstra, an economist with Texas A&amp;M University who examined stand your ground laws. "Our study finds that, as a result, you get more of it." Hoekstra recently decided to analyze national crime statistics to see what happens in states that pass stand your ground laws. He found the laws are having a measurable effect on the homicide rate. "Our study finds that, that homicides go up by 7 to 9 percent in states that pass the laws, relative to states that didn't pass the laws over the same time period," he says. As to whether the laws reduce crime — by creating a deterrence for criminals — he says, "we find no evidence of any deterrence effect over that same time period." Hoekstra obtained this result by comparing the homicide rate in states before and after they passed the laws. He also compared states with the laws to states without the laws. "We find that there are 500 to 700 more homicides per year across the 23 states as a result of the laws," he said. There are about 14,000 homicides annually in the United States as a whole.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357170749967</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 18:52:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357171129307-277</Id><Topic><Title>Like I told you Obama plays chess, GOP tic tack toe</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357169800346</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 18:36:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's tic tac toe,Mr.Genius.</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1357171129307</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 18:58:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357171345313-278</Id><Topic><Title>GOP has always blocked the payroll tax, it doesn't benefit the rich, woopsie</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357167961358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 18:06:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Through????

Democrats spend less than republicons, always has been true and here are some of the facts. Here are the facts: In Reagan's first term, government spending grew 8.7 percent per year. In his second term, it grew 4.9 percent per year. Under Bush Sr., 5.4 percent per year. Under Clinton's two terms, 3.2 percent and 3.9 percent. Under Bush Jr., 7.3 percent and 8.1 percent. Got all those numbers? Okay. Brace yourself. Under Obama: 1.4 percent. Our current budget deficit has nothing to do with out-of-control Democratic spending and everything to do with a massive recession, tax cuts, two wars, and a scare campaign that Republicans have been successfully waging for decades to cover up their serial fiscal irresponsibility Credit goes to well known economist Anthony W.

Because what better way to begin the new year than with some good and very old fashioned race baiting? Here's an excerpt from Grothman's release: Of course, almost no black people today care about Kwanzaa—just white left-wingers who try to shove this down black people's throats in an effort to divide Americans. Irresponsible public school districts such as Green Bay and Madison (and who knows how many others, see links below) try to tell a new generation that blacks have a separate holiday than Christians. Waring Fincke, left-wing West Bend lawyer and vice chair of the Washington County Democratic Party, encouraged people to learn more about Kwanzaa in a column in July. Fortunately, almost all black people ignore Waring Fincke and his ilk and their efforts to divide Americans. Despite the fact that estimates say between 1 and 2 million blacks celebrate Kwanzaa in America—and up to 40 million worldwide—Grothman warns parents to "be on the lookout if a K-12 or college teacher tries to tell your children or grandchildren it's a real holiday." You know, as opposed to that Real Holiday in which the guy from the North Pole brings everyone in the world gifts to celebrate the time the virgin gave birth to God's son.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357174310590</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 19:51:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357174426214-297</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary checks out of the hospital</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357173419686</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 19:36:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good now we can get that LYING #$%$ to testify about Benghazi.

You mean the guy who came up with Kwanzaa wasn't a holy man like that?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357180015039</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 21:26:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357180118304-317</Id><Topic><Title>A thing called class</Title><Username>redangel6666</Username><Timestamp>1357172492488</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 19:21:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbivan and Junior are born losers.

The militia, officially called the Nauvoo Legion, was composed of Utah's Mormon settlers (members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church). Intending to give the appearance of Native American aggression, their plan was to arm some Southern Paiute Native Americans and persuade them to join with a larger party of their own militiamen—disguised as Native Americans—in an attack. During the militia's first assault on the wagon train, the emigrants fought back and a five-day siege ensued. Eventually fear spread among the militia's leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men, and had likely discovered the identity of their attackers. As a result militia commander William H. Dame ordered his forces to kill the emigrants. By this time the emigrants were running low on water and provisions, and allowed some approaching members of the militia—who carried a white flag—to enter their camp. The militia members assured the emigrants their protection and escorted them from the hasty fortification. After walking a distance from the camp, the militiamen, with the help of auxiliary forces hiding nearby, attacked the emigrants. Intending to leave no witnesses and to prevent reprisals to complicate the Utah War, the perpetrators killed all the adults and older children (totaling about 120 men, women, and children). Seventeen children, all younger than seven, were spared. Following the massacre, the perpetrators hastily buried the victims, leaving the bodies vulnerable to wild animals and the climate. Local families took in the surviving children, and many of the victims' possessions were auctioned off. Investigations, temporarily interrupted by the American Civil War, resulted in nine indictments during 1874. Of the men indicted, only John D. Lee was tried in a court of law. After two trials in the Utah Territory, Lee was convicted by a jury, sentenced to death, and executed.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357180600686</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 21:36:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357181275447-320</Id><Title>Republicans who were irresponsible and need to be primary-ed</Title><Msg>REPUBLICANS WHO NEED TO BE PRIMARY-ED ENEMIES Alabama Alaska Young, Donald “Don” Alaska At Large Arizona Arkansas Womack, Steve Arkansas's 3rd congressional district California Bilbray, Brian California's 50th congressional district Bono Mack, Mary California's 45th congressional district Calvert, Ken California's 44th congressional district, Denham, Jeff California's 19th congressional district Dreier, David California's 26th congressional district Gallegly, Elton California's 24th congressional district Herger, Walter “Wally” California's 2nd congressional district Lungren, Daniel E.
