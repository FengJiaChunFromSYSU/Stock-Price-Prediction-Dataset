Obviously, when government is too lame to allow job creation, it is one way to feed the poor. It actually works better when the poor are given menial chores to perform in service of the government, like teaching preschool or something. Maybe that's what Obama was saying?

School districts with military ties from coast-to-coast are bracing for increased class sizes and delayed building repairs. Others already have axed sports teams and even eliminated teaching positions, but still may have to tap savings just to make it through year's end. But there's little hope for softening any future financial blows. "Next year is scarier than this year," said Sharon Adams, chief financial officer for Muscogee County schools in Georgia. The district serves the U.S. Army's Fort Benning and could lose $300,000 in federal funding out of its $270 million in general funds before the end of the school year — and more than four times that in 2013-2014.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1362226446485</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 07:14:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362226775397-26</Id><Title>yeah this should help the GOP in the midterm elections, LOL</Title><Msg>A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday showed 28 percent of Americans blamed congressional Republicans for the sequestration mess, 18 percent thought Obama was responsible and 4 percent blamed congressional Democrats.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1362226775397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 07:19:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362227138338-27</Id><Title>only in the rabbit hole is a blacks right to vote</Title><Msg>a racial entitlement, LOL Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said she was offended by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dismissal of the 1965 Voting Rights Act as a racial “entitlement.” “Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes,” Scalia said during Supreme Court debate in the Shelby County (Alabama) voting rights case earlier this week. Jackson Lee, who visited the courtroom during the case, said the provision of the Act under question was not a racial entitlement. “It simply says that you will have the right to vote that has been given to all citizens,” the Houston Democrat said on MSNBC’s Ed Show. “Why a justice would classify the simple protected right to vote as ‘racial entitlements’ baffles me and offends me.” Scalia, one of the court’s most conservative voices, said that political pressure will prevent lawmakers from voting against the measure.

Yes, right on the mark. The development of all-news cable channels and the consequent proliferation of live political programming have given rise to more aggressive attempts to control the news cycle, which I describe as surrogate spin. Spin in this manifestation parallels the role lawyers play in the judicial process. Surrogate spin operates on a basic democratic principle: the greater the number of credible people who zealously defend a person, the more credible that person’s cause appears. Designated stand-ins debate one another on shows like Crossfire, Hanaty and Combs, and Larry King Live, allowing campaigns to try out new sound bites and attack strategies; at the same time, multiple appearances on the talk show circuit multiply the potential for mistakes and misstatements that must themselves be ‘spun away.’ The process feeds itself in a twenty-four hour cycle. Spin in many ways represents a game played between political campaigns and news journalists under conditions of uncertainty. In he CNN Spin Zone... the top is spinning out of control. We have entered into the vortex of the tornado. Thank God for the Wizard of Oz... because of the wonderful things he does.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1362251299283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 14:08:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362251974927-90</Id><Topic><Title>Yoho, It's actually hard to predict</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1362248934846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 13:28:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OZ reference: Great.

"You see according to Graham, Mr. Market is an irrational sort of fellow. Some days, he shows up at your door offering ridiculous bids for the stocks you own, while on other days he sells at prices that much too low. Smart investors like Graham profit from market folly rather than participate in it... Put another way, you should only buy when the price offered makes sense, and you should sell when the price becomes too high."

And as long as they are getting benefit from it -- whether monetary, emotional, comfort, entertainment or psychological stability -- they will continue to engage in those actions. But realize that most of the time the person is too busy doing the behavior to see their actions in this context. This loop takes on a different form in the blamer's reality. This is partly because 'evaluation' is run through a couple of other filters. As long as everything works out for the blamer, these filters won't necessarily reveal themselves. This is what could be said to be happening inside the blamer's mind (2) when his/her behavior does NOT produce the desired results. When negative consequences result, it is all someone else's fault. This creates a one way flow that serves the purpose to protect the blamer's core delusions or meet the blamer's desires. Realize these three elements form a complex -- and self-reinforcing -- cocktail. A cocktail that that becomes a powerful motivational force for the blamer each time the deception succeeds. It becomes something that he/she is dedicated to protecting at all costs. Obama is out again today bashing his sequester. It is the continuation and protection of these 'filters' that leads to the rest of the process. Upon arriving at the red right (and despite the cross traffic), the person decides to cross any way. This is a selfish decision (while there might be a legitimate reason to cross, most jaywalking really is based in impatience -- which could be any mix of the cocktail). The results of this action is the person is struck by an oncoming car. This is where the blame process kicks in, instead of taking responsibility for his/her action that had unintended consequences, the blamer begins to find others to blame. Dr. Stone correctly diagnosed that Obama has Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Not fit to lead.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1362256494208</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 15:34:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362256509011-102</Id><Topic><Title>Cisco Systems Insider Trading Reported</Title><Username>isaiahlyons50</Username><Timestamp>1361369710669</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 09:15:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>vancelayne</Username><Timestamp>1362256509011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 15:35:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362256516876-103</Id><Title>Obamagedden has come and Gone</Title><Msg>and guess what, we are still here. all that belly aching, about the sky falling has him eating crow. march 27th will be the real test .</Msg><Username>joespada282</Username><Timestamp>1362256516876</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 15:35:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362256583745-104</Id><Topic><Title>MAD MONEY FEATURES Cisco Systems.

Benedict did a very wise thing. Obama’s mother had sex with a married African-Kenyan, a Muslim, after a Russian class. There is also plethora of literature to suggest that Obama’s "father" was a committed communist at the time he and Obama’s mother were involved in their "relationship." Obama’s mother divorced his father within a year, and then remarried to another man who was also a Muslim and citizen of Indonesia. Barack Obama lived mostly in environments dominated by Islam until he was ten years old. Obama’s religion was listed in his Indonesian school as Islam. With an Islamic father and stepfather, and registered as an Islamic, it is reasonable to assume he was subjected to Islamic indoctrination and teachings. Raised by atheists and Muslims, never a Christian, Obama strangely becomes a Christian and joins the Trinity Christian Church headed by anti-American, Marxist, racist, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, in 1988. Obama not only attended this church for 20 years, he was deeply involved in its activities. Being labeled as a “Christian” strongly helps achieving political power, certainly more than atheist or Muslim. Despite many Columbia U. enrollees interviewed from that period, same major (political science), including George Stephanopolous, no one remembers Obama on campus or in class. In 1992, Reverend Wright presided over the marriage of Barack and Michelle Obama. However, there is no record that can be found of a prior relationship Obama had with any other women, until Michelle. No past girl friends. The first gay President gets a #$%$ hag wife. Obama was instrumental in assisting the J$ew-hating leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrahkan, in formulating the Million-Man March on Washington in 1995. Obama wrote an autobiography, “Dreams Of My Father”, published in 1995. But why? Curiously, he’s a young man who has yet to accomplish anything. It was a book to re-create a past.

In his interview with German Focus magazine, Grillo urged for the renegotiation of Italy’s €2-trillion debt, which is the second highest in the euro zone after Greece, at 127 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). “Right now we are being crushed, not by the euro, but by our debt. When the interest payments reach €100 billion a year, we’re dead. There’s no alternative,” the 64-year-old said. According to the Five Star Movement leader’s forecast, the Italian political system has "only six months" left before it collapses and the state will no longer be able "to pay pensions and public sector salaries". If there’ll be no changes to the debt obligations, Grillo believes, the option for his country would be to leave the euro and return to it's former national currency, the lira. "If I've bought shares in a company that goes bankrupt, then that's my bad luck. I took a risk, and lost," he explained, drawing a comparison with the private market. “If the conditions remain the same, Italy would leave the euro and return to the lira.” The Five Star Movement has attracted the sympathy of nearly a quarter of the many austerity-weary voters to win 109 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 54 seats in the Senate in the general election on February 24-25.
