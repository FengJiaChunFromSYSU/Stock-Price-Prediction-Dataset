They are not investing that money. Don't need too. The top increased income 25% last year while all other income groups lost. Tax policy is way out of balance favoring the rich. In early whaling ships the Captain got 6 times what the lowest paid worker got. Compare that to what management takes home today relative to the blue collar worker It is not what this country was founded on and not what makes a robust economy. You must provide policy that strengthens the middle class not the rich. By the way, spending cuts take money out of recovery just like tax raises do.
