The political press with nothing else to do reports it. They say Romney is closing the polling gap. It is baloney - hyped reporting to beef viewership. Like him or not, the Electoral College vote favors Obama by a substantial margin. Romney may be gaining popularity, but not materially in key states. To win Romney would have to take Penn, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. His chances are thin. Don't gets revved up because of current media reporting.

Obama released a BAD and amateurish copy of a COLB. Experts have already called it a fraud. Based on your approach, why aren't you asking for Obama's past records that he has sealed up. Obama has sealed up or won't explain all kinds of questions from his past. Why does he have a SS# originating from Connecticut, why does his Selective Service card have BAD numbers on it, How did go from Columbia to Occidental with average grades and NO money. How did he get into Harvard? These are all very serious questions that he can't answer or refuses to answer. He has PAID lawyers a million or more to fight to conseal this information. So it begs the question, WHAT is he hiding. You can say what you want about the BC, but it was a pathetic joke of an attempt to commit fraud. Experts have picked it apart and called it a bad JOKE.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1344358345260</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 12:52:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344358376000-26</Id><Title>After losing $240,000 on the calls....I sold the calls and bought the puts...</Title><Msg>And now with the stock so strong, I'm losing on the puts.</Msg><Username>jimmmeycrackcorn</Username><Timestamp>1344358376000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 12:52:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344358603378-27</Id><Topic><Title>why isn't Romney releasing the tax returns?</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1344339882505</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 07:44:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>get back to work and let the IRS do its job.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1344358603378</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 12:56:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344358769464-28</Id><Title>2012 looking like 2010.</Title><Msg>President Barack Obama is having more difficulty keeping 2008 supporters on his side than Mitt Romney is having holding onto John McCain voters, according to a new Gallup poll.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1344358769464</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 12:59:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344359250033-29</Id><Title>Is CSCO doubling dividend? 18 to 20 looks easy</Title><Msg>Or does street think they had a blow out quarter ..stock is looking too strong</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1344359250033</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 13:07:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344359613619-30</Id><Title>Why did reid shut up so fast?</Title><Msg>my sources say he is an idiot and likes to make stuff up. be nice if he were more worried about doing his job and passing a budget than be worried about mitts taxes...let the IRS do their jobs you need to do yours.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1344359613619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 13:13:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344359771195-31</Id><Topic><Title>why isn't Romney releasing the tax returns?</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1344339882505</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 07:44:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reagan , and other Presidents didn't release anything and nobody has released more than the two years tax returns Romney has. What is the point. There is a controversy, that Trump and Root were talking about , this points out that Obama was a foreign student at Columbia, same as at Occidental College. This opens up many questions Romney should call a press conference and issue a challenge in front of the nation. He should agree to release more of his tax returns, only if Obama unseals his college records. Simple and straight-forward. Mitt should ask “What could possibly be so embarrassing in your college records from 29 years ago, that you are afraid to let America’s voters see it? If it’s THAT bad, maybe it’s something the voters ought to see.” Suddenly the tables are turned. Now Obama is on the defensive. I can only think of one answer that would explain this mystery. Here’s my gut belief: Obama got a leg up by being admitted to both Occidental and Columbia as a foreign exchange student. He was raised as a young boy in Indonesia. But did his mother ever change him back to a U.S. citizen? When he returned to live with his grandparents in Hawaii or as he neared college-age preparing to apply to schools, did he ever change his citizenship back? I’m betting not. If you could unseal Obama’s Columbia University records I believe you’d find that: A) He rarely ever attended class. B) His grades were not those typical of what we understand it takes to get into Harvard Law School. C) He attended Columbia as a foreign exchange student. D) He paid little for either undergraduate college or Harvard Law School because of foreign aid and scholarships given to a poor foreign students like this kid Barry Soetoro from Indonesia. If you think I’m “fishing” then prove me wrong. Open up your records Mr. President. What are you afraid of? It’s time for Mitt to go on the attack and call Obama’s bluff.</Msg><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1344359771195</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 13:16:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344359892168-32</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P 1422 is serious level.</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1344351282651</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 10:54:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Market is getting ahead of itself again.

Obamacare is itself a 2 trillion dollar tax hike, and when your boss drops paying for your healthcare, your going to have to pick it up personally. The Bush tax cuts is at least a $3000 per person tax hike per year. Almost everyone in the middle class got part of the Bush tax cut. Letting it expire as Obama says he will not sign its extension will be the biggest tax hike ever. I don't understand why when Obama had that total control for two years of the congress that he didn't substitute something he wanted instead of the Bush tax cut? Well be that the biggest mystery about Obama economics, nobody can blame all these hikes on the GOP who are against these hugh tax increases. Just the fact that Romney is against these two programs means that taxes won't go up. Romney allowing over a trillion dollars of repatriated overseas profits will boost Cisco and other American Multinationals. If Romney allows drilling in the USA we will get lots of tax revenue from domestic oil and gas retrieval.</Msg><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1344372714858</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:51:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344372821235-84</Id><Topic><Title>GW Bush 5.3% UE......Obama 9% UE</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1344369415961</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 15:56:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>15% real rate the U6 measure that includes all the unemployed.</Msg><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1344372821235</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:53:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344373713059-85</Id><Topic><Title>GW Bush 5.3% UE......Obama 9% UE</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1344369415961</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 15:56:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama has no vision. most libs dont that is why they cant create jobs and wealth.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1344373713059</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 17:08:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344374362052-86</Id><Title>let us "Lean foward" shall we</Title><Msg>so raising the top 2% to prebush tax levels for a whopping 5-6 billion more a year in revs for irs pays for less than two days of government. now what? obama making a big deal about 6 billion a year acting like it will pay for the 6 trillion he spent in less than four. c'on man how can americans be so dumb.

Only ONE Justice out of the nine (~11% of the court) reached the conclusion that you incorrectly attribute to the majority. The four left-of-center Justices found that Obamacare's individual mandate was a legitimate exercise of the commerce clause power, and so didn't opine on whether or not it might also be supported as a legitimate exercise of the taxing and spending power. The four other (arch)conservative Justices found (necessarily and explicitly) that the individual mandate and associated noncompliance penalty was NOT a tax: otherwise they would have had to uphold it as constitutional. In fact, of the nine Justices, only Chief Justice Roberts found that the individual mandate "can be read" as a tax, hence should be upheld under the principal of judicial restraint and deferral to the legislative branch. In fact, Mitt Romney (aka Myth RobMe) HIMSELF states conclusively that the individual mandate is not a tax. However, Mitt Romney (aka Governor Etch-a-Sketch) strongly disagrees with this position.</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1344376859640</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 18:00:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344377166056-89</Id><Title>How far will csco drop after earnings?</Title><Msg>Most tech companies missed on the top line.

This doesn't include people who graduated from school the past couple of years, they are not counted as unemployed because they never got to work 6 months before being laid off so the dept. of labor doesn't qualify them for UE. So High School and College Grads would push this up by millions more. The statistics don't tell the story, I have lots of friends who don't have much experience and cannot get the starter jobs to gain the experience that the HR departments are looking for on a resume. So this country will have a whole generation of unemployed and underemployed youth. This will mean they will not be able to pay off College Tuition loans. And on the other end, the massive unemployed numbers have given us foreclosures, evictions, repos. low personal savings , business failures, slow economic growth because of lack of disposable income. People's retirement funds are depleted, Their houses are under water. Yet there are NUMB-SKULLS here who are so in love with the Messiah they would rather see him reelected for his failure, than give a businessman a chance to do better for the people.
