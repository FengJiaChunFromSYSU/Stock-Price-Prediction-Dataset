Laura Bassett: "Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), whose name is often mentioned as a potential 2016 presidential candidate, penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that calls for contraception to be made available over-the-counter. If women could buy birth control without a prescription, he argues, employers would not have to pay for it against their moral objections, and Democrats could no longer accuse Republicans of being anti-birth control...The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently came to the same conclusion: that birth control is safe enough that it should not require a prescription. However, making contraception available over the counter would require women to pay for it out of pocket, whereas the Affordable Care Act currently requires that it be covered under most insurance plans with no co-pay."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355666685358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 09:04:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355666931156-14</Id><Topic><Title>Kerry in line for secretary of state?</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1355619180044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 19:53:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Juniorgayboy you no all about sucking if you don,t have it in your mouth you got it on your mind.</Msg><Username>shwdl</Username><Timestamp>1355666931156</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 09:08:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355668536972-15</Id><Topic><Title>Everything should be "over the counter".</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355666685358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 09:04:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking as a Tea Party participant, I'd like all meds to be over the counter.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) vowed Sunday to introduce legislation to ban assault weapons at the start of the next Congress. “I’m going to introduce in the Senate and the same bill will be introduced in the House, a bill to ban assault weapons. It will ban the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession. Not retroactively but prospectively. And it will ban the same for big clips, drums or strips of more than 10 bullets. So there will be a bill. We’ve been working on it now for a year,” Feinstein said on NBC’s “Meet The Press” during a discussion about guns following Friday’s deadly mass shooting as a Connecticut school. Feinstein said she was confident such a measure could pass. In a separate interview on Sunday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he too was was optimistic about the prospect of passing a gun control measure. “I think we can get something done,” said Schumer on CBS’s “Face The Nation.” Schumer advocated focusing on three areas: Banning assault weapons, limiting the size of clips, and making it harder for “mentally unstable” individuals to obtain firearms. (i.e. tea baggers will not be allowed to own any firearms)</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355676790473</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 11:53:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355676890249-38</Id><Topic><Title>teabilly art doubles down on stupid: 'You might need to buy something to protect yourself from someone like me.'</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1355675940676</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 11:39:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ivan, art, birdbrain there all the same person, there just isn't room in the world for three people that stupid that can read and write</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355676890249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 11:54:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355677007465-39</Id><Topic><Title>The end of our world as we know it</Title><Username>cages_are_the_enemy</Username><Timestamp>1355632607208</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 23:36:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a lot of ways, he is a perfect choice.

Someone that is reserved, shy, isolated, shunned by others, always alone, unable to have any dealings in society, but found solace from a loving pet (cats/dogs) as a young child would grow up to become compassionate towards others, protect those that are weak in society, a tree hugger, against societal injustice, help those in poverty, against all violence and for banning of all guns, would be labeled in our society as a left-wing num-nut today.

Hopefully, they put a mandatory abortion clause for Liberal nutcases, and enough teeth in it to institutionlize the real whack jobs who post on Yahoo under multiple shizophrenic ID's. Sound like anybody you know?

Art is right about that!!! , “Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition,” Psychological Bulletin). In a nutshell, the article—by Stanford and UC Berkeley researchers—seems to suggest that conservatism is a mild form of insanity. Here are the facts. A meta-analysis culled from 88 samples in 12 countries, and with an N of 22,818, revealed that “several psychological variables predicted political conservatism.” Which variables exactly? In order of predictive power: Death anxiety, system instability, dogmatism/intolerance of ambiguity, closed-mindedness, low tolerance of uncertainty, high needs for order, structure, and closure, low integrative complexity, fear of threat and loss, and low self-esteem. The researchers conclude, a little chillingly, that “the core ideology of conservatism stresses resistance to change and a justification of inequality.” The above list of variables is more than a little unsavory. We are talking about someone full of fear, with a poor sense of self, and a lack of mental dexterity. I always tell my students that tolerance of ambiguity is one especially excellent mark of psychological maturity. It isn’t a black and white world. According to the research, conservatives possess precisely the opposite: an intolerance of ambiguity and an inability to deal with complexity. Maybe that’s one reason why Obama seems so distasteful to them: he is a nuanced, multi-faceted thinker who can see things from several different perspectives simultaneously. And he isn’t preaching fear, either.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355685763940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 14:22:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355685805290-71</Id><Topic><Title>KNEECROW UNION "PREACHER" THREATENS MI GOV.

They are characterized by steadfast conformity to group norms, submission to higher status individuals, and aggression toward out-groups and unconventional group members. On the RWA Scale, subjects are asked to agree or disagree with statements like: "Some of the worst people in our country nowadays are those who do not respect our flag, our leaders and the normal way things are supposed to be done" and "There is absolutely nothing wrong with nudist camps." Guess which one RWAs tend to agree with? Meyer-Emerick notes that high RWAs perceive the world as a significantly more dangerous place than those who score low. High RWAs are more submissive to government authority and indifferent to human rights. They also tend to be more hostile and more highly punitive toward criminals, and more racially and ethnically prejudiced—and religious!—to boot. In the United States, guess what? Republicans cluster at the high end of the RWA Scale whereas Democrats range across the scale. Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley essentially confirmed this view with an meta-analysis of scores of academic studies on conservative political attitudes last year. In the study, "Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition," the Berkeley researchers found common psychological factors linked to political conservatism include: fear and aggression, dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity, uncertainty avoidance, need for cognitive closure, and terror management that causes conservatives to shun and even punish outsiders and those who threaten the status of their cherished world views. The researchers did half-heartedly assure readers that their findings do not mean that "conservatism is pathological or that conservative beliefs are necessarily false, irrational, or unprincipled." Altemeyer, inventor of the RWA Scale, believes that there is no such thing as a Left Wing Authoritarian. "I do not think 'an authoritarian impressively like the authoritarian on the right' reposes on the left end of the RWA scale. Rather the contrary," Altemeyer declared. In fact, Altemeyer finds that low RWAs are "fair-minded, even-handed, tolerant, nonaggressive persons...They score low on my prejudice scale. They are not self-righteous; they do not feel superior to persons with opposing opinions." Another panelist, Charles Anthony Smith, a lawyer and Ph.D candidate in political science at the University of California at San Diego, explored evolutionary biology explanations for how these unsavory RWAs arose in our midst. In his talk, "Law, Leadership, and Lords: Machiavellian Intelligence and the Role of Obedience in Collective Action," Smith suggested that the propensity to obey would be adaptive in either attacking or defending groups. Those groups which could more quickly be organized to defend themselves would be more likely to survive. A deliberative outlook under such circumstances would be an evolutionary disadvantage. Smith believes that this evolutionary tendency toward obedience can explain a host of behaviors, including the initial rise of theocracies in which leaders manipulated the propensity to obey by claiming that the gods had given them the divine right to rule.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355687245796</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 14:47:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355687593567-76</Id><Topic><Title>this would go a long way to solving mass killings</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355685763940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 14:22:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"According to Professor Altemeyer, right-wing authoritarians are cognitively rigid, aggressive, and intolerant."

The goal of this petition is to force the Obama Administration to produce legislation that limits access to guns. While a national dialogue is critical, laws are the only means in which we can reduce the number of people murdered in gun related deaths. Powerful lobbying groups allow the ownership of guns to reach beyond the Constitution's intended purpose of the right to bear arms. Therefore, Congress must act on what is stated law, and face the reality that access to firearms reaches beyond what the Second Amendment intends to achieve. The signatures on this petition represent a collective demand for a bipartisan discussion resulting in a set of laws that regulates how a citizen obtains a gun.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355691419064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 15:56:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355691499117-89</Id><Title>Who needs an AR-15?</Title><Msg>Shooter used an AR-15 with high capacity clips to kill the people at the school.

Your liberal friends seem very good at demonstrating hostile and aggressive behavior on message boards. I just thought they were socially inept, and slightly mentally disturbed. Mostly I thought they were uniformed, and could be educated, but they have demonstrated that they don't have that mental capacity. I suppose one could then say that conservatives do have the mental capacity to understand that the hostility often begins with other party lying and using propaganda to destabilize the social fabric, thereby resulting in "Loading up for the inevitable social exchange" Ok, I will buy your explanation. When liberals threated to destabilize and create "social insecurity," the conservative will tend to load up now, and ask questions later. Conservatism is often the ability to learn from past mistakes. I was a kid once. I was a liberal, but I grew up.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355691913955</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 16:05:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355692328643-91</Id><Topic><Title>this quote explains why the tea baggers are always threatening people with violence</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355690903034</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 15:48:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So what happened in Michigan last week,dumdum??

A survey being released today suggests that they are moving even more in that direction. Among full-time faculty members at four-year colleges and universities, the percentage identifying as "far left" or liberal has increased notably in the last three years, while the percentage identifying in three other political categories has declined. The data come from the University of California at Los Angeles Higher Education Research Institute, which surveys faculty members nationwide every three years on a range of attitudes. Here are the data for the new survey and the prior survey: 2010-11 2007-8 Far left 12.4% 8.8% Liberal 50.3% 47.0% Middle of the road 25.4% 28.4% Conservative 11.5% 15.2% Far right 0.4% 0.7% Gauging how gradual or abrupt this shift is is complicated because of changes in the UCLA survey's methodology; before 2007-8, the survey included community college faculty members, who have been excluded since. But for those years, examining only four-year college and university faculty members, the numbers are similar to those of 2007-8. Going back further, one can see an evolution away from the center.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355695457828</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 17:04:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355695721279-108</Id><Topic><Title>125,000 signatures and growing, spread the word</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355691419064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 15:56:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only 125,000!

Especially when a bunch of lame brains throw together a grouping of meaningless statistics, and correlate the data with something called "confirmation bias." That is called Pseudo-science, or better yet, PROPAGANDA. Science is developed as a means to reasoned conclusions, not proofs. Some things can be shown to be reasonably expected to repeat. Not all things can. It does seem a reasonable conclusion to assert the age of the earth. It is by no means proven and one's faith may interfere with again "confirmation bias." It does seem unlikely that a supernatural event did not create the earth within the last ten thousand years. For one who has studied the origins of the Galaxy, it would even seem impossible. It's just not an undertaking for everyone, and unless one has the credible scientific background to explain it, it's probably not a real sociably accepted exclamation to present.

The methodology has failed so far. Maybe it will at least improve the dialogue in the future. All Americans are really liberals. Republicans are just liberal about things like "gun ownership," "TAXES," "the human rights of a fetus" and "the right to vote." They don't want the government interfering with their choices and their beliefs. They are a bit conservative about national security and the protection of the citizens from radical new and untested concepts. They are mostly older, and have experienced change enough to know that it isn't always a good idea to reinvent the wheel or try something new. Democrats seem to prefer to make changes, and then find out what's in them at a later date. "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" has kept many people from destroying perfectly good equipment, and most people learn young that putting your hand in a fire will burn you.

Almost a century and a half ago, senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, "Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr president, and God bless you." Well, in that same spirit, I say to president-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancour must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country.

It was a policy to put control of weapons in the hands of individuals who could resist foreign invasion and domestic threats. It was not limited to small arms, and could be extended to cannons at the time. When did the first law against sophisticated armament occur in modern history? There was no dicrimination in the constitution regarding the sophistication of "arms."

I can only hope that it helps for you to know that you’re not alone in your grief. That our world too has been torn apart. All across this land of ours we have wept with you,” Obama said. “Newtown, you are not alone.” Obama was the chief author of the speech he delivered in Newtown. BTW W never wrote a speech, he could barely read let alone write, even in the few moments he was sober.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355715622701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:40:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355716057267-170</Id><Topic><Title>The 2nd Ammendmant was written for settling a Wild unexplored land</Title><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1355712620791</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 21:50:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>for every post you can make where a gun protected someone I can post 43 where his gun killed a family member, how did that 7 year old die two days ago in PA, yeah his dad killed him by accident right, well no it wasn't an accident it was from stupidity, you gun nuts would say there is no sense in cancer treatment because once upon a time someone's cancer was miraculously cured, problem with the alternate reality world of the teabaggers is it doesn't recognize science so 1=43</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355716057267</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:47:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355716106220-171</Id><Topic><Title>Gettysburg address 2012</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355715622701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:40:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>do you think you have your nose far enough up his butt?</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355716106220</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:48:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355716616344-172</Id><Topic><Title>Gettysburg address 2012</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355715622701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:40:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" he could barely read let alone write" Typical of Harvard Law graduates, huh?

Most of the 43 were suicides, and the gun was used to kill himself. It's further evidence that those who use guns other than for family protection are nutcases, and further exemplifies the need for serious mental heath reform in the US. I am certain the quality of this board will improve after they work on your #$%$ brain.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355717153648</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 23:05:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355717645698-174</Id><Topic><Title>The 2nd Ammendmant was written for settling a Wild unexplored land</Title><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1355712620791</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 21:50:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow your right, over half were suicides, let's ignore the fact that 22 of those suicides left families unable to support themselves, broken homes, and let's just look at the fact that 22 gun nuts shot another family member for every person they defended themselves from, only in the stupid gun nut tea bagger rabbit hole is a 22 to 1 bet a sure thing</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355717645698</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 23:14:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355717714401-175</Id><Topic><Title>The 2nd Ammendmant was written for settling a Wild unexplored land</Title><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1355712620791</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 21:50:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The statistics are actually very compelling.
