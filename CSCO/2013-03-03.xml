Obama creates a problem, he then claims the evil Republicans will destroy the nation, but then Obama makes as though he has all the answers to this problem, thus completing the pyramid. One little problem here though, it has to work as planned or Obama is the one that comes out in a very bad light since it is the very problem he created. Once people wake up, they may see the man for what he truly is, a Marxist of old! How can we even make such a statement? It is because Obama himself acknowledges that his own father was a Communist!

Obama also brought on federal workers who explained exactly what will happen as a result of the cuts. For example, border patrol will let every tenth Mexican go free, astronauts won’t have glass on their helmets anymore, and the national zoo is firing three monkeys and letting them loose on the streets of D.C. The only person who was excited was a teacher who couldn’t be happier to get away from teaching Beowulf to a bunch of ungrateful teens. Of course, Obama helped put all this into perspective by saying we’ll forget this in a month because we’ll have an even worse crisis to deal with.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1362324674862</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 10:31:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362324750587-13</Id><Topic><Title>Secret CSCO Info REVEALED!</Title><Username>sharon.gonzales</Username><Timestamp>1362155111800</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:25:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is a gay Indonesian!!!</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1362324750587</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 10:32:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362325519496-14</Id><Title>GOP continues to fracture apart</Title><Msg>More than 100 prominent Republicans signed an amicus brief last week, urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn California's ban on gay marriage. Almost 300 businesses signed a similar brief asking the court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage, for purposes of federal law, as the union of one man and one woman. The national GOP platform, adopted in August at the Republican National Convention, called for a constitutional amendment echoing the one man, one woman standard. When President Barack Obama instructed his Justice Department not to defend DOMA in court, House Republican leaders authorized spending taxpayer money to do so. But as the high court prepares to hear arguments in back-to-back cases challenging DOMA and California's Proposition 8, some big Republican names are asking the court to recognize that gay couples have a constitutional right to wed. The friend-of-the-court brief supporting a lawsuit against Proposition 8 is signed by U.S. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Fla., and Richard Hanna, N.Y.; Meg Whitman, who supported the measure when she ran for governor of California in 2010; former senior advisers to presidential candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney; four former governors; and dozens of other party leaders and strategists. Actor Clint Eastwood, the guy who debated an empty chair at the RNC, joined the brief, urging fellow Republicans to put this issue behind them. "We're making a big deal out of things we shouldn't be making a deal of," he said.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1362325519496</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 10:45:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362326215744-15</Id><Topic><Title>GOP continues to fracture apart</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1362325519496</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 10:45:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tax gay marriage -- $1000 per gay marriage.

Not surprisingly the so-called Super Committee, assembled to avoid sequestration, could not reach a deal because of continued GOP intransigence on taxes. The rigid dogmatism of the GOP position was placed in even sharper relief in August 2011, when candidates were asked at a Republican presidential debate in Iowa to raise their hand if they would accept a deal that cut ten dollars from the deficit in spending for every one dollar in tax increases. None raised their hand. This uncompromising position on taxes didn't win Republicans the White House, but that still had little impact on Republican officeholders. Only when faced with the possibility of a far larger tax increase with the expiration of the Bush tax cuts were 85 Republicans in the House willing to swallow the reality of higher taxes (Senate Republicans were far more amenable). Although it should be noted that the GOP fought tooth and nail for a deal, not that reduced the deficit (a key stated goal of Republicans) or cut spending (an ideological touchstone for conservatives), but rather ensured that couples making between $250,000 and $450,000 a year were protected from a slight increase in their tax rate. The fact that the final fiscal cliff deal actually increased the deficit by $4tn was of less concern. Now we have the latest showdown. A key demand of Republicans is that the president puts spending cuts, particularly those to social insurance programs, on the table. He's done this. Indeed, the president's current proposal, which is available on the White House website, has about $930bn in new spending reduction – approximately $400bn of that to Medicare and Medicaid, and more controversially, $130bn in reduction to Social Security benefits. The catch, of course, is what is also being demanded - $580bn in tax increases. These aren't even rates hikes, but rather reducing deductions utilized</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1362340349015</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 14:52:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362340615882-55</Id><Topic><Title>"Mr. Speaker, that's just not true,"</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1362340011542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 14:46:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama's 930 billion in spending cuts is in the real world, they can't see them in the rabbit hole</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1362340615882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 14:56:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362340654463-56</Id><Topic><Title>"Mr. Speaker, that's just not true,"</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1362340011542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 14:46:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior just had a post that had a TWO syllable word in it!!!!!!

But he doesn't blame Superstorm Sandy, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie or anything else on his loss to President Barack Obama--except his campaign's failure to connect with minority voters. “I lost my election because of my campaign," Romney said on "Fox News Sunday" in his first television interview since his November defeat. "Not because of what anyone else did." The former Massachusetts governor refused place blame on Christie, who some Republicans say gave Obama a last-minute lift in his embrace of the president in the wake of the storm. Romney said his inability to win over black and Hispanic voters--and the damage done by those disastrous "47 percent" comments--ultimately derailed his White House bid. Ann Romney, though, pointed the finger at the fourth estate. “It was not just the campaign’s fault," Ann Romney said. "I believe it was the media's fault as well, in that he was not being given a fair shake--that people weren’t allowed to really see him for who he was. I’m happy to blame the media.” Her husband, she said, "has an enormous skill set in dealing with difficult issues and I totally believe at this moment, if Mitt were there in the office, that we would not be facing sequestration right now." Mitt Romney said President Obama has failed to lead on the sequester. "He didn’t think the sequester would happen," he said. "It is happening. To date, what we’ve seen is the president out campaigning to the American people, doing rallies around the country, flying around the country and berating Republicans and blaming and pointing. Now, what does that do? That causes the Republicans to retrench and to put up a wall and to fight back. "I'll look at what's happening right now, I wish I were there," he said. "It kills me not to be there, not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done."</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1362343731439</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 15:48:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362344652472-82</Id><Topic><Title>“CPAC, to me, has totally diminished its credibility as an organization,” Dowd agreed. “And you invite Sarah Palin, who wasn’t competent enough to keep a Fox News contract?

"Our members are pretty angry," said David Borer, AFGE's general counsel. "Furloughs are going to cost them something like 20 percent of their pay over the next several months." Members of the treasury employees union spent several days this week in Washington pleading with lawmakers to prevent what they said would cause them a lot of distress. Philip Yamalis, an Internal Revenue Service tax specialist from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was among those who lobbied Congress. He has worked for the government for 22 years and says he feels anxious about the future. "When they say a sequester cuts across the board, they don't realize the fear they place in an ordinary middle-class citizen trying to do his job," he said. While unions still hope that lawmakers will reach a budget deal that will undo the sequester after the fact, they have geared up to bargain to mitigate the effects. NTEU spokeswoman Dina Long said the union plans to work with the IRS to find other budget savings that could help avoid furloughs. In an internal IRS memo acquired by Reuters, the agency informed employees that they would have to take five to seven unpaid days off starting in the summer after the busy tax season. Workers, the agency said, will take no more than one day off per pay period. Long said the NTEU wants the IRS to give employees the option of swapping furlough days as well as allow employees the right to voluntarily take on more unpaid days to relieve work mates who might be in more dire financial situations. It also wants the tax agency to allow furloughed employees to take outside employment.

The incident unfolded on Tuesday when 87-year-old Lorraine Bayless collapsed at Glenwood Gardens, a senior living facility in Bakersfield." This "nurse" is worthless. What kind of nurse does not know how to do CPR? This facility should be sued for malpractice and having phony medical staff.
