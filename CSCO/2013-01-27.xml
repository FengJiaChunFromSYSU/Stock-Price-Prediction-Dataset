The announcement by the country's top military body came a day after the U.N. Security Council agreed to a U.S.-backed resolution to censure and sanction North Korea for a rocket launch in December that breached U.N. rules. North Korea is not believed to have the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead capable of hitting the continental United States, although its December launch showed it had the capacity to deliver a rocket that could travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles), potentially putting San Francisco in range, according to an intelligence assessment by South Korea.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1359267975735</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 01:26:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359269759096-4</Id><Topic><Title>Even Fox Noise FINALLY realized what a</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359224366379</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:19:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The true story is that Fox offered to renew Palins contract, she wasn't interested.

(AP) Speaker of the House John Boehner,(R-Hooterville) addressed thousands of chilled but thrilled supporters of abortion prohibition who had gathered along the Mall in frigid weather to attend the annual "March for Life" protest Friday. In a video message, Boehner proclaimed, "Forget about jobs, the economy, or making Obama a one term president. Our new goal is to completely eliminate all abortions and contraception, especially in cases of rape, incest, risk to the life of the mother, or the sin of recreational sex." The speaker outlined initiatives that he guaranteed would make the new "Zero Tolerance" Republican social conservative platform a reality. These included laws that would make it a felony for single women to have sex, and would enact mandatory jail sentences for possessing or attempting to purchase hormonal birth control pills or condoms. Under the new law, possession or use of any "Plan B" contraceptive by rape victims would be subject to the death penalty, "As God intended." Said Boehner. Congressmen Paul Ryan (R-Looserville) and Rand Paul (R-Crazyton) then took the stage to describe the legislation, which features mandatory chastity belts for all females, regardless of age. Congressman Paul explained, "Not only will these Safety Belts prevent rape, even when the woman is clearly asking for it, only qualified husbands will have access to the keys, and only after swearing an oath to return them after conception is achieved." Congressman Ryan elaborated, "For their own safety, the keys to single women's chastity belts will be secured at their nearest republican congressman's office until her husband presents a DOMA compliant marriage license signed by a Priest, Pastor, or Rabbi."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359290168669</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 07:36:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359292714505-10</Id><Title>Court finds Obama's recess appointments UNconstitutional</Title><Msg>It's just starting folks, it's time this bozo who thinks he's a dictator is put in his place.

Again, the Rothschild Mantra is succesful, "buy when there's blood in the street, sell when there's gold". It goes to show that good companies with great products are where it's at. I just read a book where they were discussing buying products. The jist of the story is that great business people know you don't make money selling a product, you make your money on the buying of a good product. Just apply that to stocks.

"I think that those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence,'' Obama tells The New Republic. "In some cases, that may make it a little bit less exciting, but it will be a whole lot better for the players, and those of us who are fans maybe won't have to examine our consciences quite as much.'' In an interview in the magazine's Feb. 11 issue, Obama said he worries more about college players than he does about those in the NFL. "The NFL players have a union, they're grown men, they can make some of these decisions on their own, and most of them are well-compensated for the violence they do to their bodies,'' Obama said. "You read some of these stories about college players who undergo some of these same problems with concussions and so forth and then have nothing to fall back on. That's something that I'd like to see the NCAA think about.''</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359298391358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 09:53:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359298476680-38</Id><Topic><Title>Court finds Obama's recess appointments UNconstitutional</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1359292714505</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 08:18:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah but Obama is black!!! *** Time to end Affirmative Action for blacks.

After a major backlash, they promised to stop. But they haven't yet. Shocker. 2) A state legislator in Georgia wants to change the legal term for victims of rape, stalking, and domestic violence to "accuser." But victims of other less gendered crimes, like burglary, would remain "victims." 3) In South Dakota, Republicans proposed a bill that could make it legal to murder a doctor who provides abortion care. (Yep, for real.) 4) Republicans want to cut nearly a billion dollars of food and other aid to low-income pregnant women, mothers, babies, and kids. 5) In Congress, Republicans have a bill that would let hospitals allow a woman to die rather than perform an abortion necessary to save her life. 6) Maryland Republicans ended all county money for a low-income kids' preschool program. Why? No need, they said. Women should really be home with the kids, not out working. 7) And at the federal level, Republicans want to cut that same program, Head Start, by $1 billion. That means over 200,000 kids could lose their spots in preschool. 8) Two-thirds of the elderly poor are women, and Republicans are taking aim at them too. A spending bill would cut funding for employment services, meals, and housing for senior citizens. 9) Congress just voted for a Republican amendment to cut all federal funding from Planned Parenthood health centers, one of the most trusted providers of basic health care and family planning in our country. 10) And if that wasn't enough, Republicans are pushing to eliminate all funds for the only federal family planning program. (For humans. But Republican Dan Burton has a bill to provide contraception for wild horses. You can't make this stuff up).</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359320682415</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 16:04:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359320774063-138</Id><Topic><Title>787 ELECTRICAL SYSTEM</Title><Username>allouezsup</Username><Timestamp>1359319610585</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 15:46:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Electric cars use the same batteries.

As Battros summarizes his formula: Sunspots = Solar Flares (charged particles) = Magnetic Field Shift = Shifting Ocean and Jet Stream Currents = Extreme Weather [including earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes or other extreme natural events] Battros’ theories have been endorsed to one degree or another by: Dr. Ernest Hildner, Director NOAA Space Weather Center Dr. Tom Van Flandern, former US Naval Observatory Chief of Celestial Mechanics Dr. Stefaan Poedts: Lead Scientist University of Leuven Center for Plasma Astrophysics Dr. Ronald van der Linden, Director of Solar Physics Department of the Royal Observatory Dr. Pål Brekke, Deputy Director of SOHO project- European Space Agency The BBC pointed out in 2008: Third graders believe in global warming. They make me laugh. NASA scientists have said they could be on the verge of a breakthrough in their efforts to forecast earthquakes. Researchers say they have found a close link between electrical disturbances on the edge of our atmosphere and impending quakes on the ground below. Just such a signal was spotted in the days leading up to the recent devastating event in China. They have teamed up with experts in the UK to investigate a possible space-based early warning system. Many in the scientific community remain deeply sceptical about whether such signals are indeed indicators of an approaching earthquake. But Minoru Freund, a physicist and director for advanced aerospace materials and devices at Nasa’s Ames Research Center in California, told BBC News: “I do believe that we will be able to establish a clear correlation between certain earthquakes and certain pre-earthquake signals, in an unbiased way.” *** The ionosphere is distinguished from other layers of Earth’s atmosphere because it is electrically charged through exposure to solar radiation. On a significant number of occasions, satellites have picked up disturbances in this part of the atmosphere 100-600km above areas that have later been hit by earthquakes. One of the most important of these is a fluctuation in the density of electrons and other electrically-charged particles in the ionosphere. One study looked at over 100 earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.0 or larger in Taiwan over several decades. The researchers found that almost all of the earthquakes down to a depth of about 35km were preceded by distinct electrical disturbances in the ionosphere. The carbon credit tax scam proposed by Gore/Obama is a joke! It wouldn't do jack to solve anything except screw up world economy and allow libs to continue wasteful spending on the road to Greece.

On Thursday North Korea threatened the United States saying they would continue to test and develop weapons with the goal of being able to attack American territory. According to the New York Times, on Friday North Korea threatened South Korea stating that their neighbor to the south could suffer “physical countermeasures” for enforcement of any international sanctions that attempted to stop its nuclear weapons activities. Cold War fears revisited The possibility of a nuclear weapons powered North Korea stirs up global fears of nuclear war that last existed during the Cold War. The Cold War, the period from the end of World War II to the early 1990s was a time of tension between the nuclear super powers of the United States and the Soviet Union. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 the era known as the Cold War came to an end. Long before the United States used the phrase homeland security there was a concerned effort to prepare Americans for nuclear military attack known as The United States Office of Civil Defense. Cold War civil defense efforts promoted by the U.S. government to educate the public included the memorable "Duck and Cover" cartoon that taught children what to do during a nuclear attack. When the air sirens go off hide under your desk. Now, kids have lock down drills for school shooters who are imitating the book written by liberal author Stephen King. Liberal writings and ideas are the cause of school shootings not guns.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1359322397262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 16:33:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359322541042-148</Id><Topic><Title>Compromise with a M a r x i s t</Title><Username>eagle1776321</Username><Timestamp>1359321591215</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 16:19:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>''But obviously, we've got to stand with our North Korean allies.'' —Sarah Palin, on how she would handle the current hostilities between the two Koreas, radio interview with Glenn Beck, Nov. 24, 2010</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359322541042</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 16:35:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359323269907-149</Id><Title>DEMOCRAT UNION CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BUYS 47 ASSAULT RIFLES TO 'PROTECT THE CHILDREN'</Title><Msg>DEMOCRAT UNION CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BUYS 47 ASSAULT RIFLES TO 'PROTECT THE CHILDREN' Democrats keeps saying that you dont need an assault rifle to protect your family.
