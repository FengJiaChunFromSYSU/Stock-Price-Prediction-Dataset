Believers in the Biblical "End Times" stifling climate change legislation in America. Courtesy of Raw Story: The United States has failed to take action to mitigate climate change thanks in part to the large number of religious Americans who believe the world has a set expiration date. Research by David C. Barker of the University of Pittsburgh and David H. Bearce of the University of Colorado uncovered that belief in the biblical end-times was a motivating factor behind resistance to curbing climate change. “[T]he fact that such an overwhelming percentage of Republican citizens profess a belief in the Second Coming (76 percent in 2006, according to our sample) suggests that governmental attempts to curb greenhouse emissions would encounter stiff resistance even if every Democrat in the country wanted to curb them,” Barker and Bearce wrote in their study, which will be published in the June issue of Political Science Quarterly. The study, based on data from the 2007 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, uncovered that belief in the “Second Coming” of Jesus reduced the probability of strongly supporting government action on climate change by 12 percent when controlling for a number of demographic and cultural factors. When the effects of party affiliation, political ideology, and media distrust were removed from the analysis, the belief in the “Second Coming” increased this effect by almost 20 percent. “[I]t stands to reason that most nonbelievers would support preserving the Earth for future generations, but that end-times believers would rationally perceive such efforts to be ultimately futile, and hence ill-advised,” Barker and Bearce explained. Over and over again we see examples of religion interfering with scientific progress and education in this country, and I for one am damn sick and tired of it!

Via Foolocracy: Texas Rep. Joe Barton doesn’t believe in anthropogenic climate change. That’s partially because he is firmly in the pocket of Big Oil. The oil and gas industry is the largest contributor to Barton’s warchest. However, Barton’s fervor to deny that humans have anything to do with climate change has taken a new direction. In a bizarre reference to the Great Flood of the Bible, Barton is using that as evidence that hydrocarbons don’t change the climate. How Barton draws that comparison is going to have to be left to the imagination. Barton doesn’t elaborate on what forty days of rain in antiquity has to do with the present-day earth warming. Perhaps he is thinking that today’s rising sea levels are the same challenge that Noah had building an ark. If only the answer to climate change was so simple. Here is the great environmental insight from Barton: “I would point out that people like me who support hydrocarbon development don’t deny that climate is changing. I think you can have an honest difference of opinion of what’s causing that change without automatically being either all in that’s all because of mankind or it’s all just natural. I think there’s a divergence of evidence.” “I would point out that if you’re a believer in the Bible, one would have to say the Great Flood is an example of climate change and that certainly wasn’t because mankind had overdeveloped hydrocarbon energy.” It’s probably impossible to pack mor</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367848791549</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:59:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367848927134-25</Id><Topic><Title>Most ignorant in Texass?</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367848791549</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:59:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why the id change ???

Texas was a hard place to live from the beginning...you had to have cajones to survive. Texas bred a special kind of hard case, and as always, it wasn't just the Commanches you fought, but the weather and the plagues. A corollary was, that in hard places a man need to good friends, and community was important. Folks worked hard for them selves and each other. All through the early days, it was a working man's state, mostly blue collar and cowboy hat, but independent and slightly different. Even though Texas was part of the CSA, it had nothing to do with slavery and the actual number of slaves in Texas never was more than 225. Texas, in sympathy with the Old South was solid Democrat until the Democratic party became the party of the Weird, the Elite, the Lazy and the ArseHalls.....then they moved away from the left and stayed firmly in the middle of common sense and hard work, with true compassion for the helpless and a hard back hand for the lazy and the liars....two categories cherished by Democrats today. You wanna walk tall on your own two feet, come to Texas...you want someone else buying your food, paying your rent and taking care of you, stay where you are, and stay out of Texas..there's lots of jobs, but no room for titty babies.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1367853839375</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 11:23:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367853963646-39</Id><Topic><Title>TED CRUZ &amp; WAYNE LaPIERRE are the new far right dictators.

Buford Rogers, 24, was arrested Friday and charged with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He remained in federal custody Monday and it was not clear if he had an attorney.

The two are far more synergistic than antagonistic. I am a believer, in the simple gospel message that Jesus was the son of God, and bridged the sin gap, allowing relationship with the Creator. Nothing in the new or old testament is 'anti-science'...nothing!!! All the greatest 'scientists' of the last few centuries were simple Christians. The Catholic Church's squabble with Galileo is nonsense. The Christian position that all of the universe was created by a rational, good God, gives meaning and understanding and logic to a system that might have been anything at all, and far from logical! I would posit that your own antipathy to Christianity has less to do with any 'scientific' bias and more to do with personal experience, true?</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1367866693177</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 14:58:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367866829881-75</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN TED CRUZ IS TARGETED, BEWARE, HISPANICS are the true target</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1367858241341</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 12:37:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, he will be elected president....in 2016.

I was diagnosed about three years ago with obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and general anxiety disorder. I believe that my OCD stems mostly from a very dysfunctional childhood and my perception that I had to be perfect in order to keep some amount of peace in my home. It eventually became more extreme and more things had to be even. Now, I don't even step on cracks, and if I do slip up, I have to step on the crack with my other foot to make it even. Living in the Arizona heat it gets a little frustrating when you are spending more time than needed in 110-degree weather! I tried medications to alleviate the problem; however, it just created more problems. I became so lethargic that I just didn't care to make things even when I could just leave the room and go take a nap. That was no way to live for me. I would rather go about my life making things even and constantly cleaning than to feel useless. I do, however, go to therapy to deal with all of my issues, and I recommend that to anyone. It's an aggravating feeling, but I made the choice to see some humor in it. I try to always keep a positive outlook, and if people look at me in confusion, I just laugh and tell them I can't help it. I have found that most people understand and actually have loved ones that deal with similar issues. I believe there are probably more people who deal with mental health issues than not. It's time to start talking about them and quit treating our problems as if they don't exist in an attempt to be "normal." We are just as normal as anybody else; we just do things a little differently!</Msg><Username>walterbrydman11</Username><Timestamp>1367868764226</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 15:32:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367869036012-83</Id><Topic><Title>GFO99...think about it...how does science</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1367866693177</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 14:58:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So all that Do unto Other's C*r*a*P is a bunch of rot, and we're not supposed to support others?</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1367869036012</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 15:37:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367869105772-84</Id><Title>Obammy has committed an impeachable offense...</Title><Msg>but unfortunately, he won't be impeached.

Dr. David Gunn is dead because of Christian terrorists. 1994: Dr. John Britton and James Barrett became victims of Christian terrorist Reverend Paul Jennings Hill. 1994: Shannon Lowney and Lee Ann Nichols were killed by Christian terrorist John Salvi. 1996-98: Christian Terrorist Eric Rudolph killed at least two and injured more than 150 in a series of bombings, including Atlanta's Olympic Centennial Park. 1998: Christian terrorist James Kopp killed at least one and went on a series of anti-abortion shooting sprees, both in the U.S. and Canada. 2009: Christian terrorist Scott Roeder killed Dr. George Tiller in Kansas. These are just a few notable examples. In total, there have been 17 attempted murders, 383 death threats, 153 incidents of assault or battery, and 3 kidnappings in America committed by Christian terrorists over the issue of abortion alone. There are more Christian terrorists waiting in the wings for their chance for martyrdom. In 2010, a Michigan Christian Militia was spotlighted in the news for conspiring to kill police officers. And oh, yes. There was that unfortunate standoff at Ruby Ridge a few years ago. Randy Weaver was a Christian terrorist in waiting. Again, these are just a couple of prominent examples. The presence of Christian extremists in America is pervasive and surprisingly well documented. One has to wonder: If atheist extremists had committed hundreds of attacks on Christians, would we be allowed to slough them off as "not true atheists?" I suspect we would not. And yet, if you approach an average Christian on Main Street, USA, and ask about Christian terrorism, you'll probably be laughed off. True Christians don't become terrorists. Therefore, there are no Christian terrorists. Only... there are lots of them.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1367888849579</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 21:07:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367888875728-118</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S FAILURE: IRAQ AT HIGHEST LEVEL OF VIOLENCE SINCE 2008!!!</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1367875072813</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 17:17:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In 2008 Obama said we would be out of there in 14 months.

The withdrawal of American military forces from Iraq was a contentious issue within the United States for much of the 2000s, being debated fervidly since the beginning of the Iraq War in March 2003. As the war progressed from its initial invasion phase to a nearly decade-long presence, American public opinion shifted towards favoring a troop withdrawal; in May 2007, 55 percent of Americans believed that the Iraq War was a mistake, and 51 percent of registered voters favored troop withdrawal.[2] In late April 2007, the U.S. Congress passed a supplementary spending bill for Iraq that set a deadline for troop withdrawal, but President Bush vetoed this bill soon afterwards.[3][4] All American military forces were mandated to withdraw from Iraqi territory by 31 December 2011 under the terms of a bilateral agreement signed in 2008 by President Bush. The U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq was completed on 18 December 2011 early Sunday morning.[5]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1367889751556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 21:22:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367892170809-122</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S FAILURE: IRAQ AT HIGHEST LEVEL OF VIOLENCE SINCE 2008!!!</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1367875072813</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 17:17:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are exactly right Rhonda!
