S. Marine and Vietnam veteran living in Danbury, Connecticut. I am a 67-year-old former Marine and a Vietnam veteran. And I say: "Forget about living to age 75 in the USA!" This morning at Danbury Hospital here in Connecticut, I was scheduled for a cardio-lite stress test. This is a treadmill stress test where nuclear dye is injected into your bloodstream and you are put in a CAT scan or something similar in order to take a picture of your heart. If all is good, the heart shows up red; if there are blocked arteries anywhere, the heart shows up pink. I have had three of these tests in the past twelve years due to blocked arteries discovered in 2000. They use the test to determine if I need a "roto rooter" or a bypass operation. So, I arrived for my previously schedule appointment at the hospital at 8 a.m. this morning and in the process of checking in, the lady in the front desk said that my appointment has been canceled. She made a call, spoke with someone, and then she handed me the phone. It was a nurse in the Cardiology Department who said that my medical insurance carrier denied the procedure. I said, "It is a routine part of my heart maintenance program as ordered by my PCP and with approval from my cardiologist who is the head of Danbury Cardiology Department, which is right where I am standing right now." She went, "Yes, but our request was denied." So I said, "I have Medicare, so what is my backup insurance doing denying anything." Then the bombshell. . .she said, "It was the Medicare Board that denied the procedure." At that point, I turned to everyone behind me, and it was a long line, and I said to them "Well, you won't have to wait too long today because my stress test procedure was just canceled by a Medicare Death Panel. I am only 67 so can you imagine what is going to happen when we really get old?" The entire waiting room and everyone there from patients to staff just went dead silent. Then, I turned to the front desk staff and told them, "I guess I will have to write a letter to the editor of the Danbury News Times and call my senators and congressman and let them know the Death Panels have already convened". Then I walked out. By the time I got home the message machine was blinking. My PCP had called and so did the hospital and guess what? Medicare decided to approve my stress test procedure, and I should get back down to the hospital, and they would fit me in right away for the 3-hour procedure. I called back and told them that I couldn't make it, I was going fishing because I didn't know how many more fishing trips I could get in before I went into cardiac arrest, but not to worry about me costing the government any money because I am a 30% disabled Army veteran due to Agent Orange poisoning which is what caused this heart problem to begin with, and I qualify to be buried for free in a plain pine box in the cheap graves section at any national cemetery. I certainly don't want to cost our government any money. So, maybe we just won't do the procedure anymore and we can use the money to redistribute it to all of the illegals to keep them alive so they can mow the lawns at the national cemeteries. And so this note is for everyone to know that the Death Panel crap has already started. And if we don't vote this guy and his criminal cronies out of office this November, then we should all expect to die younger and as completely broke paupers as the country goes further down to hell. Feel free to distribute my note to anyone and make it your mission to not only make your vote count in November 2012 but on behalf of all of us, please also make an effort to help convince everyone to NOT vote for the present White House occupant or any of his cronies in the November 2012 election if they want to receive proper medical care and expect to live to age 75 or older!</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1351515572171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 08:59:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351515618835-12</Id><Title>Obama voting Block.

SHAMEFUL.This is one major reason why the Obama National Debt is now $16.5 TRILLION. So Sad but oh so true! Latham Ford is in Upstate NY, near Albany. From Tom Selkis (Latham Ford) Facebook... True story at the dealership..... "I'll try to make this as short and to the point as I can. One of my salesmen here had a women in his office yesterday wanting to lease a brand new Focus. As he was reviewing her credit app with her he noticed she was on social security disability. He said to her, you don't look like you're disabled and unable to work. She said well I'm really not, I could work if I wanted to but I make more now than I did when I was working and got hurt.(non-disabling injury) She said the gov't sends her 1,500.00 a month in 1 check, she gets 700.00 a month on an EBT card (food stamps), and 800.00 a month for rent. Oh yeah and 250 minutes free on her FREE phone. That is just south of 3,500.00 a month. When she was working she was taking home about 330.00 per week. Do the math and then ask yourself why should she go back to work. If you multiply that by millions of people you start to realize the scope of the problem we face as a country. Once the socialist have 51% of the population in that same scenario we are finished!!!!!!! The question is when do we cross that threshold if we haven't already? She didn't lease the Focus here because the dealer down the road beat our deal by 10.00/month. Glad to know she is so frugal with OUR hard earned money.

This is the uncaring, craftily ambitious, inexperienced yet know-it-all poseur. But, when storm clouds mount he is so unnerved by making big decisions he sprints to the sand to bury his head. This can be seen the way Obama reacted to the Gulf Oil Spill. His most memorable maneuver, after lecturing oil companies on safety. Obama hiding in D.C. as Sandy pounds the liberal NorthEast into submission. Bizarre Shrunken Adolescent POTUS We must admit how weird it is to watch Barack devolve from his 2008 pseudo-statesman routine into his new disrespectful, perverted and immature persona. Undoubtedly this suits him better as it cuts closer to the bone. He has exposed himself. Like his supporters, Obama is a vulgar, bas*tud fascist. How about a few suggestions as to Obama’s motivations in Benghazi? Why would Barack not give his ambassador Chris Stevens security when he repeatedly asked for more and apparently danger grew daily? Because this would go against Barack’s adolescent king-of-the-world fantasy which claimed he came in peace to heal the earth. But when the WH and Pentagon could see live video that our ambassador in Libya was getting murdered, why wouldn’t Barack go in with military when he had the means easily within reach? And why would he cancel the military response after it was organized? Most probably because he believed it could escalate into something huge which would go against his peace-maker narrative. This would imperil his upcoming election. Instead, Obama decided to sentence 4 men to execution, betting he could cover up the small murder by blaming it on another—Barack’s MO—with a hack video. He expected the media would undoubtedly help him with the coverup—as they subsequently tried—and sweep him back into power. But since this failed, all bets are off. Obama’s Choices: Lose or Be Impeached Barack is a self-centered, utterly unfeeling, revolution-seeking drone who cannot be bothered with the hard work of genuine leadership. And as terrifying as it sounds, he is a typical Marxist leader who wants to “save humanity,” but finds individuals not important enough to consider. It’s no wonder Barack’s White House loves Mao, a possible role model for crazy, unthinking and ideologically-driven tyranny from the man who murdered 77 million of his own countrymen. Or perhaps Vlad Lenin, first dictator of the USSR is his example, who said—“Any cook should be able to run the country.” Marxists have no respect for democracy, republicanism or capitalism. Obama must face the decision of getting beaten at the ballot box in November 2012 or being impeached.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351517647849</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 09:34:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351517770872-23</Id><Topic><Title>Storm to keep Black Vote home</Title><Username>scott4usa</Username><Timestamp>1351414222221</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 04:50:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Power is out so I can't watch Obama's negative, divisive commercials.

Stone, who wrote “The Untold History of the United States” with historian Peter Kuznick, puts forth a liberal interpretation of American history from the turn of the last century to present day. The 618-page book, slated for release Tuesday - a week before Election Day - from Gallery Books, slams Obama’s presidency like a massive hurricane. “Obama took a bad situation and, in certain ways, made it worse,” Stone and Kuznick wrote. “…Rather than repudiating the policies of Bush and his predecessors, Obama has perpetuated them.” Obama’s election “felt like a kind of expiation for the sins of a nation whose reputation had been sullied, as we have shown throughout this book, by racism, imperialism, militarism, nuclearism, environmental degradation and unbridled avarice,” they wrote. But on subjects from Wall Street reform to health care to Afghanistan, Stone and Kuznick rip Obama for breaking campaign promises and continuing the policies of President George W. Bush — who’s roundly condemned throughout the book. In some instances, they write, Obama went further than Bush’s White House toward anti-progressive policies.

It's only a coincidence that this surge in unemployment would appear set to take place just as the U.S. government approaches its self-created "fiscal cliff," where the ongoing failure of the Obama administration to negotiate government spending reductions in good faith with the U.S. Congress threatens to push the U.S. directly into recession in early 2013! Hurricane Sandy will hit refineries on East Coast High oil prices also can reduce demand for other goods because they reduce wealth, as well as induce uncertainty about the future. One way to analyze the effects of higher oil prices is to think about the higher prices as a tax on consumers. The extra payment that U.S. consumers make to foreign oil producers can now no longer be spent on other kinds of consumption goods. Five of the last seven U.S. recessions were preceded by considerable increases in oil prices. This effect is what Obama administration officials are after in part when they state their political objective that the price of fuel must "necessarily skyrocket," as it gives the administration a target to scapegoat (capital owners) while simultaneously increasing their client base of unemployed individuals who will become dependent upon government-provided welfare for their income. Obama suk balz say and do anything to stay in power like socialist dictator of banana republic.

The Cracker Bay is the yacht where the thank-you party for his top donors was held during the Republican convention in Tampa. A super-size yacht, it has room for a large military crew and equipment. The Romney friend who owns it was persuaded to be the first CEO yacht-giver. Romney sprinkled his comments with military talk. He referred to the plan as “YFTN,” Navy shorthand for Yachts For The Navy. Unlike recent Romney plans, he gave details: Give-A-Yacht: “I will personally urge CEOs to give large yachts to the Navy. I’ve been on a lot of those yachts, so I have made a little list.” In addition to the patriotism part, there is a 150% cost-of-yacht tax break. Retrofit: “Deck chairs and other civilian stuff will be removed for installation of modern weapons and stuff for military ops. The retrofit work will also create civilian jobs.” Reflag: The Cracker Bay is registered in the Cayman Islands to avoid bothersome regulations imposed by American registry. Romney said, “Flying the American flag alongside the Caymans’ flag will be as easy as storing money in the Caymans.” Romney frequently travels to the Caymans to visit money he and Bain Capital store there. Yacht Carriers: Part of Romney’s proposed $2 trillion increase in defense spending will go to design and building of 4 yacht carriers to move militarized yachts. “Aircraft carriers are no good for deploying yachts.” Mission: “The yachts will be ready for catch-and-destroy missions against pirates threatening American states off the waters of Florida, Arizona, Virginia and Ohio.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351522181644</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 10:49:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351522187655-62</Id><Title>Obama is going to lose the Electoral vote by 31 votes</Title><Msg>Yahoo would not allow my post of the specifics of this analysis</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351522187655</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 10:49:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351522334904-63</Id><Topic><Title>Sandy to win the election for Obama</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351522076320</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 10:47:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe Barry should have stayed home while our consulate was being destroyed instead of going to Vegas for some campaign money.

You need something to hold on to when the power generator runs out of gas. Thanks to bashing by the Obama administration, Exxon Mobil (XOM) is no longer the world's number-one oil producer. As of Friday, that title belongs to Putin Oil Corp - oh, whoops. I mean the title belongs to Rosneft (RNFTF.PK), Russia's state-controlled oil company. Rosneft is buying TNK-BP (TNKBF.PK), which is a vertically integrated oil company co-owned by British oil firm BP (BP) and a group of Russian billionaires known as AAR. One of the top-ten privately-owned oil producers in the world, in 2010 TNK-BP churned out 1.74 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from its assets in Russia and Ukraine and processed almost half that amount through its refineries. Obama won't let a new refinery open in USA. Mexico is building refineries right on the U.S. border. Economy in Mexico is doing well and so is the Mexican stock market. Invest in Mexico stock market. U.S. stock market is closed due to bad weather. Wall Street took your money and now you can't get it out when you need to buy a power generator.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351522755928</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 10:59:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351523157600-67</Id><Topic><Title>Re: It's the Economy, Stupid Obama!!!</Title><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1351516560570</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 09:16:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama has destoyed U.S. economy. Europe is reliant on Russia for oil and gas. To be in control of other nations' necessary energy resources is to be in a very powerful position - one that Putin has been working toward for more than a decade. He has built pipelines that bypass troublesome countries and feed into needy markets. He is cornering the uranium market by owning a large amount of primary production and controlling 40% of global uranium-enrichment capacity, while leaving the United States in need of a new nuclear-fuel supplier. He has increased Russia's oil and gas production and encouraged unconventional exploration. Gazprom (GZPFY.PK), the Russian state gas company, already has Europe wrapped around its little finger. Russia supplies 34% of Europe's gas needs, and when the under-construction South Stream pipeline starts operating, that percentage will increase. As if those developments weren't enough, yesterday Gazprom offered the highest bid to obtain a stake in the massive Leviathan gas field off Israel's coast. Gazprom in control of Europe's gas, Rosneft in control of its oil. A red hand stretching out from Russia to strangle the supremacy of the West and pave the way for a new world order- one with Russia at the helm. It is not as far-fetched as it might seem - or as you might want it to be. If Rosneft does buy both halves of TNK-BP, it will become a true goliath within the global oil sector. All the little Davids who rely on its oil will be at Putin's mercy. Same goes for Gazprom as a goliath in the continent's gas scene. In this scenario, Russia could choke off supply to raise prices. Putin could play oil- and gas-needy nations off one another, forcing European nations to commit to long-term, high-priced contracts if they want to secure supplies. Or imagine this: Russia could join OPEC. Suddenly the oil cartel would control more than half of global oil production and most of its spare capacity. With that kind of clout, the nations of OPEC could essentially name their price for oil - and the rest of the world would simply have to pay. Obama built windmills while Putin took control of the world's energy supply.

In addition, the U.S. is more likely to avoid going over the so-called fiscal cliff with a Romney presidency, says David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. "I think Romney's is portrayed aptly as the candidate that could more readily come to a compromise with the opposition." Fiscal Cliff: "Major Market Meltdown" as Obama Continues Stubborn Tax the Rich Mantra Obama will be emboldened to screw the upper middle if he is re-elected. The combination of expiring tax cuts and a big drop in government spending set to take effect would almost certainly tip the economy into recession. "Normally the President can only have a marginal impact but we're at an important inflection point; it could make a very big difference" who wins, Rosenberg says. Obama has purposely signed the fiscal cliff into law so that the country endures a standoff after the election. What a great plan. The looming deadline is spooking the financial markets and corporate executives.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351536326239</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:45:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351536852966-121</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN PRESIDENT ROMNEY IS CAMPAIGNING LIKE OBIMBO IN 4 YEARS, CAN HE FLY FREE TOO?</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1351536320885</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:45:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought both Ann and Mitt said he wouldn't run in 2016 after he loses this time.

But on Sunday, Iowa’s largest paper did just that after it concluded that Mitt Romney “offers a fresh economic vision”. The conclusion was essentially arrived because of the opinion that Romney’s business and executive background made him the best candidate to”unlock this nation’s economic potential.” Despite endorsing the promise of Barack Obama’s hope and change in 2008, in their 2012 endorsement of Mitt Romney, the liberal leaning editorial staff of the Des Moines wrote: “Voters should give Mitt Romney a chance to correct the nation’s fiscal course and to implode the partisan gridlock that has shackled Washington and the rest of America — with the understanding that he would face the same assessment in four years if he does not succeed” This is not what a re-election looks like.

The last time the poll was in the field, in late September, the race was deadlocked at 44 percent in the 2nd District. The Omaha-based district has been closely watched this year after it produced one of the biggest surprises of 2008 by voting narrowly for Obama. Back then, the Obama campaign captured one of the conservative state’s five electoral votes by taking advantage of Nebraska’s unusual electoral vote allocation — it’s one of just two states (the other is Maine) that awards its electoral votes by congressional district, rather than to the overall state winner. Obama is not gaining anywhere. It's all slipping away. Dust in the Wind.

If voters are looking to forward to a zombie apocalypse, then Whedon says Romeny is the man to lead the nation to sub-human domination. "Like a lot of liberal Americans," Whedon tells the camera, "I was excited when Barack Obama took office four years ago. But it's a very different world now, and Mitt Romney is a very different candidate, one with the vision and determination to cut through business-as-usual politics and finally put this country back on the path to the zombie apocalypse." The video, posted to YouTube Sunday, has gained more than one million views on the site and is steamrolling through social media. Under a Romney presidency, the director of "The Avengers" and creator of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" envisions a nation where paper money is useless and "the one percent will no longer be the very rich, it'll be the very fast." “Romney is ready to make the deep rollbacks in healthcare, education, social services, reproductive rights that will guarantee poverty, unemployment, overpopulation, disease, rioting," Whedon, who has previously donated to Obama's campaign, goes on to say: "all crucial elements in creating a nightmare zombie wasteland."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351542832303</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 16:33:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351542857770-151</Id><Title>Wall Street Journal warns of next Great Depression</Title><Msg>October Surprise!

While many factors have contributed to this trend, including an increase in the number of people living in flood-prone areas, the report identified global warming as one of the major culprits: “Climate change particularly affects formation of heat-waves, droughts, intense precipitation events, and in the long run most probably also tropical cyclone intensity.” Munich Re’s report was aimed at the firm’s clients—other insurance companies—and does not make compelling reading for a general audience. But its appearance just two weeks ahead of Hurricane Sandy seems to lend it a peculiarly grisly relevance. Sandy has been called a “superstorm,” a “Frankenstorm,” a “freakish and unprecedented monster,” and possibly “unique in the annals of American weather history.” It has already killed sixty-five people in the Caribbean, and, although it’s too early to tell what its full impact will be as it churns up the East Coast, loss estimates are topping six billion dollars. As with any particular “weather-related loss event,” it’s impossible to attribute Sandy to climate change. However, it is possible to say that the storm fits the general pattern in North America, and indeed around the world, toward more extreme weather, a pattern that, increasingly, can be attributed to climate change. Just a few weeks before the Munich Re report appeared, scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in New York, published a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the apparent increase in extreme heat waves. Extreme summertime heat, which just a few decades ago affected much less than one per cent of the earth’s surface, “now typically covers about 10% of the land area,” the paper observed. “It follows that we can state, with a high degree of confidence, that extreme anomalies”—i.e., heat waves—“such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small.” It is worth noting that one of several forces fuelling Sandy is much-higher-than-average sea-surface temperatures along the East Coast.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351545045693</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 17:10:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351545165299-166</Id><Title>'SANDY' GUARANTEES ROMNEY VICTORY!!!

At the same time he is benefitting, the trust will probably leave the church with less than what current law requires, according to tax returns obtained by Bloomberg this month through a Freedom of Information Act request. In general, charities don’t owe capital gains taxes when they sell assets for a profit. Trusts like Romney’s permit funders to benefit from that tax-free treatment, said Jonathan Blattmachr, a trusts and estates lawyer who set up hundreds of such vehicles in the 1990s. Near Zero “The main benefit from a charitable remainder trust is the renting from your favorite charity of its exemption from taxation,” Blattmachr said. Despite the name, giving a gift or getting a charitable deduction “is just a throwaway,” he said. “I used to structure them so the value dedicated to charity was as close to zero as possible without being zero.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351545667654</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 17:21:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351545848154-171</Id><Title>Despite the name, giving a gift or getting a charitable deduction “is just a throwaway,” he said. “I used to structure them so the value dedicated to charity was as close to zero as possible without being zero.”</Title><Msg>that's my favorite part, he rented the deduction and never even had to pay the rent!!!</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351545848154</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 17:24:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351545960371-172</Id><Topic><Title>the science is not proven</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351545045693</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 17:10:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>only in the tea bagger rabbit hole could 400,000 scientist agree on something but all be part of a giant conspiracy, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351545960371</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 17:26:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351546111986-173</Id><Title>virtually all educated scientist believe in global warming</Title><Msg>So a consensus in science is different from a political one. There is no vote. Scientists just give up arguing because the sheer weight of consistent evidence is too compelling, the tide too strong to swim against any longer. Scientists change their minds on the basis of the evidence, and a consensus emerges over time. Not only do scientists stop arguing, they also start relying on each other's work. All science depends on that which precedes it, and when one scientist builds on the work of another, he acknowledges the work of others through citations. The work that forms the foundation of climate change science is cited with great frequency by many other scientists, demonstrating that the theory is widely accepted - and relied upon. In the scientific field of climate studies – which is informed by many different disciplines – the consensus is demonstrated by the number of scientists who have stopped arguing about what is causing climate change – and that’s nearly all of them. A survey of all peer-reviewed abstracts on the subject 'global climate change' published between 1993 and 2003 shows that not a single paper rejected the consensus position that global warming is man caused. 75% of the papers agreed with the consensus position while 25% made no comment either way, focusing on methods or paleoclimate analysis (Oreskes 2004). Several subsequent studies confirm that “...the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes”. (Doran 2009). In other words, more than 95% of scientists working in the disciplines contributing to studies of our climate, accept that climate change is almost certainly being caused by human activities. We should also consider official scientific bodies and what they think about climate change. There are no national or major scientific institutions anywhere in the world that dispute the theory of anthropogenic climate change. Not one. In the field of climate science, the consensus is unequivocal: human activities are causing climate change.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351546111986</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 17:28:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351546119264-174</Id><Title>SIX VALID POLLING ORGANIZATIONS, USING TODAY'S POLLS, GIVE THE ELECTION TO ROMNEY</Title><Msg>all of them have advised President Obama to surrender, give up, abandon ship and look for a safe place to hide.

Ever since the Daimler-Chrysler alliance broke down in 2009, Chrysler has no productions in China. Now that Fiat, Chrysler’s new owner, has officially returned to China and began building factories, there will be Chinese-made Jeep SUVs again in as early as 2014. In a recent interview, John Kett, vice president and CEO of Chrysler’s Asia-Pacific operations, confirmed this, echoing Fiat-Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne’s words that Fiat is to have a production capacity of 300,00 units a year in China within five years through its joint venture with GAC (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co.). And Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, will be the location of the production base. Dumb Dumb the idiot PROVEN to be the LIAR he is.
