Jihad means war on the infidel. Islam is the worship of a demon-god, Allah, who asks his followers to put on suicide vests and blow up small children in pizza parlors, on buses, in parades, at the Boston marathon and in places all over the world. Jesus told his followers to 'turn the other cheek' and the grace and benefit of Christian missions over the past many hundred years, in hospitals and various other benevolent programs all over the world point out the sharp differences between the true God and the demon god, Allah and his depraved follower, Mohammed, who was a perverted sex addict. This should be clearly visible to anyone who looks closely at the lives of the majority of the followers of both groups. Islam, by and far, has #$%$ civilizations every where. Christianity has been the brightest light in a dark world ever. Most advanced cultures over the past 1000 years benefited from the precepts of the Judeo Christian revelation and to the extent a nation abandons these precepts, its own precipitous decline follows. The US is no exception. The farther away we move from the revealed truth of God, the more pain we will suffer.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1366972185027</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 06:29:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366980822317-5</Id><Title>Core inflation rising--</Title><Msg>The long waited inflation is starting.

In fact, Obama's approach has been praised, and former President George W. Bush made similar statements about the nature of "jihad." On the April 23 edition of his Fox News show, Hannity claimed that after the Boston terror attack, President Obama is still unwilling to "engage in a war on radical Islam." After playing a November 7, 2010, clip of Obama answering a question in Mumbai, India, about jihad, explaining that "the phrase 'jihad' has a lot of meanings within Islam and is subject to a lot of different interpretations," Hannity responded: "There are not really many interpretations -- that's spin. Jihad equals holy war." From the show: But Obama's interpretation of jihad is no different from the definition used by the Bush administration that preceded him. The 2006 National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, issued by the Bush administration's National Security Council, stated, "Terrorists distort the idea of jihad into a call for violence and murder against those they regard as apostates or unbelievers." And in an October 2005 speech, Bush said that "extremists distort the idea of jihad into a call for terrorist murder against anyone who does not share their radical vision, including Muslims from other traditions, who they regard as heretics."
