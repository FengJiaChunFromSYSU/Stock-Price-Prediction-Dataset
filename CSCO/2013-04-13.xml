The Respect State Marijuana Laws Act would shield both medical and recreational pot users...A Pew Poll released last week showed that a broad majority of Americans, even when they don't agree with legalizing marijuana, believe the federal government should not step in to punish users in states that do.

Whereas the region has always undergone some ice melt during spring and summer—with re-freezing of that melted ice always following in fall and winter—the Arctic will cease to have any ice at all, save for some residual summer ice that will continue to form near Greenland and Canada’s Arctic islands.
