Circuit Judge Debra Nelson, at a hearing on motions ahead of the trial, also ruled that lawyers can't mention Martin's school records, past fighting, marijuana use, ownership of gold teeth, or any photos or text messages found on the teen's phone. Nelson said she reserves the right to change the ruling during the trial if lawyers open the door to such issues. However, she said that she can't imagine that any of these issues would be relevant. She also said witnesses can't mention whether they think George Zimmerman's prosecution is politically motivated. She ruled that any hearsay statements to help Zimmerman is admissible. She ruled that a toxicology test showing Trayvon Martin had marijuana in his system the night of his killing is not admissible. Judge Nelson also granted the following motions: • State motions to prohibit witnesses from offering their opinions about Zimmerman's guilt, the proper punishment he should receive for his actions, and from telling the jury to disregard the law.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369754573064</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 11:22:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369754745947-45</Id><Topic><Title>Nothing Will Save The GOP</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_7</Username><Timestamp>1369752191967</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 10:43:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior is probably about 12.

Reagonomics , reducing tax rates and control government regulations, created the largest post war economic growth in modern history. The economy grew more under Reagon with more jobs created than any other President. With a Republican controlled Congress, Clinton was able to enjoy the fruits of Reagonmics and garner the praise. Obama has created so much regulation, we have had the slowest job growth in the history of the US. As for the market, this is all due to the federal reserve printing money and giving it to banks to pay off the real estate losses. Large Corporations are expanding overseas where taxes are low and return on capital spending is larger. Yes the markets are up, but Obama has nothing to do with it. He is responsible for slow job creation. He's had 5 years to do something and has failed miserably. The only conclusion- he doesn't know what to do but give out food stamps and disability checks.</Msg><Username>mec2invest</Username><Timestamp>1369759698963</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 12:48:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369760022598-68</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P Performance Under Clinton/Bush/Obama</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_7</Username><Timestamp>1369755969149</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 11:46:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>funny how the tea billies mistake imaginary political propaganda with history</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369760022598</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 12:53:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369760163334-69</Id><Topic><Title>IRS scadal backfires on the GOP</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369758420979</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 12:27:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are " filet minion" and " shinning " typos??

It has lost the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections. It consoles itself with a majority in Congress, but even there its ranks are dwindling. On nearly every issue of national significance—from social affairs to fiscal matters to foreign policy—its positions are increasingly out of step with those of the majority of Americans. Riven by factions, it sometimes seems more like a collection of squabbling interest groups than a coherent political entity. People have started muttering that it might become merely a regional concern, or even go the way of the Whigs and die out. This is the plight of the Republican Party today. “If we’re being honest,” the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, moped earlier this year, “we have not really won a decisive presidential election since 1988.” Polls show that the party’s stance on practically every issue is a loser: same-sex marriage, international affairs, immigration, even taxes and the deficit.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369762734720</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 13:38:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369762779437-77</Id><Topic><Title>Monkey Holder LIED under oath, like his Mvslim Messiah.</Title><Username>ivanhoeofloxxly</Username><Timestamp>1369761809331</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 13:23:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL how's that impeachment working out for you Ivan, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369762779437</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 13:39:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369763339036-78</Id><Topic><Title>Blowoff Top?</Title><Username>doji_rubicon</Username><Timestamp>1369753170572</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 10:59:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Was that what you meant?

Of course, polls will vary. But the idea of a House GOP that is stunningly unpopular running inquisitions against President Obama, whose popularity towers above the GOP, and Clinton, whose popularity towers above the GOP even more, is a political disaster in the making. The prime directive for the Tea Party is tax breaks for the rich and tax breaks for themselves — hardly a winning position in a nation that wants more equity and fairness for all. The Tea Party projects a politics and negativity,which is why it is so highly unpopular with voters. Palin represents a negativity and eccentricity and out-of-the-mainstream rightism, which is why she was such as disaster for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), why she left the governorship after half of one term and why she has held no public office in recent years. According to the delusional commentary of the right, their options for leader of the free world to run against Clinton in 2016 range from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. from Palin to former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), from Alaska's Joe Miler to former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.). The only Republican who runs within reach of Clinton is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who is anathema to the right and was not even invited to the latest national meeting of conservatives. America does not want the product the right is selling. Let the fantasists and delusionists name their saviors for the Republicans and the Republic, which is the best news of the year for Democrats as Republican inquisitions continue from their unpopular partisans in the House.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369764389430</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:06:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369764553337-83</Id><Title>WHEN THE CRASH DOES COME IT WILL BE A F5 MONSTER</Title><Msg>And you can thank the fed for what is coming ..they have pumped and pumped..this one will be a "monster"!!</Msg><Username>futureperson</Username><Timestamp>1369764553337</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:09:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369764704019-84</Id><Title>Why is the GOP protecting tax cheats?</Title><Msg>The more information that comes out about the scandal at the Internal Revenue Service, the harder it is to say employees there erred in putting more scrutiny on particular groups seeking tax-exempt status.

It’s the same kind of tactic used by frauds like Glenn Beck and pseudo-journalists like Matt Drudge. Usually the people they cater to already have a deep-seated hatred or fear of the government, and they feed off of the reassurance that they should be afraid. Big bad government is coming for your guns, practicing martial law in order to implement it in larger cities and confiscate all weapons! This kind of fear mongering garbage is what leads to people like Timothy McVeigh, or Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, thinking that they must do something to fight back. In reality, people like Alex Jones are doing a terrible disservice to the healthy idea of questioning your government and its intentions. We should be analyzing what our government is doing, the laws they’re passing and any possible ulterior motives they may have in their actions. But to cry wolf anytime something bad happens in our country, immediately screaming about how “Obama did it,” is just absurd–and deals the overall notion of questioning your government a massive black eye. It really makes you wonder what Alex Jones’ true motives are when he’s yelling about everything from Aurora, to Sandy Hook, to Boston all being false flag operations. Not to mention pretty much every tragedy before these as well. I’m all for the First Amendment and I feel anybody has a right to speak their mind, even somebody as obviously crazy as Alex Jones or Glenn Beck. What I’m not for is when they’re using those first amendment rights to prey on vulnerable minds, leading them in the direction of violence in order to “keep their rights.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369766012399</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:33:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369766481610-91</Id><Title>Nazicommlibpigs breeding more evil anti-American William Ayers terrorists</Title><Msg>Because they HATE America as much as their Mvslim Monkey Messiah.</Msg><Username>ivanhoeofloxxly</Username><Timestamp>1369766481610</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:41:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369766668634-92</Id><Title>O'Bama protects his Mvslim brother terrorists like Nadal Hassan and Boston Bombers</Title><Msg>But goes after American citizens like FOX's James Rosen,…..

The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the state law targeting Planned Parenthood went too far. Indiana is among more than a dozen states that have enacted or considered laws to cut off taxpayer money to organizations that provide abortion.

T he Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare, has one major goal: Increasing access to affordable health care. And one of the prime mechanisms to accomplish that goal is a series of state health-care exchanges, where people without employer-provided insurance will be able to buy coverage from competing insurers. Now, America is getting an important glimpse at that exchange system. Last week, California revealed the bids from the 13 insurance companies participating in its exchange, named Covered California. The results are important, writes Paul Krugman in The New York Times, because while a health-care exchange has already worked in Massachusetts, critics wondered "what would happen in California, where more than a fifth of the non-elderly population is uninsured, and the individual insurance market is largely unregulated." The answer: Lower-than-expected premiums, averaging $321 per month. That beats previous estimates that predicted rates of at least $450. Prices would vary significantly by age and income level. For example, according to KQED Public Radio, a 21-year-old buying the least expensive plan would pay $216 per month or, with the most generous subsidy, only $44. Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, released a statement calling the announcement "a home run for consumers" that would " allow millions of consumers to enroll in affordably priced products."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369774143230</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 16:49:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369774211561-117</Id><Title>OK LibTards, what's the opposite of RIGHT?</Title><Msg>WRONG of course.

States could replicate California's success, argues Slate's Matthew Yglesias, but some won't for political reasons. That could have disastrous results, he says. There are huge swathes of the country where public officials have been deliberately refusing to try to make the new law work well, and congressional Republicans are also doing their best to try to stymie implementation. Those efforts will succeed. Residents of California, Oregon, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and other eager implementers will see much larger gains from the new law than residents of Texas, Florida, and Alabama. And since a very large share of uninsured Americans live in those red states, this will be a real tragedy for the country. [Slate] In states where Republican lawmakers have blocked Medicaid expansions, Krugman adds, even fewer people will have access to health care, which could add up to bad news for the GOP: "As contrasts emerge between the experience of states like California that are making the most of the new policy and that of states like Texas whose politicians are doing their best to undermine it, the sheer meanspiritedness of the ObamaCare opponents will become ever more obvious."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369774370951</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 16:52:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369774609326-119</Id><Topic><Title>gonna be funny watching the GOP get blamed</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369774370951</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 16:52:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You liberals should be very happy then.

All of which explains why Americans are more hopeful about the economy than at any other point in five years. Investors on Tuesday celebrated the latest buoyant reports on consumer confidence and housing prices, which together suggest that growth could accelerate in the second half of 2013. Greater confidence could spur people to spend more and help offset tax increases and federal spending cuts. And the fastest rise in home prices in seven years might lead more Americans to put houses on the market, easing supply shortages that have kept the housing recovery from taking off. Tuesday’s report from the Conference Board, a private research group, showed that consumer confidence jumped in May to a reading of 76.2, up from 69 in April. That’s the highest level since February 2008, two months after the Great Recession officially began.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369776605885</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 17:30:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369777998645-122</Id><Topic><Title>Thank you Obama for saving the country from the Bush Depression.</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369776605885</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 17:30:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tell that to the people using EBT cards.

John McCain (R-AZ) an “illegal immigrant” because he had sneaked into Syria to visit rebels fighting against the Bashar al-Assad regime. Although the White House was aware of McCain’s Syrian visit, the article indicated that his visit was virtually the same as undocumented immigration. It also noted that McCain’s humanitarian support for rebels could be attributed to his lack of intelligence, and Democratic turnout for his unsurprising win in the Arizona Senate race. The characterization of McCain is just one incident in a long series of efforts by the group to unjustifiably incite hatred against undocumented immigrants. While the Tea Party is ostensibly meant to represent true American virtues, it’s better known for its outlandish values that border on racism, particularly when it comes to immigration. Tea Partiers have deemed pejorative phrase “illegal immigrant” and “illegal alien” a “fair” phrase, even when it is not applicable in many instances. For example, in the latest gubernatorial race in Virginia, Terry McAuliffe was portrayed as an “undocumented Virginian” even though he had lived twenty years in the state.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369787923685</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 20:38:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369787963940-144</Id><Topic><Title>Thank you Congress ...</Title><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1369781311566</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 18:48:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You think the guy who ran Obama's 2008 election is not biased towards Obama and no longer confers with him.??
