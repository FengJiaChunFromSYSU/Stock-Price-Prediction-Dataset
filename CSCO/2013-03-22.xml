(Applause.) Thank you so much. Well, it is a great honor to be with you here in Jerusalem, and I'm so grateful for the welcome that I've received from the people of Israel. Thank you. (Applause.) I bring with me the support of the American people -- (applause) -- and the friendship that binds us together. (Applause.) Over the last two days, I've reaffirmed the bonds between our countries with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Peres. I've borne witness to the ancient history of the Jewish people at the Shrine of the Book, and I've seen Israel's shining future in your scientists and your entrepreneurs. This is a nation of museums and patents, timeless holy sites and ground-breaking innovation. Only in Israel could you see the Dead Sea Scrolls and the place where the technology on board the Mars Rover originated at the same time. (Applause.) But what I've most looked forward to is the ability to speak directly to you, the Israeli people -- especially so many young people who are here today -- (applause) -- to talk about the history that brought us here today, and the future that you will make in the years to come. Now, I know that in Israel's vibrant democracy, every word, every gesture is carefully scrutinized. (Laughter.) But I want to clear something up just so you know -- any drama between me and my friend, Bibi, over the years was just a plot to create material for Eretz Nehederet. (Applause.) That's the only thing that was going on. We just wanted to make sure the writers had good material. (Laughter.) I also know that I come to Israel on the eve of a sacred holiday -- the celebration of Passover. And that is where I would like to begin today. Just a few days from now, Jews here in Israel and around the world will sit with family and friends at the Seder table, and celebrate with songs, wine and symbolic foods.

I know, because I’ve experienced the "negative actions directed to members of a specific group" called discrimination. Prejudice is an attitude that can be felt. A person does not have to do or say anything prejudicial to me, but I can feel it and sense it. I think body language and non-verbal communication plays a role in prejudice.

Even Carter is glad this guy came along, so at least he knows he is no longer the worst president ever. Here is just a short list of Obama’s Failures: 1. Hawaii is in Asia 2. Passing on the keystone pipeline. 3. Touts a Green Energy Company as exemplary that fails a year later. 4. Using the Gulf Oil Spill to promote Green Energy – instead of cleaning it up. 5. Thinking the Tea Party is a passing fad – or that they are racists. 6. Pulling out of Iraq with no clear victory over insurgent forces. 7. Trying to re-write history through speeches – with inaccurate information (i.e. Statue of Liberty) 8. Getting a Nobel Prize for being the most ineffective President in the history of the United States, though some say it was for his pigment. 9. Putting all legislation on the Internet for five days before it comes to a vote. 10. Returning the bust of Churchill to the Brits. 11. Giving a collection of DVDs to the British PM. 12. Denying the notion of American Exceptionalism. 13. Promising to close Gitmo — failing to do so. 14. Securing the Olympics for Chicago in 2016. 15. Naming numerous Communists/Socialists/Progressives to his various Czar positions and then watching them scurry for cover when Beck begins to call them out, forcing them to resign. 16. Government races for NJ, VA and the Senate Seat in Mass. 17. The midterm elections, which Obama himself called a shellacking. 18. Prediction that stimulus would ensure that unemployment doesn’t exceed 8%. 19. Bowing to just about everybody. 20. Proposing amnesty for illegal aliens to increase the population of voters for Democrat elections. 21. He said, I have visited 57 states. Now there is just 1 left to visit. 22. Obama to Medvedev…give me space I will have more flexibility after my election.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363953702521</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:01:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363953780575-46</Id><Title>TIME WASHINGTON CUTS ALL THE FREE STUFF. WE ARE BROKE AND SO WILL BE NEXT GREECE.</Title><Msg>Leave it to GOP to come up with a solution for the mess that America is now in economically. I bought a bird feeder. I hung it on my back porch and filled it with seed. What a beauty of a bird feeder it was, as I filled it lovingly with seed. Within a week we had hundreds of bird taking advantage of the continuous flow of free and easily accessible food. But then the birds started building nests in the boards of the patio, above the table, and next to the barbecue. Then came the poop. It was everywhere: on the patio tile, the chairs, and the table everywhere! Then some of the birds turned mean. They would dive bomb me and try to peck me even though I had fed them out of my own pocket. And others birds were boisterous and loud. They sat on the feeder and squawked and screamed at all hours of the day and night and demanded that I fill it when it got low on food. After a while, I couldn't even sit on my own back porch anymore. So I took down the bird feeder and in three days the birds were gone. I cleaned up their mess and took down the many nests they had built all over the patio. Soon, the back yard was like it used to be quiet, serene and no one demanding their rights to a free meal. Now let's see. Our government gives out free food, subsidized housing, free medical care and free education, and allows anyone born here to be an automatic citizen. Then the illegal’s came by the tens of thousands. Suddenly our taxes went up to pay for free services; small apartments are housing 5 families; you have to wait 6 hours to be seen by an emergency room doctor; your child's second grade class is behind other schools because over half the class doesn't speak English. Corn Flakes now come in a bilingual box; I have to ‘press one ' to hear my bank talk to me in English, and people waving flags other than 'Old Glory' are squawking and screaming in the streets, demanding more rights and free liberties. Just my opinion, but maybe it's time for the government to take down the bird feeder. If you agree, pass it on; if not, just continue cleaning up the poop.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363953780575</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:03:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363953831652-47</Id><Topic><Title>drstone gets thrown off the GE board again? him and his vensh_1 alias?</Title><Username>carey50fairy</Username><Timestamp>1363177402658</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 08:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>iii</Msg><Username>winkipuss</Username><Timestamp>1363953831652</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:03:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363953836692-48</Id><Title>Lazy Obama spends more time on March Madness picks of final four than doing a Budget.</Title><Msg>Lazy Obama spends more time on March Madness picks of final four than doing a Budget. Obama you owe the American people a responsible, balanced budget. Our skyrocketing debt is damaging our economy and threatening our future. It's time to change course. Today, the GOP is introducing a plan to do just that. House Republicans are offering a common-sense plan to balance the budget in ten years. The Senate Democrats' budget, on the other hand, never balances - ever. Balancing the budget isn't just about making numbers on a spreadsheet line up. It's about the well-being of the country. A balanced budget will revive our economy and expand opportunity. Now do your job Mr. Obama. Already Democrats are falsely attacking our budget. We need your support to help us push back and put in place real solutions to our fiscal challenges. Now go do your job Mr. President. President Obama American families cannot spend more than Mom &amp; Dad make in a year or they go bankrupt. Stop using that Maxine Waters fuzzy ghetto math and balance the US budget.

Basically all the Republicans in the House and Senate said “HELL NO SOCIALIST, GO SUCK A TELEPROMPTER” when the President asked them to vote yes on the stimulus package. There was endless rhetoric, but they knew they were powerless to stop it's passage. So their no votes were really no more than hollow protest. A lot of Republican Governors echoed this sentiment. One of them was our favorite, Sarah “thanks but no thanks, now give it here” Palin. She is the Governor of Alaska, of course, a state that pays its residents to live there from massive oil revenues, yet still manages to have a billion dollar deficit. Her part of the story begins when she said she rejected 31 percent of the nearly $1 billion in available funds. Actually, it appears she tried to get away with claiming a higher figure but was promptly called out on that when everyone realized she was leaving out some of the funds slated to go to Medicare to boost the number. Ultimately her office was forced to “clarify” her original refusal to take these funds and say that the state legislature will have to be the ones to request that part of the money, of which the lions share goes toward education. So basically it's “no thanks, but my state legislature will get that from you while I grandstand for the sake of my Presidential aspirations”. Another Governor to talk the talk, then walk over to his desk and file for that sweet free money is Texas Governor Rick Perry. Oh, but he has his caveats as well. The Texas Governor wants nothing to do with $555 million in unemployment benefits, enough to raise the weekly check received by every unemployed Texan by twenty-five dollars. Further, their unemployment fund will become insolvent by fall if a new source of funding is not found. A tax on businesses is how this will be achieved in the absence of Federal funds. Gee, maybe thats why the money was alloted to them? Of course the same thing applies here as in snowbilly country. The legislature can still say “hey #$%$ you, we want it”. Or they can compromise, but this means that Perry would have to take the money first. This of course speaks nothing of the other roughly $16.5 billion headed into the state without much debate. Lastly, let's take a look at the most high profile “holdout” of them all, South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford. Sanford wins the “I can hold out longest” contest, and boy is he something for doing that. What an achievement, to wait until the last moment to do something that everyone knew he ultimately would. So what's his big stand on? Well, he is not so sure about this whole “$700 million for education and law enforcement” deal.He is apparently the only one though. In fact, his own state legislature may have to just go ahead and disagree with him in order to get this portion of the $8 billion dollars set aside for South Carolina. See a pattern forming here? The Republicans, from top to bottom have been saying all along that this thing is a bad deal. They voted against it knowing #$%$ well it was going through anyway. And then the people actually responsible for accepting the money, instead of taking a stand and saying “You know what? Our guy at the federal level was unable to stop this thing, but I damn sure can stop our states portion of the money from being spent.” have instead sent letters of certification to the White House, accepting the funds. The truth is, they want it. Oh, they have their little stands to make, on little portions of the money. But even that money can be used by a state if the states legislature can override a veto by their grandstanding Governors. Or the governors may continue to acquiesce in the face of overwhelming local opposition and call it “compromise”. Governors who all have eyes on the White House in 2012, one may add. But the simple fact is, the vast majority of this money is going to flow right down to your state and local governments no matter who is running them. And that my dear friends brings me to the question posed in the title of this weeks column of filthy Liberal journalism. How many Governors rejected the terrible socialist money alloted them? Let me see here. Oh yeah I remember. Not a single one.</Msg><Username>dei.verbum</Username><Timestamp>1363954627280</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:17:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363954722395-80</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare the US job killer.</Title><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363953605481</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:00:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>JUST ASK ANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNER.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363954722395</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:18:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363954807179-81</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO &amp; Yahoo Posting Board list of cyber liberal bullies and spammers who work for George Soros who funds them.</Title><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363954767567</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:19:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I made the list!!!!!!!!!!!!! so easy to make your list though! thanks DAVIE !</Msg><Username>winkipuss</Username><Timestamp>1363954807179</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:20:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363954822845-82</Id><Topic><Title>drstone3 Do you remember you promised us that you were leaving this board after Obama Won and wouldn't return until 2016.</Title><Username>winkipuss</Username><Timestamp>1363954521683</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:15:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>keep your promise!</Msg><Username>winkipuss</Username><Timestamp>1363954822845</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:20:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363954892498-83</Id><Topic><Title>Wow!

In total, the projects questioned by the two senators amounted to about $15 billion, or less than 2% of the $862 billion. The two senators did concede that the stimulus has had a positive effect on the economy, though they criticized it for failing to give "the biggest bang for our buck" on the issue of job creation. CNN noted that the two senators' stated objections were brief summaries presenting selective accounts that were unclear, and the journalists pointed out several instances where they created erroneous impressions.[94] One of the primary purposes and promises of the Act was to launch a large number of "shovel-ready" projects that would generate jobs.[95] However, a sizable number of these projects, most of which pertained to infrastructure, took longer to implement than they had expected by most.[96][97] This was largely attributed to the regulatory process that is involved in such projects.</Msg><Username>dei.verbum</Username><Timestamp>1363955187518</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:26:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363955190692-96</Id><Title>drstone- the last birther standing!!</Title><Msg>makes up his own ideas about who obama is</Msg><Username>winkipuss</Username><Timestamp>1363955190692</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:26:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363955212545-97</Id><Topic><Title>Here is Obama &amp; Pope Joke for you CONSERVATIVES to enjoy!</Title><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363953208711</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 07:53:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LIBERALS HATE OBAMA JOKES.

Bow Down Beeatches While many of her fans are celebrating the song as playful and innovative, the lyrics are in direct contrast to past statements she has made about wanting to inspire other women to enter and be successful in the music industry. She once said, "When I was younger I wish I had more females who played instruments to look up to.... I just wanted to do something which would inspire other young females to get involved in music so I put together an all-woman band.” While intentionally deciding to have an all-woman band was a cutting-edge and progressive decision for Beyonce to make, why would she undermine it by releasing a song that says she reigns supreme over other women? As a mother and sister, how does she not see a problem in referring to women as “b--ches” and “tricks”? Does she get a pass for being domineering and crass whenever her alter-ego Sasha Fierce decides to resurface? Women are often said to be incapable of sharing space in arenas of power.

The suspects in the Thursday killing of the 13-month-old boy and wounding of his mother are thought to be from 10 to 15 years old, Brunswick Police Chief Tobe Green said. "He said 'I'm going to kill you if you don't give me money,' and I said, `I swear I don't have any,"' the mother, Sherry West, said in a tearful interview with WAWS-TV of Jacksonville. She said she tried to protect her baby, Antonio, but shots rang out. "I put my arms over my baby and he shoves me and then he shot my baby right in the head," West said. She was recovering from a gunshot wound to her leg after the crime, which happened around 9:15 a.m. "This is obviously a terrible day in Brunswick," Brunswick Mayor Bryan Thompson said. "Please call if you know something. You are complicit in this crime."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363957777329</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:09:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363957831312-153</Id><Topic><Title>No need to ban assault weapons</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363957777329</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:09:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh by the way everyone in the NRA and everyone that doesn't support an assault weapons ban is complicit in this crime.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363957831312</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:10:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363958104535-154</Id><Topic><Title>NEW YORK (AP) — Joe Biden doesn't kiss up to anyone — whether a queen or a pope.</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1363957377160</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:02:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I Was Just Thinking That!,..</Msg><Username>dei.verbum</Username><Timestamp>1363958104535</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:15:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363958210264-155</Id><Title>It's True!

[image] We encourage investors to take profits, and we move to the sidelines as we work to better understand the significant changes occurring across the networking landscape. Could routers and switches go the way of the dodo? Yes, but slowly and not entirely. Our research does suggest that service providers and large enterprises are moving toward a significant reduction in the number of routing and switching ports deployed as a result of: 1) the continued shift from legacy packet and time-division multiplexing (TDM) networks into Ethernet networks; 2) a network infrastructure transition to common compute-based platforms; and 3) the consolidation of network functions to compute platforms based in metro or regional network data centers. Together, we expect these trends to drive more than a 40% reduction in the number of switching routing ports in service provider networks.</Msg><Username>febru3012</Username><Timestamp>1363961074928</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 10:04:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363961141732-173</Id><Topic><Title>As A Matter Of Fact Obama Was A Harvard Legacy His Father Earned A Master's in Economics</Title><Username>the.word999</Username><Timestamp>1363919934087</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 22:38:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep in mind that all tests are blind graded at Harvard Law, the Professor doesn't know who's test he is grading.

Bush</Title><Msg>Why I am no longer a Republican By George W. Bush [ Found this on another board- not sure what to think of it ] It has a lot to do with the Iraq war This week has been filled with Iraq War recriminations and re-evaluations. While official Washington was strangely silent about the 10th anniversary of the start of the conflict, journalists and intellectuals have been (predictably) more vocal. Prominent neocons have reaffirmed, with minor caveats, their support for the war. Some (erstwhile) liberal hawks have issued full-throated mea culpas. Other liberals, meanwhile, have tried to have it both ways, denouncing the war they once supported while praising its outcome. And of course, lots of people who opposed the war from the beginning, on the right and left, have declared vindication. My own position on the war fits into none of these categories. Ten years ago, I was still President. The Nation magazine strongly supported my original conception of the War on Terror, and so did I. In my speech to Congress and the nation on September 20, 2001, I stated that the United States would seek to decimate al Qaeda as well as every other terrorist groups of global reach. To this day I remain committed to that goal and willing to support aggressive military action (including the use of drone strikes) to achieve it. But thanks in large part to the Iraq war, I no longer consider myself a Republican or a man of the right.</Msg><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1363968148950</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 12:02:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363968209078-198</Id><Topic><Title>Even the FOX NEWS Rasmussen poll says that the TEA PARTY has a favorable rating of 9% now.</Title><Username>winkipuss</Username><Timestamp>1363955772359</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:36:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow!!</Msg><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1363968209078</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 12:03:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363968259960-199</Id><Topic><Title>more teabilly treason</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1363967624624</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:53:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wonder what alsmith thinks of this Junior .LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL How about dumbivan.LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL You effing phony bastid!!

Debbie Wasserman Schultz and her colleague VA Rep. Jim Moran openly whined about the impacts of spending cuts on their personal office budgets. Moran fretted that, with the looming sequester cuts, he may have to cut one staffer from his office. Wasserman Schultz upped his ante, however. She, almost literally, suggested that her staff were on the brink of starvation, due to the cuts. Speaking at a hearing of the House Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, Wasserman Schultz worried that prices of meals in House restaurants are getting so high that aides are being "priced out" of a good meal. At the carry-out cafe in the Cannon Office Building, where Wasserman Schultz has her office, you can get an 8oz bowl of Ham and Bean soup for $2. You can buy gourmet sandwiches and wraps for around $5. Both of these are cheaper than I can get at delis down the street from my house. Her aides could walk across the street to the Longworth Building, which has a large sit-down cafeteria. Today, it is featuring a roasted stuffed Chicken, with asparagus and mashed potatoes, for around $7. Or, one could opt for a heaping 12oz bowl of Chicken Chili for $3. There is also the tried and true method enjoyed by millions of workers around the country: a brown-bag lunch. Wasserman Schultz's top aide earns around $160k a year. She pays two additional aides around $120k a year. She has five additional aides who earn between $60-100k a year. Whenever anyone proposes cuts in federal spending, Democrats like Wasserman Schultz warn that the cuts will endanger seniors and children. I used to think the argument was just a cynical political play for votes. After Tuesday's hearing, however, I'm afraid Wasserman Schultz may actually believe it. If, in her mind, modest cuts to Members' personal offices results in well-paid aides struggling to pay for their lunch, then we will have a harder time cutting the budget than we realize.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1363980862022</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 15:34:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363980974812-257</Id><Title>Obama lied about being black</Title><Msg>He lied about being straight too.

Today, the GOP is introducing a plan to do just that. House Republicans are offering a common-sense plan to balance the budget in ten years. The Senate Democrats' budget, on the other hand, never balances - ever. Balancing the budget isn't just about making numbers on a spreadsheet line up. It's about the well-being of the country. A balanced budget will revive our economy and expand opportunity. Now do your job Mr. Obama. Already Democrats are falsely attacking our budget. We need your support to help us push back and put in place real solutions to our fiscal challenges.

The Pope leans towards Mr. Obama and said, "Do you know that with one little wave of my hand I can make every person in this crowd go wild with joy? This joy will not be a momentary display, but will go deep into their hearts and they'll forever speak of this day and rejoice!" Obama replied, "I seriously doubt that! With one little wave of your hand....Show me!" So the Pope backhanded him and knocked him off the stage! AND THE CROWD ROARED &amp; CHEERED WILDLY and there was happiness throughout the land Kind of brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it? Are you ready for some of Obama’s many First’s so read them and weep.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363993517817</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 19:05:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363993563228-286</Id><Topic><Title>This is likely to end the sequester</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363983320420</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 16:15:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe airports belong in privet section.

Read this: We have been hammered with the propaganda that it was the Iraq war and the war on terror that is bankrupting us. I hope the following 11reasons are forwarded over and over again until they are read so many times that the reader gets sick of reading them. 1. $11 Billion to $22 billion is spent on welfare to illegal aliens each year by state governments. 2. $22 Billion dollars a year is spent on food assistance programs such as food stamps, WIC, and free school lunches for illegal aliens. 3. $2.5 Billion dollars a year is spent on Medicaid for illegal aliens. 4. $12 Billion dollars a year is spent on primary and secondary school education for children here illegally and they cannot speak a word of English! . 5. $17 Billion dollars a year is spent for education for the American-born children of illegal aliens, known as anchor babies. 6. $3 Million Dollars a DAY is spent to incarcerate illegal aliens. 7. 30% percent of all Federal Prison inmates are illegal aliens. 8. $90 Billion Dollars a year is spent on illegal aliens for Welfare &amp; Social Services by the American taxpayers. 9. $200 Billion dollars a year in suppressed American wages are caused by the illegal Aliens. 10. In 2006, illegal aliens sent home $45 BILLION in remittances to their Countries of origin. 11. The Dark Side of Illegal Immigration: Nearly One million sex crimes committed by illegal immigrants in the United States. The total cost is a whopping... 338.3 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY; IT IS $ 338,300,000,000.00 WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY FOR THE CITIZENS OFTHIS COUNTRY. Are we THAT Stupid? YES, FOR ALLOWING THOSE in THE U.S. CONGRESS to GET AWAY WITH DOING THIS YEAR AFTER YEAR!!!!! If this doesn't bother you, then just delete the message. If, on the other hand, it does raise the hair on the back of your neck, I hope you forward it to every legal resident in the United States!!!</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363993668377</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 19:07:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363993813841-289</Id><Topic><Title>Lazy Obama spends more time on March Madness picks of final four than doing a Budget.</Title><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363983934725</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 16:25:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do your Job Obama or do not cash your pay check.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363993813841</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 19:10:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363993895120-290</Id><Topic><Title>Shame shame we know your name = juniorsclassmate_5--- the CSCO Spammer &amp; liar.</Title><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363993312379</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 19:01:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like he is on Red Bull smoke break at moveon blogging office.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363993895120</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 19:11:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363994335882-291</Id><Title>Black student axe teachers why</Title><Msg>They can't find jobs.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1363994335882</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 19:18:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363994913771-292</Id><Topic><Title>Black student axe teachers why</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1363994335882</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 19:18:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No Blacks have found Jobs in the USA since Obama was elected.

U.S. oil production is at its highest levels in a generation, with the boom greased by new technologies and more streamlined industrialization. In particular, analysts cite the exploitation of shale, natural gas and fossil fuel resources as pushing investors toward the energy sector as a whole - especially the stocks of companies involved in the drilling and extraction of oil.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1364004050490</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 22:00:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364004473621-302</Id><Title>Jesse, AL, and Obozo are too Busy Hosting the :</Title><Msg>Party to the Pokey for lil jesse jr. hershey bars and baby ruths will be plenty some.</Msg><Username>joespada282</Username><Timestamp>1364004473621</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 22:07:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364005101634-303</Id><Title>Blacks shoot white baby?</Title><Msg>Wonder why the race of shooters is suspiciously not mentioned in the news?
