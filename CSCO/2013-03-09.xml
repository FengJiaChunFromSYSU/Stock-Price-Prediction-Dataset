Now, many have given up trying and the few who continue notice very little change after speaking with politicians and their aides. “No GOP candidates or policymakers want to touch the issue, and those of us trying to educate them are left frustrated,” Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a registered Republican, told InsideClimate News. “Climate change has become a third rail in politics.” Heading into the 2008 presidential election, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, warned about the dangers of global warming. He was one of a group of moderate Republicans who used to be leading climate action advocates, acknowledging the scientific consensus on climate change and the need for federal policies to address it. But with the rise of the TeaBirchers movement in 2009, skepticism or even flat-out denial of global warming has become part of the party’s core message. And no candidate now vying for the GOP nomination can admit to the scientific consensus, much less advocate for measures to curb climate-altering emissions, no matter what positions they might have taken in the past.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1362834678775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 08:11:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362835084820-10</Id><Topic><Title>George Bush playing "hand grenades," game with Saddam cost us</Title><Username>oil_for_bullets_initiative</Username><Timestamp>1362809903967</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 01:18:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Focus on the Machiavellian turd dictator.</Msg><Username>generic_erick</Username><Timestamp>1362835084820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 08:18:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362835707285-11</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO CEO Buying Shares!</Title><Username>vincent.middleton</Username><Timestamp>1362511286358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:21:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing !!</Msg><Username>rolanda.huff</Username><Timestamp>1362835707285</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 08:28:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362836358820-12</Id><Topic><Title>Consensus is Obama is Unqualified, Incompetent, Egomaniac, Marxist, and Fraud &amp; Liar.</Title><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1361539635214</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:27:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's all about Black Liberation Theology, a marxist plan.

What happens in Calif happens to the other 56: Red To Purple to Blue States – The Political Migration March 8, 2013 By mario piperni We knew it was happening, but this fast? Trend lines for the California GOP are in free-fall. For example: • Republican numbers have fallen to 29% of registered voters. Independents have grown to 21%. Democrats are at 44%. At the current rate, independents will surpass Republicans before the end of the decade. And independents tend to vote and think a lot more like Democrats than Republicans. • Latinos are shunning the GOP. And within months they’re projected to surpass whites as California’s largest ethnic group. Among Latinos, 57% are registered Democrats, 25% are independents and the GOP is No. 3 at 18%, according to the roundtable. By the end of the decade, the current trend has Republicans relegated to 3rd party status in California. Wow. And unless Republicans make serious changes to their platform in regard to minorities, women and just about every other issue they’re locked into, it’s not hard to imagine the same happening in other states. Red state Texas (Hispanic population projected to grow by 58 percent by 2016) will soon find itself a lovely shade of purple as a fast-growing Latino population continues to align itself with the Democratic party. Nevada – currently a swing state – will in all likelihood be a blue state by the time the 2016 election rolls around. In our years time, Nevada will have another 100,000 Hispanic voters ready to cast their vote for Hillary. And then there’s this: According to a 2009 study by the Center for American Progress: “In 2020 — the first presidential election where all Millennials will have reached voting age — this generation will be 103 million strong, of which about 90 million will be eligible voters.

(Photo: Kim / flickr)"Under all plausible greenhouse gas emission scenarios," the world is on track to surpass temperatures not seen since the dawn of civilization, according to new research. Confirming "unprecedented" global warming, the new study published in Friday's issue of the journal Science shows that the earth's temperatures catapulted in just the last century at a rate that had previously taken 4,000 years. "In 100 years, we've gone from the cold end of the spectrum to the warm end of the spectrum," said climatologist Shaun Marcott, lead author of the study. "We've never seen something this rapid. Even in the ice age the global temperature never changed this quickly." Marcott said that current "global temperatures are warmer than about 75 percent of anything we've seen over the last 11,000 years or so." By 2100, he said, global temperatures will be "well above anything we've ever seen in the last 11,000 years." "The climate changes to come are going to be larger than anything that human civilization and agriculture has seen in its entire existence," NPR quotes Gavin Schmidt, a climate researcher at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, as saying. "And that is quite a sobering thought."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1362837394279</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 08:56:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362839778370-18</Id><Title>Sign in front of the New Deliverance Church</Title><Msg>If man evolved from monkeys why are there still monkeys?

ACORN Housing was shut down in 2000 due to street pimps issuing fraudulent subprime loans. The same Chicago hustlers Obama is associated with. Subprime lending was non-existent prior to Clinton taking office; 4 million subprime Loans were issued during his administration from deregulation enacted by the Community Reinvestment Collation run by Human and Health Services Under Secretary Roberta Echenberg 1991-1998. Clinton/Obama get a free pass! Clinton signed the Financial Services Modernization Act Of 1999, (wrongly referred to as Gramm-Bleach-Liley Act to place blame on those republican Senators by liberals for their own political purpose) which allowed Commercial Banks and Wall Street investment. Most consider this peace of legislation the root cause of the financial crisis of 2008/2009. Clinton spoke briefly after its signing, which is on Youtube. Take a look a the official Senate/House roll-call vote, both side of the aisle voted for it. George W. Bush was still Gov. of Texas. Democrat supporters and Wall Street CEO's Richard Fuld (Lehman Bros.), Lloyd Blankfine (Goldman Sachs), Frank Lewis (B of America), Charles Prince (Citibank)favorite... all heavily involved in subprime/mortgage backed securities and there derivatives were responsible for the 2008/2009 stock market crash.

You know the bond market was "correcting" last week. It will be interesting to see who gets stung next week if/when momentum builds. You would think Ben has been selling because he initially declared the purchases were to inspire a housing recovery, and that is moving forward. The last "cover story" was UE, and even that is improving. Stocks have been priced higher because bonds are too expensive, IMHO. I am not sure I took enough off the table or went conservative enough on my purchases.

She’s wrapping up a campaign to become the party’s vice chair, an election which will be held Sunday as the state GOP wraps up its three day convention in Sacramento. Vera Eyzendooren, the president of the San Bernardino County Federation of Republican Women — an official party group — slammed Dhillon in a recent Facebook post, which included a photo of an Islamic terrorist who beheaded two people. “I was told by one of Harmeet’s friends that because of her religion, her loyalty is to the Muslim religion,” Ms. Eyzendooren wrote on Facebook. “So she will defend a Muslim beheading two men without any hesitation……she is not a Republican.” UPDATE: Eyzendooren’s comments were sharply denounced Thursday in a joint statement from California GOP chair Tom Del Beccaro, Senate Minority Leader Bob Huff and Assembly GOP leader Connie Conway: “Blatant racism has no place in the party of Lincoln. We strongly denounce this hateful speech in this and any other venue.” At right is her shameful post, which has since been deleted: The San Bernardino GOP women’s president is not the only one leveling nasty comments aimed at Dhillon’s race and religion. San Francisco GOP activist Gail Neira, in a recent widely circulated letter, wrote: “This particular woman candidate for state v.p. appears to see herself as the dowager princess with the CAGOP as her Taj Mahal.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1362860187085</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 15:16:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362860266458-71</Id><Topic><Title>Trend in Party identification, Pew research neat graph mouse over it for the exact numbers</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1362855206857</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 13:53:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"When the DNC says all women should have access to contraceptives" it usually means that the GOP has to prevent another socialist freebie program.

I try and explain to them that what they felt doesn't matter, what matters is how people perceive what they are saying. And the fact is the GOP has now acquired a firm reputation as a racist party. It doesn't really matter if they come out and claim they aren't, or other people are prejudiced against them too. The fact is the public perception is the GOP is an intolerant, racist party. Until the GOP is willing to throw out the racists in the party instead of embracing them they will be viewed as the racist party. It is what most people believe. Forinstance Conservatism was never about liberty, merit, or even naked greed for the top 1%. It's about domination and conservation of the hierarchy. Oh, sure, greed indulgence is one of the fruits of social domination, but when it comes down to it the European and Southern and Russian aristocrats have made it damn clear that no amount of money would be worth losing the privilege to force everyone else wallow in sewage -- even if they had to wallow in mud in order to crack the whip. The Republican Party as we know it today isn't about "limited government" or "state's rights" or a "strong military," it is about white racism. It simply wouldn't exist as a viable national party if it didn't include the white racist constituency. And what passes as "conservative/evangelical Christians" in many cases, is part of the same faction. Just like the KKK. I haven't seen any realistic assessment of the percentage of the GOP that is White Racist, but it has to be pushing 80 percent, and when you're talking those kinds of numbers, there is simply no way to "subtract" the White Racist component and have any kind of Republican Party left. Rather, the Republican Party IS the White Racist Party.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1362866222474</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 16:57:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362867126060-91</Id><Title>GOP is in a tough spot</Title><Msg>if they throw out the 25% that are blatant racists they still are unlikely to attract minority voters, at least not in the short term.

ACORN Housing was shut down in 2000 due to street pimps issuing fraudulent subprime loans. The same Chicago hustlers Obama is associated with. Subprime lending was non-existent prior to Clinton taking office; 4 million subprime Loans were issued during his administration from deregulation enacted by the Community Reinvestment Collation run by Human and Health Services Under Secretary Roberta Echenberg 1991-1998. Clinton/Obama get a free pass! Clinton signed the Financial Services Modernization Act Of 1999, (wrongly referred to as Gramm-Bleach-Liley Act to place blame on those republican Senators by liberals for their own political purpose) which allowed Commercial Banks and Wall Street investment. Most consider this peace of legislation the root cause of the financial crisis of 2008/2009. Clinton spoke briefly after its signing, which is on Youtube. Take a look a the official Senate/House roll-call vote, both side of the aisle voted for it. George W. Bush was still Gov. of Texas. Democrat supporters and Wall Street CEO's Richard Fuld (Lehman Bros.), Lloyd Blankfine (Goldman Sachs), Frank Lewis (B of America), Charles Prince (Citibank)favorite... all heavily involved in subprime/mortgage-backed securities and there derivatives were responsible for the 2008/2009 stock market crash. Liberals and democrats still mention their favorite goat- George W. Bush in there on going blame game. *** Good information.

This includes 85% of Republicans, 71% of Democrats and 68% of Independents favor drilling. [15] The poll additionally found the American public split on whether the domestic drilling would have any effect on gas prices. Pelosi wants oil companies to drill on the lands already leased and is refusing to allow a vote on additional domestic drilling. She did take a vote to close the House of Representatives early for a five-week recess without addressing energy issues. [17] Pelosi wants to tap into the Strategic Oil Reserves. "America's greatest strategic reserves lie beneath taxpayer-owned lands - including ANWR's northern coastal plain and the outer continental shelf - that are currently off limits to energy production,” said Daniel Kish, senior vice president of the Institute for Energy Research, an oil industry-supported think tank. [18] Nancy Pelosi often blames oil companies and capitalist speculators for the oil price increases. Her call for renewable energy and new technologies hasn't had an impact on lowering oil prices. "A New Direction", the Democrats' Six for '06 campaign promises includes energy independence. She has completely failed to produce anything that would contribute to energy independence. "For 25 years, Democrats have blocked more American-made oil and gas. That's why we're in the predicament we're in, voters want Congress "to vote on more American made oil and gas. We want to do that. She, Harry Reid, Barack Obama are standing in the way." "She's got time to go out and promote her new book tour and her new book, but she doesn't have time to schedule a vote on the floor of the House and let the American people have their will expressed?" said Minority Leader John Boehner, R-OH. Pelosi is a supporter of increasing taxes and regulation on energy production because she is a believer in global warming. She was scheduled to speak at a March 2, 2009 global warming protest, but did not make it because her plane was delayed due to a snowstorm.
