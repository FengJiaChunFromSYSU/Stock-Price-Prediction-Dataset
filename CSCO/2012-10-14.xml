Tea Party faithful are still listed as independent, although survey's show as many as 45% are listed as Republican. Based on early ballots, Romney has a 15 point lead. This is staggering, and unprecedented. Just being slightly ahead would have been encouraging. Freighters have been booked for the short trip from Florida to Cuba and rail car accommodations are being upgraded to allow Democrats to be moved in 'comfort' from the North East to Cuba by the millions, just in time for the cane harvest. Survivors will then be shipped to Venezuela for domestic servant roles and boot licking. Democrats from Calipornia will be forced to stay in that state where they will suffer the disastrous consequences of Democratic mismanagement for decades. Fuel shortages, water shortages and industrial products will be severely limited since all trans-Pacific freight will be shipped to the central and eastern US through the newly enlarged Panama canal by the Chinese company PeiWei. This construction has been ongoing for a decade, since Carter turned the canal over to Pineapple Face. Best wishes, sad faced, misogynist, depraved, debauched and deluded Democrat!

Coyote will be played by Vice President Joe Biden." Thursday night's debate between Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan went according to the super-secret plan of Karl Rove to not only defeat but deeply embarrass the Democratic Party. Rove had previously arranged for President Obama to take two Ambien before the first debate. Not even a maniacal, all-powerful Rove could be blamed for the Democrats decision to attempt to cover-up the details of the terrible tragedy in Benghazi or the serial malfeasances before or after the attack of 9/11 that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans --Glen Doherty, Sean Smith and Tyrone Woods. The collapse of the president in the first debate and the implosion of the vice president in the second were mere political misfortunes, but the murders in Benghazi were horrible personal tragedies and a national nightmare. That Obama spokesperson Stephanie Cutter then politicized the deaths by blaming the attention paid to them on politics rather than on the trauma of a shocked nation left her radioactive and forever branded as the operative willing to say anything. These are the events that changed a nation's mood and the election that is to be held after the shift. Many will always argue that Mitt Romney would have surged into the lead in any event given the underlying economic havoc the president has wrecked upon the country, and indeed that is the fundamental premise of the University of Colorado model that has correctly predicted the result in presidential elections back to 1980. It is the state of the state-by-state economies that drive their votes according to this model, and this model, updated and released this week, shows Mitt Romney accumulating 330 electoral college votes and romping to a victory. Whatever the reason --terrible debate performances, a searing national tragedy brought about by terrorists and its cover-up, or economic misery on a state-by-state basis, Mitt Romney is winning, and the country will be ready to celebrate when he does. A fresh start is needed. Most economists still don't see another recession looming, but the number who do is rising rapidly and Europe is sinking deeper into a recession that could pull us along with it. The price of gas has topped $5 a gallon in many places in California, and the consequences of the president's feckless energy policy are everywhere coming into clear view and brining with them agony for the middle class. Devastating cuts to the military's personnel and equipment are poised to occur under the "sequestration" and the president is cheering them on. And of course the fiscal cliff looms and we are headed towards it in Thelma and Louise style, with the president hitting the gas and demanding the "Bush era tax cuts" fade and the country fly off the side of the canyon into who knows what. Did I mention Obamacare unfolds in all of its maniacal bureaucratic density in the next year? All of these factors have driven the surge towards Romney, and poll after poll shows that the country is shaking off the torpor induced by the endlessly talking, talking, talking president and the endlessly gesturing, gesturing, gesturing vice president. Democrats are hoping that the president can work some of his old magic on Tuesday night, in effect requesting an entire nation to step up on to the stage and be hypnotized --again. Who is going to volunteer to sleep walk through another four years? There is a fine new satire out by Jamie Weinstein and Will Rahn of the Daily Caller. It is The Lizard King: The Shocking Inside Account of Obama's True Intergalactic Ambitions by an Anonymous White House Staffer, and it is wildly funny as only good and timely satire can be. What it mocks are (1) conspiracy theorists who spin bizarre tales about the president, and (2) most especially the president and his inner circle, the Chicago Gang. Knocking the nutters about is pretty easy stuff though funny, but the art is in laying open the many, many conceits of Team Obama, especially those of its world-weary senior advisors and their deep seated belief that they know what they are doing at all times. In fact they are and have been from day one a group of bumbling, stumbling amateurs, bereft of real experience in anything outside of the ward politics of Chicago, and propped up as best as was possible by a permanent governing class and especially by an incredibly effective military, and covered for by a Manhattan-Beltway media elite that fell in love with the president's story (especially those parts that closely resemble their own.) Having blown through all the intelligence and all the world position willed them by President Bush --Mark Steyn is especially good at recognizing how this cupboard has been stripped bare-- Team Obama is now witnessing the rolling collapse of the president's ego-driven plans that is materializing at breakneck speed, and the consequences are terrible for the country and the West it leads (or used to lead.) "But wait," they cry, "unemployment is down to 7.8%!" Put aside your suspicion and believe the number. That's it? That's the re-election campaign? Unemployment down to 7.8%? Yes, it is. That and the promise of four more years of Joe Biden's unintentional comic relief. There are many reason behind the rise of Mitt Romney to the top of the polls, and for his continuing momentum. Chief among them is the country's desperate hunger for competence and for integrity, for candor as to the problems and transparency in the explanation of the choices ahead. A turnaround is possible and we are lucky to have a turnaround specialist at hand. Whatever the next two debates bring us, whatever Rove has cooked up, the essential dynamic of Election 2012 was, is and will remain the need to make a U-Turn. We went down a wrong road in 2008, for a lot of very good and understandable reasons. But it was a huge mistake, a mistake we can begin to correct in four weeks.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350225590167</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 10:39:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350225843174-7</Id><Topic><Title>If YOU are middle class and vote GOP, you are</Title><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1350221687270</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 09:34:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Man,isnt that the truth</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1350225843174</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 10:44:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350225948225-8</Id><Title>GOP voters are FOOLED so easy because they are UNINFORMED</Title><Msg>Middle class andf vote GOP ,YOU ARE HURTING YOURSELF,,,,think</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1350225948225</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 10:45:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350227104073-9</Id><Title>obama bumper stick , may as well read "I'm Just That Stupid"</Title><Msg>After 4 years of blaming someone else for the job he applied for, this fool won't take responsibility for his own lousy economy. 23 million people are out of work, bankruptcies and foreclosures at a record high.

The problems with the bailout of these car companies are firstly that the union featherbedding contracts with there profit killing excessive benefits were not excised from the contracts. These benefits put these car companies $2,000 per car more than similar cars from other brands. This addition cost now is being paid for out of taxpayer money. We will never get the money back we put into these companies like we have with the TARP bank loans. Its a lie these companies are on Taxpayers Welfare.

Lie after lie is all the American people get from this corrupt administration.</Msg><Username>algore_eats_his_own_boogers</Username><Timestamp>1350234550769</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 13:09:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350234713480-29</Id><Topic><Title>JOE BIDEN THROWS CIA UNDER BUS ON BENGAZI LIBYA THEN SAYS CIA KNOWS IRANS EVERYMOVE</Title><Username>kwanza_beauty_queen</Username><Timestamp>1350109401285</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 02:23:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When it comes to a choice of being honest upfront and creating a strawman(anti-islam video) to blame for the murder of US Libyan Ambassador Stevens and 4 co workers, the Obama administration always chooses deceit and lies and creates strawmen to blame.</Msg><Username>algore_eats_his_own_boogers</Username><Timestamp>1350234713480</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 13:11:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350234860212-30</Id><Title>If You want Romney and Ryan to Control your Uterus vote GOP, if you want womens rights vote Obama Biden</Title><Msg>crystal clear choice on womens rights</Msg><Username>gliderpilot7777</Username><Timestamp>1350234860212</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 13:14:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350235071741-31</Id><Topic><Title>House Republicans cut the administration’s request for embassy security funding by $331 million in fiscal 2012.</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350233506532</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 12:51:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama State Department Official Charlene Lamb was asked in the Congressional hearings under oath, if funding was a factor in rejecting the ambassadors request for more security.Lamb said it was not.

Obviously it was more important for the Obama administration to lavish the US Vienna Embassy with Expensive Chevy Volts than to provide Security to protect Libyan Ambassador Stevens who was murdered because of the Obama administrations negligence. From Washinton Times: "In a May 3, 2012, email, the State Department denied a request by a group of Special Forces assigned to protect the U.S. embassy in Libya to continue their use of a DC- 3 airplane for security operations throughout the country. The subject line of the email, on which slain Ambassador Chris Stevens was copied, read: “Termination of Tripoli DC-3 Support.” Four days later, on May 7, the State Department authorized the U.S. embassy in Vienna to purchase a $108,000 electric vehicle charging station for the embassy motor pool’s new Chevrolet Volts. The purchase was a part of the State Department’s “Energy Efficiency Sweep of Europe” initiative, which included hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on green program expenditures at various U.S. Embassies."

One of the reasons for the stagnant housing recovery is that slowest economic recovery since 1882 (when Chester Arthur was President). According to Stanford economist John Taylor, the current economic recovery is the slowest since 1882. Economic growth is generally strong following recessions, but not this time around. According to Taylor, “Growth was nearly 4 times stronger on average in the past recoveries. The only recovery in this list in which growth was as weak as this one followed the 1990-91 recession, but that was from a very shallow recession with output declining only 1.1%, so growth did not need to get very high to catch up.” In addition to looking at economic growth rates (which we know have been lackluster following the most recent recession), we can see other indicators that the recent “recovery” has been dismal. Mean Duration of Unemployment While some celebrated the decline of unemployment to 7.8%, little mention was made of the mean duration of unemployment lingering at around 40 weeks. This figure is abnormally high by historic standards. U6 Unemployment/Underemployment The measure of unemployment and underemployment, U6, remained at 14.7% in the most recent unemployment report. Wage &amp; Salary Income to GDP In addition to dismal employment numbers, wage &amp; salary income to GDP has fallen since the end of the recent recession. Growing Dependency on Government (Disability and Food Stamps) One aspect of the economy that has increased is the growth of government dependency. Since July 2010, more people have gone on disability than have fallen off unemployment (by 255,000). And food stamps have skyrocketed, not a good sign for the economy. Employment to Population Ratio I have often mention the employment to population ratio which has fallen to levels not seen since the Carter recessions. Fiscal Cliff and the Largest Increase in Taxes in American History There is no doubt about it. The fiscal cliff is approaching and approaching fast. The Obama Administration and Congress have instituted 20+ new taxes in the form of Obamacare. And the Bush tax cuts expire leading to an increase in marginal tax rates for everybody INCLUDING the middle class. -The 10% bracket rises to a new and expanded 15% -The 25% bracket rises to 28% -The 28% bracket rises to 31% -The 33% bracket rises to 36% -The 35% bracket rises to 39.6% Of course, there may be a suspension of the Bush tax cuts for a year. But the Obamacare taxes are going into effect regardless. The fiscal cliff could cost the construction industry $2 billion in lost work and 61,483 federal jobs in architecture and engineering occupations are at risk from sequestration. And lest we forget, the Federal debt is over $16 trillion AND taxpayers face a liability for unfunded liabilities (Medicare, etc) of over $1 million EACH. [I would say that cutting PBS and Big Bird seems like a good start!)</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350246903759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 16:35:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350248277358-68</Id><Title>IF re-elected, why won't Obama...</Title><Msg>extend the Bush tax cuts even longer?

If Romney talks about the 23 million UE Americans, the losses in home values the bankruptcies, the foreclosures, Obama is in trouble. Obama must steer this night into lying about Romney for his own record is indefensible. Obama must hope the moderator interrupts Romney like the Raddish did. Obama must hope Romney can't get the facts out about the Libyan embassy coverup. Obama must hope that people forget the high gas price they just paid to fill up their car.

More than 775,000 of such loans are outstanding, according to the federal government. Concerns about the multibillion-dollar reverse mortgage market echo those raised in the lead-up to the financial crisis when consumers were marketed loans — often carrying hidden risks — that they could not afford. “There are many of the same red flags, including explosive growth and the fact that these loans are often peddled aggressively without regard to suitability,” said Lori Swanson, the Minnesota attorney general, who is working on reforming the reverse mortgage market. Joan Serioux-Forde, 72, thought that she couldn’t feel more devastated after her husband, Christopher, died last year. Then, roughly a month after the funeral, she received a letter from Generation Mortgage, a reverse mortgage lender, informing her that unless she paid $293,000, she would lose her home in San Bernardino, Calif. Ms. Forde said she was never informed that if she wasn’t on the reverse mortgage deed, she would have virtually no right to stay in her home unless she bought it outright. “It’s a nightmare,” she said. Generation Mortgage declined to comment.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350250808216</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:40:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350250961953-75</Id><Topic><Title>New study Global Warming ended in 1997</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350245070975</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 16:04:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lot's of educated Scientists are really stupid OR really greedy, some of us without a scientist degree saw through their lies just by applying common sense.

But despite a price tag now estimated at $833 billion, there are 925,000 fewer construction jobs in the United States than in February 2009, and 1,035,000 fewer than when Obama was inaugurated, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). And there are even 484,000 fewer jobs than when the last recession officially ended in June 2009. When Obama signed the stimulus bill in Denver, Colo., he told a crowd: "Because we know we can't build our economic future on the transportation and information networks of the past, we are remaking the American landscape with the largest new investment in our nation's infrastructure since Eisenhower built an Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. "Because of this investment, nearly 400,000 men and women will go to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our faulty dams and levees, bringing critical broadband connections to businesses and homes in nearly every community in America, upgrading mass transit, building high-speed rail lines that will improve travel and commerce throughout our nation." But in September 2012, according to the BLS, 5,523,000 Americans had jobs in the construction industry, down from 6,558,000 in January 2009, when Obama took office, and down from 6,448,000 in February 2009, when Obama signed the stimulus. It is also down from 5,564,000 in January of this year, when Obama started the fourth year of his term. Construction jobs in the United States peaked at 7,726,000 in April 2006.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350251349518</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:49:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350251560714-77</Id><Topic><Title>obama bumper stick , may as well read "I'm Just That Stupid"</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350227104073</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 11:05:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you believed in man made global warming Your Just the Stupid</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350251560714</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:52:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350251663927-78</Id><Topic><Title>JOE BIDEN ACTED LIKE DEGENERATE JERRY SPRINGER GUEST</Title><Username>democrat_cocoon_of_terror</Username><Timestamp>1350060201612</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 12:43:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're just sour grapes because the punk kid {RYAN} got his butt kicked !</Msg><Username>snjusnd</Username><Timestamp>1350251663927</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:54:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350251664664-79</Id><Topic><Title>Slowest recover since 1882</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350246903759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 16:35:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you think its Romney and not Obama that wants to raise your taxes Your just that Stupid</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350251664664</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:54:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350252117809-80</Id><Topic><Title>Over a million construction jobs lost because of Obama</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350251349518</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:49:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well Rhonda ....I don't know state you you live in ....Here in the Dallas-FtWorth area construction is booming....But of course this a "RIGHT TO WORK" state.....That can make a substancial difference...</Msg><Username>snjusnd</Username><Timestamp>1350252117809</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:01:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350253324921-81</Id><Topic><Title>Over a million construction jobs lost because of Obama</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350251349518</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:49:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama caused the housing crisis when he was a Senator and controlled the Bush Administration!!!

Yes Bush's meaningless invasion made us more hated in the Middle East. If the Soviets invaded the U.S. because Canada bombed Moscow, I don't think most Americans would be happy either. Baggers are so jaded they are unable to look at things from another persons viewpoint. Let's review Iran, in 1952 there was a Democratically elected President that objected to the fact that the U.S. oil companies were pumping all the oil out of Iran and not paying for it. The U.S. CIA assassinated him and installed a dictator who tortured and murdered all opposition. The people rose up and revolted. Then Bush announced that Iran was part of the Axis of evil and we needed to overthrow the democratically elected government. He then invaded the country to the East of Iran and the Country to the West of Iran. Now baggers, stop for a second and change the names. The U.S. elects Ronald Raygun who objects that Venezuela is pumping oil from U.S. land without paying for it, so Venezuela has him assassinated and installs a dictator who holds no elections in the U.S. and uses murder and torture against anyone who objects with him (with Venezuela's full support). When the heroic U.S. rises up and overthrows the installed dictator Venezuela declares the U.S. evil, invades Canada and Mexico because England bombs Cuba. Now Venezuela baggers are confused why they are not loved by the baggers in the U.S.. new stupid lows for baggers</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350260659081</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:24:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350261372142-101</Id><Topic><Title>Tuesday's debate</Title><Username>crankf41</Username><Timestamp>1350249045489</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:10:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pathetic when a boob like Biden does so much better than Obama did.</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1350261372142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:36:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350261574496-102</Id><Topic><Title>Romney will prevent war in Syria</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350240125349</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 14:42:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey dumdum Magoo, tell Obama to quit lying to us about the one trillion then.LOLOLOLOLOLOL Is he a stupid teabagger too ???LOLOLOL</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1350261574496</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:39:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350262517805-103</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Change = 23,MILLION UNEMPLOYED</Title><Username>weeping_oil_soaked_obama_pelican</Username><Timestamp>1349655509483</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 20:18:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama administration is pretending that the 23 million UNEMPLOYED Americans no longer exist and all died.</Msg><Username>nancy_pelosi_is_an_eyesore</Username><Timestamp>1350262517805</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:55:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350262766767-104</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA =UNEMPLOYMENT TO WOMENS COLLEGE GRAD KIDS</Title><Username>fukk_france_dot_com</Username><Timestamp>1337973286000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-05-25 15:14:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is really pathetic when Obama becomes Presient and mothers spend large sums of money for their kids to get a college education then when the kids graduate they can't find a job under Obama and have to mooch off of mom until America elects a new President.</Msg><Username>nancy_pelosi_is_an_eyesore</Username><Timestamp>1350262766767</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:59:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350262991295-105</Id><Topic><Title>Tuesday's debate</Title><Username>crankf41</Username><Timestamp>1350249045489</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:10:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since you picked out the poll you liked, I'll go with the one that says Romney leads by one.LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL All the polls will change after Tuesday so todays dont mean anything,idiot.</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1350262991295</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 21:03:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350263064059-106</Id><Title>2016.

The SWC also called for Obama to cut off all contact with the Muslim Brotherhood until the threat is retracted. Al Ahram, Egypt’s largest newspaper, reported Badie’s speech in which he said: "The Jews … have spread corruption on earth, spilled the blood of believers and in their actions profane holy places, including their own." Badie urged Muslims to confront Israel “through holy jihad, high sacrifices and all forms of resistance … Zionists only understand the language of force and will not relent without duress.” The SWC statement reads: “Badie’s rant confirms our long-held view that Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood is the most dangerous anti-Semitic organization in the world today. We are not dealing with a Youtube video or a lone extremist Imam, but a call for anti-Semitic violence by a man who has tens of millions of followers and leads the organization thast controls Egypt’s future. It cannot be business as usual in Washington when such an assault is launched against the Jewish people.
