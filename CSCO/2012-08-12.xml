Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said that surveys showed attacks on the Ryan plan moved voters dramatically, adding that Mr. Romney could no longer dance around it. “There is no longer a nuance to that debate,” he said. “There are a lot of white, working-class voters, particularly older ones, who will walk away now, even if tempted earlier by the slow economy.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344779541028</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 09:52:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344780678227-9</Id><Topic><Title>RYAN-ROMNEY.....MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

It showed how he pivoted from being a relatively cautious investor to risking his reputation for a big payoff. It is one that Romney has rarely, if ever, mentioned in his two bids for the presidency, perhaps because the Houston-based department store chain that Bain assembled later went into bankruptcy. But what distinguishes this deal from the nearly 100 others that Romney did over a 15-year period was his close work with Milken’s firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. At the time of the deal, it was widely known that Milken and his company were under federal investigation, yet Romney decided to go ahead with the deal because Drexel had a unique ability to sell high-risk, high-yield debt instruments, known as “junk bonds.” The Obama campaign has criticized the deal as showing Romney’s eagerness to make a “profit at any cost,” because workers lost jobs, and challenged Romney’s assertion that his business background best prepares him for the presidency. Romney, meanwhile, once referred to the deal as emanating from “the glorious days of Drexel Burnham,” saying, “it was fun while it lasted,” in a little-noticed interview with American Banker magazine. The “glorious” part, for Romney at least, was that he used junk-bond financing to turn a $10 million investment into a $175 million profit for himself, his partners, and his investors. It marked a turning point for Romney, according to Marc Wolpow, a former Drexel employee who was involved in the deal and later was hired by Romney to work at Bain Capital.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344780835512</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 10:13:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344781109262-11</Id><Topic><Title>hail mary pass already deflected</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344779541028</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 09:52:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You loons would have been wailing and whining if Romney had picked Hillary Clinton for veep.

Paul Ryan was born into a well-to-do Janesville, Wisc. family, part of the so-called “Irish mafia” that’s run the city’s construction industry since the 19th century. When his lawyer father died young, sadly, the high-school aged Ryan received Social Security survivor benefits. But they didn’t go directly to supporting his family; by his own account, he banked them for college. He went to the private Miami University of Ohio; the land grant University of Wisconsin (my alma mater) apparently wasn’t good enough for Ryan. After his government-subsidized private education, the pride of Janesville left college and went to work for government, where he’s spent his entire career, first serving Republican legislators and then in his own Congressional seat, with occasional stints at his family-owned construction business when he needed a job (reportedly he also drove an Oscar Mayer Wiener Mobile for a while). Ironically, Ryan came to national attention trying to dismantle the very program that helped him go to a private university, pushing an even more radical version of President Bush’s Social Security privatization plan, which failed. He has since become the scourge of the welfare state, a man wholly supported by government who preaches against the evils of government support. He could be the poster boy for President Obama’s supposedly controversial oration about how we all owe our success to some combination of our own hard work, family backing and government support. Let’s say it together: You didn’t build that career by yourself, Congressman Ryan. Thus Paul Ryan represents the fakery at the heart of the Republican project today. It starts with the contradiction that Mr. Free Enterprise has spent his life in the bosom of government, enjoying the added protection of wingnut welfare benefactors like the Koch brothers. If Herman Cain is Charles and David Koch’s “brother from another mother,” as he famously joked, Ryan is the fourth Koch, swaddled in support from Americans for Prosperity and other Koch fronts. The man who wants to make the world safe for swashbuckling, risk-taking capitalists hasn’t spent a day at economic risk in his entire life."</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344782357909</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 10:39:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344782378569-16</Id><Topic><Title>Romney must show the tax returns.

The choice of Ryan will nationalize the race for Congress and bring new focus on the dominant theme of many critical house races: Medicare, Medicare, Medicare. It will also, allow President Obama to run against the physical embodiment of the obstructionist Republican Congress that has about a 15% approval rating. It will make it easy for the Obama team to make the politically toxic Ryan budget a centerpiece of the race. And, finally, perhaps most important, it virtually guarantees that the race will ultimately be viewed by many voters as a choice not simply a referendum on Obama's performance or the economy. But one thing is clear. By choosing Ryan, Romney proved once and for all, that if he wins, right wing strategist Grover Norquist will have what he says wants: a President who has enough digits to sign whatever the Tea Party gang in Congress passes - a guy with no core values of his own who is perfectly willing to be led around by a ring in his nose to do whatever his right wing backers and the passionate partisans of the radical Tea Party in Congress demand of him. Romney's choice of Ryan proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that Mitt Romney will never revert to his "moderate" former self if he were elected President. He, Paul Ryan, the Tea Party and his billionaire contributors will try to fundamentally transform America into a plutocracy that is of, by and for a tiny number of very wealthy families. And the notion that Paul Ryan is a "bold visionary" - as his book "Young Guns" would have us believe -- is simply laughable. Is it "bold" to abolish Medicare, convert it into a voucher program, and raise the annual out of pocket health care spending of a senior citizen making $14,000 or $15,000 a year by $4,000 - just so you can give hundreds of thousands of dollars of additional tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America? Outrageous, but not "bold" - unless you think that it's "bold" for a street thug to steal a senior citizen's purse - or a juice loan operator to prey on low income customers who are desperate for credit. Robinhood was bold. "Romneyhood" is not. "Romneyhood" is about the strong victimizing the weak. That's not "bold"; that's brazen. And if you think abolishing Medicare is "visionary", think again. Republicans have been trying to get rid of Medicare since they opposed its passage in 1965. It was former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who said he hoped it would "wither on the vine" two decades ago.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344787068789</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:57:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344791676419-29</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's desperate choice</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344787068789</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:57:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ryan must have DeepdumbivanHarbor really in a panic.

"The 'big boy' drought last year in the state of Texas exceeded anything that we had seen in the past," said Johnson. He said the 6,200 members of his co-op are also suffering from the catastrophic drought gripping the Midwest. It has killed the corn that would have fed these Texas cows and sent the price of feed soaring. The July report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows the lowest national cattle herd since 1973. Ranchers here say the prolonged drought could make those numbers even lower. "The only place that we have to turn is to liquidate our animals," said Johnson, "and then somehow look for another livelihood that in this economy doesn't seem to be offering a lot of opportunities to a lot of people." The estimate is that 25 percent of the ranchers and dairy farmers in this co-op may be on the brink of losing their way of life. "The best way to put it at this point is let's just all pray for rain," said Johnson.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344792498901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 13:28:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344792996403-32</Id><Topic><Title>I'm voting romney/ryan</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344720488236</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 17:28:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think Faux still is biased, their 9 point lead is probably 3</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344792996403</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 13:36:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344793353098-33</Id><Title>Why Ryan dooms Romney to loss</Title><Msg>Ryan is a teabagger and America hates baggers Now, 20 percent approve while a stunning 40 percent disapprove of it.

With the budget in surplus at the time, Mr. Bush didn’t dispute that cost, and never tried to pretend that the cuts would be free. Within a decade, in fact, they would turn out to be the biggest factor in the huge deficit he created. Twelve years later, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, claims his far deeper tax cuts would have a price tag of exactly zero dollars. He has no intention of submitting his tax plan to the committee or anywhere else that might conduct a serious analysis, since he seems intent on running a campaign far more opaque than any candidate has in years. He has made his economic plan the fundamental basis of his candidacy, and yet with the Republican convention just two weeks away, we know next to nothing of the plan’s details. The extreme cuts proposed by his new running mate, Paul Ryan, are far more hard-edged, making Mr. Romney’s mathematically impossible promises look vague and shopworn by comparison. For example, Mr. Romney wants to keep all the Bush tax cuts, then cut taxes much further, particularly for the rich, but he says the plan won’t grow the deficit by a dime. He won’t say how he will accomplish this — there are no real numbers in his plan beyond a vague pledge to eliminate some loopholes. The Joint Committee would take one look at his substance-free plan and say, we can’t work with this.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344811523470</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 18:45:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344811917363-55</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan voted for the Iraq War!</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1344805549002</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 17:05:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>only in the bagger rabbit hole where idiots like Rhonda live does ending a war and withdrawing all the troops amount to doubling down, LOL Hello Rhonda, Obama never sent more troops to Iraq, lol</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344811917363</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 18:51:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344812590960-56</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan voted for the Iraq War!</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1344805549002</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 17:05:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you don't shut down a war immediately you #$%$ the point was not to go to war in the first place you dumb imbecile. people died for nothing in Iraq and now you come here to lecture us about Iran and Libya? we should stick an Iran nuke up your dirty hole and light it up, so your dead brain would explode.</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1344812590960</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 19:03:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344815677657-57</Id><Topic><Title>Lets see how long it takes it HATERS to start the personal attacks.</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1344684190830</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 07:23:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really, since when is telling the truth slander?

On Feb. 2, 2009, President Barack Obama explained his chances to fix the economy to host Matt Lauer on NBC’s “Today” show: “I will be held accountable. I’ve got four years. … If I don’t have this done in three years, then there’s going to be a one-term proposition.” Here are my Top 10 reasons why I believe President Obama shouldn’t stay a single day beyond his one term in the Oval Office: 10) Obama’s economic actions have failed to lower the U.S. unemployment rate below 8 percent for last 42 record months Four years into his presidency, Reuters has reported on Obama’s economic progress: “Details of the household survey, from which the unemployment rate is drawn, gave a downbeat assessment of the labor market, with the share of the population that has a job falling to near cycle lows. In addition, the labor force participation rate, or the percentage of Americans who either have a job or are looking for one, fell to 63.7 percent last month from 63.8 percent. That is a sign of low confidence in the labor market. Data last week showed the economy grew at an annual pace of 1.5 percent in the second quarter, also far short of the 2.5 percent rate needed to keep the unemployment rate stable.” 9) The Obama administration’s out-of-control spending has led America to the economic brink and destroyed our country’s credit rating In 2010, President Obama spoke out of one side of his mouth when giving financial advice to the people in New Hampshire: “When times are tough, you tighten your belts. You don’t go buying a boat when you can barely pay your mortgage. You don’t blow a bunch of cash in Vegas when you’re trying to save for college.” But he then spoke out the other side of his mouth when he informed the American public that he was proposing a record-breaking $3.8 trillion budget for 2011, which equates to spending $7.3 million a minute. (The federal budget was only $1.9 trillion in 2001.) Tragically, the president expects Americans to live financially one way (fiscally prudent) and the federal government to live another (extravagantly wild). Not surprisingly, Moody’s credit rating agency announced the next day after the president’s 2011 budget proposal release that his fiscal policies “test [America's] AAA boundaries” and now push the U.S. government credit ratings below those of Canada, Germany and even France. Even the liberal media predicted that Obama’s spending would “leave a string of deficits dwarfing any in the nation’s history.” And they were right. 8) Obama’s reckless spending and fiscal policies have added more to the national debt than most U.S. presidents combined: Roughly $6 trillion during his first term in office (making the total debt nearly $16 trillion) and, by White House projections alone, $21.3 trillion by the end of fiscal 2017, $25 trillion in 2021 and $25.9 trillion in 2022. In 2007 when I began writing my New York Times best-seller, “Black Belt Patriotism,” unemployment was less than 5 percent, the annual federal budget was about $2.9 trillion, the federal deficit was $161 billion and the national debt was $9 trillion. Today, unemployment is stuck at 8.3 percent, the federal budget at $3.8 trillion, the federal deficit at $1.3 trillion and the national debt is quickly approaching a staggering $16 trillion. And to add insult to injury, our vassalage to other countries deepens as they bankroll increasing amounts of U.S. debt, with more than one-half of the public debt alone held by private investors in foreign lands. A few weeks ago, the International Business Times reported, “China overtook Japan as the largest holder of U.S. national debt in 2009. As of December (the most recent data available), it held about 23.1 percent, or $1.15 trillion, of all foreign investment in U.S. privately held federal debt, according to a newly released report by the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. … Without monetary policy change, the CBO warned in its 2012 Long-Term Budget Outlook on June 5, the U.S. federal debt could be twice the size of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2037.” Even PolitiFact confessed, “U.S. total debt is now about 101 percent of GDP. … The president’s current spending proposal projects the debt will grow to $21.3 trillion by the end of fiscal 2017 – the last year for which a two-term Obama would submit a budget. … The White House projected [its] plan would lead to gross national debts of $25 trillion in 2021 and $25.9 trillion in 2022.” America, is that really the burden you want to place upon yourselves and your children? 7) Obama has not only detrimentally increased the costs of entitlements but the dependency of citizens upon government subsidies, rather than empowering the people’s autonomy, responsibility and freedom. President Obama has been called the “food stamp president” because more federal grocery subsidies have been given out under his presidency than most others combined. A record 44.7 million people – or one in seven Americans – were on food stamps last year, up 33 percent from fiscal 2009. But far more than that, this president has radically increased government entitlement expansions. The Heritage Foundation documented that President Obama’s 2011 budget increased total welfare spending to $953 billion, a 42 percent increase over welfare spending in 2008. And over the next decade, welfare spending is projected to cost taxpayers $10.3 trillion. The Heritage Foundation reported that not only has the president greatly expanded welfare, “but he has also eliminated a program that aims to reduce the prevalence of single motherhood, one of the greatest contributors to poverty in the United States.” And the Congressional Budget Office recently released updated figures that reveal how Obamacare will cost twice as much as the original price tag first soft-lobbed at the American public, from $900 billion then to $1.76 trillion between now and 2022. And who is going to have to pay for all those entitlements? That’s right: you and your posterity. Trust me. That’s a fact you can take all the way to yours and your loved ones’ bank accounts. 6) Obama demeans private enterprise and the entrepreneurial spirit – the very heart of America – and, instead, believes “only” government is our savior. In 2009, right after taking office, President Obama emphatically stated “only government” is our savior, and then he supported his socialistic platform through multiple company and corporate bailouts. Recently, Obama reiterated his anti-individual and anti-capitalistic beliefs when he defined the “somebody” who’s responsible for the success of your business as being the federal government: “If you’ve got a business, you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.”(Underline added) The Wall Street Journal even confessed that the president is “subordinating to government the individual enterprise and risk-taking that underlies prosperity.” (In Part 2 next week, I will continue my Top 10 reasons not to re-elect President Obama.)</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1344819664874</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 21:01:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344820599049-62</Id><Topic><Title>Lets see how long it takes it HATERS to start the personal attacks.</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1344684190830</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 07:23:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Next they are going to lie like they did about Herman Cain.

"The committee expects to file the civil contempt suit against the attorney general Monday," a Republican source said. The suit will be filed in the federal district court for the District of Columbia. The action is the latest escalation in the dispute between House Republicans and the Justice Department over the documents, which relate to a botched gun-smuggling operation. On June 28, the House voted to hold Holder in contempt of Congress and authorized the Oversight panel to bring suit to enforce its rights. In Fast and Furious, agents for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed assault guns to "walk," which meant ending surveillance on weapons suspected to be en route to Mexican drug cartels. The tactic, which was intended to allow agents to track criminal networks by finding the guns at crime scenes, was condemned after two guns that were part of the operation were found at Border Patrol agent Brian Terry's murder scene.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1344823328565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 22:02:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344823417540-64</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan voted for the Iraq War!</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1344805549002</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 17:05:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You wouldn't be satisfying me,stooge .None of them including Clinton did anything wrong. Voting what they thought was right is not a punishable offense just because kooks like you dont agree with their vote. As for my political philosophy,you dont have a clue. I have voted for both parties. I want a qualified person running the country .Obama is not that person. Is Romney?? Who knows. But I consider Obama a disaster and am ready to try someone else.</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1344823417540</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 22:03:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344823663060-65</Id><Title>Call for defunding the Justice Dept. until Holder resigns or is fired</Title><Msg>Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich told The Daily Caller on Friday that if he were still atop the House of Representatives, he would defund the Department of Justice until Attorney General Eric Holder resigned or was fired. TheDC asked Gingrich if he would send Capitol Hill police to arrest Holder, as the Washington Times had suggested the House could, now that he is in both criminal and civil contempt of Congress. “No,” Gingrich said in response, during a wide-ranging interview with TheDC staff in the news outlet’s Washington, D.C., offices. “If I were speaker, I’d cut off funding because that’s real. If I were speaker, I’d announce that we’re not moving any appropriations for the Justice Department as long as Holder is attorney general.” With Issa suing its likely the house will vote to stop paying for the JD.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1344823663060</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 22:07:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
