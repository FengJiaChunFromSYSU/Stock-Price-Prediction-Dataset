"I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut." Romney flatly lied about the cost of his proposal to cut income-tax rates across the board by another 20 percent (undercutting even the low rates of the Bush tax cuts). Independent economists at the Tax Policy Center have shown that the price tag for those cuts is $360 billion in the first year, a cost that extrapolates to $5 trillion over a decade. 2. "I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans." Romney has claimed that he will pay for his tax cuts by closing a variety of loopholes and deductions. The factual problem? Romney hasn't named a single loophole he's willing to close; worse, there's no way to offset $5 trillion in tax cuts even if you get rid of the entire universe of deductions for the wealthy that Romney has not put off the table (like the carried interest loophole or the 15 percent capital gains rate.) The Tax Policy Center report concludes that Romney's proposal would create a "net tax cut for high-income tax payers and a net tax increase for lower- and or middle-income taxpayers." Moreover, some of Romney's tax cuts are micro-targeted at American dynasties, particularly his proposal to eliminate the estate tax, which would reduce his own sons' tax burden by tens of millions of dollars. 3. "We've got 23 million people out of work or [who have] stopped looking for work in this country." Romney is lying for effect. The nation's crisis of joblessness is bad, but not 23 million bad. The official figure is 12.5 million unemployed. An additional 2.6 million Americans have stopped looking for jobs. How does Romney gin up his eye-popping 23 million figure? He counts more than 8 million wage earners who hold part-time jobs as also being "out of work." 4. Obamacare "puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have." Romney is reviving Sarah Palin's old death panels lie here. Obamacare does establish an Independent Payment Advisory Board to help constrain the growth of Medicare spending. The body has no authority to dictate the practices of the private insurance marketplace. And the law also makes explicit that this body is banned from rationing care or limiting medical benefits to seniors. 5. "Pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan." In the biggest whopper of the night, Romney suggested that his health care proposal would guarantee coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions. This is just not true. Under Romney, if you have a pre-existing condition and have been unable to obtain insurance coverage or if you have had to drop coverage for more than 90 days because you lost your job or couldn't afford the premiums, you would be #$%$ out of luck. Insurance companies could continue to discriminate and deny you coverage, as even Romney's top adviser conceded after the debate was over.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1349534785283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 10:46:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349535618720-26</Id><Topic><Title>The Debates, the Unemployment Numbers, Ohio, Electoral Votes, Obama Win</Title><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1349532937490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 10:15:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NOW YOU ARE LYING. The Independent tax policy center has come out and said that the Obama people are WRONG about their assumptions regarding Romneys plan. YOU PEOPLE seem to be ignoring that little factoid. There is NO 5 trillion tax cut and even Cutter acknowledged that yesterday in an interview. YOU PEOPLE ARE LYING. Under #2 you people call anything a LIE that you don't understand. Romeny says he is going to close loopholes and has said that all along. NOBODY and I mean NOBODY can give or name what the actual cuts or reductions will be because CONGRESS will hash that out and anyone who thinks or says otherwise is LYING.......You people don't understand that because that is all O'Loser has ever done, gave you promises that he hasn't kept because he doesn't know how to work with congress, He has NO LEADERSHIP. FYI, there are 23 million people either out of work, stop looking for work or working part time because they can't find full time work. I'll stop at that, I think I have shown what an out of touch far left parrot you are who doesn't understand the FACTS and who does nothing but repeats what you've heard from the LYING left. Thet reason Romney stomped your Messiah as bad as he did was because ROmney came with the Facts and your BOY can't defend his record.

In the debate, Mr. Romney won handily over Mr. Obama, who looked irritated and confused at times. Not only have new polls shown Mr. Romney now leading President Obama nationally, but the Republican has also taken the lead in key swing states. This comes after Mr. Obama was leading in all polls prior to the debate. In Colorado, both Gravis Marketing and McLaughlin &amp; Associates, Mr. Romney now leads. Gravis's poll shows the GOP candidate with a 49.4-45.9% lead. McLaughlin shows a 50-46% lead for Mr. Romney. In Florida, WeAskAmerica and Rasmussen Reports show Mr. Romney with a multiple-point lead. According to Rasmussen, Romney leads 49-47%. WeAskAmerica has the numbers at 49-46%. In Virginia, again, WeAskAmerica and Rasmussen Reports show Mr. Romney in the lead. Rasmussen has Romney leading 49-48% over President Obama. WeAskAmerica shows Mr. Romney with a 48-45% lead. Finally, WeAskAmerica has Mr. Romney leading Mr. Obama by one point in Ohio. Their poll shows a 47-46% lead for the challenger; and this percent comes even though WeAskAmerica polled 4% more Democrats than Republicans in Ohio.

Welch explained his rationale to the MSNBC host: “We had 600,000 government jobs added in the last two months. We had 873,00 jobs by a household survey — which is a total estimate — from 50,000 phone calls. Of those, 600,000 were temporary workers. Chris, these numbers are all a series of assumptions. Tons of assumptions. And it just seems somewhat coincidental that the month before the election, the numbers go one-tenth of a point below where the president started. Although, I don’t see anything in the economy that says these surges are true.” When Matthews asked him if he had any evidence to prove his assertion correct, Welch admitted that he did not. “I have no evidence to prove that, I just raise the question,” he said. “But you didn’t raise the question,” Matthews shot back. “Did you talk to any economist or any people in the national income accounting world that understood how these numbers are put together before you accuse these ‘Chicago guys’ of changing the numbers?” the host asked. Welch then repeated his position that the unemployment numbers were generated based on a “series of wild assumptions.” Matthews then asked if he wanted to take back his accusation that the numbers were intentionally fudged.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349541807938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 12:43:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349542390309-42</Id><Title>Romney debates an empty chair</Title><Msg>Picture deleted</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349542390309</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 12:53:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349542493913-43</Id><Topic><Title>Jack Welch explains why the UE numbers are #$%$</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349541807938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 12:43:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let Solis show us the data then he will have the evidence.

In August, a poll by the Joliet, Ill.-based polling firm of McKeon and Associates, found President Obama leading challenger Mitt Romney in Cook County, which includes Chicago and its suburbs, by a 12-point margin 49-37. That would seem to be a comfortable edge, but it is significantly smaller than traditional margins needed to outweigh the more Republican downstate vote... Now comes a new poll from WeAskAmerica that finds Obama with just a 2-point lead over Romney, 47-45, in a suburban Chicago congressional district that Obama won in 2008 by 23 points.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349563051045</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 18:37:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349563755767-68</Id><Topic><Title>Romney winning in Illinois</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349563051045</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 18:37:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow Rhonda you found a poll showing Mitt leading in a county!!!

In September 2004, new numbers came out, showing a drop in unemployment from 5.5% to 5.4%. At that time, with a much lower unemployment number than we have today (around 8% today), the increase in new jobs that caused a 0.1% decrease in unemployment was 144,000. So, let's get this straight. With 144,000 new jobs in a smaller U.S. population (about 295 million in 2004 vs. about 314 million today), you get a drop in unemployment by 0.1%. But now, 8 years later, with a greater population, you get 114,000 new jobs and, somehow, you get an even larger drop in unemployment: from 8.1% to 7.8%?

That's slightly weaker than yesterday's +114,000, and in September 2004 the jobless rate remained unchanged at 5.4%, but it's close enough to compare the media coverage of then and now. Let's start with the New York Times. How did they lead their coverage in October 2004 of the September jobs report? Employment growth in the United States slowed last month, falling far short of expectations, the U.S. government reported Friday. The new jobs report cast doubts on the strength of the U.S. economic expansion and appeared to bolster Senator John Kerry’s case against President George W. Bush’s handling of the economy just hours before the second presidential debate. The Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added just 96,000 jobs in September, substantially less than the roughly 150,000 needed to keep pace with the expansion in the labor force and start absorbing the slack in the job market. How did they report yesterday’s jobs report? Let’s just say they gave it a … different emphasis: The jobless rate abruptly dropped in September to its lowest level since the month President Obama took office, indicating a steadier recovery than previously thought and delivering another jolt to the presidential campaign. The improvement lent ballast to Mr. Obama’s case that the economy is on the mend and threatened the central argument of Mitt Romney’s candidacy, that Mr. Obama’s failed stewardship is reason enough to replace him. Employers added a modest 114,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department reported on Friday, but estimates for what had been disappointing gains in July and August were revised upward to more respectable levels. In 2004, a jobless rate of 5.4% “cast doubt” on the economy, and suddenly 7.8% is a sign of “a steadier recovery.” In 2012, the NYT never even mentions the need to grow jobs by 150,000 each month to keep up with expansion in the labor force. Not even once. All right, that’s the New York Times. No one expects them to be unbiased. How about PBS? (Stop laughing, you guys.) Believe it or not, they did marginally better, only because they didn’t get so in the tank in 2004: Still, the September job-creation total fell far short of Wall Street economists’ forecasts for 148,000 new jobs.September’s net increase of 96,000 payroll jobs was less than August’s rise, which the Labor Department revised downward from 144,000 to 128,000 it reported a month ago.The latest figures show four straight months of weak job growth after three strong months in the spring. It was the final jobs report before the Nov. 2 presidential election with polls indicating that jobs are a central concern of voters. How about yesterday? It was “a rare banner day.” No, really: A rare banner day on the jobs front, at least at first glance. The official unemployment rate — U-3 — dropped below 8 percent to 7.8 and even our all-inclusive U-7 is down 0.08 percent — to 16.87 percent. The most impressive numbers are in job creation as reported by the monthly survey of “establishments.” While the 114,000 new jobs added in September is a modest figure, the upward revisions for July and August are substantial: 86,000 more jobs, or a bump of better than 30 percent. It’s a good reminder not to take any given month’s numbers too seriously. But it’s a reminder in the right direction. Yeah, well … call that the revenge of Big Bird. How about the Washington Post? From Nexis, here’s their report from October 9, 2004: U.S. job growth slowed last month as manufacturers, airlines and retailers shed workers, the government reported yesterday in its last official snapshot of the labor market before the presidential election. Employers added 96,000 non-farm obs last month, down from 128,000 in August, as losses in some industries were more than offset by hires in others, such as real estate, construction and temporary help services. September was the fourth-straight month of gains below the roughly 150,000 a month that many economists estimate are necessary to keep pace with population growth. The unemployment rate held steady at 5.4 percent as hundreds of thousands of people stopped looking for work and therefore were not counted among the jobless, the Labor Department said. Aaaaand from yesterday: The nation’s jobless rate dropped to its lowest point in nearly four years in September. And unlike some recent declines, this one happened for the right reason: not because people gave up looking for a job, but because far more people reported having one. It is a surprising improvement in a job market that had appeared listless in recent months. Although employers added a modest 114,000 jobs in September, the unemployment rate dropped sharply, from 8.1 to 7.8 percent, the government reported Friday. Unemployment is at its lowest level since President Obama took office in January 2009, offering him a political boost just days after his performance was widely judged as lackluster during a debate against GOP rival Mitt Romney. Just as the New York Times did in 2004, the context of the necessary +150K each month to keep up with population growth appeared within the first three paragraphs. In 2012, the Post never mentions that context at all. Up for another round? Here’s the Chicago Tribune in 2004, and this time, we’ll start with the headline, again from Nexis: JOBS REPORT: September employment growth a disappointment The nation’s payrolls grew by a less-than-expected 96,000 jobs in September, as joblessness remained at 5.4 percent, the Labor Department said in its last employment report before Election Day. … Economists said the latest report was disappointing, and that job growth remains anemic for this stage of an economic recovery. The country should be creating 250,000 jobs or more per month by now, one analyst said. Disappointment at 96,000 and 5.4%! How about in 2012? The U.S. unemployment rate dropped to a near four-year low of 7.8 percent in September, a potential boost to President Barack Obama’s re-election bid. The Labor Department said on Friday the unemployment rate, a key focus in the race for the White House, dropped by 0.3 percentage point to its lowest point since January 2009. A survey of households from which the jobless rate is derived showed 873,000 job gains last month, the most since June 1983. The drop in unemployment came even as Americans come back into the labor force to resume the hunt for work. The workforce had shrank in the prior two months. The household survey is volatile. A survey of business establishments showed employers added 114,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, a touch above economists’ expectations for 113,000 jobs. Employment for July and August was revised to show 86,000 more jobs created than previous reported. And just in case you don’t get the message from the coverage, the Tribune’s editors tell you today that the American economy “has finally broken loose,” and that the overall result is “modestly positive” at +114K and 7.8% while +96K and 5.4% in 2004 was “a disappointment”: After 43 straight months in the cold grip of an 8-plus percent unemployment rate, America finally broke loose — by a little. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the jobless tally dipped in September to 7.8 percent, its lowest level since January 2009. That was down from 8.1 percent in the month-earlier report. … The volatility in the household numbers contrasts with the more stable, larger survey of employers, which is the basis for the job creation figure of 114,000. The more encouraging part of the report was an upward revision in the number of jobs created in July and August, which suggested that the jobs slump this past summer wasn’t as deep as previous reports suggested. America’s jobs engine is bumping along a little more steadily than economists might have thought. It’s hardly robust, though. This was a modestly positive report — period. Ah, the huge difference between +96K/5.4% and +114K/7.8% … or really, between Republican incumbents and Democratic incumbents.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349572272522</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 21:11:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349573134637-91</Id><Title>From Canada : Obama: Beware the Silent Majority- a Great Article</Title><Msg>The “Silent Majority.” Where are they today? Remember during the Nixon Administration the “Silent Majority” was often spoken of in the press. The President (Nixon), himself, gave them credit for supporting him… not only in elections but supporting him generally. Well, where did they go? Oh, they’re still here… and just as powerful as before. You see them everyday. They’re all around you. They are the folks you see at parties who stand around the edges of a group discussing politics. They never have any input into the discussion, they just absorb it. They’re the folks who do not sit in on the coffee klatch discussion on politics and world affairs. They’re the people who go to church, nearly every Sunday, and raise their children to be respectful of others and live useful, productive lives. They send their kids to church-supported universities and colleges for a good education, rather than an indoctrination in the ways of the political left. The Silent Majority are the folk who never miss an opportunity to vote. They believe men and women died to give them that opportunity, and they will not abuse the memory of those heroic Americans by not going to the polls to vote. They are also the people who will not tell those taking the exit polls who they voted for. They voted in secret, it’s their secret, and they will keep it, often never even divulging it to their families. They are, for the most part, conservative in politics as well as religion. These are the people who shop at Wal-Mart, and K-mart, and drive 2, 3, or 4 year old cars. Most own their own homes. They have savings accounts and they have a family budget, which they will not abuse. Their lives are built around their families and their church. Many are veterans of America’s armed forces. They believe this country is worth fighting for and they will put their own lives on the line to protect her. They view politics as a necessary evil. They believe they should always vote for the man who best represents their belief. They will not support a candidate just because he, or she, wears the label of the party to which they, themselves, are registered. They wield enormous power. These people can make, or break, a presidential election. When they step into the voting booth, they speak, loud and clear. It is there that the Silent Majority rejects their silence and shouts their politics to the world. They did it again in November of 2010. So, politicians, you neglect the Silent Majority at your peril. The press makes fun of one of the mightiest forces in American politics. The Silent Majority never fails to notice the MsM’s stifled giggles and backhanded insults of conservative politics. They see it all and… they remember… as they did in November, two years ago. ... And they’ve had enough. For four years they have heard all the lies disguised as promises. They’ve cringed as our leader sucks-up to foreign powers by bowing and scraping and apologizing—just because America is America. They are concerned and deeply, deeply, angry. They have watched the country they love being torn apart by class warfare plotted and led from the White House. They have watched the government bail-out and prop-up companies that, by rights, should have been allowed to fail. All of it done with taxpayer money ... their money. They’ve watched the government borrow and spend as though there is no tomorrow and they have watched the debt pile up and pile up until the next two generations of Americans are already buried in debt, even those yet unborn. They have watched the President’s power grab and the intrusion of government into nearly every facet of their lives ... unbidden ... and they are outraged. They have seen the government pass a law, against the will of the people, and take over the country’s health care system. They’ve watched as the government began to dismantle it so they (the government) can, eventually, take it over under a single-payer system in which all Americans get sub-par healthcare—equally. They watch the government spy, relentlessly, upon their every waking moment. Their movement, their communications, their purchases, every move they make is monitored by the government —and they are mad as hell about it. They’ve watched socialism replace capitalism and love of state replace love of God and they are incensed. They’ve watched the President reject the one people that God, Himself, chose. As people of faith, they know the curse which befalls the people of a nation that acts toward the Jewish state as America, through its leader, Obama, has done. And they are aware of the quiet planning in the corridors of power in Washington to find a way to bypass their Second Amendment rights. Rest assured—they DO know—and they are quietly arming themselves against the day they may be called upon—by their country—to defend the constitution. They remember the oath they took as members of America’s military—and as police officers—to defend the constitution against ALL enemies, domestic and foreign, and they remember, too, there was no expiration date on that oath. Silent, they may be—but silent they shall not remain. They are ready to set things aright. This is the unseen, uncounted, power the pollsters miss. It is the power of deep conviction that things are terribly wrong in America and they, the so-called Silent Majority, have a responsibility to the constitution, to the country, to their fellow Americans, and yes, to their families and themselves, to step up, to lean in, and to reclaim their birthright—before it is lost forever. These quiet Americans have the fortitude and the determination of the all the ancient defenders of freedom. They know—and they understand—the stakes for America. Losing THIS fight it not an option. Without America standing in the breech, the free world will fall as dominoes—and the socialist/Marxist tyrants will truly rule the world. These people who love their God, their families, their constitution, and their America—these people who suffer so much scorn and derision from the elitist of the left WILL have their say. These people are not to be trifled with. It was THEY who coined the phrase: “We have four boxes with which to defend our freedom: the soap box, the ballot box, the jury box, and the cartridge box.” And THESE are the people who have resolved to rescue their country from the practitioners of the philosophy of Lenin, Marx, and Engels NOW, before it is too late. You’ll find them standing in line when the polls open on November 6th. You’ll find them standing in line waiting to vote rather than taking a lunch break. You’ll find them stopping at the polling place on their way home from work. You’ll find them hurrying through dinner so as to be in line before the polls close. It’s that quiet determination we mentioned above. These are the Americans with the legendary “true grit”—fortitude and determination—to rise to the challenge and save America again. So, here’s to the Silent Majority , the conscience of America, the steel in America’s spine, the hope of Americans yet unborn. May God bless them!</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349573134637</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 21:25:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349573626390-92</Id><Title>Stock market wants ROMNEY!
