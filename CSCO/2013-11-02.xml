"The U.S. food-stamp program is set to shrink in the months ahead. The only real question is by how much. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) currently costs about $80 billion per year and provides food aid to 14 percent of all U.S. households — some 47 million people. Those numbers swelled dramatically during the recession. A farmers market in Roseville, Calif. advertises its acceptance of EBT (electronic benefit transfer) cards, which are used for food stamps. (Rich Pedroncelli/AP) A farmers market in Roseville, Calif. advertises its acceptance of EBT (electronic benefit transfer) cards, which are used for food stamps. (Rich Pedroncelli/AP) But the food-stamp program is now set to downsize in the weeks ahead. There's a big automatic cut scheduled for Nov. 1, as a temporary boost from the 2009 stimulus bill expires. That change will trim about $5 billion from federal food-stamp spending over the coming year." -The Washington Post So It looks like all you FAT Demcrapo White trash, Black trash and Latino trash bums are about to be forced into a DIET!!!

Meanwhile, America’s solar installations have been chugging their way to new heights. 2013′s second quarter saw 832 megawatts installed, making it the second-best quarter on record, and installation prices are dropping across the country. In Asia, demand for solar is surging as the cost of modules and installation stabilizes, and analysts anticipate major solar markets across the globe will become sustainably competitive without any form of government incentive by 2014. “The dramatic cost reductions in photovoltaics, combined with new incentive regimes in Japan and China, are making possible further, strong growth in volumes,” said Jenny Chase, BNEF’s head of solar analysis.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1383398303836</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-11-02 09:18:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383398773522-10</Id><Topic><Title>Only on FAUX NEWS LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1383397773841</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-11-02 09:09:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, are you talking about the liberal pecker-wood that made all the money on insider trading?

Significant occurrences in politics and finance are speculated to be orchestrated by an unduly influential cabal operating through many front organizations. Numerous historical and current events are seen as steps in an on-going plot to achieve world domination through secret political gatherings and decision-making processes.[3][4][5][6][7] Prior to the early 1990s, New World Order conspiracism was limited to two American countercultures, primarily the militantly anti-government right, and secondarily fundamentalist Christians concerned with end-time emergence of the Antichrist.[8] Skeptics, such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet, have observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order have now not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but have seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating an unrivaled period of people actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.[4][6] These political scientists are concerned that this mass hysteria could have what they judge to be devastating effects on American political life, ranging from widespread political alienation to escalating lone-wolf terrorism.[4][6]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1383406512506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-11-02 11:35:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383407137109-23</Id><Title>FAUX says the race is tight, LOL</Title><Msg>we all know if Cuccinelli was ahead by 12 points Faux would still be saying it was tight, LOL Democrat Terry McAuliffe has opened a double-digit lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli II in the race for Virginia governor, in a new poll capturing increasing dissatisfaction among voters with Cuccinelli’s party and his conservative views.

Undocumented immigrants pay taxes every time they buy gas, clothes or new appliances. They also contribute to property taxes—a main source of school funding—when they buy or rent a house, or rent an apartment. The Social Security Administration estimates that half to three-quarters of undocumented immigrants pay federal, state and local taxes, including $6 billion to $7 billion in Social Security taxes for benefits they will never get.

SECURITY BREECH on OBAMACARE WEBSITE--AMAZING LIB INCOMPETENCE</Title><Msg>Justin Hadley logged on to HealthCare.gov to evaluate his insurance options after his health plan was canceled. What he discovered was an apparent security flaw that disclosed eligibility letters addressed to individuals from another state. “I was in complete shock,” said Hadley, who contacted Heritage after becoming alarmed at the breach of privacy. Hadley, a North Carolina father, buys his insurance on the individual market. His insurance company, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, directed him to HealthCare.gov in a cancellation letter he received in September. After multiple attempts to access the problem-plagued website, Hadley finally made it past the registration page Thursday. That’s when he was greeted with downloadable letters about eligibility — for two people in South Carolina.</Msg><Username>gregu456</Username><Timestamp>1383438757810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-11-02 20:32:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383439081220-70</Id><Topic><Title>BREAKING!
