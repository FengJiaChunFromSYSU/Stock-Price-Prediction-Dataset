Romney himself referenced these five studies in an interview with Meet the Press on Sunday. His running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), said the same during his run through the Sunday show circuit. A closer examination, however, calls into question the fact that there are even five studies at all. Last week, the Romney campaign passed along the five documents that the candidate had referenced on NBC's Meet the Press. Three of the five are blog posts or op-eds (as opposed to academic literature), and two of those three are written by the same author: Harvard economist Martin Feldstein. Of the remaining two studies, one is the tax reform white paper authored by Romney-backing economists and paid for by Romney for President, Inc. (in an email to PolitiFact, the Romney campaign highlighted several Wall Street Journal editorials in place of the campaign white paper as the "fifth" study).</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347649962230</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 15:12:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347650477246-107</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt's wheels are coming off, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347649962230</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 15:12:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ROMNEY announces new scaled down foodstamp program for the lower class, applies to all households with incomes below $200,000.00 That's slumming it, according to MITT!</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1347650477246</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 15:21:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347650518391-108</Id><Title>Important photo-op</Title><Msg>Glad Obama got to have a photo-op with the dead people returning from Libya.Reminds of when he used the dead soldiers returning from Iraq for a photo-op at Dover AFB.

Romney also offered a glimpse into how he likes to sleep. When asked what he wears to bed, Romney quipped, "I think the best answer is as little as possible." With uprisings spreading across the Middle East, the timing seems almost as odd as the content. It is also in stark contrast to the President's schedule today. President Obama, Secretary Hilary Clinton and Secretary Panetta went to Joint Base Andrews to be on hand when the body of slain Ambassador Christopher Stevens was returned to the United States.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347660302475</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 18:05:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347660373216-126</Id><Topic><Title>EVERYONE TAKE IT EASY ON FLUTIE NOW...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1347639424257</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 12:17:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey, I see you guys are still beating up on flutie like a mexican pinata, take it easy.

You believe companies provide free health care and retirement. You believe that a venture firm CEO is doing his job if he keeps failing businesses open. You believe the big money in the investment capital business is shutting down bankrupt businesses and selling their assets. You think employees of money-losing businesses have the right to demand that investors keep them on the payroll. You have never skipped a paycheck to ensure that your employees are paid on time. You criticize Mitt Romney for having a grandfather who lived among polygamists (even though his grandfather had only one wife) but think Obama's bigamist father and polygamist grandfather are irrelevant. You think the law of supply and demand affects prices except of oil and gasoline. You think Vice-President Joe Biden is smarter than former VP Dick Cheney. You think the governor who tried to keep nine black students out of a high school in Arkansas (The Little Rock Nine) was a Republican and the president who sent the Army to escort them into school was a Democrat. You think Obama should claim credit for increased domestic oil production despite his three-year record of doing everything he could to reduce it. You think investigators who concluded that Obama's Hawaii birth certificate is a forgery must be wrong because they are conservatives. You don't demand to know why Obama's Social Security card was issued for a resident of Connecticut, a state where he never lived. You think Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona is unqualified to lead an investigation of Obama's U.S. citizenship though he worked for 25 years as an investigator for the Drug Enforcement Administration. You thought Bush's college grades were a matter of national concern but accept Obama's secrecy over his college papers. You think Sunday talk shows are balanced when a token conservative is filibustered by three or four liberals, including the host. You care about racial diversity in the major news media but don't care that 90 percent of their reporters vote Democrat. You support politicians who want to put coal miners, military personnel and oil field workers on unemployment but hate politicians who want to get rid of overpaid bureaucrats. You call raising taxes "investing in our future" unless the money is spent on the military. You think it's OK to ban schools from holding bake sales to raise money because the government has a duty to enforce dieting. You praise Hillary Clinton for eschewing makeup but think Republican women who wear ordinary clothes are frumpy. You praise Bill Clinton for his greatest accomplishment — welfare reform — but hate Republicans for fighting Obama's "wealth redistribution." You blame George Bush for the bank deregulation bill signed by Bill Clinton. You cite his fancy garage as proof that Mitt Romney is out of touch but thought nothing of John Kerry's multiple mansions worth $33 million. You were upset with the money Sarah Palin spent on her wardrobe but see nothing wrong with Michelle Obama's spending twice as much. You oppose a fence on our southern border but live in a gated community. You think churches should not be exempt from taxes. You cheered when your candidate said "Bush" but insist that others show respect by saying "President Obama." Your chief argument for opposing oil extraction in the Arctic 10 years ago was that it would take too long — 10 years — to produce oil. You think people who defend themselves with guns are violent nut cases who were looking for trouble. You still think John Edwards would have been a better vice-president than Dick Cheney. You see Obama's Harvard degree as evidence of vastly superior intelligence, but you think Bush is an idiot though he's the only president to have earned an M.B.A. (from Harvard). You might be liberal if you think conservatives are racists for opposing Obama's radical socialism. You think Christians are a bigger threat than radical Islamist fascists. You think the media should not run pix reminding us of what terrorists did on 9-11 but excuse pix of our soldiers posing w dead suicide bombers. You think of Michael Moore as a hero because people had to pay $14 million for tickets to see his movie opposing capitalism. You have the hair and beard of Jesus and the work ethic of the town drunk. You're against people who intimidate at polling places unless they're New Black Panthers. Your views are constantly evolving when you lack courage to take a stand. You think George Clooney, Roseann Barr, Sean Penn and Barbra Streisand know more about the military, taxes and the economy than any Republican. You call for respectful dialogue, then call Republicans "Nazis," "baby killers," "war criminals," "rich white men who want dirty air and dirty water," "#$%$s," "imbeciles" and "flat earthers." You pour blood on women wearing fur but cry foul when pro-lifers show pictures of a murdered fetus to women considering abortion. You think we should have believed Saddam Hussein but we should not believe Ahmadinejad. You get your news from the Comedy Central and Saturday Night Live. You oppose racial hatred but practice class hatred. You think anybody with a job is rich. You think you're charitable by taking my money to pay for your programs. You might be liberal if you think conservatives are racists for opposing Obama's radical socialism. You look just like all the other nonconformists you idolize. You thank the lamestream media for refusing to run pictures of people jumping off the Twin Towers while excusing them for running pictures of Americans posing with dead suicide bombers. You like giving billions of tax dollars to failing solar panel companies but want to tax successful oil companies out of business. You aborted your baby but want to saddle my baby with your debts. Your chief goal is to get a bigger check from the government. You think the lamestream media is unbiased. You have ever arranged to get yourself laid off so that you could beach bum, ski or go fishing on unemployment checks. You think Obama's college documents should be private but Mitt Romney's tax returns should be public. You believed candidate Obama when he said he opposed gay marriage. You think taxpayers are not paying their fair share if their tax rate is higher than yours. You think it's OK to call Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann and Ann Coulter #$%$s but wrong to call a #$%$ a #$%$. You think a 10 percent return is an obscene profit for the oil industry but a 15 percent tax on oil companies is low. You don't want your daughter "punished with a baby." You think the Democrats can choose my charitiesbetter than I can. You hate SUVs but love Chevy Volts. You call yourself open-minded but won't watch Fox News or Hannity and won't tune into Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham, Michael Savage or any other conservative talk show. Jerry Springer supports your candidates. Your favorite part of Obama's health insurance plan is that it doubles or triples premiums on vets and active-duty military. You're 30 years old and live in your mother's basement. You think we can solve our nation's debt problems by borrowing more money. You think the government can do a better job ofpicking your health insurance plan than you can. You want higher taxes on everybody else but refuse to pay more taxes voluntarily. Prostitutes, strippers, pornographers, drug dealers and deadbeats oppose the same candidates you hate. You signed a mortgage you know you can't afford and then blame the bank. You don't believe in God or Jesus but curse by invoking their names. You want a government agency such as the TSAdeciding on your health care. You've chained yourself to a bulldozer to prevent it from thinning pinyon-juniper cover for improved wildlife habitat. You spent more on your pet's wardrobe than you donated to charity in an entire year. You think you're smarter than Karl Rove, Marco Rubio, Rush Limbaugh, George Bush, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Condoleeza Rice. You know nothing about Thomas Paine or Alexander Hamilton but everything about Kim Kardsashian. You consider yourself open to other cultures except the culture of the Bible Belt. You honor and respect the sacred places and religious practices of voodoo worshippers, native Americans, Muslim</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1347666065556</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 19:41:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347666072008-150</Id><Title>YOU CAN TELL HOW CONFIDENT ROMNEY FEELS DEPENDING...</Title><Msg>on how far he sticks up his neck.
