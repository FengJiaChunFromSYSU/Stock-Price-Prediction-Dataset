His family was constantly on the move and at age 15, he refused to keep moving with his parents. He was working part time at the Hobby House restaurant in Fort Wayne and dropped out of high school to start working at the business full time. After working as a mess sergeant during the Korean War, he began working for KFC, where he was able to help turn several of their failing franchises around. In 1969, he sold of the KFC franchises he owned and opened his own restaurant in Columbus, Ohio. He named the restaurant after his daughter, who was actually called Melinda, but was nicknamed Wendy. These days, Wendy’s is the third largest burger chain in America. Creator of the Kodak Camera Company, George Eastman, was forced to drop out of school due to financial circumstances. At only 14, his father died and the only way George could keep his two sisters and mother alive was to quit school and begin working as an office boy full time. By the age of 26, Eastman found his true calling and began working to improve the emulsion process involved in photography. He thought the liquid emulsions proved quite a problem as they were excessively sticky and had to be used quickly before they dried. In only three years, Eastman had perfected his dry emulsion plates and he started his own photographic business in 1880. While a lot of famous directors hone their skills during college, Quentin Tarantino built up his film knowledge by working in a video rental store in Manhattan Beach, California. He not only never went to college, but he quit going to Narbonne High School in Harbor City, California in his freshman year. He started learning the acting craft in acting school at the James Best Theatre Company in Toluca Lake, but it really wasn’t until he started working at Video Archives with Roger Avery, also a director these days, that he really began sharpening his future skills.

FACT" This is fact only in the alternate reality teabaggers live in, all fact checking organizations are in agreement that it is totally false. Sen. Jeff Sessions wrongly claimed that federal revenues "went up every single year" after the Bush tax cuts were "put in." Actually, federal revenues declined for three straight years after the first tax cut was signed in 2001. The Alabama Republican made his statement on "Face the Nation." Sessions, July 10: The revenue went up every single year after those tax cuts were put in. The revenue is down now because of the low economy. The first tax cut — the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 — was signed into law June 7, 2001. It began to affect revenues almost immediately as "advance rebate" checks were mailed to millions of taxpayers starting that July. After the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2001, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculated that those rebates had already amounted to $35 billion. As a result, CBO said, federal income tax receipts fell that year, rather than posting an increase.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343325777348</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:02:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343325784048-94</Id><Title>Sell this 'rally'..</Title><Msg>You won't regret it.

In a move that astonished Downing Street, hours before it laid on a special reception for Romney at No 10 he told NBC there were "disconcerting" signs about the preparations for the Games. One senior Whitehall source said: "What a total shocker. We are speechless." David Cameron wasted no time in slapping down Romney hours after his remarks were broadcast. On a visit to the Olympic Park, the prime minister said: "We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest, most active, bustling cities anywhere in the world. Of course it's easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere." Cameron's remarks were intended to be a light-hearted rebuke to Romney, who used his famous management skills honed at Bain Capital to rescue the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002. Romney frantically rowed back later after a 45-minute meeting in Downing Street where the prime minister expressed his unease about his remarks. "I am very delighted with the prospects of a highly successful Olympic Games. What I have seen shows imagination and forethought and a lot of organisation and [I] expect the Games to be highly successful," he said. When asked about the preparations for the Olympics earlier in the day by the NBC anchor Brian Williams, Romney said: "You know, it's hard to know just how well it will turn out. There are a few things that were disconcerting, the stories about the private security firm not having enough people, supposed strike of the immigration and customs officials, that obviously is not something which is encouraging. Because there are three parts that makes Games successful.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343326075948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:07:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343326194426-97</Id><Topic><Title>Federal Revenue as a share of the U.S. economy lowest level in 50 years</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343324306736</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:38:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go look at revenues for 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007......... after the 2003 tax cuts took effect 2003 1,782.3 2004 1,880.1 2005 2,153.6 2006 2,406.9 2007 2,568.0 2008 2,524.0 Now take your big fat foot out of your mouth.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1343326194426</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:09:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343326205456-98</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt the #$%$</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343326075948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:07:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if he isn't bright enough to handle going to the Olympics (at least he didn't get drunk and fall down like W) it's pretty scary imagining him deal with a real foreign policy issue, how is he going to deal with Iran?

The only logical reason then left for someone to vote for him would be his skin color, a decision based on emotion not rationale.</Msg><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1343326450036</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:14:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343326607347-100</Id><Topic><Title>Federal Revenue as a share of the U.S. economy lowest level in 50 years</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343324306736</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:38:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only in teabaggastan according to the OMB A review of data from the White House Office of Management and Budget shows that tax revenues did not consistently increase after the Bush tax cuts went into effect. In FY 2001, tax revenue in dollars was $1,991.1 billion. For FY 2002 - the first budget of the Bush administration, which went into effect after President George W. Bush signed tax cuts into law in June 2001 - revenue dropped to $1,853.1 billion. Bush signed two more tax cuts into law over the next two years. In FY 2003, revenue dropped further, to $1,782.3 billion - about a 10-percent reduction from two years earlier. This drop in tax revenue occurred even as economic activity - the nation's GDP - was continually rising, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Revenues then increased for four years - from $1,880.1 billion in FY 2004 to $2,568 billion in FY 2007 - before sliding to $2,524 billion in FY 2008, and then dropping further to $2,105 billion in FY 2009 as the recession exploded. Source Data: White House Office of Management and Budget - Historical Tables As a percentage of gross domestic product, the amount of tax revenues as a part of the economy has also varied widely, though it is still less today than in FY2001, when it represented 19.5% of GDP. It has dipped from as low as 16.1% in FY2004, to as high as 18.5% in FY2007, before finishing out FY 2009 at 14.9% - its lowest level since 1950 (14.4%).</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343326607347</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:16:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343326630848-101</Id><Topic><Title>Vote for the white guy</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1343324350588</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:39:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stating a fact is being a scoundrel?

As Bill McKibben laid out in a terrific article in Rolling Stone last week, the Alberta Tar Sands contain about half the maximum amount of carbon that can be burned globally if we are to avoid warming greater than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists agree is a crucial tipping point.4 So building a pipeline to export and burn these carbon reserves around the globe is ill-advised, to put it mildly. Of course, tar sands oil is also is especially toxic, this pipeline will run through Nebraska's delicate Sandhills and close to the Ogallala aquifer, and oil companies treat oil spill safety like it's a joke. Keystone XL is a recipe for disaster — as was once again made clear earlier this month when the National Transportation Safety Board released its report on the 2010 Kalamazoo River tar sands oil spill. The largest on-land oil spill in our country's history was caused by ignoring multiple warning signs, failing to respond for more than 17 hours, and then acting with the ineptitude of "keystone cops" when the company workers did finally begin responding.5</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1343329461936</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 15:04:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343329661738-113</Id><Title>Important message from CITIgroup CEO</Title><Msg>The Citigroup CEO Who Broke Glass-Steagall Wants It Back Posted: 26 Jul 2012 07:00 AM PDT Click here to view this media This is a statement that is probably going to change the political landscape, considering how much Sandy Weill had to do with this mess. Most people don't seem to know the story of Weill basically playing chicken with the Clinton administration. He pushed through the Citigroup merger and dared them to stop it. Rather than pick a fight with the financial services industry, they let it happen. The Graham-Bliley-Leach bill was, as this article says, a mere formality: They were words no one ever expected Sanford I. Weill — the man who helped usher in the age of the financial supermarket — to utter. “What we should probably do is go and split up investment banking from banking,” Mr. Weill, former Citigroup chief executive, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday. “Have banks be deposit takers, have banks make commercial loans and real estate loans, have banks do something that’s not going to risk the taxpayer dollars, that’s not going to be too big to fail.” His words were essentially a call for a return to Glass-Steagall, the financial regulation that for decades separated commercial banking from investment banking in an effort to keep the financial world safer and easier to regulate. And it was an admission rich with irony. For it was Mr. Weill, the empire builder who progressively turned an insignificant Baltimore-based lender into the towering financial services provider named Travelers and who erased Glass-Steagall with the $70 billion union of his firm with Citicorp in 1998. While Glass-Steagall had already been worn away in large parts by then, thanks to various loopholes that firms like Citicorp and the Chase Manhattan Bank had exploited over the years, it was Mr. Weill’s deal and furious lobbying that finally broke the rule apart. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 formally blessed the creation of the universal banking model, but by then it was almost a formality. Mr. Weill said on Wednesday that Glass-Steagall had essentially dissipated by the mid-1980s; the only remaining regulation he sought to erode was a prohibition on banks conducting insurance underwriting. [...] John S. Reed, who was Citicorp’s chief executive at the time of the 1998 merger, has already apologized for his role in midwifing the birth of the banking supermarket. But Mr. Weill had not uttered anything similar until now. “I’m suggesting that they be broken up so that the taxpayer will never be at risk, the depositors won’t be at risk, the leverage of the banks will be something reasonable,” he told CNBC on Wednesday. He added that by making banks smaller, they could become more profitable.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1343329661738</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 15:07:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343329672853-114</Id><Title>REPUKE UNIVERSITIES...</Title><Msg>Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity !

Republicans (68 percent) are more likely than Independents (62 percent) and Democrats (51 percent) to express comfort with the likely GOP nominee’s faith. But nearly one in four white evangelicals say they are uncomfortable with Romney’s Mormonism, higher than any other religious group except atheists/agnostics (30 percent). Many social conservatives warned during the GOP primary that Romney would struggle to spark evangelical enthusiasm. Fewer conservative Christians would volunteer to canvass neighborhoods, donate money or plan rallies, they said. The Pew poll indicates such fears may be warranted. Among the nearly 23 percent of evangelicals who are uncomfortable with Romney’s Mormonism, just 16 percent back him strongly.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343340084546</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 18:01:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343340203182-143</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt the #$%$</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343326075948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:07:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>only idiots would vote this clown , he so fake its pathetic !</Msg><Username>settegast_scholar</Username><Timestamp>1343340203182</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 18:03:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343343522248-144</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt the #$%$</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343326075948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:07:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wonder if the Brits liked Obama removing the bust of Churchill from the white house?</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1343343522248</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 18:58:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343343691574-145</Id><Topic><Title>you pinheads know of course</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343339755255</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:55:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Better talk to Harry Reid.

They are both RICH, so what's your point? 2) 15% tax rate. TRUE, yet he pays 50 - 100 times MORE in taxes than you or I. He also gives more to charity by a factor of 50 - 100 times than you or I. Seems like he is paying more than his fair share as compared to you or I. 3) So are you mad he was for it or against it. Not a deciding factor when I vote for a President. 4) A mormon. Harry Reid is a Mormon. Is that bad? I'm Catholic, is that bad too? Not sure what your point is here. 5) He was not the architect of Obamacare but it is a false far left talking point. Federal vs. state is a completely different story. If you don't like a states laws you can move to another state. 6) Many people have lost elections to come back later and win. AGAIN, a silly comment. 7) ?? 8) Another lie by the far left. 9) Bailing out detroit will cost taxpayers FOREVER. Unions got favorable treatment over bondholders who legally were first in line.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1343350659934</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 20:57:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343350917841-167</Id><Topic><Title>Romney called worse than Palin in UK</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1343347678274</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 20:07:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes the prime minister did take a jab.

Romney's dad was a millionaire. Obama is willing to pay more in taxes to pay for the Iraq war. 2) He pays more than I, is not the standard, and Charity doesn't count. The guy in charge of United Way is paid over 1 million dollars a year. Romney paying that guys salary does not have an impact on the society or the cost of the Iraq war. 3) Not a deciding factor for me at all, but it might be for all the religious nut jobs in the republican party. 4) again, this might be a deciding factor for the religious nut jobs 5) You are right, he was not the architect of the Obama care. Obama care was a republican idea that Romney adopted in his state. Now that Obama did it, the republicans are all against it. 6) you might be right but we will see how silly this argument is in November. Remember, the republicans could not stand Romney 4 years ago...other than the rich, they hated him! Again, he was not disliked by most in the republican party, he was hated. 7) he can't sing and speaks French....Republicans were attacking Kerry for speaking French...now you know how silly that attack was 8) Not a lie, the companies that he invested money into outsourced jobs. If that is a lie than you just landed in this country. Every single company in the past 10 years outsourced jobs. 9) you are either against bailouts or for bailouts. which would it be?</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1343351958531</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 21:19:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343352933321-171</Id><Topic><Title>here is why you should vote for Romney</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1343349594123</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 20:39:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You really don't make much sense, it's kind of like those silly stock calls you make. You people make fun of Romney because he is rich, yet YOU strive to be rich and Obama is also rich. Again you make no sense. How about you stop with the trivial non starters and start debating what is really important. People care about jobs and the economy and none of you people are willing to have that discussion. It's all about diverting from the truth.

Cathy: take it to the supreme court and Emanual and the Boston Mayor would lose for sure. This could not possibly hold water, denying a business a permit due to the personal views of an executive…views that the majority of this country also hold. Could you imagine something as outlandish as this happening only 3 years ago? The BO administration is empowering this kind of behavior, along with race baiting and a host of other despicable things.</Msg><Username>dcomus</Username><Timestamp>1343360349466</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 23:39:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
