They are so brain dead they don't think Americans will recognize how much they are against democracy, LOL this will backfire big time</Title><Msg>BOSTON — After back-to-back presidential losses, Republicans in key states want to change the rules to make it easier for them to win. From Wisconsin to Pennsylvania, GOP officials who control legislatures in states that supported President Barack Obama are considering changing state laws that give the winner of a state's popular vote all of its Electoral College votes, too. Instead, these officials want Electoral College votes to be divided proportionally, a move that could transform the way the country elects its president. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus endorsed the idea this week, and other Republican leaders support it, too, suggesting that the effort may be gaining momentum. There are other signs that Republican state legislators, governors and veteran political strategists are seriously considering making the shift as the GOP looks to rebound from presidential candidate Mitt Romney's Electoral College shellacking and the demographic changes that threaten the party's long-term political prospects. "It's something that a lot of states that have been consistently blue that are fully controlled red ought to be looking at," Priebus told the Wisconsin Journal Sentinel, emphasizing that each state must decide for itself. Democrats are outraged at the potential change. Obama won the popular vote with 65.9 million votes, or 51.1 percent, to Romney's 60.9 million and won the Electoral College by a wide margin, 332-206 electoral votes. It's unclear whether he would have been re-elected under the new system, depending upon how many states adopted the change. While some Republican officials warn of a political backlash, GOP lawmakers in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are already lining up behind proposals that would allocate electoral votes by congressional district or something similar. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he "could go either way" on the change and doesn't plan to push it. But he said it's a reasonable issue to debate and that he prefers that leaders discuss it well before the next presidential election. "It could be done in a thoughtful (way) over the next couple years and people can have a thoughtful discussion," Snyder said. Republican leaders in the Michigan Statehouse have yet to decide whether to embrace the change there. But state Rep. Peter Lund, a Republican who introduced a bill to change the allocation system two years ago, said some Republicans might be more receptive to his bill this year following the election. "We never really pushed it before," he said, adding that the bill wasn't designed to help one party more than the other. Democrats aren't convinced. And they warned of political consequences for Republicans who back the shift — particularly those governors up for re-election in 2014, which include the governors of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, among others. "This is nothing more than election-rigging," said Michigan Democratic Chairman Mark Brewer. Each state has the authority to shape its own election law. And in at least seven states — Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida and North Carolina — Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's office. Already, Maine and Nebraska have moved away from a winner-take-all system to one that allocates electoral votes based on congressional district. "This is a concept that's got a lot of possibility and a lot of potential," said Washington-based Republican strategist Phil Musser, acknowledging that the debate would "incite different levels of partisan acrimony." Musser also predicted that more pressing economic issues would likely take priority in most Republican-led statehouses. In Pennsylvania, Senate Republican leader Dominic Pileggi this week renewed his call for the Republican-controlled Legislature to revamp the way it awards electoral votes by using a method based on the popular vote that would have given Romney eight of the state's 20 votes. Democrats quickly criticized it as partisan scheme. "It is difficult to find the words to describe just how evil this plan is," said Pennsylvania state Sen. Daylin Leach, a Democrat. "It is an obscene scheme to cheat by rigging the elections," Gov. Tom Corbett, who supported a related proposal from Pileggi last year, had not seen the new plan and could not say whether he supports the new version, the Republican governor's spokesman Kevin Harley said. In Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has said that changing how electoral votes are allocated was an "interesting idea" but that it's not one of his priorities nor has he decided whether he supports such a change. It's gotten a lukewarm reception in the Republican-controlled Legislature as well. No proposal has been introduced yet and no lawmaker has announced any plans to do so, but the state Assembly speaker, Robin Vos, first proposed the change back in 2007. "I am open to that idea," Vos said in December as lawmakers prepared for the start of their session. "But I would have to hear all the arguments." All 10 of the state's Electoral College votes went to Obama last fall under the current system. If they were awarded based on the new system, the votes would have been evenly split between Obama and Romney. Democratic Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett sent an email plea urging people to sign a petition against the change: "We can't sit silently by as they try to manipulate the democratic process for political advantage," Barrett wrote. "We can't let them attack the very democratic institutions and rights that others have sacrificed so much to gain — just because they don't believe they can win in a fair election fight." So far, Republicans have only advocated for the change in states that have supported Democrats in recent elections. The view is predictably different in states where the Republican nominee is a cinch to win. "The Electoral College has served the country quite well," said Louisiana GOP Chairman Roger Villere, who doubles as a national party vice chairman. He continued: "This is coming from states where it might be an advantage, but I'm worried about what it means down the road. This is a system that has worked. That doesn't mean we can't talk about changes, but we have to be very careful about any actions we might take."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358519731925</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 09:35:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358520459476-13</Id><Topic><Title>Why America more and more hates the GOP.

Full details aren't settled yet, but the measure would give the government about three more months of borrowing authority beyond a deadline expected to hit as early as mid-February, No. 2 House Republican Eric Cantor of Virginia said Friday. The legislation wouldn't require immediate spending cuts as earlier promised by GOP leaders like Speaker John Boehner of Ohio. Instead, it's aimed at forcing the Democratic-controlled Senate to join the House in debating the federal budget. It would try to do so by conditioning pay for members of Congress on passing a congressional budget measure. "We are going to pursue strategies that will obligate the Senate to finally join the House in confronting the government's spending problem," Boehner told GOP lawmakers at a retreat in Williamburg, Va. "The principle is simple: 'no budget, no pay.'" The Senate hasn't passed a budget since 2009, which has drawn lots of criticism from Republicans but protected Democrats controlling the chamber from politically difficult votes. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid welcomed the House GOP move. "It is reassuring to see Republicans beginning to back off their threat to hold our economy hostage," said Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson. "If the House can pass a clean debt-ceiling increase to avoid default and allow the United States to meet its existing obligations, we will be happy to consider it." GOP leaders have been grappling with how to gain leverage in their battles with Obama over the budget. Boehner successfully won about $2 trillion in spending cuts as a condition of increasing the government's borrowing cap in 2011. Obama, however, was dealt a stronger hand by his re-election in November and successfully pressed through a 10-year, $600 billion increase on upper-bracket tax payers earlier this month. Other choke points remain, including sharp across-the-board spending cuts that would start to strike the Pentagon and domestic programs alike on March 1 and the possibility of a partial government shutdown with the expiration of a temporary budget measure on March 27. Failing to meet those deadlines would have far less serious consequences than defaulting on U.S. obligations like payments to bondholders, Social Security recipients and myriad other commitments when the government confronts a cash crisis and can no longer borrow to make payments. That could cause a meltdown in financial markets and would inflame voters already disgusted with Congress. Boehner has previously invoked a promise that any increase in the government's borrowing cap would be matched, dollar for dollar, by spending cuts or "reforms" that could include curbs on the long-term growth in retirement programs such as Medicare. Friday's announcement did not repeat that specific promise. "Before there is any long-term debt limit increase, a budget should be passed that cuts spending," Boehner said. "The Democratic-controlled Senate has failed to pass a budget for four years. That is a shameful run that needs to end, this year." The measure picked up support from key GOP conservatives, including the current and former chairmen of the Republican Study Committee, a powerful group inside the House GOP. "In order to allow time for the Senate to act, next week's bill will extend the debt limit for three months," the Study Committee said Friday in a statement. "This is a necessary first step as we work to halt the decline of America and puts the focus where it belongs: on the Senate who has failed to do their jobs to pass a budget for more than three years." The statement was issued by RSC Chairman Steve Scalise, R-La., and former chairmen, Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Tom Price, R-Ga., and Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas. Obama's budget is due early next month but is expected to be released several weeks later.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358535426695</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:57:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358535439117-63</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think CSCO is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>trina.hoffman636w</Username><Timestamp>1357832888332</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:48:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I got my own choice</Msg><Username>lashoreelise</Username><Timestamp>1358535439117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:57:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358535635333-64</Id><Topic><Title>NRA SAYS: THIS IS GOING TO BE AN EXPENSIVE BATTLE.

Not to be outdone, on Sunday Republicans will hold a private swearing-at ceremony for President Obama.” –Jimmy Fallon “President Obama’s half-brother is running for political office in Kenya. Donald Trump has already accused him of being born in the United States.” –Conan O’Brien “Thousands of dead fish have now washed up on shore along the coast of South Carolina. Today the NRA said that this wouldn’t have happened if those fish had guns.” –Jay Leno “Ann Romney, the wife of Mitt Romney, has reportedly turned down a chance to appear on ‘Dancing With the Stars.’ Apparently, she has something called ‘self-respect.’” –Jay Leno “Actually, she says she loves to dance and is a big fan of the show, but she said she’d rather stay home with the Biggest Loser.” –Jay Leno “It’s reported that if you’re playing Angry Birds, the company is tracking your location. This may seem silly to you, but it’s actually how we got bin Laden.” –Conan O’Brien “President Obama’s inaugural parade will feature eight floats, including a Hawaii float to honor his birthplace, an Illinois float to honor the first lady’s home state, and a Kenyan float just to mess with Republicans.” –Jimmy Fallon “Republicans and Democrats are working on a new bill to streamline the healthcare system. It will reduce the cost of mammograms and prostate exams. But don’t worry. They’ll still be free at the airport.” –Jimmy Fallon “President Obama is coming under criticism that his new administration has less diversity than his first one. Which is why this morning Obama said, ‘All right, fine, I am a Muslim.” –Conan O’Brien “An economist is suggesting that the U.S. Treasury mint a trillion-dollar county and deposit it in the federal reserve – which is how ‘The Lord of the Rings’ starts, isn’t it?” –Jimmy Kimmel “The Treasury will not mint a trillion-dollar coin. That is a shame. Wouldn’t it be nice to mint up nine or 10 and say we’re even?” –Jimmy Kimmel “President Obama told Congress it must raise our debt limit because the U.S. ‘is not a deadbeat nation.” Then the president added, ‘By the way, if China calls, I’m not here.’” –Conan O’Brien “Ten days from now Barack Obama will be inaugurated. I’m telling you, it is really starting to look bad for Mitt Romney.” –David Letterman “President Obama’s inauguration is coming up. During next week’s inauguration, he will be sworn in with not one, but two Bibles. Relax, Mr. President. We get it. You’re not a Muslim. You’re overcompensating.” –Conan O’Brien “Abraham Lincoln, our 16th president, has never been hotter. ‘Lincoln’ received 12 Oscar nominations. ‘Lincoln’ also received a nomination for best hat.” –David Letterman “President Obama recently came under fire over the lack of diversity in his cabinet. Then Obama said, ‘You guys know I’ll be there, too, right?’” –Jimmy Fallon</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1358536523505</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:15:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358536566629-71</Id><Topic><Title>Vix is pretty low</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1358531206691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:46:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jr.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1358536566629</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:16:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358536637771-72</Id><Topic><Title>Vix is pretty low</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1358531206691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:46:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>but you know low vix means sell stocks -high vix means buy. better check that out or you will lose a lot of money. you have it totally opposite.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1358536637771</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:17:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358537294976-73</Id><Topic><Title>Vix is pretty low</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1358531206691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:46:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Flute isn't Junior.

Now the potential 2016 presidential contender has lashed out at the National Rifle Association, calling a new ad from the group “reprehensible” for using Obama’s daughters to make a political point. “To talk about the president’s children or any public officer’s children who have — not by their own choice, but by requirement — to have protection and to use that somehow to try to make a political point, I think, is reprehensible,” Christie said. He added: “I think it’s awful to bring public figures’ children into the political debate. They don’t deserve to be there. And for any of us who are public figures, you see that ad and you cringe. You cringe because it’s just not appropriate to do that, in my opinion.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358548114390</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:28:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358548803357-123</Id><Title>House GOP agrees</Title><Msg>to keep the country in economic uncertainty for at least 3 more months, Eric Cantor (R., Va.) was quoted as saying "this seems the best way to maintain uncertainty in the economy and extend the current slow growth.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — House Republicans next week will take up a bill to extend the U.S. debt ceiling by three months, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said Friday, a move that would push the deadline for raising the borrowing limit to mid-April.

The U.S. is on track to run out of borrowing ability sometime in mid-February or March, according to the Treasury Department, and a three-month bill if passed in the House and Senate would get the country safely past that time.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358548803357</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:40:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358549254396-124</Id><Topic><Title>The evidence is mounting</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358547695587</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:21:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are one sick IDIOT.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1358549254396</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:47:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358549292452-125</Id><Title>GOP accuses Obama of not having enough diversity in his Cabinet</Title><Msg>Now they are angry he wants to appoint white men, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358549292452</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:48:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358549437981-126</Id><Topic><Title>The only difference between Libs and Zoo animials ------</Title><Username>juniorsclassmates_5</Username><Timestamp>1358535617336</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:00:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"animials" LOL you can't make up how stupid these people are, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358549437981</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:50:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358549494732-127</Id><Topic><Title>GOP accuses Obama of not having enough diversity in his Cabinet</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358549292452</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:48:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And NOW the racist left won't use minorities.

Released yesterday, Bullet to the Head of the NRA seems to have been designed just to #$%$ people off. "Share this everywhere, especially gun-nut and anti-game websites," creator and forum user gizmo01942 writes. "Also see if you can't send it in to the NRA somehow, like through the feedback on their website or something." ED forum user gizmo01942 is also developing a game based on the Sandy Hook shooting, he says, in which you'd go into the Connecticut school and shoot kids. This NRA game is a demo, he writes. It will be a bonus level in the Sandy Hook shooter. Bullet to the Head of the NRA comes just a day after the NRA released their own gun game, NRA: Practice Range, an iOS title for ages four and up in which you can shoot targets on a set of practice fields. I've played Bullet to the Head of the NRA, which you can download from the ED forums. It's very basic: you can move around a sniper rifle and shoot three NRA members on a stage as they talk about guns.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358553194806</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 18:53:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358553894969-137</Id><Topic><Title>'Firearms instructor' hired as school guard leaves handgun in student bathroom</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1358522942145</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:29:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well,dumbivan,when you going to back up your statement about guard guns killing children.
