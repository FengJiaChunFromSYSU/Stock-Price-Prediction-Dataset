Voted for both Bush's a total of 4 times. BTW, 10 years ago this very week I was activated and given orders to go play in the Sandbox again. Yup, been a decade...dang! I personally rather enjoyed the Bush years...always felt that my President understood where I was coming from. Not so much with this guy in office right now. On Senator Hagel...he has earn my attention to listen to anything he says. I have not formed a complete opinion on the man but I really, really liked his comment the he was the Senator from Nebraska, not Israel. Dang straight! Wish every Senator understood that it's America first. Heck, I wish the sitting President thought that... As for SecDef? Might be rather interesting to have a ground-pounders viewpoint in the hot seat. My initial instinct is to confirm. The whole Israeli viewpoint isn't that big a deal form me...yes, my default is to support them but again...America first.</Msg><Username>burgresident</Username><Timestamp>1357652444929</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 08:40:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357652570770-16</Id><Title>obama raised everyones taxes</Title><Msg>hahahahahahahahahaha all he could talk about for 5 years was middle class bottom 98% earners and what does he do...gives them a nice tax increase takes away morgage writ-offs as well as state and local tax write-offs. fn stupid lemmings...no wonder why they struggle for assistance they are to dumb to know what is good for them.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357652570770</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 08:42:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357652854842-17</Id><Topic><Title>why hagel is the anti bush choice</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1357648448630</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 07:34:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Heck, I wish the sitting President thought that...

LOL The lower 48 U.S. states experienced the warmest year on record in 2012, shattering the previous mark set in 1998 by one degree Fahrenheit, government scientists said Tuesday. The U.S.'s temperature records for the states excluding Hawaii and Alaska go back to 1895. In all the earlier years, average temperatures had varied within a band of about four degrees, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, making the jump in 2012 particularly stark. you just have to laugh at how stupid these people are, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357691151040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 19:25:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357694106992-147</Id><Topic><Title>I still say the earth is flat!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357691151040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 19:25:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One kilometer tall building (yes, 1000 meters) taller than the Burj Khalifa by nearly 2 football fields. NOW THAT'S A STIMULUS PACKAGE!!! The Tower of Babel aka Kingdom Tower (Arabic: برج المملكة‎ Burj al Mamlakah‎), previously known as Mile-High Tower (Arabic: برج الميل‎‎), is a supertall skyscraper proposed for construction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia at a preliminary cost of only US$1.23 billion. It will be the centerpiece and first phase of a US$20 billion proposed development known as Kingdom City that will be located along the Red Sea on the north side of Jeddah. If completed as planned, the tower will reach unprecedented heights, becoming the tallest building in the world, as well as the first structure to reach the one-kilometer mark. The tower was initially planned to be 1.6-kilometer (1 mi) high; however, the geology of the area proved unsuitable for a tower of that height.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1357694106992</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 20:15:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357694865674-148</Id><Topic><Title>I still say the earth is flat!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357691151040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 19:25:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A whole 118 years of records means nothing.

The NWO is the framework which every new conspiracy-of-the-week can be fit into. According to Jones' broadcasts and various "documentaries," the scaffolding around which the NWO was built came about over two hundred years ago when the Rothschild banking family, the Illuminati, and the Freemasons came to power. Since then, things have snowballed into a complete worldwide conspiracy of every government and corporate entity. Because many of the conspiracy theories he espouses are similar to those passed around in the John Birch Society and the sovereign citizen movement like Federal Reserve, global warming, and United Nations conspiracies (the Birch Society and New World Order conspiracies are not part of a neocon platform if they bothered noticing, the guy hates Bush more than the majority of the left! Along with every modern President.), he is often mis-characterized in some mainstream sources as part of the conservative talk radio milieu (sure, put a 9/11 truther in with Sean Hannity). Jones, however, considers himself a libertarian and also covers a number of more left-wing conspiracy theories (remember, everything's a conspiracy), such as Truthers, Big Pharma conspiracies, vaccine hysteria, and Monsanto/genetically modified food conspiracies (useless eaters!). Because of his belief that these corporations are part of the NWO as well, he promotes all sorts of alternative medicine and nature woo. Oh, did we mention he's homophobic?[2]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357695924296</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 20:45:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357696522323-153</Id><Topic><Title>I still say the earth is flat!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357691151040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 19:25:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"you just have to laugh at how stupid these people are," We do.

LOL just to funny. In the scientific field of climate studies – which is informed by many different disciplines – the consensus is demonstrated by the number of scientists who have stopped arguing about what is causing climate change – and that’s nearly all of them. A survey of all peer-reviewed abstracts on the subject 'global climate change' published between 1993 and 2003 shows that not a single paper rejected the consensus position that global warming is man caused. 75% of the papers agreed with the consensus position while 25% made no comment either way, focusing on methods or paleoclimate analysis (Oreskes 2004). Several subsequent studies confirm that “...the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes”. (Doran 2009). In other words, more than 95% of scientists working in the disciplines contributing to studies of our climate, accept that climate change is almost certainly being caused by human activities. We should also consider official scientific bodies and what they think about climate change. There are no national or major scientific institutions anywhere in the world that dispute the theory of anthropogenic climate change. Not one.

LOL ARIZONA – Giffords and her husband on Tuesday launched a political action committee aimed at curbing gun violence, while two politicians on opposite ends of the gun debate held dueling weapons buybacks outside a Tucson police station. In Maricopa County, Sheriff Joe Arpaio has said he plans to post armed volunteers on school perimeters to protect Phoenix-area students. His plan, announced last month, came after two other Arizona officials released ideas for boosting school security: Attorney General Tom Horne proposed firearms training for one person in each school, and Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu proposed training multiple educators per school to carry guns.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357707071270</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:51:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357707410977-177</Id><Topic><Title>In one corner we have every single national and major scientific institution</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357706603170</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:43:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>now that is funny</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357707410977</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:56:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
