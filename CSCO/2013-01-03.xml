A November editorial titled “Obama’s Soviet Mistake” observes that while Vladimir Putin’s re-election signified popular determination to keep the New World Order agenda out of Russia, President Obama’s did the opposite. The commentary presents a very dim view of “the illiterate society” that voted to award Obama a second term, influenced by continuing “lies of less taxes while he raises them”, and “speeches of peace and love in the world as he promotes wars as he did in Egypt, Libya and Syria.” It goes on to say that Obama “plans his next war is with Iran as he fires or demotes his generals who get in the way.” Man The Lifeboats! Global Warming Has Oceans Rising At Alarming Rate!

It's a form of sociopathy. Is that a word? It's like a religion, only the liberal demagogues are their idols. They don't seem to be able to think cognitively, and their first reaction is to give handouts instead of a hand up. The leaches and moochers need someone to kick them in the butt and get them moving. Roosevelt knew how to get some work out of them with the WPA.

The ban was rushed through the Russian parliament after our Congress passed the Magnitsky Act, which prohibits Russian human-rights abusers from visiting or banking in the U.S. Isn’t it remarkable to see how Russian newspaper Pravda recognizes that “Obama is a Communist without question, promoting the Communist Manifesto without calling it so”? Pravda continues: “How shrewd he is in America. His cult of personality mesmerizes those who cannot go beyond their ignorance. They will continue to follow him like those fools who still praise Lenin and Stalin in Russia. Obama’s fools and Stalin’s fools share the same drink of illusion.” Again, offering Putin’s “conservative” policies for contrast, Pravda lists some preferred examples: 1. Reducing taxes on production, investing money in the economy and optimizing state expenses. 2. Avoiding excessive governmental interference into the economic life of the country and absolute faith in the all-mightiness of the state… expecting that the state can achieve better results. 3. Avoiding unreasonable expansion of the annual budget deficit and national debt, recognizing that both are as destructive as an adventurous stock market game. Can you possibly believe that these pointers are drawn from speeches delivered by Vladimir Putin, rather than from fundamental lessons we would be much more likely expect to hear from Ronald Reagan? The world has turned upside down. The U.S. has gone #$%$. China and Russia are the successful capitalists. Quoting Putin, “During the time of the Soviet Union the role of the state in economy was made absolute, which eventually lead to the total non-competitiveness of the economy. That lesson cost us dearly. I am sure no one would want history to repeat itself.” The editorial opines that, “President Putin could never have imagined anyone so arrogant or so willing to destroy their people like Obama, much less seeing millions vote for someone like Obama.” Incredulously, it asks, “They read American history don’t they? Alas, the schools in the U.S. were conquered by the Communists long ago and history was revised, thus paving the way for their Communist presidents. Obama has bailed out those businesses that voted for him and increased the debt to over 16 trillion with an ever-increasing unemployment rate, especially among blacks and minorities. All the while, promoting his agenda.” And the amazing Putin-quoting clincher: “We must seek support in the moral values that have ensured the progress of our civilization. Honesty and hard work, responsibility and faith in our strength are bound to bring us success.” Really? Aren’t we supposed to know that? Do we have to be reminded of this by Putin and Pravda ? Nor does it end there. Not by a long shot! The article states that “…the red, white and blue still flies happily, but only in Russia” where the symbol of St George defeating the Dragon cross appears on its flag. On the other hand, “…the ACLU and other atheist groups in America would never allow the U.S. flag with such religious symbols.” It notes “Lawsuits a plenty against religious freedom and expression in the Land of the Free. Christianity in the U.S. is under attack as it was during the early period of the Soviet Union when religious symbols were against the law.”</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1357229187377</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 11:06:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357229432784-54</Id><Topic><Title>A typical liberal</Title><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1357219374513</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 08:22:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you think anybody in the Middle East is really our friend, you are the idiot.

When that drew universal scorn, who but a jokester would then have followed with a specifics-free do-over speech on fiscal policy in April? That “plan” was so funny that, when asked about its budgetary effects, Congressional Budget Office chief Douglas Elmendorf cracked, “We don’t estimate speeches.” And who but a funnyman would explicitly threaten senior citizens, as Obama did this week, by saying he couldn’t “guarantee” that Social Security checks would go out on schedule next month if an agreement to raise the borrowing limit can’t be reached? Meanwhile, no Democratic-controlled chamber of Congress has been able to pass a budget in two years: They refuse to cut spending, they don’t dare raise taxes without Republican cover — and now even new borrowing could become impossible.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357236555528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 13:09:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357236583799-106</Id><Topic><Title>fiscal cliff is about</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357144753270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 11:39:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They get the synopsis from a trusted source, and make a decision.

The new analysis shows Democratic presidents far outperform their Republican counterparts in producing manufacturing jobs. Of course, that finding shouldn't surprise anyone. After all, as the record shows, measured by job creation, employment growth, stock market performance or just about any other indicator, the U.S. economy for three generations has done much better with Democrats in the White House. The new study jointly performed by Pennsylvania's Keystone Research Center (KRC) and the Iowa Policy Project (IPP) found that "Democratic administrations have added an average of between 160,000 and 250,000 manufacturing jobs each year, while Republican ones have lost manufacturing jobs at about the same rate."

Corker stated that the visibility of his properties and public knowledge of his ownership in them served as another check on his actions as mayor.[89] On October 11, 2006, The Commercial Appeal reported that the blind trust that Corker set up to run his businesses to avoid conflicts of interest while he was mayor "may not have been all that blind".[88] According to e-mails discovered by the Appeal (some of which had previously presumed to be lost): "Corker met often with employees from his private companies while mayor from 2001 to 2005, and he shared business tips with others. Corker also got help organizing his 2001 mayoral campaign from City Hall, where a government secretary passed on voting lists and set up meetings for the millionaire commercial real estate developer."[88] The e-mails show that Corker often met with officials from his private company, the Corker Group, which was part of the blind trust, while he was mayor.[88] When asked about these e-mails by the Appeal, Corker said that he thought the blind trust had "worked very well" and that he had sold most of his business holdings so that he could avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest in the Senate.[8</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1357254975280</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 18:16:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357256016537-241</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO Upgraded to Outperform</Title><Username>wobatus</Username><Timestamp>1357218382103</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 08:06:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure looks like big accumulation, every time the HFT manipulators tried to sell it down, large buying would come in and run it back up.

If the person making the threat does not own a gun, that person should be blocked from buying one, the task force said. When the General Assembly convenes Jan. 9, some familiar issues will no longer be on the table More news about Md. politics The group also recommended that mental health and other professionals be required to report such threats to local law enforcement. Those professionals would include psychologists, educators, social workers, addiction treatment counselors and others. “The task force thinks every single one of those categories should be reporting. Some of those may be stronger than others in current law,” said Patrick Dooley, chief of staff at Maryland’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, who was co-chairman of the group. Currently, the ethics code of the American Psychological Association says psychologists can disclose information to “protect the client/patient, psychologist, or others from harm.” The task force, which included representatives from the police, courts, state government and advocacy groups, was created by the General Assembly last year. Its work took on added urgency after the massacre last month in Newtown, Conn., which resulted in 28 deaths, including the gunman’s. Lindsay Nichols, an attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said the changes, if implemented, would put Maryland in a select group nationwide. “Really only a handful of states have looked at this. This proposal would really put Maryland in the forefront of addressing the problem” of violent mentally ill individuals having access to firearms, Nichols said. Philip Watson, director of special projects at the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun rights group, said his group is “cautiously optimistic” about the proposed effort “to keep dangerous individuals away from firearms.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357260136396</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 19:42:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357260446508-267</Id><Topic><Title>CHRISTIE THE BLIMP IS STARTING TO WIN ME OVER...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1357191595581</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 00:39:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You go blimp man</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1357260446508</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 19:47:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357260636413-268</Id><Topic><Title>577,190 CANCER DEATHS IN USA ANNUALLY</Title><Username>weiner_the_peter_tweeter</Username><Timestamp>1357070917484</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 15:08:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More Venezuelan Officials Arrive in Cuba CARACAS—More top leaders within Venezuela's government arrived in Cuba during the past two days, where ailing President Hugo Chávez apparently remains in "delicate" condition after a six-hour surgery, raising concerns once again that the 58-year-old leader could be near death.

Richard Mack, a former sheriff in Graham County, Ariz., joined with then-Ravalli County Sheriff Jay Printz in a lawsuit against Washington when Bill Clinton demanded sheriffs enforce provisions of the Brady Bill gun-control law. He won. And since then he’s been at the front of a movement that highlights the responsibility of local sheriffs. Now, as Washington gears up to consider imperious plans to limit guns, require fingerprinting and registration, impose additional taxes and fees, ban particular features or functions outright, and even confiscate weapons of self-defense, Mack has told WND that there’s hope remaining in local law enforcement. It’s not complicated, he said. “Gun control is illegal, and it’s against the Constitution,” he said. “What people don’t realize is that the Second Amendment was designed to protect us from the power of the federal government.” He said he would expect sheriffs across the country to defend the rights of ordinary Americans</Msg><Username>bullbear308</Username><Timestamp>1357260637557</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 19:50:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357261065793-270</Id><Title>HOORAY!

ORLANDO, Fla., Oct. 25 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- A new initiative organized by ten national law enforcement leadership organizations is promising to focus on effective strategies to address gun violence, calling its current level a "crisis" and "unacceptable." The National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence was launched today at the annual conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Orlando, Florida. Representatives of the founding organizations were on hand to speak to the devastating impact of firearms, which kill and injure 100,000 Americans each year. The Partnership marks an unprecedented joint effort by law enforcement leaders to address gun violence in an era of shrinking law enforcement budgets and rising levels of officer deaths. "Every day, gun violence threatens the safety and well-being of citizens and law enforcement officers throughout this country," said Chief Michael J. Carroll , president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. "Law enforcement understands and embraces our central role in combating illegal firearms and gun violence. That is why I am proud that the IACP, along with the leaders of our nation's premier law enforcement organizations, have come together in this unprecedented manner to create this national Partnership." According to U.S. Secret Service Resident Agent in Charge Hector Hernandez, president of the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association, law enforcement leaders "know firsthand how devastating crimes involving guns are to our communities and society as a whole. We're honored to have the opportunity to have a role in fighting the cycle of gun violence." "In 2008, 34 officers were killed in the line of duty with firearms. So far this year, we've lost 43 officers to firearms," said Chief Katherine Perez , president of the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives. "The trend is worsening, and we need to take immediate action."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357261141367</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 19:59:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357261381198-273</Id><Topic><Title>Sheriffs called out to fight the law (resisting gun confiscation)</Title><Username>bullbear308</Username><Timestamp>1357260637557</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 19:50:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Meanwhile back in the real world, Most people support the NRA and gun rights and sheriffs refusal to confiscate guns spells big time blockade for anti-gun nuts old buddy.</Msg><Username>bullbear308</Username><Timestamp>1357261381198</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 20:03:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357262760944-274</Id><Topic><Title>must suck to be a tea billie</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357237915414</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 13:31:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Probably a college graduate.

Cuba is certainly the most vulnerable. The Cuban economy would probably implode without the massive oil subsidy it receives from Venezuela. This would jeopardize the continuity of the Castro regime. This is why Havana is playing such an active role in deciding who will replace Chávez and how the succession should play out. Other regional allies such as Nicaragua, Ecuador and Bolivia would also face cutbacks in economic assistance but not big enough to threaten their leaders’ hold on power. It has long become clear that Chávez-style populism doesn’t work. Venezuela is in ruins. There are shortages of basic goods. Its infrastructure is literally falling apart. It’s the most corrupt country in the region. It has one of the world’s highest crime rates. Meanwhile, countries that have chosen democratic capitalism such as Chile and Peru are faring much better and represent a far more attractive model. Chávez’s death will only accelerate the demise of his so called “Socialism of the 21st Century.” Argentina calls for UK to give up the Falklands.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1357264953752</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 21:02:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357264984872-281</Id><Topic><Title>More people killed with clubs and hammers than rifles</Title><Username>eagle1776321</Username><Timestamp>1357264861791</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 21:01:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CSCO is a good buy.

LOL tea billies are a cancer killing the GOP. Washington (CNN) -- Supporters of the Violence Against Women Act hope to revive the law in a new Congress after efforts to renew it failed in the last one. "It is an early priority for us," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, told CNN as the 113th Congress convened Thursday. "Since it passed the Senate last time, with two more Democrats in the Senate, we hope that it will have an easy path there and a doable path there -- and a successful one in the House." The Violence Against Women Act mostly provides support for organizations that serve domestic violence victims. Criminal prosecutions of abusers are generally the responsibility of local authorities, but the act stiffened sentences for stalking under federal law. Supporters credit the 1994 act with sharply reducing the number of lives lost to domestic violence over the past two decades.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357268482098</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:01:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357268827397-296</Id><Topic><Title>GOP house votes down renewal of the Violence Against Woman Act cause they like to beat their women without police interference</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357268482098</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:01:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is so stupid.

There were some signs that conservative resistance to Boehner was well-organized, at least by one member who has never been a big fan of the Ohio Republican. (Also on POLITICO: Who are the Boehner resisters?) Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) -- who was recently removed from key committees and supported Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) for speaker -- sat on the House floor during the speaker vote brandishing an iPad. A message was displayed on the screen ticking off members of the House Republican Conference he hoped would oppose the sitting speaker. The title of the document: "You would be fired if this goes out." Among the Republicans on the list were Reps. Steve King (Iowa), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Scott Garrett (N.J.), Steve Fincher (Tenn.) and Scott Desjarlais (Tenn.). All of them ultimately supported Boehner. It's not clear that any of the other Republicans on Huelskamp's list knew they were on it, or even knew of the list's existence. In the end, nine Republicans abandoned the Ohio Republican's bid for a second term as speaker, and cast votes for people as varied as a former member of Congress who lost his reelection bid in November and a 1990s-era U.S. comptroller general who appears on cable television. (Also on POLITICO: Boehner's battle for speaker) Two Republicans - Reps. Raul Labrador (Idaho) and Mick Mulvaney (S.C.) - sat in the chamber, pointedly ignoring the call of their name to cast a vote for Boehner, who edged to victory with 220 votes. And newly elected Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas), who returned to the House after 15 years, voted "present," demonstrating his lack of fear for the diminished Boehner. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) -- long a foil to Boehner -- got three votes. As a trio of Republicans lawmakers cast their votes for him, Cantor shook his head on the House floor, visibly displeased. His office declined to comment on the vote. Huelskamp's and others' whipping efforts to oust the speaker fell short, though several lawmakers listed in the Kansan's iPad message did oppose Boehner, including Reps.

LOL Now what you can expect, now that he has been reelected, and the tea baggers have made clear they will not support him, he has only one way to get legislation passed, the way he just got the Tax Bill passed. He cuts deals with the DNC and brings in some GOPERS. The house is 201 DNC and 234 GOP, there are 151 GOPERS that voted against the tax bill, 52 were hard core baggers that will never vote for anything the DNC would vote for. To pass legislation #$%$ has to get 218 votes. He can do it by getting 218 GOPERS (52 of which will never do what he wants) or he can do it by passing legislation the DNC can support meaning he needs just 17 GOPERS to be sane.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357270505212</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:35:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357270565993-309</Id><Topic><Title>ROCK CENTER TELLING How JFackingKennedy Raped MEME Alford</Title><Username>donkeydouchebags</Username><Timestamp>1357270219085</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:30:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah, makes you wonder who Oby is probably fricking instead of that gorrilla he sleeps with.

She is among the majority of the minority, idiot. "In practical terms, this has generally kept the minority party from passing bills with the assistance of a small number of members of the majority party. It takes 218 votes to pass a bill. Even when there are 218 votes to pass a bill, the rule prevents votes from taking place when those 218 votes do not include a majority of the majority party"</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1357271288306</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:48:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357271655981-316</Id><Topic><Title>Someone ask J Boehner</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357270918442</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:41:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I prefer guidelines to rules. The Tax deal bridged the guideline. It wasn't a very old guideline. I suppose you would prefer the tax bill didn't pass? Never voted after so much media frenzy and BS? Yeah, sometime the guidelines need to be broken for the peace of the nation. Boehner wins as a negotiator. Wins speakership again. You just sound like an idiot, but you are probably paid to do it by Acorn or the Union. I 'll put in a good word for you. You are doing a great job of sounding like an idiot.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1357271655981</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:54:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357275552038-317</Id><Topic><Title>ROCK CENTER TELLING How JFackingKennedy Raped MEME Alford</Title><Username>donkeydouchebags</Username><Timestamp>1357270219085</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:30:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well this Meme was just of them, the story names at least 9 women JFK cheated with, 10 if you throw in Marlyn Monroe.
