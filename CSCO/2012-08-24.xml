Take his legislative agenda. No Child Left Behind is now widely unpopular among both liberals and conservatives—so unpopular that Congress has spent the past five years assiduously avoiding a vote to reauthorize it. His tax cuts expired in 2010 and are now little more than a political football. His own party wants to repeal key provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley. The Supreme Court has effectively gutted campaign finance reform. On the foreign policy front, his wars are widely viewed as expensive failures. And he was never able to get so much as a vote on Social Security privatization or immigration reform. That doesn't leave much. Pretty much all that's left is the PATRIOT Act and the Medicare prescription drug bill. That's not much for eight years. Beyond that, neither party wants anything to do with him. It's not surprising that Democrats still think of him as the Frat Boy President, one of the worst of all time, but what is surprising is that Republicans largely agree.

If Bush's numbers don't improve, he could become the first president held back and forced to repeat his presidency.'' —Tina Fey, on Saturday Night Live's ''Weekend Update''</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1345809288556</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 07:54:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345810533431-10</Id><Topic><Title>MITT TO PAY 0.82% IN TAXES, AND SO WILL I</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345785817352</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 01:23:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stick it in your azzszzz crybaby HYPOCRITE.

Dr. John C. "Jack" Willke, now 87, founded the National Right to Life Committee and wrote the influential 1971 "Handbook on Abortion," which has shaped the thinking of generations of anti-abortion activists. Rep. Todd Akin's comments this week on rape and pregnancy helped upend a Senate race and roiled the Republican Party in a tough election year. Akin, a candidate for the Senate from Missouri, suggested during an interview Sunday that women's bodies can prevent pregnancies in case of "legitimate rape." Although Akin apologized, leading Republicans, including presidential candidate Mitt Romney, are pressuring him to abandon his Senate bid, one of several races seen as key to Republican hopes of regaining control of Congress in November. Akin's comments also thrust abortion to the forefront of the presidential campaign at a time when Romney has been trying to steer the debate away from sensitive social issues and toward the economy. But the remarks reflect ideas that Willke began peddling many years ago. "There's no greater emotional trauma that can be experienced by a woman than an assault rape," Willke wrote in 1999 in the journal Christian Life Resources. "This can radically upset her possibility of ovulation, fertilization, implantation and even nurturing of a pregnancy."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345851127985</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 19:32:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345854581761-117</Id><Title>President Mitt Romney</Title><Msg>is going to open our oil fields!

In his opinion, those human beings are no better than #$%$ roaches or rabid rats and it is ok to kill them. And Republicans wonder why there is a huge gap in the Latino vote. Not to be outdone by his fellow Joes, Republican Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio reported that his criminal investigation into President Obama’s birth certificate is proceeding on schedule and makes him absolutely sure that it is a forgery. What he is asserting is that the President of the United States is an illegal alien. In Arizona, he can arrest and hold the President in a private “jail” for suspicion he’s an alien. They join Michelle Bachman, Louis Gomert, Donald Trump, Herman Cain, and a host of other prominent Republicans who have recently been spewing hate speech disguised as something else. Welcome to today's Republican party. What is worse: These hateful statements by Republicans holding or running for high office, or the deafening silence of all Republican leaders from Chairman Reince Pribus to the party leader Presidential nominee Mitt Romney? There is no condemnation of these statements by any Republican leader. However, these same leaders starting with Mitt Romney were outraged beyond belief by the “hatred” coming from the Obama campaign because Vice-President Joe Biden said that Wall Street wanted to put “y’all back inn chains.” In the new Republican morality, killing Mexicans including children, and hatred of Muslims, burning their Mosques, profiling African Americans (or worse) is just fine, but Biden’s statement about Wall Street is “over the top.” What happened to the soul of today’s Republican Party? Congressman Walsh is the same deadbeat Dad that is $100,000 behind in child support despite his $190,000 a year salary earned eating at the public trough. He is the same guy who attacked his opponent, a decorated Army Veteran who lost her legs in service to this country, saying she was not a hero. He never served.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345856475496</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 21:01:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345856558376-121</Id><Title>THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT TRADED JESUS FOR JOSEPH SMITH...</Title><Msg>Because it is better to worship a false prophet than to have a black guy for president.

The Romney campaign has already raised objections with NBC, CBS and ABC for not broadcasting from the convention on its first night on Monday. That's when Ann Romney was scheduled to speak, but the campaign is now likely to move her address to Tuesday, when the broadest possible audience will be watching. (It remains unclear why the campaign was so apparently blindsided by network plans which have been in the works for a very long time.) The networks are airing the same number of hours -- three -- of the conventions for both parties. They also aired that same number of hours for both conventions in 2004 and 2000. Moreover, NBC is skipping one night of the Democratic convention in favor of football. But Priebus told CNN he sees the hidden hand of favoritism in the decision to skip Monday's proceedings.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345856982424</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 21:09:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345857185253-125</Id><Topic><Title>Why hasn't Mitt released his</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345849848645</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 19:10:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>anybody? could it be because he is a felon? birth certificate and taxes like Obama??</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345857185253</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 21:13:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345857442191-126</Id><Title>IT IS TIME TO GET ANOTHER 2 ASSAULT RIFLES...</Title><Msg>If Romeny wins this country is going down the tubes and I better be ready</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345857442191</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 21:17:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345857616750-127</Id><Title>9-11 happened under Obama's administration</Title><Msg>in the teabagger rabbit hole On "Good Morning America" Friday, the former New York mayor declared, "We had no domestic attacks under Bush; we've had one under Obama."
