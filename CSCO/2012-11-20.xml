It remains under the control of sane, rational, hard working Red Workers who will demand accountability and sober management of a nearly insoluble crisis....MASSIVE DEBT, PAPER MONEY AS TOILET PAPER and the plunging productivity of Blue States...nearly underwater. Democrats are paralyzed with fear and sent their confused President abroad where he can mangle nouns, verbs and geography without fear of observation and the need to readjust his medication dosage.

One would have some sympathy for the human condition and diversity without conceding that everyone deserves a college education. I really do think that people of color should be "allowed" to pursue their dreams and seek higher education, but should not be preferred based on their race. Shouldn't the seats be given to the people with the highest qualifications regardless of race? I thought that was what "equality" was supposed to mean. Why Democrats want to pay for everyone, including #$%$ in college is an outrage to sensibilities. Again, regardless of race.

Clearly in the rabbit hole slitting your throat is viewed as a big positive. LOL If only she was half black half hispanic it would be perfect!!! And the Republicans, having lost the election because Americans want cooperation and laser-like-focus by Congress on the economy, should have learned a lesson about gridlock. They also hopefully have learned that women, minorities, and young voters don’t like the GOP message. Now, BAM!, the GOP goes after a black woman ambassador whom Obama wants to nominate as the Secretary of State. Good idea I think not. Susan Rice is an intelligent and articulate diplomat. She was given intelligence information on the Behghazi, Libya by US intelligence which she foolishly repeated on TV – that a spontaneous demonstration by angry Muslims over a YouTube video insulting the Prophet Mohammed was responsible for the attack. While that was probably incorrect it does NOT rise to the level of a Watergate-Like Hearing. Especially since the Republicans cut funding for diplomatic security and THAT can easily be made the issue of why there was not more robust security at the consulate.That COULD be an issue only if Democrats decide to get some “loin” and strike at the Republicans over those cuts which does not seem likely since the democrats seem to have become pussycats. Some feel that God sent Superstorm Sandy to punish Republicans and give Obama the election. Now one of my students send me an e mail asking if God was punishing Republicans for continuing to squabble and make hay out of the Libyan tragedy by starting a war between Israel and the Palestinians. I hardly believe that God has time to micro manage! But it is true that every time the GOP leadership tries to grab headlines on Benghazi something else happens to suck all the oxygen out of those hearings. Now it is the renewed war between Israel and the Palestinians – in other words a new Middle East crisis. It’s almost as if the GOP has tin ears that can’t hear what voters and Americans in general want.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353442320045</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:12:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353442897730-59</Id><Topic><Title>GOP smart to attack Susan Rice,</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353442320045</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:12:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Back to cut and paste as dumbivan.

The Pallies didn't ever get a state from either Egypt or Jordan, the Pallies were treated by Arabs as the sub humans that they are. Not only did Israel give them the Gaza for nothing but 30 thousand Jews were forcibly removed from their homes and businesses. The Pallies never gave peace, for the land Israel gave them. Since they got the free land they have shelled Israel with about 8000 missiles, rocket, mortars, artillery shells, had suicide bombers.

FYI, this has all started because Israel wanted to test the effectiveness of their new "iron dome" weapons in a battlefield. Israel needed a dry run to prepare for their confrontation with Iran, so Israel initiated this latest conflict by first killing an unarmed Palestinian civilian at the border crossing but didn't receive any retaliatory response from the Hamas. Then few days later, Israel killed a 13 year boy to incite provocation but still did not get the adequate response from Hamas. So, Israel went ahead to assassinate one of Hamas military leader which finally driven the Hamas into a frenzy and retaliating with their rockets. Israel now has a chance to really test their “iron dome” weapons in a real battle.
