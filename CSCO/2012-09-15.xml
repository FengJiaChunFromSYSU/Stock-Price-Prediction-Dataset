And it is dangerous for Mr. Netanyahu to try to push the president into a corner publicly and raise questions about Washington. Is that really the message he wants to send to Tehran? There is no reason to doubt President Obama’s oft-repeated commitment to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon. But 70 percent of Americans oppose a unilateral strike on Iran, according to a new poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and 59 percent said if Israel bombs Iran and ignites a war, the United States should not come to its ally’s defense.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347718170711</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 10:09:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347718651471-15</Id><Title>Mitt ain't no Ronald Raygun</Title><Msg>Andrew Sullivan of The Daily Beast suggests Romney's response makes him "unfit" for the responsibility of running the country. Sullivan lays out the reasons why he thinks Romney should be disqualified from being president. Including Romney's knee-jerk judgments, based on ideology not reality, his inability to back down when he said something wrong and his argument that President Obama sympathized with the murderers of America's ambassador to Libya. Criticizing America's Commander-in-Chief while U.S. interests were still under attack, and Americans were dying, comes off as amateur and un-presidential, and might just be political suicide for Romney. It's times like these when an unguarded comment can leave a lasting impression. Compare Romney's response to how the 1980 Republican candidates for president reacted to the Iran hostage crisis under President Carter's watch. As The Atlantic points out, when news broke that an effort to rescue the American hostages from the Tehran embassy failed Ronald Reagan said, "This is the time for us as a nation and a people to stand united." George H.W. Bush went even further, saying he "unequivocally" supported carter and it wasn't a time to "try to go one-up politically." Mitt Romney has been around long enough to know better.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347718651471</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 10:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347718684514-16</Id><Topic><Title>what is really funny is</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347714818349</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:13:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There were NO marines at Benghazi.

Ryan now points to his vote for war as a token of his readiness to serve in the White House, but he is on the wrong side of both history and public opinion. The Wisconsin congressman may come to regret his flippant response to Carl Cameron last Saturday, when the Fox News reporter asked how he would respond to critics who question his weak national security resume. "I've been in Congress for a number of years," he said. "That's more experience than Barack Obama had when he came into office." Perhaps he should have stopped there, but instead blundered on, "I voted to send people to war." Does Ryan believe that voting for war constitutes foreign policy experience? If so, it is a kind of experience that reflects very poorly on him. Even he must realize that the underlying premise of the war, Saddam Hussein's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, quickly proved to be nothing more than a Bush administration hoax, along with the secondary claim that Saddam's regime had some connection with the 9/11 attacks. After casting his party-line vote for a ruinous war because he accepted a faked argument, Ryan never spoke up against its continuation. He ratified every troop escalation and every supplemental appropriation. Unlike the American people, who turned decisively against the war years ago, and have condemned it by large majorities as a waste of blood and treasure, he apparently still believes it was a swell idea. Concerned as he supposedly is about excessive federal spending, Ryan believes that the Iraq misadventure was worth $3 trillion it has cost so far (and presumably the lost and destroyed lives of Americans and Iraqis, all the dead, wounded, orphaned and traumatized, as well).</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347741552666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:39:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347743126408-54</Id><Title>Romney is toast</Title><Msg>President Obama is also showing a growing lead in three swing states, according to the Washington Post. A poll by Marist College, NBC News and the Wall Street Journal called the Marist polls shows Obama leading Mitt Romney by seven points in Ohio and by five points each in Florida and Virginia. The margin is the largest lead for Obama, as the DNC bounce paid big dividends. The scary thing for Mitt Romney and his supporters is that no Republican nominee for President has ever been elected without winning the state of Ohio, going back to Abraham Lincoln. It is Ohio in all the electoral prognostications that show President Obama will be easily reelected President with Ohio in his column. The states of Florida and Virgina would just be frosting on the electoral cake. Obama leads 50 percent to 43 percent in Ohio and 49 percent to 44 percent in both Florida and Virginia. The 50 percent lead in Ohio is indeed very bad news for Mitt Romney. It is generally accepted that if Obama wins just one of those three swing states, the path for victory for Mitt Romney diminishes greatly. A clean sweep of those states means the reelection of President Barack Obama.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347743126408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:05:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347743201607-55</Id><Topic><Title>Romney is toast</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347743126408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:05:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As Gopers start to see Romney is a lost cause I think a lot of baggers will go vote for the libertarian candidate Johnson, after all a vote for a true conservative that is going to lose is better then a vote for a faux conservative that is going to lose</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347743201607</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:06:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347744277359-56</Id><Title>0.00005% of Egypt hates America, THE REPUKES HAVA A COW !!!</Title><Msg>Yes, 3,000 egyptians out of 60 MILLION hate America and the repukes think we should nuke the entire country.

(The Romney-Ryan campaign now says they would restore those cuts.) “You gotta give him one thing: It takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did,” Clinton said in one of many moments in the speech during which he departed from his prepared remarks. That was one of several zingers in the speech, in which Clinton fleshed out a line of attack that labels Republicans as the founders of the economic hardships that have plagued Obama’s presidency. “We simply cannot afford to give the reins of government to someone who will double down on trickle-down” economics, Clinton said. Earlier, he offered this take on the GOP’s campaign strategy: “We left (Obama) a total mess, he hasn’t cleaned it up fast enough, so fire him and put us back in.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347745889013</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:51:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347746339060-60</Id><Title>mitt needs Fl and OH or he loses</Title><Msg>President Obama is building his lead in Florida, Ohio and Virginia over Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, according to polls released Thursday.

Bet Obama's team encourages folks like you, hell you probably work for Obama's campaign Obama’s Selective Service registration is public. A copy has been posted publicly, and the Selective Service confirmed that Obama registered for the draft on Sept. 4, 1980, and was given registration number 61-1125539-1. Worth noting is that nobody in the U.S. has been drafted for military service since 1972, the year Obama turned 11. Obama, like other young men turning age 18 since then, was required to register on a standby basis, in case Congress ever resumes an active military draft. Failure to register is technically a crime, and disqualifies a man for federal student aid or from holding certain federal jobs.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347754349400</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 20:12:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347754402617-86</Id><Topic><Title>I voted to send people to war--Ryans best line</Title><Username>rationalthought11</Username><Timestamp>1347751097442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 19:18:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My my,dumdum!!This morning you accused me of being a Flute id and said you put me on ignore.Now you just answered my post.Did I catch you in a fib??LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL How's Bill Ayers doing??LOLOLOLOLOL</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1347754402617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 20:13:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347755681609-87</Id><Topic><Title>I voted to send people to war--Ryans best line</Title><Username>rationalthought11</Username><Timestamp>1347751097442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 19:18:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nope I never said I put you on ignore, I said I ignored you, you baggers aren't smart enough to understand anything that isn't black and white, LOL I'm probably going to ignore some more of our inane posts too, that doesn't mean I don't read them for the humor, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347755681609</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 20:34:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347756241117-88</Id><Title>a post from another recovering republican</Title><Msg>My old Republican worldview was flawed because it was based upon a small and particularly rosy sliver of reality. To preserve that worldview, I had to believe that people had morally earned their “just” desserts, and I had to ignore those whining liberals who tried to point out that the world didn’t actually work that way. I think this shows why Republicans put so much effort into “creat[ing] our own reality,” into fostering distrust of liberals, experts, scientists, and academics, and why they won’t let a campaign “be dictated by fact-checkers” (as a Romney pollster put it). It explains why study after study shows — examples here, here, and here – that avid consumers of Republican-oriented media are more poorly informed than people who use other news sources or don’t bother to follow the news at all.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347756241117</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 20:44:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347756403347-89</Id><Topic><Title>GOP spending cuts include $129 million a year for embassy protection</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1347746848706</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 18:07:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if we eliminate protection of our embassies private corporations will step in and protect them for the naming rights!!!</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347756403347</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 20:46:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347758124244-90</Id><Topic><Title>a post from another recovering republican</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347756241117</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 20:44:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like dumb dumb has totally lost it.

Gallup poll doesn't pass elementary math. The Gallup seven day tracking poll of the presidential race released today shows Mitt Romney behind President Obama by a 49 percent to 44 margin. The seven day tracking poll of 3050 registered voters, that has a margin of error of 2.0 percent, samples Democrats by about a 8 percent margin based on calculations from the reported data. If the data is properly weighted for the partisan makeup of the electorate, the data from this poll unskewed would show a Romney lead of 49 percent to 44. By skewing the poll, it gives Obama a five point lead instead of showing Romney leading by the same total. The sampling used by Gallup differs with the partisan data measured from hundreds of thousands of voters by Rasmussen Reports, which measures the partisan percentages at 37.6 percent Republicans, 33.3 percent Democrats and 29.2 percent independents. This indicates a degree of over-sampling of Democrats by eight percent, a plus four margin for Democrats as opposed to the plus four margin of Republicans among the likely voting electorate. The Gallup tracking poll has Democrats favoring Obama by a 90 percent to seven percent margin while Republicans surveyed in the poll favor Romney by a 91 percent to six percent margin. ARG found independent voters to support Romney by a 43 percent to 42 percent edge. If this data is weighted for the appropriate percentage of Republicans, Democrats and independents as shown by the Rasmussen data, the survey indicates a far larger and growing lead for Mitt Romney. Analysis of the data by those criteria would lead to a result showing Romney leading with a 49 percent to 44 percent margin over President Obama. That is exactly the opposite of what was officially reported earlier today by Gallup.</Msg><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1347759594305</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 21:39:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347761753395-92</Id><Topic><Title>Yes, CSCO splits 3 for 2 on December 16,</Title><Username>QcomMan</Username><Timestamp>881347247000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 1997-12-05 13:40:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK nope though</Msg><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1347761753395</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 22:15:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347761860598-93</Id><Topic><Title>I NOW URGE EVERYONE I KNOW TO VOTE ROMNEY/RYAN IN NOVEMBER</Title><Username>rationalthoughtll</Username><Timestamp>1347752473961</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 19:41:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so you DO have some brains after all eh?</Msg><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1347761860598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 22:17:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347762220592-94</Id><Title>OBAMA has NOT protected Our Embassies and Ambassadors!</Title><Msg>He is one incompetent GOOF UP!
