"Our Christian tradition teaches that we are to treat the poor with dignity and to prioritize the poor in our policies as a society," the organization said in a press release on Thursday. "At a time when millions are struggling financially, it is degrading to talk about the 'dependency' of people hurting in this economy, as Gov. Romney did recently." “Political leaders would not talk about the poor in demeaning ways or cut job training programs if they spent more time with the people they are affecting with their policies" FAN's criticism, however, goes beyond the Romney campaign's rhetoric on welfare by condemning cuts to Pell Grants, Medicaid and Head Start programs put forth in the budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and supported by Romney. “With the political conversation now on ensuring that low-income people are working, the most blatant affront is that the Romney-Ryan Budget actually cuts job training programs for low-income people,” FAN Executive Director Patrick Carolan said in a statement. NETWORK, a Catholic social justice advocacy group, has supported the national "Nuns On A Bus" tour, which is aimed at highlighting the negative effects of Ryan's proposed cuts, and invited Romney to spend a day with Catholic nuns helping the poor in their communities. In April, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote a series of letters to congressional lawmakers criticizing the Ryan budget, saying that fair budget solutions "must require shared sacrifice by all, including raising adequate revenues, eliminating unnecessary military and other spending, and fairly addressing the long-term costs of health insurance and retirement programs." "The House-passed budget resolution," the Bishops said in the letter, "fails to meet these moral criteria."</Msg><Username>rhonda_evilstein</Username><Timestamp>1344620436917</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 13:40:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344620494175-75</Id><Topic><Title>BUSH HAS ADMITTED DOING COCAINE</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1344612823439</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 11:33:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you're just a gentile what do you know?</Msg><Username>rhonda_evilstein</Username><Timestamp>1344620494175</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 13:41:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344621231473-76</Id><Title>Who let the dog out?</Title><Msg>CSCO... what a dog.</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1344621231473</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 13:53:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344624655553-77</Id><Topic><Title>CNN Poll Obama +7 FAUX news poll Obama +9</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344618378238</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 13:06:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no cherrypicking, these are todays polls, they are the most recent polls, Mitt has to throw a hail mary pass or he has no chance</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344624655553</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 14:50:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344624820636-78</Id><Title>Lemons and boats.

This matters, because Huntsman is a longtime backer of Romney — he has long been close to Romney; he supported his early campaigns; he was the national finance chairman of Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign; and he has raised a lot of money for him over the years. (He backed his own son in the latest GOP primary.) “I feel very badly that Mitt won’t release his taxes and won’t be fair with the American people,” Huntsman told me. In a reference to Romney’s father, who pioneered the release of returns as a presidential candidate, Huntsman said: “I loved George. He always said, pay your taxes for at least 10 or 12 years.” “Mr. Romney ought to square with the American people and release his taxes like any other candidate,” Huntsman said. “I’ve supported Mitt all along. I wish him well. But I do think he should release his income taxes.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344626841463</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 15:27:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344627270332-85</Id><Topic><Title>Huntsman Sr. says Mitt release your taxes</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344626841463</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 15:27:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And if Romney did release them, you would then start bashing him for " caving " as the first sentence of your post suggests.

The poll showed a notable drop in Romney's favorability, with 46% viewing him favorably and 45% unfavorably, as compared with a 52%-40% division in July. Obama's favorability had risen slightly, to 54%-42% from 52%-46% the month before.
