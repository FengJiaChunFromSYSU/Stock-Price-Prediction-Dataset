JP Morgan comes out today and didn't even have a buy rating on Cisco. They downgrade from neutral to under weight. So these Bozos go from neutral to under weight when practically all the street has an outperform rating. If anyone pays attention this is what happened last quarter, Cisco had a nice run, we got an upgrade from Goldman, then 2 weeks before earning we get a downgrade from some Bozo and the stock FALLS all the way into earnings. Cisco BEATS and climbs from $17 to where it is today, $21.00. Gotta love how these boys in the Casino get away with their legalized criminal activity.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1358422262128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 06:31:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358423664477-8</Id><Topic><Title>Let the Cisco games begin</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1358422262128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 06:31:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree.

A lot of volume pushed it down from the close of $21.03 to $20.96 for no apparent reason. How does a firm like JP Morgan justify a neutral rating which MISSED the entire runup from $17 and then downgrade to Under Weight when EVERYONE else is positive. Same thing happened last quarter, anaylsts UPGRADED based on channel checks and then some Bozo downgrades the week in front of earnings and is 100% wrong. Shareholders suffered and these guys just walked away. Interesting that this downgrade is 1 day in front of option expiration.

"Despite refocusing on its core businesses, streamlining its operations and prioritizing margins and earnings over revenue growth, we believe positive investor sentiment and Cisco's shares have gotten ahead of themselves," JPM says.

One of NASDAQ's best performers, Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) [Full Research Report][1] is considering the development of a personal cloud storage to offer in the global market. With new companies competing with Cisco in various areas of the communication network business, Cisco recently introduced "Videoscape Unity," a video services delivery platform that is designed to redefine video entertainment. This new platform boasts of an intuitive and synchronized multiscreen video screening that allows the consumers to play back their favorite shows and programs. Through a multiscreen cloud digital video recorder (DVR), consumers can access their records on any screen - no matter where they are. The Sky's the Limit In a study conducted by Forrester Research, the number of Americans who are subscribed to personal cloud is expected to increase by 400%, equating to 196 million people over the next five years. The report showed that 97 million of the expected personal cloud subscribers are willing to pay for cloud services. With Cisco's beyond industry average performance in the Q4 of 2012 and the opening of 2013, adding personal cloud storage in their existing portfolio may significantly ramp up the company's daily trading volume of 29.5 million, as of this writing. Analysts and investors are obviously bullish about the company as they see more developments in its impressive portfolio. In related news, Cisco announced its partnership with AT&amp;T Digital Life to produce an all-digital, wireless-based home security and automation service that has been certified by Underwriters Laboratories. This first-of-its-kind security program can be accessed by homeowners through their smartphones or tablets. According to reports, Cisco is targeting eight markets in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2013, and as much as 50 more markets, thereafter. Google Positioning into the Industry Keeping an eye on the industry, Cisco needs to worry about Google's latest move to sell Motorola Home cable set-top box to Arris Group. This business deal is seen to be a forming alliance between Google and Arris, as Google holds a 7.85% stake already. William Blair and R.W. Baird both upgraded Cisco to "outperform" from "market perform" and "neutral" status as its shares gained 1.66 percent, trading at $20.82 on Monday. Cisco is again on the green today as it closed at $20.98 per share with a market cap of $111.39 billion. The company recovered with an advance of 38% increase from its decline during the Q3 of 2012.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1358431131160</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 08:58:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358431260054-44</Id><Topic><Title>JPM downgrade?</Title><Username>sameveryman</Username><Timestamp>1358430647940</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 08:50:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NO.

Obama's gun measures face a tough road in Congress Jan 17, 11:09 AM (ET) By ERICA WERNER WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama's sweeping gun-control package faces an uncertain future on Capitol Hill, where majority House Republicans are rejecting his proposals while the president's allies in the Democratic-controlled Senate are stopping well short of pledging immediate action. The fate of his plan could ultimately hinge on a handful of moderate Democratic senators. Although they are unlikely to endorse the president's call for banning assault weapons, they might go along with other proposals, such as requiring universal background checks on gun purchases. Several of these senators responded warily after Obama unveiled his proposals Wednesday with the challenge that "Congress must act soon." "I will look closely at all proposals on the table, but we must use common sense and respect our Constitution," said Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. Tester told the Missoulian newspaper in his home state recently that he supports background checks but doesn't think an assault weapons ban would have stopped the shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., where a gunman massacred 20 children and six adults before turning the gun on himself. Obama's proposals came a month after the shootings in Newtown, which he has called the worst day of his presidency. His announcements capped a swift and wide-ranging effort, led by Vice President Joe Biden, to respond to the deaths. The $500 million plan marks the most comprehensive effort to tighten gun laws in nearly two decades. It also sets up a tough political fight with Congress as Obama starts his second term needing Republican support to meet three looming fiscal deadlines and pass comprehensive immigration reform. The White House strategy for pressing Congress centers on building public support for the president's measures. "There's only one voice powerful enough to make this happen: yours," Obama wrote in an op-ed Thursday in The Connecticut Post. The president is also expected to travel around the county pitching for his proposals and could activate his still-operational campaign organization, Organizing for America, to fight for the plan as well. Campaign manager Jim Messina sent an email to Obama supporters Thursday urging them to sign a petition backing the president's proposals and promising "more soon" from the organization. Obama, seeking to sidestep some congressional opposition, also signed 23 executive actions Wednesday, including orders to make more federal data available for background checks and end a freeze on government research on gun violence. But he acknowledged that the steps he took on his own would have less impact than the broad measures requiring approval from Capitol Hill. He is also calling for limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds or less. "To make a real and lasting difference, Congress, too, must act," Obama said. The question now is how and whether that happens. House GOP leaders have made clear they'll wait for the Senate to act first, since they see no need to move on the contentious topic if it doesn't. "House committees of jurisdiction will review these recommendations. And if the Senate passes a bill, we will also take a look at that," said Michael Steel, spokesman to House Speaker John Boehner. Many rank-and-file Republicans scorched Obama's proposal. "The right to bear arms is a right, despite President Obama's disdain for the Second Amendment," said Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan. Senators are expected to begin discussions on how to proceed when they return to Washington next week from a congressional recess, according to a Democratic leadership aide who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They could end up breaking the president's proposals into individual pieces, with votes possibly starting next month. The argument went trans-Atlantic Thursday when Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who is leaving the administration, talked to U.S. troops in Europe. "Who the hell needs armor-piercing bullets except you guys in battle?" Panetta told the soldiers at the U.S. Army Garrison Vicenza in northern Italy. "For the life of me, I don't know why the hell people have to have assault weapons." Panetta, who said he believes in the Second Amendment and has been a longtime duck hunter, was asked about the issue by a soldier who wanted to know what steps the Obama administration was going to take to deal with attacks in schools that "don't have to do with tearing apart our Second Amendment." Known for his often blunt and colorful language, Panetta added that things can be done to protect children "so that the nuts that are out there won't use these kinds of weapons to wipe them out." While the assault weapons ban is seen as having little if any chance of passage, support may coalesce behind requiring universal background checks, which is a top priority for advocacy groups that see it as the most important step to curbing gun crimes. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence says 40 percent of gun sales are conducted with no criminal background checks, such as in some instances at gun shows or by private sellers over the Internet. Obama would seek to require checks for all sales. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., already has sponsored a bill to require universal background checks that the Senate could take up, while Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., has legislation banning ammunition magazines with more than 10 rounds. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., a gun-rights backer who's been supported by the National Rifle Association in the past, responded cautiously, saying he was committed to ensuring the Senate considers legislation on gun violence early this year. He didn't endorse any of Obama's proposals. Despite the uncertainty on Capitol Hill and opposition from the powerful NRA, outside groups are encouraged by polling showing public support for changes to the law. They intend to try to harness that sentiment to pressure lawmakers. A lopsided 84 percent of Americans back broader background checks, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans want stricter gun laws, the same poll showed, with majorities favoring a nationwide ban on military-style weapons. "Now it's up to us," said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign. He said his group would be working "to bring that voice to bear in this process, because without that it's not going to happen."</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358441429114</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 11:50:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358441636069-85</Id><Topic><Title>Bush attorney general disappoints Hannity: Obama’s executive orders are legal</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1358441164137</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 11:46:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't that a shame,poor Hannity.Did he ever get waterboarded for charity during the corrupt Bush administration when he said he would,or was he just blowing smoke as he always does?</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358441636069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 11:53:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358441712362-86</Id><Topic><Title>Two Term President Barry Obama!!!</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1358439289107</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 11:14:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your freely elected LEADER BY A LANDSLIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358441712362</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 11:55:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358442092706-87</Id><Topic><Title>Dont be jealous!!!!</Title><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1358437224024</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 10:40:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why does Junior always scurry away like a cockroach after he sticks his foot in his mouth?LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL HILARIOUS!!!!!</Msg><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1358442092706</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 12:01:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358442362453-88</Id><Topic><Title>Dont be jealous!!!!</Title><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1358437224024</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 10:40:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Worked again!!!!!

Read: NRA ad brings Obama kids into gun debate; White House fights back In the 35-second spot, Obama is called an “elite hypocrite” for dismissing the idea of adding armed guards to schools while accepting Secret Service protection for his girls. “Are the president’s kids more important than yours?” the narrator asks at the beginning of the spot. “Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school?” The White House called the ad “repugnant and cowardly” and criticized the organization for using the president’s children as “pawns in a political fight.” Advertising executive Donny Deutsch called the ad “disgusting” for inserting the president’s children into the issue. “This is a disgusting, vulgar ad,” he said. Watch: Obama prepares for fight over gun proposals The video also features a picture of NBC “Meet the Press” host David Gregory, whom Keene grouped as among those “who have attacked the NRA and the very idea of school security.” NBC News released a statement Wednesday, saying it “firmly objects to the use of our journalists in any political ad. David Gregory's role as moderator of 'Meet the Press' is to ask tough questions of guests representing all sides of the issues." Also Wednesday, Obama unveiled an ambitious gun control program that includes numerous congressional programs and 23 executive actions. Among them: mandatory background checks for anyone who wants to buy a gun, including individuals who purchase weapons from a private seller. Keene expressed concern over how such a rule would be fairly enforced. “It becomes more problematic when you talk about the farmer who buys a new shotgun and sells his old one to his neighbor over the fence, or the father who sells to the son or all those kinds of things,” Keene said Thursday. “The laws need to be certain. And they need to fair and fairly enforced.” Another proposal Keene criticized was the effort to limit the size of ammunition magazines. “This all sort of makes you feel good, but in fact it doesn’t do much,” Keene said. “If you are out there, and if you’re crazy, and if you’ve got a gun like this and if you’re going to shoot people with it, it takes a second or so to change the magazine.”</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358445175646</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 12:52:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358445259414-107</Id><Title>LOOK FOR ORETARDED TO SEND TROOPS INTO ALGERIA NOW</Title><Msg>after all, he's got to try and prove he's a "big man" and competent.

The Commerce Department said Thursday that builders broke ground on houses and apartments last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 954,000. That's 12.1 percent higher than November's annual rate. And it is nearly double the recession low reached in April 2009. Construction increased last month for both single-family homes and apartments. And the pace in which builders requested permits to start more homes ticked up to a 4 1/2 year high. For the year, builders started work on 780,000 homes. That's still roughly half of the annual number of starts consistent with healthier markets. But it is an increase of 28.1 percent from 2011. And it is the most since 2008 - shortly after the housing market began to collapse in late 2006 and 2007. Steady hiring, record-low mortgage rates and a tight supply of new and previously occupied homes available for sale have helped boost sales and prices in most markets. That has persuaded builders to start more homes, which adds to economic growth and hiring. "There is no denying that the housing market recovery is solidifying, and we expect construction activity to ramp up to the 1 million annualized threshold by the end of this year," said Michael Dolega, an economist with TD Economics, in a note to clients. Dolega said the gains in home building helped boost construction hiring in December by 30,000 jobs - the most in 15 months. He predicts the construction industry could add half a million jobs in 2013. In December, the pace of single-family home construction, which makes up two-thirds of the market, increased 8 percent. While that's well below healthy levels, single-family housing starts are now 75 percent higher than the recession low reached in March 2009. Apartment construction, which is more volatile, surged 23 percent last month. It is now back to pre-recession levels. Applications for building permits, a sign of future construction, inched up to a rate of 903,000 - the highest level since July 2008. "The strong rise in single-family starts is a clear indication of builder confidence in the sales outlook," said Pierre Ellis, an economist at Decision Economics, in a note to clients. Confidence among homebuilders held steady in January at the highest level in nearly seven years. But builders are feeling slightly less optimistic about their prospects for sales over the next six months, according to a survey released Wednesday. In November, sales of previously occupied homes rose to their highest level in three years, while new-home sales reached a 2 1/2-year high. Those factors have helped make homebuilders more confident and spurred new home construction. But homebuilders' are still warily watching the current standoff in Washington between President Barack Obama and Congress over several approaching budget deadlines, including the need to boost the nation's $16.4 trillion borrowing limit. Though new homes represent less than 20 percent of the housing sales market, they have an outsize impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in tax revenue, according to data from the homebuilders association.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358451544621</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 14:39:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358451870807-151</Id><Title>As a gay white man I have no problem admitting that blacks are superior to whites.

In the Jim Crow South there was something called the "race wage," or the "social wage" (as W.E.B. Dubois called it) where racial segregation allowed lower-income whites to feel superior and more important than African-Americans even though their economic conditions were not all that different. Today, the "gun wage" might give some white people who are facing a scary and uncertain economic future a sense of holding onto an artificially higher status. At least they still have their guns, while they observe around them a "threatening" number of immigrants, Latinos, blacks, women, and young people who are finding their political voice. This phenomenon might also explain the totally irrational hatred of Obama we've seen from the right in this country; not only because he's black, but because he embodies everything they fear about a changing American society. And now he wants to "take away" their guns! Obama has governed as a Rockefeller Republican yet they see him as a Kenyan Mau Mau, Socialist, radical. Like the old Jim Crow "race wage" the "gun wage" allows lower middle-class white men to feel a little less besieged by immigrants, feminists, blacks and others. They hug their guns to their chests as the great equalizers postponing their declining social status, while they sense the inexorable demographic shift toward becoming a minority in the United States. All the calls we hear for "taking back" the "real America," like Bill O'Reilly lamenting on election night the loss of "traditional America," the gun wage compensates them for their loss in social rank. Many of these beleaguered white men hold fantasies, like radio nut-jock Alex Jones, of picking up the gun to fight a tyrannical central government. Good luck with that.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358459761777</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:56:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358459801785-191</Id><Topic><Title>If the NRA is trying to count Secret Service protection for Obama’s children as part of that force of armed guards, that’s even more ridiculous.
