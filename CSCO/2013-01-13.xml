By TOM HARVEY | The Salt Lake Tribune First Published Jan 11 2013 12:25 pm • Last Updated Jan 12 2013 11:38 am A federal court hearing Friday in which St. George businessman Jeremy Johnson was to admit guilt to two felony charges ended when prosecutors balked at placing a list of people into the record that Johnson said prosecutors had promised not to indict if he entered a guilty plea. Included on that list were Johnson family members, business associates, friends — and Utah Attorney General John Swallow. Johnson granted The Salt Lake Tribune access to emails, documents and other records that appear to support what Johnson said was an effort in 2010 initiated by Swallow, then chief deputy attorney general, to enlist U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to stifle a federal investigation into his I Works online marketing company. While Johnson said he believed Swallow had done wrong, he still wanted to protect Swallow from possible prosecution. Johnson said a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against himself and I Works plus a criminal charge had ruined his life and he did not wish the same fate on Swallow. In an interview before the hearing, Johnson said he did not believe he was guilty of the bank fraud and money-laundering charges contained in the plea agreement. But he said Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Ward, the lead prosecutor in his case, had threatened to indict family members, friends and others if he did not plead guilty. On Friday, Johnson told the judge, "Mr. Ward said that they would arrest my mom or my wife, my father-in-law but this agreement will make sure that they don’t." U.S. Attorney for Utah David Barlow told reporters after the hearing there had been no threats. Ward confirmed several times in court that the government would not investigate or arrest anyone else connected to the I Works investigation as part of the plea deal. "We have committed there will not be other further indictments … period," Ward said. But then Johnson produced the list of names, and U.S. District Judge David Nuffer asked whether it should be entered into the official record. That prompted a hurried huddle involving Ward, Barlow and other attorneys.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358095799584</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 11:49:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358096182027-15</Id><Topic><Title>A Republican Utah business man charged with fraud is claiming he paid Harry Reid $600,000 to make the case go away.</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1358092358008</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 10:52:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nuffer called a recess and asked the two sides to reach an agreement. Prosecutors huddled in a hall outside the courtroom, conferring and apparently going over the list. Then the parties met in a jury room behind closed doors. After a lengthy period, the two sides emerged and said they had not reached an agreement. Ward said as a result, prosecutors would seek an additional indictment, and another hearing was scheduled for February to set a trial date for Johnson. Johnson, his company I Works and business associates were sued by the FTC in December 2010, then he was arrested on a single mail fraud charge in June 2011.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358096182027</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 11:56:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358096552697-16</Id><Topic><Title>A Republican Utah business man charged with fraud is claiming he paid Harry Reid $600,000 to make the case go away.</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1358092358008</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 10:52:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Harry Weed must go.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1358096552697</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 12:02:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358096700853-17</Id><Topic><Title>Bubba's new cellmate</Title><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1358088271129</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 09:44:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They should settle this with a duel.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1358096700853</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 12:05:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358096802015-18</Id><Topic><Title>A Republican Utah business man charged with fraud is claiming he paid Harry Reid $600,000 to make the case go away.</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1358092358008</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 10:52:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Banjobrain=IQ=45</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358096802015</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 12:06:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358098456264-19</Id><Topic><Title>Bubba's new cellmate</Title><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1358088271129</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 09:44:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior---before saying people make things up,Google " Harry Reid land deals".

About 3 million fewer uninsured people will gain health coverage because of last month's Supreme Court ruling granting states more leeway, and that will cut the federal costs by $84 billion, the Congressional Budget Office said in the biggest changes from earlier estimates. Republicans have insisted that "Obamacare" will actually raise deficits — by "trillions," according to presidential candidate Mitt Romney. But that's not so, the budget office said. The office gave no updated estimate for total deficit reductions from the law, approved by Congress and signed by Obama in 2010. But it did estimate that Republican legislation to repeal the overhaul — passed recently by the House — would itself boost the deficit by $109 billion from 2013 to 2022. "Repealing the (health care law) will lead to an increase in budget deficits over the coming decade, though a smaller one than previously reported," budget office director Douglas Elmendorf said in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The law's mix of spending cuts and tax increases would more than offset new spending to cover uninsured people, Elmendorf explained. Tuesday's budget projections were the first since the Supreme Court upheld most of the law last month but gave states the option of rejecting a planned expansion of Medicaid for their low-income residents. As a consequence, the budget office said the law will cover fewer uninsured people. Thirty million uninsured people will be covered by 2022, or about 3 million fewer than projected this spring before the court ruling, the report said. As a result, taxpayers will save about $84 billion from 2012 to 2022. That brings the total cost of expanding coverage down to $1.2 trillion, from about $1.3 trillion in the previous estimate. The Congressional Budget Office has consistently projected that Obama's overhaul will reduce the deficit, although previous estimates aren't strictly comparable with Tuesday's report because of changes in the law and other factors. At the time it was approved in 2010, CBO estimated the law would reduce the deficit by $143 billion from 2010 to 2019. And CBO estimated that last year's Republican repeal legislation would increase deficits by $210 billion from 2010 to 2021. That may sound like a lot of money, but it's actually a hair-thin margin at a time when federal deficits are expected to average around $1 trillion a year for the foreseeable future. When the law is fully in effect, 92 percent of citizens and legal residents are estimated to have coverage, as compared to 81 percent now. Democrats hailed Tuesday's estimates as vindication for the president. "This confirms what we've been saying all along: the Affordable Care Act saves lots of money," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Actually, the government will spend more. It just won't go onto the national credit card because the health care law will be paid for with a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. GOP leaders sought to shift attention from claims about the deficit and focused instead on the additional spending. "What we know from today's CBO report ... is that the new health care law is dramatically increasing health care spending and costs," said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Republicans said they remain unswervingly committed to repealing what they dismiss as "Obamacare." When combined with other budget-cutting measures, GOP leaders say that repeal will ultimately reduce deficits. Romney says if elected he will begin to dismantle the law his first day in office. Medicaid has been one big question hanging over the future of Obama's law since the Supreme Court ruled. Some GOP-led states, such as Texas and Florida, say they will not go forward with the expansion. Others are uncommitted, awaiting the voters' verdict on Obama in November. Although the federal government would bear all of the initial cost of that expansion, many states would have to open their Medicaid programs to low-income childless adults for the first time. CBO analysts did not try to predict which specific states would jump in and which would turn down the Medicaid expansion. Instead, they assumed that many states would eventually cut deals with the federal government to expand their programs to some degree. As a result, the budget office estimates that more than 80 percent of the low-income uninsured people eligible under the law live in states that partially or fully expand their programs. The big coverage expansion under the law doesn't start until 2014, with middle-class uninsured people signing up for subsidized private plans and more low-income people picked up through Medicaid.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358099496205</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 12:51:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358100554119-21</Id><Topic><Title>Budget office: Obama's health law reduces deficit</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358099496205</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 12:51:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" The law's mix of spending cuts and tax increases " O'Liar said there were NO TAX INCREASES in Obamacare.
