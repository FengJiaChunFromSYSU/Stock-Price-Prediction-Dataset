It is rather nippy As forecasters predict ice, snow, darkness and blade-like freezing winds that can actually slice your face off, the UN declared the country uninhabitable and began evacuation procedures. A UN spokesman said: “We just want to get as many people out alive as possible, then we’ll figure out distributing them across pleasanter places like Spain. “The weather is obviously a huge concern but Christmas adverts, middle class angst and the presence of Ed Balls’ face also make Britain a humanitarian crisis. “We’ll be sending helicopters in about a week, keep watching during the X Factor ad breaks for details of where to rendezvous. Maximum two pieces of hand luggage each. “In the meantime, just stay inside. Do not attempt to leave the house or even look out of the window, it’s far too psychologically damaging.” Asked why the UN was not taking similar action in Scotland, the spokesman said: “The Scots thrive on misery.

Now investors are going after the banks for fraud. We knew this would happen sooner or later: The investors who got scammed by the big banks over mortgage securities want their pound of flesh. I wonder how they're going to weasel out of this one? Will they buy themselves some more judges? Stay tuned: According to a New York Times report, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo andCitigroup, among others, have been sued by a full spectrum of plaintiffs in connection with more than $1 trillion worth of mortgage securities. Investors have gone to court seeking to have the banks buy back the bum securities, while prosecutors are accusing the banks of fraud and SEC regulators claim they deceived investors about the failed instruments. Should the dominant forces on Wall Street lose all of the litigation in a worst case scenario, it could cost them as much as $300 billion. One of the major pending lawsuits is a $200 billion case filed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency that argues the banks tricked mortgage financiers into buying faulty securities. So far, banks have settled only a few cases against them -- already paying out billions of dollars to repurchase bad securities -- and costs for future settlements and judgments are expected to overshadow what the institutions have spent thus far, according to the Timesreport. Among the major banks involved, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup are four of the top five political contributors from the commercial banks industry, and together with others in the financial sector played a major role in the 2012 election cycle. Giving mostly to Republicans, the four banks combined to spend more than $10 million in contributions larger than $200. They were also all among GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's top ten contributors in this year's race.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355754599487</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 09:29:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355754814977-22</Id><Title>sick people kill people</Title><Msg>not guns...if those school attendants had AR's then they could have saved lives. but you dont want honest responsible people to defend themselves against crazys who get illegal guns. just like the war on drugs, it does not work. people will get them and those people are not the people who should have them. liberals want to unarm americans and give criminals more power.

By Susie Madrak This first ran in January 2011. First of all, this isn't my idea. It's my oldest son's, and he told me about it a few years ago when he was trying to figure out a way he could make money. (Did I mention the kid is a genius? If you use this idea, you owe him.) He said it made more sense to sidestep the entire gun control controversy and instead pass state laws that require anyone who owns a gun to carry insurance. If they have risk factors (like teenagers in the house), their rates go up. If one of their kids sneaks a gun out of the house and gets caught, or uses it to commit a crime, the insurance gets canceled for some meaningful period of time -- say, 10 years. And if someone steals your gun and you don't report it in a 24-hour window of you finding out, your insurance is suspended for a long time. If you have a rifle and it's only used for hunting, low rates. If you have a Glock and you carry it in an open-carry town or state, your rates will be very high -- because odds are so much higher that innocent bystanders may get caught in a shootout. The more training and safety classes you take, the cheaper the premium. If you've ever been convicted of domestic abuse or are the target of a protection order, you are not eligible for insurance. Homeowners could be required to carry gun insurance as long as they're still paying on a mortgage, because a gun accident or misuse could result in a large legal judgment against the house. Oh yeah, and you have to buy coverage for each gun you own. I think it has real possibilities. What do you think?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355755401889</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 09:43:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355755984002-24</Id><Title>how many terrorist attacks</Title><Msg>under obama...egads. obama is home growing terrorism now even our children are not safe.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355755984002</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 09:53:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355756812364-25</Id><Topic><Title>O'bama murders 4 Americans in Benghazi</Title><Username>ivanhoeofoloxly</Username><Timestamp>1355716360453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:52:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You ran around being patriotic and wanting to kill all Muslims , this is just hate and your kind is part of the problem , why those kids were slaughtered in Conn, Colorado and all the other violent attacks, yes terrorism is homegrown and right beneath our nose, its people like you that are the enemy within, you need Jesus and he is not the one that is lost .

The seller hasn't been arrested or charged or even thought about being charged now has he? Nor the buyer.

(Reuters) - A pro-gun U.S. lawmaker on Monday called on Congress and the gun industry to come together on a "sensible, reasonable approach" to curbing high-powered, assault weapons like those used in the Connecticut school shooting last week. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who has earned top marks from the gun industry, said all ideas should be open for discussion after the violence on Friday that killed 20 children aged 6 and 7. Manchin, a hunter and member of the National Rifle Association, said the availability of such high-powered weapons does not make sense and called on the gun lobby group to cooperate with a reform of the nation's gun laws. The NRA has been an influential force against limiting gun sales and has succeeded in loosening restrictions on some high-powered combat weapons originally intended for military use. "We've got to sit down. I ask all my friends at NRA -- and I'm a proud NRA member and always have been -- we need to sit down and move this dialogue to a sensible, reasonable approach to fixing it," he told MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355762214203</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 11:36:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355762216347-47</Id><Topic><Title>Armed ex military combat vets</Title><Username>eagle1776321</Username><Timestamp>1355761703310</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 11:28:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Solves a few problems.

Depardieu, 63, star of films including Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac, is furious at French President Francois Hollande for several of his policies aimed at taking money away from the rich, including a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent. The actor is now set to move to Belgium after putting his £40million mansion on Paris's Left Bank up for sale. Leaving: French actor Gerard Depardieu has put his Paris mansion up for sale and will leave France in protest at tax hikes imposed by the government In an open letter to prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault today, Mr Depardieu said: ‘I am leaving because you consider that success, creation, talent, anything different, must be punished.’ Mr Depardieu said he has paid 85 per cent of his income to the Government this year, and estimated that he had paid more than £130 million in total since he started work on leaving school aged 14. New financial measures: French President Francois Hollande has imposed a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent Mr Ayrault had earlier branded Mr Depardieu ‘pathetic’ and ‘unpatriotic’, but the actor wrote in an open letter in the Journal de Dimanche: ‘Who are you to judge me like this, Mr Ayrault? I ask you, who are you? 'Despite my excesses, my appetite and my love of life, I am a free man. ‘I am not asking to be approved of, but I could at least be respected. All of those who have left France have not been insulted as I have been. ‘At no time have I failed in my duties. The historic films in which I took part bear witness to my love of France and its history.’ The actor is not the first wealthy French resident to signal their intention to leave since Mr Hollande came to power back in May. Bernard Arnault, chief executive of the luxury goods group LVMH and France’s richest man, is among those who have applied for Belgian residency, although the billionaire denies it is for tax reasons. It came as an Ifop poll released in France at the weekend put Mr Hollande’s public approval rating at just 37 per cent, with Mr Ayrault on 35 per cent. MailOnline reported last week how Depardieu had moved to a new 'tax exile' mansion just 800 yards from the French border in Belgium. The actor's lavish home in the village of Nechin - on a street known as Millionaire's Row - is less than two minutes drive from the French town of Roubaix. The funny thing is that in the USA this Tax The Rich, will only pay for 2 days of government expenditures, just 2 days. This is what is called demagoguery, which is natural speech for Democrats.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1355767655721</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 13:07:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355767774545-94</Id><Title>Who the NRA supports TERRORISTS</Title><Msg>The NRA has strongly opposed legislation to prohibit the sale of guns to people on the federal government's terrorist watch list.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said Sunday that she plans to introduce an assault weapons ban bill on the first day of the new Congress. "I'm going to introduce in the Senate, and the same bill will be introduced in the House -- a bill to ban assault weapons," Feinstein said on NBC's "Meet the Press." The shocking murder of 26 children and adults in Newtown, Conn., on Friday has sparked a national discussion on gun control, with mostly Democratic legislators saying laws need to be tightened. President Bill Clinton signed an assault weapons ban into law in 1994, but the measure expired a decade later. Democrats have tried several times since then to renew the ban, without success.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355768424263</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 13:20:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355768469121-102</Id><Topic><Title>HEY LIBSTOOGES, GOOGLE AMMOLAND'S PHOTO CHUCKY SCHUMER FIRING</Title><Username>gregu456</Username><Timestamp>1355768063689</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 13:14:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Remember Rosie ODonnell ranting about ALL guns.Then we found out she was paying an armed bodyguard for her own protection.

BEIRUT - Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem told UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Palestinians should not offer "shelter or assistance to terrorist groups" in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, state television said on Monday. His comments came after Ban's spokesman said the secretary-general was concerned at reports of an air strike by President Bashar Assad's forces on Yarmouk on Sunday in which activists said 25 people were killed. Syrian jets bombed the camp on Sunday killing at least 25 people. Syrian troops backed by tanks gathered on Monday outside Yarmouk, scene of clashes between Palestinians loyal to Assad and rebels supported by Palestinian fighters, activists said. Moualem said Palestinians should work to expel "terrorists" - the label authorities give to anti-Assad rebels. Syrian troops backed by tanks gathered outside the Palestinian Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus on Monday, the scene of clashes between Palestinians loyal to President Bashar Assad and rebels supported by Palestinian fighters, activists said. Clashes inside the camp continued on Monday with thousands of people fleeing to nearby suburbs. Yarmouk, in southern Damascus, falls inside a swath of territory that stretches from the east to the southwest of the Syrian capital where Assad's forces have been trying to push back rebels from the gates of his power base for several weeks. Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby on Monday urged all sides in the conflict to protect the Palestinians and to keep them out of the fighting. Syria hosts more than 500,000 Palestinian refugees, most of them in Yarmouk. Assad's government and Syrian rebels have enlisted and armed Palestinians refugees during the 21-month uprising, which has escalated into a civil war. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWRA) also said in a statement Monday that it is following the events in the Palestinian camp with "extreme concern," warning that all parties involved in the conflict must "respect their [Palestinian] neutrality, official Palestinian News Agency WAFA reported. Heavy fighting broke out 14 days ago between Palestinians loyal to Assad and Syrian rebels, together with a brigade of Palestinian fighters known as Liwaa al-Asifah (Storm Brigade). The fighting intensified on Saturday with rebels gaining ground inside the camp, forcing Ahmed Jibril, a veteran leader of a Damascus-based Palestinian faction that back Assad to leave the capital with his son. Jibril's PFLP-GC has maintained strong ties to Assad throughout the uprising, unlike the Islamist Hamas movement whose Damascus-based officials - including leader-in-exile Khaled Mashaal - quietly pulled out of Syria as the mainly Sunni Muslim revolt against Assad gained momentum.

On February 27, 1993, the Waco Tribune-Herald began the “Sinful Messiah” series of articles. It began, "If you are a Branch Davidian, Christ lives on a threadbare piece of land 10 miles east of here called Mount Carmel. He has dimples, claims a ninth-grade education, married his legal wife when she was 14, enjoys a beer now and then, plays a mean guitar, reportedly packs a 9mm Glock and keeps an arsenal of military assault rifles, and willingly admits that he is a sinner without equal." The article alleged that Koresh had physically abused children in the compound and had taken multiple underage brides amounting to statutory rape. Koresh was also said to advocate polygamy for himself and declared himself married to several female residents of the small community. According to the paper, Koresh declared he was entitled to at least 140 wives, that he was entitled to claim any of the females in the group as his, that he had fathered at least a dozen children through the harem and that some of these mothers became brides as young as 12 or 13 years old.[18] In addition to allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct, Koresh and his followers were accused of stockpiling illegal weapons. In May 1992, Chief Deputy Daniel Weyenberg of the McLennan County Sheriff's Department called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) notifying that his office had been contacted by a local UPS representative. A UPS driver described a package that had broken open on delivery to the Branch Davidian residence, revealing firearms, inert grenade casings, and black powder.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355773245710</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:40:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355773383529-155</Id><Topic><Title>every NRA member needs to read this</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355766822420</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 12:53:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"dispicable" LOL you #$%$ crack me up</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355773383529</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:43:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355773444687-156</Id><Topic><Title>Liberal AG Janet Reno killed more in Waco, TX ...</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1355772744188</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:32:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If moral depravity justified killing, then both you and Junior would be executed.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355773444687</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:44:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355773451622-157</Id><Title>REAL QUESTION IS: WHY DO BLUE STATE LIBS CONTINUE TO KILL EACH OTHER?</Title><Msg>whether in Colo. theaters, OR malls or CT schools?

Shirley Phelps-Roper, a spokesperson for the group and, like most members of the organization, a relative of the group's founder, Fred Phelps, announced on Twitter on Saturday the group's plan "to sing praise to God for the glory of his work in executing his judgment." It is unclear when the group plans to protest, although a tweet from Margie Phelps implied that it would be during a vigil that will be attended by President Barack Obama on Sunday evening. Members of the Westboro Baptist Church say that America is being punished for its acceptance of gays and lesbians. In recent days, Phelps family members have sent tweets about the Connecticut shooting that have said "God sent the shooter."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355776780055</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 15:39:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355776807192-190</Id><Topic><Title>Did it really help?</Title><Username>redangel6666</Username><Timestamp>1355775989208</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 15:26:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CSCO options activity. 20k DEC and JAN options bought with $20 strike.

The one-time Florida congressman said the Sandy Hook tragedy hit particularly close to home, not only because he lives in Connecticut, but he has young children, one son has Asperberger's, as apparently did the gunman. While noting that he kept a 100% voting rating with the National Rifle Congress while in Congress, he did some soul-searching after the carnage in Connecticut. "Friday changed everything and it must change everything," Scarborough said somber, prepared remarks for the morning news show on Monday "Politicians can no longer be allowed to defend the status quo," he said. "They must instead be forced to defend our children. Parents can no longer take no for an answer from Washington when the topic turns to protecting our children." Scarborough linked gun violence in the United States to a "violent popular culture, a growing mental health crisis and the proliferation of combat-styled weapons."

Ltd., a Chinese maker of telecom gear whose U.S. base is in Plano, has laid off 100 people in the United States. A Huawei spokeswoman told Light Reading, a trade publication, that the job cuts were in the company’s network infrastructure group. Some 70 U.S. residents were affected, as were 30 expatriates, Light Reading reported. In a statement issued to Light Reading, Huawei said it “recently simplified and streamlined its organization to sustain a profitable infrastructure business in the U.S.” Huawei limited the job cuts “to best streamline the organization to allow the company to continue providing U.S. carrier customers with the best technology solutions while maintaining our cost structure,” the statement said. “Our long-term commitment to the U.S. infrastructure market and our U.S. carrier customers remains unchanged.” A Huawei spokesman said the Light Reading story and the company’s statement “capture” what transpired. He referred other questions, such as about where the job cuts occurred, to Huawei's statement.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1355787579427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 18:39:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355787745860-248</Id><Topic><Title>some more NRA child murders to remember</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355782625973</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 17:17:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To bad Obama and Dumb are exploiting these young victims to capitalize politically.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1355787745860</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 18:42:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355787975406-249</Id><Title>MOTHER HAS PHYCHO SON AND KEEPS GUNS IN THE HOUSE</Title><Msg>Her gene pool should of never reproduced...How many other Phychos are out there..Undesireables having more kids that will be future criminals.

Any adult in the school with some degree of small arms training could have done better than no one being available to confront the killer. Shooting a crazed killer in the back would be more preferable than allowing the slaughter to continue as it did.

Customs and Border Protection has asked for $2.4 million to replace "destroyed or damaged vehicles, including mobile X-Ray machines." The bill includes a $4 million repair job at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. ( I heard Obama got us out of the space race?) An additional $13 billion has also been added in to protect against future storms, a cost some Republican lawmakers say isn’t emergency-related and should be scaled back. Other sweeteners include $150 million for fisheries in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico, and $125 million for a Department of Agriculture program that would help Colorado cope with summer wildfires.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1355798734442</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 21:45:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355798847466-305</Id><Topic><Title>Dumb Dumb Ivan positions</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1355798365110</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 21:39:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nose permanently fixed to Obama's butt.
