What a sad surprise. The "main stream media" continues to ignore the reason we were lied into the war.....the commentators get lost in the "forest" of " the accuracy of the intelligence of the existence of weapons of mass destruction".......what about the the billions (trillions) of $ funneled by The Department Of Homeland Security thru no bid contracts to "friends and business associates" of VP Cheney et al. The major transfer of our "taxpayers' treasure" to these criminals, in my opinion, was the reason to go to War. All other "facts" were Red Herrings to distract us. I also strongly believe that The Department of Homeland Security itself was brought into existence to "centralize " the $$$ . Not because this would make the US "safer".......There has never been an accounting of how $$$ was dispersed.....And VP Cheney had his son-law(an attorney) appointed to an important position withing the agency at the beginning of the war. It is time to "connect the dots" America has spent over 3 trillion dollars on the Iraq war. That's enough money to pay 30 million Americans a 6 figure salary. We did this to prevent Iraq from building weapons that they had no intention of building. We have now lost more American lives in Iraq than we did on 9/11. And the Chimp is responsible for all three Afghanistan, 9.11 and Iraq.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1363254660314</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 05:51:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363262755761-4</Id><Topic><Title>YET ANOTHER HISTORIC ALL TIME HIGH ONT HE DOW FOR OUR GREAT PRESIDENT</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1363208401000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 17:00:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No matter how hard the Baggers to bring down the USA we are STILL making some fat cash.</Msg><Username>idiot_whisperer</Username><Timestamp>1363262755761</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 08:05:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363263452334-5</Id><Topic><Title>drstone gets thrown off the GE board again? him and his vensh_1 alias?</Title><Username>carey50fairy</Username><Timestamp>1363177402658</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 08:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He got banned from the GE board. Actually I believe that he was placed on ignore by people who actually have investments in GE. The schmuck is a total loser with only a palty Social Security check to do nothing with in his senior years but pay his IP provider so he can whine all day and night. In fact when I think about it now, the loser is probably in some state-run nursing home that probably has WiFi for their residents to keep them occupied other then playing in and smearing their own schiit on the walls.

The revelation is made in the authorized biography done by friends who knew the former president when he was an actor. One of them, Howard Fast, the writer, said Saturday that Reagan "was passionate" about enlisting with the American Communist party in 1938. "They thought he was a feather brain and turned him down," Fast told The Sunday Times. Reagan always portrayed himself as a former left-leaning Democrat who moved to the political right after seeing the communists in action in Hollywood. It now emerges that some of his closest friends were communists. "He felt if it was right for them, it was right for him," said Fast. In 1938, the 27-year-old actor announced he wanted to sign up. The party conducted an investigation, said Fast, and "word came back he was a flake … who couldn’t be trusted with a political opinion for more than 20 minutes." Fast said the party sent Reagan a delegation who "convinced him he could do more for the various causes that the party represented in Hollywood as an outsider, as a friend of the party, than as a member. "It took hours to talk him out of it." The former president’s flirtation with Marxism was an unlikely prelude to a political career that was largely spent battling the threat of Soviet communism. At the time, the United States was still in the grip of economic depression and many Hollywood actors were starved of work. According to Edmund Morris, the biographer, Reagan applied to become a member of the Californian branch of the American CP but was rejected by leading figures in the party.

Even Carter is glad this guy came along, so at least he knows he is no longer the worst president ever. Here is just a short list of Obama’s Failures: 1. Hawaii is in Asia 2. Passing on the keystone pipeline. 3. Touts a Green Energy Company as exemplary that fails a year later. 4. Using the Gulf Oil Spill to promote Green Energy – instead of cleaning it up. 5. Thinking the Tea Party is a passing fad – or that they are racists. 6. Pulling out of Iraq with no clear victory over insurgent forces. 7. Trying to re-write history through speeches – with inaccurate information (i.e. Statue of Liberty) 8. Getting a Nobel Prize for being the most ineffective President in the history of the United States, though some say it was for his pigment. 9. Putting all legislation on the Internet for five days before it comes to a vote. 10. Returning the bust of Churchill to the Brits. 11. Giving a collection of DVDs to the British PM. 12. Denying the notion of American Exceptionalism. 13. Promising to close Gitmo — failing to do so. 14. Securing the Olympics for Chicago in 2016. 15. Naming numerous Communists/Socialists/Progressives to his various Czar positions and then watching them scurry for cover when Beck begins to call them out, forcing them to resign. 16. Government races for NJ, VA and the Senate Seat in Mass. 17. The midterm elections, which Obama himself called a shellacking. 18. Prediction that stimulus would ensure that unemployment doesn’t exceed 8%. 19. Bowing to just about everybody. 20. Proposing amnesty for illegal aliens to increase the population of voters for Democrat elections. 21. He said, I have visited 57 states. Now there is just 1 left to visit. 22. Obama to Medvedev…give me space I will have more flexibility after my election.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363280393192</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 12:59:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363280426085-88</Id><Title>THE STIMULUS Obama wasted on Union thugs &amp; Big Bank crooks.</Title><Msg>THE STIMULUS Obama wasted on Union thugs &amp; Big Bank crooks.

Independent health care experts say the law has caused some insurance premiums to rise. As we wrote in October, the new law has caused about a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in health insurance premiums for employer-sponsored family plans because of requirements for increased benefits. Last year's premium increases cast even more doubt on another promise the president has made -- that the health care law would 'lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year.’”</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1363280462530</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 13:01:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363280493444-91</Id><Title>GREEN JOBS are another Obama utter failure.

Four deemed especially dangerous have been placed back in jail. The administration had claimed only a "few hundred immigrants" were released for budgetary reasons, challenging as inaccurate an Associated Press report that more than 2,000 immigrants had been released and that 3,000 more would be released this month. However, the director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, John Morton, testified Thursday that his agency released 2,228 illegal immigrants for what he called "solely budgetary reasons." Morton and other agency officials spoke during a hearing by a House appropriations subcommittee. He told lawmakers that the decision to release the immigrants was not discussed in advance with political appointees, including those in the White House and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. He said the pending automatic cuts known as sequestration was "driving in the background." "We were trying to live within the budget that Congress had provided us," Morton told lawmakers. "This was not a White House call. I take full responsibility." The subcommittee chairman, Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, pressed Morton about the agency's claims that immigrants were routinely released, and Morton acknowledged that the release of more than 2,000 immigrants was not routine. "At the time this release started, the president of the United States was going around the country telling people what the pain was going to be from sequester," Carter said. "That's a fact. That was the atmosphere. It was Chicken Little, the sky is falling almost." Morton told Carter that more immigrants were released in Texas than in any other state but did not name other states where they were released.

As we studied resistors, op amps, transistors, capacitors, and timers, and learned to make a variety of devices including alarms, amplifiers, delays, and thermostats, Nick was a near genius at breadboarding. He managed to put almost all of our required circuits side by side on one board and the result was a real piece of art. He was immensely clever and creative in his building techniques and found ways to connect components that I have never seen before. He also demonstrated creativity Final Course Comments for Winter Term 2013 _________________________________________________________________ in his circuit analyses. He would make up his own spreadsheets to do calculations, and would derive equations that his classmates did not do. Nick always insisted on completely mastering the concepts we were learning, and he did so in a way that was unique. The flip side of that independent streak was that his write-ups tended to be so sparse that he lost points due to lack of clear communication. Nick knew where his passion was and he was following his bliss so to speak - not always perfect for a classroom situation, but workable in electronics, and downright necessary for life beyond Exeter.

We spent much of the year working on tying your own velcro sneakers, nose blowing using tissues and washing your hands after going to the bathroom. I feel he is now ready to move on to the fifth grade and holding him back for the fourth consecutive year will not help him. Although I understand he will turn 16 this summer I encourage you to let him continue in his studies. The fifth grade curriculum in Texas is very important to a child's development and he will learn valuable life skills that will put him on par with his Texan peers. Skills like signing your name with an X, counting to ten on your fingers and learning to deny anything based on logic and science. I know it can be discouraging seeing the slow progress of your child but I would encourage you that I had a student named George W. Bush who didn't show half the promise of your child.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363292986710</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:29:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363293189807-185</Id><Topic><Title>well ladies, yet ANOTHER ALLTIME HISTORIC HIGH on the dow under THE GREAT OBAMA</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1363292370732</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:19:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior, you are going to buy tomorrow pre-market right?

The inbreeds need to be exterminated. But Paul only received tepid applause as he made his way through the opening section of his speech about civil liberties and drone use. Paul has raised questions about the administration’s contention that drones could be used against Americans acting as enemy combatants on American soil. “Good intentions are not enough,” Paul said was his message for President Barack Obama. The were just a smattering of applause. “If we allow one man to charge Americans as enemy combatants and indefinitely detain or drone them, then what exactly is it our brave young men and women are fighting for?” Paul said, and again just tepid applause. “Our Bill of Rights is what defines us and makes us exceptional,” Paul said to polite applause. On reaching out to youth, Paul said, “They want leaders that wont feed them a line of #$%$ or sell them short. They aren't afraid of individual liberty.” Just a light round of claps.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1363297171632</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 17:39:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363297184181-217</Id><Topic><Title>dumb the millionaire 4th grade teacher</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1363295838803</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 17:17:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When he was deepharbor he went to Machu Picchu and the B.V.I's.

Yet, there they languish – in some cases, now in their second decade – in a hellish legal limbo, uncharged yet imprisoned.

The White House blog on Wednesday said that "we celebrate Sunshine Week - an appropriate time to discuss the importance of open government and freedom of information" and quoted the president this way: "Openness will strengthen our democracy, and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government." Along with others, I've spent the last four years documenting the extreme, often unprecedented, commitment to secrecy that this president has exhibited, including his vindictive war on whistleblowers, his refusal to disclose even the legal principles underpinning his claimed war powers of assassination, and his unrelenting, Bush-copying invocation of secrecy privileges to prevent courts even from deciding the legality of his conduct (as a 2009 headline on the Obama-friendly TPM site put it: "Expert Consensus: Obama Mimics Bush On State Secrets"). Just this week, the Associated Press conducted a study proving that last year, the Obama administration has rejected more FOIA requests on national security grounds than in any year since Obama became president, and quoted Alexander Abdo, an ACLU staff attorney for its national security project, as follows: "We've seen a meteoric rise in the number of claims to protect secret law, the government's interpretations of laws or its understanding of its own authority. The Obama administration is actually even more secretive than the Bush administration." What is remarkable is that this secrecy has become so oppressive and extreme that even the most faithful Democratic operatives are now angrily exploding with public denunciations.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1363310218163</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 21:16:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363310289761-249</Id><Title>MSNBC loses again</Title><Msg>Bill OReilly kicks MSNBC's butt again.

He keeps cheering even if Team Obama is suc*kin hind teat and getting a pie in the face like a laughable circus clown. That's why Junior is so hilarious. He says everyone else is stupid but he doesn't even realize he looks like a complete imbecile, the poor deluded fool. I feel sorry for the kid. He obviously bit hard on Obama's snake oil pitch.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1363318323120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:32:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363318605252-259</Id><Topic><Title>THE US GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME COMPLETELY WORTHLESS</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1363289513764</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 15:31:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We have become nothing more than a nation of scammers *** Following Obama's example... a nation of scammer, liars and blamers.
