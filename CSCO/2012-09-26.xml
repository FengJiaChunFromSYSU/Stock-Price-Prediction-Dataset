In a sign of particular trouble for Romney, negative views of his campaign have grown by 18 points since midsummer among independents, who often are swing voters. In July, 46 percent of independents rated Romney's handling of his campaign negatively; it's 64 percent today. Romney's positive score among independents, at 32 percent, far trails Obama's, 50 percent. Even among Republicans, more than one in four rates Romney's efforts negatively - 27 percent. While essentially unchanged since July, that's substantially more than the share of Democrats who respond negatively to Obama's work on his campaign, 11 percent.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1348660760782</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 07:59:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348661649952-18</Id><Title>both the Republicans and the Democrats have allowed few rich c-riminals to ship our jobs overseas.

(Photo by Rico Chorizo). CARIBOU, Maine - Mitt Romney's Mormon Merriment Presidential Campaign Bus Tour pulled into the town where reportedly most of the Revolutionary cannonballs were manufactured. Romney spoke before a crowd of 17 people that had gathered in the parking lot of a local Burger Bandit Restaurant. He told the people that it was a pleasure for him to meet the non-47 percent of the American voters that he has been talking about for the past week. "Old Mittens" was then asked about the rumor that he is seriously considering disowning his 40 or so cousins who reside in Mexico. Romney giggled and said that, that was just a vicious rumor that he believes had been started by either Laramie Cobalt, President Obama's Chief Secret Service Agent or Hollywood actor George Clooney. The man who lately has been introducing himself as Ann Romney's husband, stated that there is no way that he would ever deny that he has lots of relatives in the Republic of Mexico. In fact, the old "Flip-Flopper," as Vice-President Joe Biden refers to him, pointed out that he has personally spoken with Mexican President Nacho Winslow and asked that his family members not be given any preferential treatment simply because they are all related to Mitt Romney. SIDENOTE: There is talk down in Mexico that if Romney is elected president that President Winslow will tell him to ease up on the capturing of illegal aliens from Mexico or else he (Winslow) will issue a directive that will legally allow for Mexico's Federal Police to round up everyone of Romney's cousins and deport them back to Utah.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1348663650294</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 08:47:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348663660679-23</Id><Topic><Title>THE WILLARD SAID "THE NUMBER 1 ELEMENT ABOUT BEING A GOOD LEADER IS...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1348628149703</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 22:55:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, Mitt"s gonna hit the fan.</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1348663660679</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 08:47:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348665242856-24</Id><Topic><Title>how come obama and manchelle have not thanked the "rich"</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1348662811798</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 08:33:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how come blace people get free college? is the american gov racist????</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1348665242856</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:14:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348665380743-25</Id><Title>A Liberals Idea of Success</Title><Msg>Gain 4 million jobs in 4 years after you LOST 8 million.

The 9/12 - 9/24 RCP average shows Obama ahead by 3.7%. The site shows individual polls from sources such as Rasmussen, Gallup, and AP with Obama ahead from 1% to 7%. At the same time polls claiming to be "unskewed", that is, unweighted to favor Democratic voters, show Mitt Romney ahead by 7%. PolicyMic gives us a very good technical explanation of the practice of weighting poll numbers toward the desired result. Pollsters are pushing the numbers toward Barack Obama by increasing the apparent number of Democrat included from the 7% value from 2008, to as much as 13%. This artificially inflates the Democratic preference within the poll. Stripping out a 13% weighting from the RCP average would actually show Romney ahead by 9.3%!</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1348671048627</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 10:50:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348671085026-43</Id><Topic><Title>polls are a dem tool and a joke...idiots use them to re-assure themselves that stealing and being lazy is ok and they are victims.</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1348671048627</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 10:50:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But aren't pollsters that continue this practice setting up their fellows for a huge letdown? Given the current level of distrust for government, and the reactionary frame of mind that so many Americans espouse, isn't this a recipe for disaster? Groups such as OWS, the Black Panthers, and Act Up will likely seize upon any great Romney victory as evidence of corruption in the electoral process. We've all seen and remember the tediousness of the certification process that took place in Florida between Bush and Gore in the 2000 election. Gore's supporters went so far as to claim that the sheer popular majority for Gore should override the Constitution and its requirement for a majority in the electoral college, virtually disregarding the boundaries between the states. One can only see weighted polling as an effort to affect the outcome of the election, an illegal practice referred to in out courts as "electioneering". Pollsters are lobbied by Democrat administrators to produce a result that is favorable to their guy, and the pollsters do it. It is intended to suppress the GOP voter turnout. Obama is ahead in spite of all of the hard work done on Romney's behalf, so don't bother. Stay home on election day. Don't waste your time! Pollsters, lest we forget, benefit financially from a tight presidential race. Both sides see the numbers and flock to polling websites by the millions daily to see what the latest numbers for their candidates are. Advertisers pay per hit for their ads to be viewed. Pushing the polls to show an Obama lead early in the race, and then allowing the amount of the skew to fade as election day draws near is like throwing a cast net at a fish hatchery. But, what a cost to the nation these unclean profits are for the pollsters! When November, 2012 comes around, and the voters indicate their rejection of Obama, Obama's supporters will have had their hopes raised for a fictitious poll rating. Then when disappointment turns to outrage and anger flares, when Watts, Harlem, and South Central Los Angeles burn again in race riots, will we remember that is was the Democrats and their pollsters that brought this about? .</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1348671085026</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 10:51:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348671218906-44</Id><Title>When we picked Mitt Romey to lead,it was a POOR CHOICE,losing all 3 swing states by 10 points</Title><Msg>Im afraid we are finished,,poor choice</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1348671218906</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 10:53:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348671219033-45</Id><Title>When we picked Mitt Romey to lead,it was a POOR CHOICE,losing all 3 swing states by 10 points</Title><Msg>Im afraid we are finished,,poor choice</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1348671219033</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 10:53:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348671490555-46</Id><Topic><Title>When we picked Mitt Romey to lead,it was a POOR CHOICE,losing all 3 swing states by 10 points</Title><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1348671218906</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 10:53:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>relax...dems are paying the pollseters to favor their canidate. watch it will get tigher as we get closer.

By Brad The Republican Party of Florida's top recipient of 2012 expenditures, a firm by the name of Strategic Allied Consulting, was just fired on Tuesday night, after more than 100 apparently fraudulent voter registration forms were discovered to have been turned in by the group to the Palm Beach County, FL Supervisor of Elections. The firm appears to be another shell company of Nathan Sproul, a longtime, notorious Republican operative, hired year after year by GOP Presidential campaigns, despite being accused of shredding Democratic voter registration forms in a number of states over several past elections. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Strategic Allied Consulting has been paid some $667,000 this year by the FL GOP, presumably to run its voter registration campaigns in the state. That number, however, does not account for another identical payment made in August. The Palm Beach Post is reporting tonight that the firm received "more than $1.3 million" from the Republican Party of Florida "to register new voters." The firm is not only tied to the FL GOP, but also to the Mitt Romney Campaign, which hired Sproul as a political consultant late last year, despite years of fraud allegations against his organizations in multiple states. Moreover, the firm is also reportedly operating similar voter registration operations on behalf of the Republican Party, to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars, in a number of key battleground states this year, including North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado. Strategic Allied has recently taken steps to hide their ownership by Sproul's notorious firm, Sproul &amp; Associates. Palm Beach County Supervisor of Election Susan Bucher confirmed to The BRAD BLOG late this evening that she turned over 106 suspicious voter registration applications to the Florida State Attorney during a meeting yesterday afternoon in Palm Beach, after the "questionable" applications were submitted to her office by a worker for Strategic Allied. The forms were said to all have similar signatures, changed addresses and party affiliations, and other defects which appear to have all been done by the same hand. The case emerging in Florida tonight mirrors a similar incident reported earlier this year when more than a thousand fraudulent voter registration forms were discovered to have been turned in to the Sacramento County, CA Registrar of Voters by a group hired by that state's Republican Party. But that's not the only similar case, as a massive GOP voter registration scheme, which appears to involve the upper-echelons of the national party, begins to emerge... 'Questionable' registrations in Palm Beach The Palm Beach Post reports tonight that Bucher turned the "questionable" applications over to FL State Attorney Peter Antonacci and Chief Assistant State Attorney Paul Zacks during a meeting on Monday in "an abundance of caution" after her staff "had questions about similar-looking signatures, missing information and wrong addresses on the forms." The paper reports that "some of the applications she questioned were for new voter registrations while others were for address or party affiliation changes or requests for new voter cards." According to the FL Election Code, the alteration of a "voter registration application...without the other person's knowledge and consent" is a third degree felony, punishable by a $5,000 fine and up to five years in jail. Similarly, the willful submission of "any false voter registration information" is also a third degree felony. (Though don't tell fading GOP superstar Ann Coulter that, since she submitted fraudulent information on her own voter registration form --- in Palm Beach County, FL, coincidentally --- back in 2005, before knowingly voting at the wrong precinct illegally, as we have covered in great detail here over the years. The Post reports that "The 106 applications flagged by Bucher were part of a batch of 304 turned in Sept. 5 by the contractor, using the Republican Party of Florida’s identification number." As of tonight, the Republican Party of Florida (RPOF) says they have fired the firm, which they claim they had hired at the request of the Republican National Party. "When we learned today about the instances of potential voter registration fraud that occurred in Palm Beach County," RPOF Director Mike Grissom said, "we immediately informed the Republican National Committee that we were terminating the contract with the voter registration vendor we hired at their request because there is no place for voter registration fraud in Florida." Palm Beach Post reports that Strategic Allied Consulting was given "identical payments of $667,598 in July and August" by the RPOF. Strategic Allied Consulting Strategic Allied Consulting, which has only a single-page, generic website (including typos, as seen above) has been advertising for paid registration workers on "Craigslist, Monster Jobs, Jobs Indeed, Conservative Jobs, etc.," according to a source who has been researching them over the past several days. Late last month, Greg Flynn at the North Carolina blog BlueNC reported on some of their job listings seeking workers in that swing-state, which Obama narrowly won in 2008, offering to pay anywhere from $11 to $13 per hour. "WANT TO HELP REPUBLICANS WIN IN NC?," reads one ad, "We are currently hiring self-motivated people to contact voters for the election. No experience needed! We are paying $13/per hour for this program." "Are you interested in helping Mitt Romney win North Carolina?," reads another, "I am with the North Carolina Republican Party working with Voter Registration Projects and am looking for team members to help expand Republican voter registration." "Republican Voter Registration Captains Needed," begins another, requesting applicants submit resumes to John Bria of Strategic Allied Consulting. "Help GOP candidates win in November and become an integral part a [sic] presidential campaign." "Employees will go to high traffic areas, identify conservative voters, ensure that their voter registration is up to date, and then report back at night with their data and the voter registration forms that they collected." Curiously, that's exactly what is seen in a rather breathtaking viral video we reported on this morning revealing a young voter registration worker in Colorado Springs, CO (El Paso County), asking a potential registrant, "Would you vote for Romney or Obama?" before she would offer a voter registration form. While the worker, when pressed, reluctantly admitted, "we're out here in support of Romney," she then claimed to be working for the El Paso County Clerk's office. In fact, as we reported, the El Paso County Republican Party Chairman has since admitted the young lady was working for the party. Following publication of our story, we were informed by a tipster that the young lady was actually hired by a third-party contractor, though we have not yet been able to either confirm that point, or identify the name of the contractor. BlueNC reports, however, that, in addition to FEC campaign filings showing the NC Republican Party paid some $333,000 to Strategic Allied Consulting for services in that state in July, "There is evidence that similar operations are being conducted in Colorado, Florida and Virginia on behalf of the Republican Party." Was the young worker in Colorado Springs hired by Strategic Allied Consulting for her work with the local GOP? The techniques described in the NC help wanted ads sound very familiar to what was seen on video tape in CO. At BlueNC, Flynn reports "The company was set up in Virginia in June 2012 and filings with the Virginia Secretary of State reveal no identifying information other than that of a corporate filing service." He adds: "There is no evidence of business registration in either North Carolina, Colorado, or Florida (or Arizona)," where Sproul's Sproul &amp; Associates is based. At the time of BlueNC's report, the domain StrategicAlliedConsulting dotcom was registered to Sproul &amp; Associates in Tempe, Arizona. The day after they published their report, the domain name registration was quickly changed to "private", but not before Flynn was able to grab a screen shot confirming the ownership of the domain: The notorious Nathan Sproul We've reported on Sproul many times over the years, as the GOP operative, and former chair of the Arizona GOP and the state's Christian Coalition, pops up again and again in each Presidential Election year. He is hired over and over by the Republican Party, despite years of fraud allegations in multiple states against his organizations, which are said to have routinely changed or entirely destroyed Democratic voter registrations. He operates as Sproul &amp; Associates as well as Lincoln Strategy Group, among other names, including now, apparently, Strategic Allied Consulting. And this year, after being hired by the Bush/Cheney campaign in '04 and the McCain/Palin campaign in '08, Sproul was "quietly" hired by the Romney campaign as a political consultant late last year, according to a June report from Lee Fang at the non-partisan Republic Report: Late last year, Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign began paying Nathan Sproul, a political consultant with a long history of destroying Democratic voter registration forms and manipulating ballot initiatives. Sproul, who changed his firm’s name from Sproul and Associates to Lincoln Strategies, has received over $70,000 from Romney’s campaign ... Republic Report reviewed disclosures from the Federal Elections Commission. Sproul’s Lincoln Strategy Group has received about $71,391 in payments for “field consulting” and “rent &amp; utilities” by the Romney for President Inc. committee from November 30th through March 2nd of this year. Fang then goes on to highlight what he describes as some of Sproul's "greatest hits" as detailed by ThinkProgress while reporting on Sproul's Lincoln Strategies astroturf work for a so-called "Clean Coal" industry campaign in 2009 [emphasis in original]: - In Oregon and Nevada, Lincoln Strategies - then known as Sproul and Associates - was investigated for destroying Democratic voter registration forms. The Bush-Cheney 2004 presidential campaign paid Sproul $7.4 million for campaign work. [CNN, 10/14/04; KGW News, 10/13/04; East Valley Tribune, 09/07/06] - In Nevada, people who registered as Democrats with Lincoln Strategies - then known as Sproul and Associates - found their names absent from the voter registration rolls. [Reno Gazette-Journal, 10/29/04] - During the 2006 midterm elections, Wal-Mart banned Lincoln Strategies for partisan voter registration efforts in Tennessee. The Republican National Committee had hired the firm. [Associated Press, 08/24/06] - In Arizona, Lincoln Strategies employed a variety of deceptive tactics - including systematically lying about the bill - to push a ballot initiative to eviscerate the state's clean elections law. [Salon, 10/21/04] - Lincoln Strategies, then employed by the Republican Party, was behind efforts to place Ralph Nader on the ballot in states such as Arizona. [American Prospect, 06/25/04] Despite all of those years of allegations, the McCain campaign went on to hire Sproul in 2008, according to Sam Stein at Huffington Post, who reported at the time: John McCain's campaign has directed $175,000 to the firm of a Republican operative accused of massive voter registration fraud in several states. According to campaign finance records, a joint committee of the McCain-Palin campaign, the RNC and the California Republican Party, made a $175,000 payment to the group Lincoln Strategy in June for purposes of "registering voters." The managing partner of that firm is Nathan Sproul, a renowned GOP operative who has been investigated on multiple occasions for suppressing Democratic voter turnout, throwing away registration forms and even spearheading efforts to get Ralph Nader on ballots to hinder the Democratic ticket. ... That Sproul would come under the employment umbrella of the McCain campaign --- the Republican National Committee has also separately paid Lincoln Strategy at least $37,000 for voter registration efforts this cycle --- is not terribly surprising. Sproul, who has donated nearly $30,000 to McCain's campaign, has been in the good graces of GOP officials for the past decade despite charges of ethical and potentially legal wrongdoing. In Fang's report, he goes on to note that "Even former Rep. Chris Cannon (R-UT), during a hearing on voter fraud, admitted that 'the difference between ACORN and Sproul is that ACORN doesn't throw away or change registration documents after they have been filled out.'" GOP voter registration fraud epidemic continues As we described earlier today, in our story on the disturbing Colorado GOP voter registration worker video, while Republicans had long been critical of fraudulent voter registration efforts they inaccurately attributed to ACORN, the non-partisan, four-decade old community organizing group (which has since been forced into bankruptcy as a result of the years-long GOP effort to mischaracterize them and their work) there is no evidence, to our knowledge, that any of its tens of thousands of registration workers ever screened out potential registrants from one party or another before allowing them to register, as seen in CO. Neither is there evidence that any of their workers ever changed party affiliations on registration forms, as is being alleged tonight in Palm Beach County, or destroyed Democratic forms, as has been alleged over the years, as noted by Republican Rep. Cannon. Moreover, it should be noted that of the handful of ACORN registration workers who submitted fraudulent applications over the years, almost all of those workers were turned into officials by ACORN themselves. The group checked all applications for validity before turning them in, flagged those which appeared to be fraudulent, and then turned them in to officials, along with the names of the workers who had defrauded them. Contrast that with the disturbing activities of Sproul &amp; Associates, Lincoln Strategies and now Sproul's Strategic Allied Consulting, along with what was admitted to by the Republican Party today in Colorado, and revealed by a number of recent cases of massive registration fraud by the Republican Party in California. (For the record, ACORN was never hired to do registration work by the Democratic Party, despite inaccurate Republican claims to the contrary.) In 2006, GOP voter registration firms in California were reported by the LA Times to have turned in thousands of invalid registration forms, as well as fraudulent signatures on petitions in San Bernardino County. In once instance, "About 4,800 of more than 5,600 signatures submitted [by John Burkett Petition Management] were found to be invalid and were tossed out by election officials," the paper reported. In 2008, at the height of that year's GOP/Fox "News" ACORN "voter fraud" scam, a group calling itself Young Political Majors (YPM) was hired by the CA Republican Party to do voter registration. The firm was reportedly paid $7 to $12 for every Californian it registered as a member of the GOP. YPM was subsequently found to have been changing thousands of voter registration forms from Democratic to Republican. The group's CEO, Mark Anthony Jacoby, was eventually arrested (see video of my appearance announcing the news on Fox in a live "Fox News Alert" that year) before he later pleaded guilty to voter registration fraud. And, earlier this year, in 2012, the Sacramento Republican Party was found to have hired Momentum Political Services, a firm headed up by a woman described as a "professional con-artist". The group allegedly turned in thousands of fraudulent voter registrations as part of a $50,000 bounty scheme seeking Republican registrations, as paid for by the GOP in the district of Republican Congressman Dan Lungren. All the while, Republicans were loudly accusing Democrats of committing "voter fraud" requiring polling place Photo ID restrictions to stop it, even though there are just 10 known cases of in-person impersonation --- the only type of voter fraud that can possibly be deterred by Photo ID --- out of hundreds of millions of votes cast in all 50 states since 2000, according to a recent exhaustive report by the non-partisan investigative news consortium, News21. Perhaps it's a case of projection. Perhaps the GOP knows about the fraud that they are carrying out, so they presume that Democrats must be doing something similar. Nonetheless, when it comes to voter registration fraud, Republicans are the champs, hands down. And it remains to be seen how wide and how high this story will go. This one may have legs. As to actual voter fraud, it's Republicans --- and very high profile ones at that, including Mitt Romney himself --- who are winning that contest as well.

Jul 12, 2012 1:43 PM . Permalink The whole executive team makes very little cash so there is no serious cash burn. If the company were to be liquidated today it would sell for 15.50. If the QStream product takes off you are looking at $22, if it is a failure, they will shut the doors pay off shareholders $15 each and end of story. That is why the stock is holding firm while the market has been getting pounded lately. In other words, this is a 7% bonus with a 60% upside potential.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1348676849113</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:27:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348677021295-108</Id><Title>Proffesional community orginizer</Title><Msg>Narcissistic Obama, spends all day on TV -writing books about himself.

America’s owners are building a global economic empire for their own amusement and to build their fortunes at our expense. Since they NEED battle-hardened troops at the ready to coerce foreign governments to do what they’re damn told, they send our young warriors—who are true patriots who love their country and are willing to die defending it—into hot zones where their leaders are coerced into “training” them to become empire-building shock troops who lose their humanity, a bit at a time, because of the experiences they are forced to survive…or not. At the same time, they are creating the reality of the Ugly American out of whole cloth and growing a huge force of jihadists whose battle cry is “Death to America” because their friends and family members have been murdered. The second major factor is that keeping the troops busy keeps the war-machine manufacturers busy, and their companies, such as Haliburton, make an obscene amount of money in the process. Third, our owners foster the “US vs. The Rest of The Non-European World” mentality as a diversion for the bloodthirsty mental midgets of the Far Right, the fear-driven paranoid schizophrenics of the “moderate” right, and the Bible-thumping pseudo-Christians of the Religious Right. BONUS: this chaos id a perfect tool to keep Americans divided/polarized and fighting among ourselves as our owners bleed us dry. It’s a perfect strategy, except for those of us who understand it, and most of those of us who do understand are ridiculed to the point that we’re ignored, imprisoned for nothing, or beaten, shot, and eventually murdered for speaking out.

It was former political director of the Republican Party of Iowa Craig Robinson who said to the New York Times on Sunday, “I hate to say this, but if Ryan wants to run for national office again, he’ll probably have to wash the stench of Romney off of him.” The remark has been taken up by Paul Ryan as an inside joke on the campaign trail. Politico‘s Roger Simon reported that while Ryan “had already decided to distance himself from the floundering Romney campaign, he now feels totally uninhibited. Reportedly, he has been marching around his campaign bus, saying things like, ‘If Stench calls, take a message’ and ‘Tell Stench I’m having finger sandwiches with Peggy Noonan and will text him later.’” Meanwhile, according to Simon’s anonymous sources, the Romney “brain trust” of senior campaign officials in Boston have taken to calling Ryan “Gilligan.” Campaign headquarters apparently feels that the man brought on to the ticket for his alleged deftness in navigating complicated snarls of budget and policy numbers is turning out to be an intellectual flyweight.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348691602590</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 16:33:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348691684104-217</Id><Topic><Title>I HAVE A PROPOSITION...LETS NUKE IRAN, IF WE NUKE ISRAEL ALONG WITH IT.</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1348683624880</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 14:20:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bird brain, writing is not your forte.

The segment kicked off with Fox &amp; Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson introducing Rice as a “recent college grad who voted for President Obama” and who “just moved out of his parents’ home.” Rice then cut in with “S’up” and referred to Carlson, a former Miss America winner, as “Miss USA." “It’s an honor,” he said. PHOTOS: 15 of the Best Election Themed Movies Carlson quickly corrected her guest (who responded, “Miss Universe in my book”) before asking Rice to explain what had happened since he voted for Obama in the last election. “I was a huge Obama supporter in 2008,” Rice replied. “I met him in third grade. I met him when I was little.” And the interview only got worse. Asked why he’s now a supporter of the Romney campaign, Rice said, “It’s actually a funny story. I lost a basketball game to a friend of mine.” Producers ultimately cut the interview short after a few more quips from Rice, with Carlson explaining, “We’re gonna give Max another chance maybe when he’s ready to do the interview.” “They were so happy that I fit the mold and that I was Caucasian,” Rice said in a post-show interview with Raw. “They were just casting a part in a show. They were so stupid… I’m a kid messing around.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348691968074</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 16:39:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348692202273-219</Id><Title>Stench and Gilligan ticket</Title><Msg>I'm running for President not him, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348692202273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 16:43:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348692368851-220</Id><Topic><Title>Stench and Gilligan ticket</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348692202273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 16:43:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your dumb.ivan id isn't usually this childish.

Amid a push by the campaign to remind voters of high deficits, Mr. Romney on Wednesday told an Ohio crowd that while he would work for lower tax rates on businesses and individuals, they shouldn't "be expecting a huge cut in taxes because I'm also going to lower deductions and exemptions." His campaign also has backed away from statements that its plan would preserve most tax deductions for Americans whose adjusted gross income is less than $200,000 a year. Instead, one staff member said, an alternate scenario would lower that income cutoff to $100,000, thus raising revenue by allowing fewer taxpayers to take deductions.The staff member said the campaign hasn't committed to that plan; such a change would affect millions of taxpayers.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348701220085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 19:13:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348701270437-248</Id><Topic><Title>both the Republicans and the Democrats have allowed few rich c-riminals to ship our jobs overseas.

That was a time when people believed in truth and regarded truth as an independent power and not as an auxiliary for government, class, race, ideological, personal, or financial interest. Today Americans are ruled by propaganda. Americans have little regard for truth, little access to it, and little ability to recognize it. Truth is an unwelcome entity. It is disturbing. It is off limits. Those who speak it run the risk of being branded “anti-American,” “anti-semite” or “conspiracy theorist.” Truth is an inconvenience for government and for the interest groups whose campaign contributions control government. Truth is an inconvenience for prosecutors who want convictions, not the discovery of innocence or guilt. Truth is inconvenient for ideologues. Today many whose goal once was the discovery of truth are now paid handsomely to hide it. “Free market economists” are paid to sell offshoring to the American people. High-productivity, high value-added American jobs are denigrated as dirty, old industrial jobs. Relicts from long ago, we are best shed of them. Their place has been taken by “the New Economy,” a mythical economy that allegedly consists of high-tech white collar jobs in which Americans innovate and finance activities that occur offshore. All Americans need in order to participate in this “new economy” are finance degrees from Ivy League universities, and then they will work on Wall Street at million dollar jobs. Economists who were once respectable took money to contribute to this myth of “the New Economy.” And not only economists sell their souls for filthy lucre. Recently we have had reports of medical doctors who, for money, have published in peer-reviewed journals concocted “studies” that hype this or that new medicine produced by pharmaceutical companies that paid for the “studies.” The Council of Europe is investigating the drug companies’ role in hyping a false swine flu pandemic in order to gain billions of dollars in sales of the vaccine. The media helped the US military hype its recent Marja offensive in Afghanistan, describing Marja as a city of 80,000 under Taliban control. It turns out that Marja is not urban but a collection of village farms. And there is the global warming scandal, in which NGOs. the UN, and the nuclear industry colluded in concocting a doomsday scenario in order to create profit in pollution. Wherever one looks, truth has fallen to money. Wherever money is insufficient to bury the truth, ignorance, propaganda, and short memories finish the job. I remember when, following CIA director William Colby’s testimony before the Church Committee in the mid-1970s, presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan issued executive orders preventing the CIA and U.S. black-op groups from assassinating foreign leaders. In 2010 the US Congress was told by Dennis Blair, head of national intelligence, that the US now assassinates its own citizens in addition to foreign leaders. When Blair told the House Intelligence Committee that US citizens no longer needed to be arrested, charged, tried, and convicted of a capital crime, just murdered on suspicion alone of being a “threat,” he wasn’t impeached. No investigation pursued. Nothing happened. There was no Church Committee. In the mid-1970s the CIA got into trouble for plots to kill Castro. Today it is American citizens who are on the hit list. Whatever objections there might be don’t carry any weight. No one in government is in any trouble over the assassination of U.S. citizens by the U.S. government. As an economist, I am astonished that the American economics profession has no awareness whatsoever that the U.S. economy has been destroyed by the offshoring of U.S. GDP to overseas countries. U.S. corporations, in pursuit of absolute advantage or lowest labor costs and maximum CEO “performance bonuses,” have moved the production of goods and services marketed to Americans to China, India, and elsewhere abroad. When I read economists describe offshoring as free trade based on comparative advantage, I realize that there is no intelligence or integrity in the American economics profession. Intelligence and integrity have been purchased by money. The transnational or global U.S. corporations pay multi-million dollar compensation packages to top managers, who achieve these “performance awards” by replacing U.S. labor with foreign labor. While Washington worries about “the Muslim threat,” Wall Street, U.S. corporations and “free market” shills destroy the U.S. economy and the prospects of tens of millions of Americans. Americans, or most of them, have proved to be putty in the hands of the police state. Americans have bought into the government’s claim that security requires the suspension of civil liberties and accountable government. Astonishingly, Americans, or most of them, believe that civil liberties, such as habeas corpus and due process, protect “terrorists,” and not themselves. Many also believe that the Constitution is a tired old document that prevents government from exercising the kind of police state powers necessary to keep Americans safe and free. Most Americans are unlikely to hear from anyone who would tell them any different.
