Apparently it's better that the depraved kids do the evil queerifying and not their supervisors? AP: "Under pressure over its long-standing ban on gays, the Boy Scouts of America is proposing to lift the ban for youth members but continue to exclude gays as adult leaders. The Scouts announced Friday that the proposal would be submitted to the roughly 1,400 voting members of its National Council at a meeting in Texas the week of May 20. Gay-rights groups have demanded a complete lifting of the ban, while some churches and conservative groups want it maintained in its entirety, raising the likelihood that the new proposal will draw continued criticism from both sides. Indeed, the BSA, in making its announcement, estimated that easing the ban on gay adults could cause widespread defections that cost the organization 100,000 to 350,000 members."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1366459236542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 08:00:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366462839891-10</Id><Topic><Title>HEY, FAT, STUPID GOP PUKES!!!

It doesn't take too great a leap in imagination to get from "the wretched refuse of your teeming shore" to "hirsute, low-browed, big-faced persons of obviously low mentality"—which was sociologist E.A. Ross's description of Eastern European immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in 1914.10 Every great surge in immigration in American history has generated a corresponding surge in nativism—opposition to immigration on the grounds that an influx of foreigners will marginalize the English language, undermine American culture, destabilize American politics, and weaken the economic status of American workers. Nativist opposition to immigration often embraced negative racial and ethnic stereotypes—like those expressed by E.A. Ross—about the immigrants themselves. Patterns of Continuity In the twin histories of immigration and nativism in America we find a remarkable degree of continuity across four centuries. The economic forces that drove immigrants from Ireland to the United States in the 1840s aren't much different from those driving immigrants from Mexico to the United States today. Benjamin Franklin's objections to heavy German immigration into Pennsylvania in the 1750s aren't much different from Lou Dobbs's objections to heavy Mexican immigration into America today. The descendents of English immigrants fought Irish immigration in the 1840s on much the same grounds as the descendents of Irish immigrants fought Eastern European immigration in the 1920s, and as descendents of Eastern European immigrants fight Mexican immigration today.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366480680405</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 13:58:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366481093168-36</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN YOU LIVE IN A BLUESISSY STATE...</Title><Username>juniorclassmate</Username><Timestamp>1366438456453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 02:14:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>funny how you tea billies think you have the right to carry a gun and shoot an unarmed civilian when you get scarred but then criticize the police for returning gun fire when they were being attacked, LOL Just goes to show you the tea billies really don't care who or why someone attacks America, they are still going to be on their side.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366481093168</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 14:04:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366481140405-37</Id><Topic><Title>ONE THING IS NOW APPARENT TO AMERICA., MELTING POTS DO NOT WORK!</Title><Username>futureperson</Username><Timestamp>1366475923689</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 12:38:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One thing about it, had they keep Dumb and Junior's grandparents out, the USA would certainly have a larger Gerbil population today!</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1366481140405</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 14:05:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366481156441-38</Id><Title>did the #$%$ teabillies blow up the Texas fertilizer plant on purpose?</Title><Msg>or was it just their normal stupidity working?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366481156441</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 14:05:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366482787525-39</Id><Title>tea party right wing hate groups on the rise</Title><Msg>For the fourth straight year, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s annual “Hatewatch” report found very significant growth of the radical right, and in particular with respect to the so-called “Patriot” groups, what we used to call militia groups. It’s been really astounding. There were 149 of these groups in 2008, by our count. That number as of 2012 was 1,360. That’s 813% growth in four years. It seems quite clear to us that this has a lot to do with Barack Obama, who was of course elected right at that time at the end of 2008, and what he represents: the demographic change that is going on in the population right now. The loss of the white majority is predicted by 2043, according to the Census Bureau. That along with the economy, which collapsed at right around the same time, is really what’s driving this movement. It’s been a very tough time. We’re living through a serious backlash to large changes in our world, and it’s very likely to get worse before it gets better. Now, with the new talk of gun control in the aftermath of the Newton, Conn., massacre, we’re seeing an even angrier reaction. Gun control is a large part of what drove the initial wave of militia movement back in the 1990s, and now we’re seeing talk about it again. As a result, we’re in a very scary situation. It is important to say that the vast majority of people in the Patriot movement, and in the radical right in general, will never blow up a federal building, will never shoot a police officer, or commit a major crime. But the reality is that looking back at the 1990s, there was an enormous amount of terrorism or attempted terrorism that in fact did come from people associated with the Patriot movement. We’ve seen it again, too, since 2008. There’s been a fairly dramatic uptick in non-Islamic domestic terrorism as soon as Obama appeared on the scene. Barack Obama had not left the city of Denver, where he was nominated for president by the Democratic party in 2007, before there was a skinhead plot to murder him. That fall, there were a number of other plots to kill Obama. There have been plots to attack four eastern cities, including Atlanta, with a deadly biological toxin. There have been plans and conspiracies to assassinate and kidnap judges and police officers. There was a major attempt to kill as many as 1,500 people marching in a Martin Luther King Day parade several years ago in Spokane, Wash. The list goes on and on, but what’s very clear is that after a lull of about eight years—the eight years under George Bush—we’re seeing a serious uptick in domestic terrorism.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366482787525</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 14:33:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366483010840-40</Id><Title>these are the guys Ivan is defending</Title><Msg>(CNN) -- Handguns, a rifle and at least six bombs -- three of which exploded -- were found at the scene early Friday after officers first confronted the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects in the darkness of a residential street, the Watertown, Massachusetts, police chief said Saturday in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. A single officer was the first to encounter the two cars that Tamerlan and Dzhokar Tsarnaev were driving, just before 1 a.m. Friday, Chief Edward Deveau said. One of the vehicles was a Mercedes sport utility vehicle the brothers carjacked earlier that night, he said. Before the officer could get backup, the two cars stopped, and the brothers got out. "They jump out of the car and unload on our police officer," Deveau said "They both came out shooting -- shooting guns, handguns. He's under direct fire, very close by. He has to jam it in reverse and try to get himself a little distance." anyone who hates America is a friend of Ivan's.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366483010840</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 14:36:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366484513693-41</Id><Title>BREAKING..SUSPECT #2 WAS NOT MIRANDIZED</Title><Msg>which means the lib state fuhked up big time in their arrest.</Msg><Username>gregu456</Username><Timestamp>1366484513693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 15:01:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366485173719-42</Id><Topic><Title>BREAKING..SUSPECT #2 WAS NOT MIRANDIZED</Title><Username>gregu456</Username><Timestamp>1366484513693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 15:01:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah and yet the important thing is that all the MA Munchkins could come from their hiding places and be happy and play again and party in the streets and sing "Ding #$%$ the witch is dead!" lol I thought I was watching a remake of the Wizard of OZ last night.</Msg><Username>lameduck0bama</Username><Timestamp>1366485173719</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 15:12:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366485258988-43</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN YOU LIVE IN A BLUESISSY STATE...</Title><Username>juniorclassmate</Username><Timestamp>1366438456453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 02:14:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If they were not criminals, they wouldn't have needed to throw pipe bombs and gunfire at cops when they approached.</Msg><Username>kevivoe</Username><Timestamp>1366485258988</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 15:14:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366485290639-44</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN YOU LIVE IN A BLUESISSY STATE...</Title><Username>juniorclassmate</Username><Timestamp>1366438456453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 02:14:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>post some more Ivan, we can all use the laughs,</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366485290639</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 15:14:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366485441102-45</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN YOU LIVE IN A BLUESISSY STATE...</Title><Username>juniorclassmate</Username><Timestamp>1366438456453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 02:14:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not necessarily true.

Under the automatic spending cuts – caused by a failure to reach compromise in Congress – the agency will have its budget cut by 8.2%, about $50m.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366496014311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 18:13:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366497153410-68</Id><Title>80% of Americans are afraid</Title><Msg>of the threat of the tea billies, only 20% fear terrorist</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366497153410</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 18:32:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366498026691-69</Id><Title>Why Sarah really resigned</Title><Msg>Monday, April 1, 2013 Sarah Palin Announces Resignation July 3, 2009 ~ The Real Reason As we all know, former Governor Sarah Palin, announced on July 3, 2009 that she would be leaving the Office of Governor. She did this from her backyard in Wasilla AK. She gave a lot of excuses but never any real reasons why she was leaving office. This is the first time in political history that a politician announced they could make more of a difference outside of politics. But then again, maybe Sarah had other things on her mind. From early 2009 when Sarah was sexting with my son Shawn Christy, and up to the summer time when Sarah was putting in reports of Shawn being in Alaska, life was going pretty good for Sarah. It was not until the US Capitol Police from Washington DC and the Secret Service noticed that Shawn had been home the whole time with us in McAdoo PA that problems began for Sarah. The Anchorage FBI had known the whole time that Shawn was still in PA because of the agent they had in our local library in Tamaqua. This all led to Shawn ending up in Washington DC on June 11, 2009 at the US Capitol Police Headquarters. One week later the US Secret Service visited our home with the PA State Police and McAdoo Police to take a full statement from Shawn regarding the sexting. At this point Secret Service Agent Joe Conlin requested that we take Shawn for a psychological evaluation. This appointment was scheduled for July 3, 2009 at 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time with Dr. Virginia Sherr in Holland PA. We arrived at Dr. Sherr's office at 2:00 sharp. Craig and I were allowed to be with Shawn during the psych evaluation which lasted about 45 minutes. There was only one break in the session and it was about 20 minutes in where the doctor left the room for about 10 minutes. The evaluation went very well and basically Shawn was told that he had some emotional problems due to Lyme disease and also that he had a love for politics. Dr. Sherr also states that Shawn probably has an e</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366498026691</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 18:47:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366498272653-70</Id><Title>remember when Sarah Palin said</Title><Msg>First Amendment "I think it's appalling and a violation of our freedom of the press." —On negative media coverage of Republican congressional candidate Vaughn Ward, Boise, Idaho, May 21, 2010 yup, you can't make up how stupid these people are, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366498272653</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 18:51:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366499093578-71</Id><Topic><Title>Miranda exemption</Title><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1366494500831</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 17:48:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Per NBCNEWS..."

The Daily Mirror reported: The FBI was last night hunting a 12-strong terrorist “sleeper cell” linked to the Boston marathon bomb brothers. Police believe Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were specially trained to carry out the devastating attack. More than 1,000 FBI agents were last night working to track down the cell and arrested a man and two women 60 miles from Boston in the hours before Dzhokhar’s dramatic capture after a bloody shootout on Friday. A source close to the investigation said: “We have no doubt the brothers were not acting alone. The devices used to detonate the two bombs were highly sophisticated and not the kind of thing people learn from Google. “They were too advanced. Someone gave the brothers the skills and it is now our job to find out just who they were. Agents think the sleeper cell has up to a dozen members and has been waiting several years for their day to come.” A specialist team of CIA and FBI interrogators was yesterday flown to a Boston hospital to grill wounded Dzhokhar, 19, about the secret group. The University of Massachusetts student was caught on Friday after hiding out in a boat parked in a garden in locked down Watertown the day after a gun battle with police left his 26-year-old brother and a rookie cop dead. Meanwhile… Obama does not want us to jump to any conclusions about the motivation of these two bombers.
