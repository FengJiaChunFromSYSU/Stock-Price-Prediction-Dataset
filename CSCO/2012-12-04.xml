On top of that, they conceded that the Pentagon budget must be cut even more deeply than the $487 billion already targeted over the next decade to seal an increasingly elusive deal to stop the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration."

And if they refuse to agree to Obama’s demands and take the country “over the cliff” (which actually isn’t a ”cliff” at all. More of a ”Reset Button”), then EVERYONE’S taxes go up and Democrats get to pass a totally separate “OBAMA Tax Cut” for 98% of Americans. That is… if the GOP doesn’t threaten to filibuster it. Republicans are over a barrel on this one. Democrats don’t have to concede ANYTHING in this debate. And what can Republicans do to extract concessions from the Democrats? Nothing except the threat of obstruction if they don’t get their way. Time to defang this obstructionist “Do Nothing Republican Party” once and for all.

A meta-analysis culled from 88 samples in 12 countries, and with an N of 22,818, revealed that “several psychological variables predicted political conservatism.” Which variables exactly? In order of predictive power: Death anxiety, system instability, dogmatism/intolerance of ambiguity, closed-mindedness, low tolerance of uncertainty, high needs for order, structure, and closure, low integrative complexity, fear of threat and loss, and low self-esteem. The researchers conclude, a little chillingly, that “the core ideology of conservatism stresses resistance to change and a justification of inequality.” The above list of variables is more than a little unsavory. We are talking about someone full of fear, with a poor sense of self, and a lack of mental dexterity. I always tell my students that tolerance of ambiguity is one especially excellent mark of psychological maturity. It isn’t a black and white world. According to the research, conservatives possess precisely the opposite: an intolerance of ambiguity and an inability to deal with complexity. Maybe that’s one reason why Obama seems so distasteful to them: he is a nuanced, multi-faceted thinker who can see things from several different perspectives simultaneously. And he isn’t preaching fear, either.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354637309088</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:08:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354637659105-48</Id><Topic><Title>the GOP is FICKED</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354634252857</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:17:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rhonda's not going to be happy the GOP wants to cut her social security, the one she receives even though she never paid into the system at all</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354637659105</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:14:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354637843351-49</Id><Topic><Title>Chiefs player who shot GF</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1354582657946</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 19:57:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>only you jr would be sure to check up on that one. just making sure you were still a racist.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1354637843351</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:17:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354637919094-50</Id><Title>Instructions for handling the "Bebt ceiling"</Title><Msg>TheAdministration could impose the following measures in between when we reach the ceiling, and when we have no choice but to default on our obligations: •Withhold all funding for federal projects in Ohio and Virginia until the ceiling is raised •Withhold oil &amp; gas subsidies, and suspend all federal permits for resource extraction until the ceiling is raised •Withhold all payments to defense contractors until the ceiling is raised Wingnuts, will this work?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354637919094</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:18:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354638075916-51</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. Deficit Shrinking At Fastest Pace Since WWII, Before Fiscal Cliff</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354637656142</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:14:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"MoronJuniorClassMate".

It’s No. 1 in executions, share of its population that lacks health insurance and five categories of air pollution — nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide, mercury emissions, volatile organic compounds and particulates. Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, said Texas can’t seem to shake miserable rankings. Naishtat, the group’s treasurer, cited how the state was tied with Florida as No. 1 in the share of children who are uninsured — 18 percent — and tied with Alabama as fourth-highest in child poverty at 32 percent, according to 2008-09 census data.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354643479436</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 12:51:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354643532660-80</Id><Topic><Title>Some people say dead last but I say</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354643238269</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 12:47:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why does everyone want to go to Texas? 6% EU, this is why you and your ILK FAIL at business and prosperity.

Beginning in 2009 and continuing to the present, a succession of states have changed their driver’s license procedures to comply with these regulations. The Coalition for a Secure Driver’s License has carefully tracked those upgrades, and is pleased to report that more than half of the states are close to joining the club that is authorized to place a gold star on its driver’s licenses and IDs. The dozen states that have done little or nothing to comply with the federal REAL ID requirements had best start looking at the calendar.

Working people should expect to have all their social security refunded then, if republican deal makers think it is an entitlement. This touching social security is like sticking their hands in pockets of people that can't afford to lose more. They want to play hardball? Stop letting the very wealthy hide their assets offshore, tax the excesses they don't need to survive paycheck to paycheck at 35%, [like the pay check to paycheck workers are taxed], and then perhaps in return Democrats will compromise by allowing "wasted spending" on things like - well you know, infrastructure, defense, environmental concerns.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354648758967</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:19:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354648891348-129</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO take a clutch of all to go onward on - rudely active takings</Title><Username>marjorie.carrillo45</Username><Timestamp>1353606548797</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 12:49:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>harry_palmore</Username><Timestamp>1354648891348</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:21:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354649095977-130</Id><Topic><Title>A majority of Americans say that if the country goes over the fiscal cliff on Dec. 31, congressional Republicans should bear the brunt of the blame, according to a new poll, the latest sign that the GOP faces a perilous path on the issue between now and the end of the year.</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354647386820</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 13:56:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Excellent strategy.

The specter of mental illness does indeed loom large over creationists, but they are not alone. Signs of psychopathology can also be seen among their political bedfellows, conservative Republicans, especially when you consider a wide range of illness indicators. In his award-winning 2005 book Dr. James Whitney Hicks discusses 50 signs of mental illness including denial, delusion, hallucination, disordered thinking, anger, anti-social behavior, sexual preoccupation, grandiosity, general oddness, and paranoia. Now I'm no clinician, but it seems that prominent Republicans have evidenced each of these ten telltale signs of mental illness over the past year: 1) Denial: humans did not evolve; Obama is not a native-born American Christian 2) Delusion: climate is not changing 3) Hallucination: God ordained me to be President 4) Disordered Thinking: being for small government that's huge in the bedroom; being anti-contraception and anti-abortion 5) Anger: Newt Gingrich’s perpetual scowl 6) Anti-social Behavior: toward women, gays, minorities, anyone without an umbilical cord or trust fund 7) Sexual Preoccupation: a fervent compulsion to control when we can mate, with whom we can mate, and precisely how we are allowed to mate (which I lampoon in Why Do Politicians Want to Police Dick and Jane's Private Parts?) 8) Grandiosity: even Rick Santorum recognizes Gingrich’s “over the moon” grandiosity 9) General Oddness: Ron Paul 10) Paranoia: pretty much all of them, all of the time</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354650377244</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:46:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354650819402-140</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo #$%$ censors working overtime</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1354649714968</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:35:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny because I can type flutelover is a re'tarded pile of trailer trash, not an issue</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1354650819402</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:53:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354650907541-141</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo #$%$ censors working overtime</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1354649714968</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:35:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seems like they have a liar's sensor.

The capital gains rate is so important to the economy, that it should be adjusted almost as frequently as the discount rate. Do you know what those rates represent? Of course, cap gains rate should aonly be adjusted annually. It applies to a rate of taxation, so adjusting it more often would probably confuse any people who normally forget to pay their social security contributions.

No increase in marginal rates. Sure, you can employ the cliff to reduce existing taxes, but you will have to put that on the table with spending cuts. It's very simple. You have offered nothing better than allowing the cliff to happen. If oblamer would consider simple cap gains increase with an exclusion for those who earn less than $250,000, it might be considered a non-marginal rate increase. Even Reagan raised cap gains taxes. You could easily #$%$ that as your tax on the rich.

If so it disproves evolution by showing humans and cave men have lived throughout the same periods without evolving. Those saying it shows proof of evolution I will ask why didn't big foot evolve? I'm fascinated with the study of genetics. Exactly what percentage and how recently linked is the human aspect of bigfoot within the dna? Also I'm fairly sure it is possible for a gorilla and a human to have offspring......just look at Obama; no really, I think it is possible and has been done recently. What's next? Capturing followed by a captive mating or cloning? Will human's try to mate with the big foot? Are these the giants mentioned in the bible? Bah, just thoughts as this stock message board is good for nothing but chat like this if it is even good for that. The stock is terrible also. Stuck at $14 to $20 into infinity.

The balance is trending toward methods other than shooting, as well. It would seem obvious to declare that if people don't get married, there won't be any spousal homicide rates.
