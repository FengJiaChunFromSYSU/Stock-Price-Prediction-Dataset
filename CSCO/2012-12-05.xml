Tim Berry, McCarthy's chief of staff, told the group of eight GOP message mavens that the White House is not seriously engaged in talks with House Republicans, but is still successfully painting them as the obstructionists. 'One of the things that was said was that the White House is winning right now and we've got to turn that back around because we do want a deal," said a meeting participant.'" Gosh, it's almost as if a majority of Americans supports higher taxes on the rich.

The reporting period included Thanksgiving and Black Friday, the official kickoff of the critical holiday shopping season. Early reports regarding those days had been mixed, and the individual retailers’ dim results suggest a big challenge in the coming weeks for retailers.” Thomson Reuters tracks major retailers actual sales results — not surveys — and the most recent data was disappointing. Sales at stores open at least a year gained 1.6% increase in November. This is far below the nonsensical 13% number the National Retail Federation (NRF) trumpets to gullible journalists. It was even below the 3.3% increase consensus of analysts. The NYT rounds up some of the sales figures, and they are not pretty: Kohl’s sales -5.6% (vs expectations of +1.9%) Target -1% (vs +2.1%) Nordstrom -1.1% (vs +4.3%) Macy’s -0.7% (vs + 1.5%) There were a few winners: Costco +6% Limited +5% Gap +3% We won’t get the final holiday sales figures til January, but you can be pretty comfortable with the premise that there will not be an increase of 13% of retail sales this holiday season. The lesson here is pretty stark. Be very aware of what you accept as a data source. Understand the differences between hard numbers — i.e., sales receipts — and squishy emotional guesses produced by surveying consumers. The bottom line: The NRF is an industry shill group that produces nonsensical spin that misleads investors, fools the public, and bamboozles incompetent journalists. Any writer who uncritically reprints their nonsense deserves to be fired; any media outlets that publishes their junk should be put quarantined and put on your DO NOT READ list.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1354720893158</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 10:21:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354721021153-42</Id><Title>WHO CARES?</Title><Msg>the US is defunct....just a matter of throwing dirt in the grave.

Might Decide To Let My Child Die Posted: 04 Dec 2012 06:00 PM PST This is, of course, a parody. But not all that far from reality! Talk about a marriage made in heaven! Rick Santorum has been hired as a weekly columnist by.... World Net/Nut Daily. You remember WND, owned by far-fringe wingnut Joseph Farah and home to birtherism, a conspiracy theory that Andrew Breitbart was assassinated... why, so many wonderful stories, I can't begin to list them all. And Little Ricky leads off his first column with the suggestion that the UN wants to kill his disabled child: In keeping with the WND tradition of promoting various fringe conspiracies, Santorum’s debut column claimed that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has an objective of “ceding our sovereignty to the United Nations.” Santorum warned that a United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities treaty adopted in 2006 “has much darker and more troubling implications” than to simply improve the treatment of disabled people in other countries. The staunchly anti-abortion Republican worried that the treaty would “put the government, acting under U.N. authority, in the position to determine for all children with disabilities what is best for them.” And taking that thought to its absurd conclusion, Santorum suggested that the U.N. treaty would have meant the death of his daughter, who has a rare genetic disorder. “In the case of our 4-year-old daughter, Bella, who has Trisomy 18, a condition that the medical literature says is ‘incompatible with life,’ would her ‘best interest’ be that she be allowed to die?” he asked. “Some would undoubtedly say so.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354727655750</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:14:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354727669759-89</Id><Topic><Title>BJ's anyone ?

Popular Idea By Greg Holyk | ABC News Blogs – 5 hrs ago Carried by a new high in personal popularity and broad approval of her work as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton closes out her diplomatic career with majority support as a candidate for president in 2016. Fifty-seven percent in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll say they'd back a run by Clinton to succeed Barack Obama, vs. 37 percent opposed. That includes a broad gender gap - 66 percent support for Clinton among women, dropping to 49 percent among men. See PDF with full results, charts and tables here. Clinton is expected to step down soon from her leadership of the State Department, a position she accepted after narrowly losing the Democratic presidential nomination to Obama in 2008. She's demurred on the prospect of another bid for the presidency. Clinton's fared well during her tenure at State; 68 percent approve of her work, second only to Colin Powell among the last five secretaries of state. (He managed a remarkable 85 percent approval in 2002 and 2003.) Similarly, two-thirds in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, see Clinton favorably overall, numerically a new high in her long public career as first lady, U.S. Senator, presidential candidate and top U.S. diplomat. Clinton's recovered from personal favorability as low as 44 percent in April 2008, during her presidential run; she also dropped that low in June 2003, when she was discussed as a possible candidate in the 2004 presidential race, and in June 1996, during the Whitewater controversy. Those dips underscore the potential risks should she climb back into the political fray. In another sign of the challenges of a political candidacy, intensity of sentiment is better for Clinton personally, and as secretary of state, than it is for her as a candidate. Her "strongly" favorable rating and strong approval of her job performance outnumber her strong negatives, in both cases, by more than 2-1 margins. Strong support for her as a candidate also outweighs strong opposition, but much more narrowly, by 9 percentage points, 36 to 27 percent. 2016 and GROUPS - Politics are comparative, so actual support for Clinton as a candidate would depend more than anything on her opponents, in the Democratic primaries and general election alike. That said, having 57 percent willing to give you a look (55 percent among registered voters) is not a bad starting point - and the differences among groups are telling. In addition to the gender gap there are sharp differences between age and racial groups, generally similar to Obama's support patterns. Young adults, age 18 to 29, support Clinton for president by nearly 2-1; that falls to an even split among seniors. And while she gets 52 percent support among whites, that jumps to 70 percent among nonwhites, a strongly Democratic group. Clinton does less well among nonwhites than did Obama, who won re-election with 80 percent of their support last month. That said, while majorities of white men and married men say they'd oppose a Clinton candidacy, she's backed by more than six in 10 white women and married women - two groups that Obama lost. Among other groups, support for Clinton in 2016 tops out at eight in 10 Democrats and liberals, vs. 23 and 24 percent of Republicans and strong conservatives, respectively. About two-thirds of moderates and six in 10 independents say they'd support a Clinton candidacy. It's hard to see Clinton winning 23 percent of Republicans in an actual campaign; no Democrat has come close to that mark in exit polls dating back 36 years. That's another sign that, while currently her numbers are positive, actually running for president can be messier than it looks from a popular perch at Foggy Bottom. METHODOLOGY - This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cell phone Nov. 28-Dec. 2, 2012, among a random national sample of 1,020 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 4 points. The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by SSRS/Social Science Research Solutions of Media, Pa.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354727881434</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:18:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354727995713-94</Id><Title>the tragedy of this nation : Obama is a shameless LIAR.</Title><Msg>We're at rock bottom.</Msg><Username>beat_army62</Username><Timestamp>1354727995713</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:19:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354727999855-95</Id><Topic><Title>Marco Rubio Clarifies The Earth’s Age: It’s ‘At Least 4.5 Billion Years Old’</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354724990045</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 11:29:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can't cure stupid.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1354727999855</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:19:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354728107887-96</Id><Topic><Title>Marco Rubio Clarifies The Earth’s Age: It’s ‘At Least 4.5 Billion Years Old’</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354724990045</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 11:29:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how funny smart guys like Rubio are forced to act stupid to appeal to the right wing nut cakes</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354728107887</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:21:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354728108376-97</Id><Title>JuniorCM sounds like a patient in a mental hospital.</Title><Msg>What a worm.

Harry Reid: Filibuster Changes Will Take Place In January Posted: 12/04/2012 4:31 pm EST Updated: 12/05/2012 11:46 am EST WASHINGTON -- Keeping with his post-election pledge to reform the filibuster, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Tuesday proffered that changes to the rules of the upper chamber will be made, leaving it up to Republicans if they would like to participate. "There are discussions going on now [over filibuster reform], but I want to tell everybody here. I'm happy I've had a number of Republicans come to me, a few Democrats,” Reid told reporters Tuesday at his weekly press availability. “We're going to change the rules. We cannot continue in this way. I hope we can get something that the Republicans will work with us on.” “But it won't be a handshake,” he added. “We tried that last time. It didn't work.” Asked to confirm if his comments meant that the rules would change and Republicans can choose to be a part of that change if they want, the Nevada Democrat responded, “That's right. Yup." Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has repeatedly slammed Democratic efforts to reform the filibuster, was unmoved by Reid’s statement. "Well, there is growing Democratic unease with breaking the rules to change the rules,” McConnell said later Tuesday at his weekly press conference. “I think it will be very difficult for that to come about. I think it will be bad for the Senate.” McConnell added that in accordance with Senate rules, such an effort would require a 67-vote majority, and that Reid’s approach to make the changes with a simple 51-vote majority -- a procedure that has been labeled a “nuclear option” by its opponents -- would be "bad for the institution, bad for the country." He continued that he hoped to see a “more sober reaction” develop to the current situation. Following the November election, Reid indicated that he would aggressively pursue a filibuster reform to stop GOP senators from continuously blocking legislation from moving forward. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) has been working with Reid on the proposed changes, which would effectively force any senators wanting to delay a vote to visibly take to the floor and talk. Once every senator had left the floor and could no longer debate, a cloture vote would be taken that would require only a simple majority rather than two-thirds of the chamber in order to pass muster. "You've got to present your case before your colleagues, before the American public," Merkley recently told The Huffington Post in an interview. "If you haven't got the guts to do that, then you shouldn't stand in the way of the majority vote." President Barack Obama has also endorsed Reid and Merkley's efforts. Most Republicans, led by McConnell, have fiercely opposed the measure, which has left Reid few options for seeing the reform through. Yet, on Monday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) expressed sympathy with supporters of changes to the filibuster, while voicing his frustration at Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and his filibuster threats and stall tactics. In his remarks on Tuesday, Reid did not name any of the Republicans who he said have expressed their support to him for filibuster reform, and his office did not immediately return a request for comment for those names.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354737895447</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:04:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354737982272-183</Id><Title>Communists, Nazis, Socialists, Democrats - All appealed to the hatreds of men for other men.

Walter Jones (N.C.), a rare moderate, and David Schweikert (Ariz.) lost their spots on the Financial Services Committee. Amash, Huelskamp and Schweikert were all first elected in the 2010 Republican wave. Republican leaders told National Journal that the Republican Steering Committee made the moves after looking at multiple factors, including voting against leadership or committee chairs too often. At a Heritage Foundation lunch Tuesday, Huelskamp suggested the purge was punishment for being too conservative: “It’s petty, its vindictive, and if you have any conservative principles you will be punished for articulating those.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354739938103</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:38:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354739942865-203</Id><Topic><Title>What is Bob Costas opinion on giving food stamps to Coyotes?</Title><Username>cages_are_the_enemy</Username><Timestamp>1354739531146</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:32:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't he the guy trying to make knives illegal because they kill people?</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1354739942865</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:39:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354740068334-204</Id><Topic><Title>It happened in Russia and Germany.

The GOP claims they will raise taxes on the wealthy by eliminating deductions! but the fact is deductions are phased out for the rich already. The tax deduction for personal tax exemptions begins to be phased out if AGI exceeds $234,600 for 2007 joint tax returns and $156,400 for 2007 single tax returns. Each tax exemption is reduced by 2% for each $2,500 by which your AGI exceeds the threshold amount until the benefit of all tax exemptions is eliminated (2007) or reduced by one-third (2008 &amp; 2009) on your tax return. All claimed tax exemptions are phased out to $2,333 for single tax return filers with an AGI of more than $282,450 in 2008 and joint tax return filers with AGI of more than $362,450 in 2008. As explained by the IRS, how much interest you deduct depends on the date the mortgage was taken out and the amount of the mortgage. If your loan was taken out before Oct. 13, 1987, there are no limits on the amount of interest that can be deducted. If it was taken out after that date, you cannot claim interest on more than $1,000,000 worth of mortgages on first and second homes, nor more than $100,000 in any loan taken out for any reason other than home purchase. Layered on the mortgage interest rules are the itemized-deduction limitations. Mortgage interest is one of many itemized deductions. In 2009, your deduction for certain types of itemized deductions, including mortgage interest, begins to phase out at an adjusted gross income of $166,800. For every $100 of income over the limit you lose $3 of itemized deduction up to a maximum loss of 80 percent of your itemized deductions. Finally, for 2008 and 2009 taxes, the reduction is multiplied by one-third.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354743992390</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:46:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354744065299-236</Id><Topic><Title>the GOP proposal is to increase taxes on everyone but the 2%</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354743992390</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:46:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so what the GOP is proposing is taxing the upper middle class but not the rich, nice</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354744065299</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:47:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354744149526-237</Id><Topic><Title>republicans are here to serve who?</Title><Username>ratfacedtrash</Username><Timestamp>1354741148281</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:59:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WRONG pal, it was BOTH.

East Coast skiing is second rate but I think Sunday River is the best if you go, lot's of trails, mountains and a lot of snow making so there are always trails open. Whistler/Blackcomb has iffy snow. My brother loves it for the night life but it is right off of the Pacific and the Chinook winds make the snow heavy. The snow report everyday reports the rain/snow line, the height at which the rain stops and the snow begins, so you spend the morning in rain getting up to the upper lifts where the snow is. Lots of fog too. Banff is a lot better it is on the other side of the mountains, it get's light powder like Utah, skied Lake Louis years ago and had the most snow I've ever seen, skied powder to my waist but there were other guys going off of lips and ended up going completely under the snow. Got 3 feet of snow one night.

So, once he does, what next? I don't believe in intervention, epecially when we need to invest at home...like W. intervention did in I R A Q!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But when a madman starts real big amounts of killing his own people....What do you think? PRE-EMPTIVE aggression (LIKE W./Cheney based on LIES) or wait until the death gas is dropped...then take over with NATO. I fear that is what will happen.
