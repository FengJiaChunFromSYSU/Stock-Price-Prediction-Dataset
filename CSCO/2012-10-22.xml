As a Dem JFK knew this and reduced rates and Federal IRS revenues increased. Increasing Debt 6 trillion bucks, got the US a ratings agency downgrade or two. See its easy to confuse the two ways government action can be used. But the outcome is not in doubt. Government must suck the life out of the economy making less money produced by the productive sector available for seed money. But then politicians who want to distribute other people's hard earned money around to buy votes at election time. Government money goes thru bureaucratic layers wasting capital feeding the monster in Washington. It is an expense not additive to America's wealth. It is subjective not a multiplier. Profit reinvested and all the tributary ancillary profits made by others (suppliers, transportation) is DIRECT stimulus and is multiplied. Reagan said it well. Let Government get out of the way of business. Every time this is done we get growth.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350879098675</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 00:11:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350879863402-3</Id><Topic><Title>Time out for a logical look at Ohio for a change</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350777909675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 20:05:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Two new Ohio polls came out yesterday after my Ohio post, from from Gravis Marketing and PPP, both of which point to a razor-thin race in the most coveted swing state. A closer look at each poll shows just how much Romney has gained since the debates, and why he would be absolutely thrilled if these polls were accurate on Election Day. The poll from Gravis Marketing shows Obama and Romney tied at 47 percent. But that’s as good as it gets for Obama. Among the most interesting tidbits from the poll: Romney leads Obama by 19 percent among independents, 52–33, and holds 92 percent of his base compared to Obama’s 87 percent. Obama is underwater in job approval, 44–50, and independents disapprove of him overwhelmingly, 31–58. And the poll has a Democratic advantage of 9 percent, which is a 4 percent jump from 2008 — no one believes that Democrats can match their 2008 turnout advantage, let alone almost double it. PPP (a Democratic firm) released their new poll yesterday showing Obama only up one point, 49 to 48. Just a week ago PPP had the race at 51–46 for Obama. But the four-point gain for Romney is even more impressive when you look at the poll’s findings: This week’s poll has a Democrat sample advantage of 8 percent; last week’s advantage was 4. Romney gained four points on Obama in a week despite the sample’s having four percentage points more Democrats. Romney leads with independents by 7 percent, up from a 5 percent last week. Obama’s approval is underwater at 48–50, and independents disapprove of him by a 41–54 margin. Last week Obama was in positive approval ground at 50–48, and independents disapproved by a much smaller 45–50 margin.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350879863402</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 00:24:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350880437624-4</Id><Topic><Title>Economics Tells You To Avoid Cisco.

No wonder your a Repub. Multiplier effect has little to do with tax cuts or the marginal tax rate. Of course the more money in the hands of the public as the result of the multiplier effect will result in additional stimulus for the economy but government spending does the same and it is direct. Government spending is not left to the whim of hoarders who would SAVE thus diminish the multiplying effect. The debt load didn't cause the debt downgrade. it was the House's threat to NOT honor the debt obligation that caused the downgrade. As for the last part of your post, what are your talking about? Just as monopolies are counterproductive to an efficient economy so are hoaders. Government never replaces the private sector, it only aids through regulation and oversight. That is what causes an equal playing field which stimulate competition thus allows the laws of supply/demand to work efficiently. If you knew half of what yopu claim, you would understand why CSCO stock only went up when Germany infused cash into the Euro countries facing default. It is the ability of government to stimulate growth and the multiplier effect that helped CSCO's stock. Now as these debt laden countries employ austerity measure, the expectation is that demand for goods and services will drop. Therefore CSCO is overvalued.</Msg><Username>superdupershortysporty</Username><Timestamp>1350880437624</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 00:33:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350880995137-5</Id><Topic><Title>Time out for a logical look at Ohio for a change</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350777909675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 20:05:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The difference is plain and simple, methodology. The pollsters switched from registered voters to likely voters. Some polls, due to the whining of Repubs, increased the proportion of Repubs they contacted. Yet even still Romney can't pull ahead. The closer the race, the more Dems will vote to make sure Romney losses. Repubs should've kept their mouths shut.

W. Bush’s 50% in 1988, and Bill Clinton’s 40% in 1992. In 2000 and 2008 George W. Bush and Barack Obama both tracked at a within-error 51%. The Gallup numbers have come under criticism from Obama supporters for their supposed inaccuracy, but the oldest established polling organization has done well in predicting the last three elections. In 2000, the final Gallup likely voter poll showed a neck and neck race, 47/45, which turned out to be a 50/50 outcome. In 2004 Gallup had the Bush/Kerry race at 49/47 and the result was 50/48. And in 2008 Gallup's final likely voter poll had Mr. Obama at 53% which was right on the money. Whether Mr. Romney's tracking numbers will hold over the next few weeks remains to be seen but right now he is on a better trajectory than any presidential challenger in the last 40+ years. Maybe the Justice Department will want to investigate.</Msg><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1350917387879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:49:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350917453395-37</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Has Best Gallup Tracking Poll Numbers Since 1968</Title><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1350917387879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:49:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jr. stop posting over me.</Msg><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1350917453395</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:50:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350917546983-38</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH CSCO ANALYST REPORT</Title><Username>danwilliam291</Username><Timestamp>1350653652093</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 09:34:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love CSCO</Msg><Username>samwilliams431</Username><Timestamp>1350917546983</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:52:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350917692342-39</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Has Best Gallup Tracking Poll Numbers Since 1968</Title><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1350917387879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:49:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hope Gallup is accurate.But with all other polls saying race is essentially tied, its hard to believe that seven point spread.</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1350917692342</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:54:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350918047389-40</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Has Best Gallup Tracking Poll Numbers Since 1968</Title><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1350917387879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:49:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The poll has likely voters, other polls mostly not. also, Gallup says margin of error is +- 2% while the poll shows +7%.

(Oct. 19, 2012) Galleries Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, Virgil Goode, Rocky Anderson and other 3rd-party candidates Celebrities who are Republican, conservative Where Obama and Romney stand on issues Web links Database: NY donations to the 2012 presidential election Election 2012 Timeline: Obama's first term According to Real Clear Politics, Mitt Romney is, on average, up by one point in the polls. According to both Nate Silver and InTrade, President Barack Obama has a better-than-60-percent chance of winning the election. I think it's fair to say that the election is, for the moment, close. But not according to Gallup. Its seven-day tracking poll shows Romney up by seven points — yes, seven — with likely voters. But he's only up by one point with registered voters. It gets weirder: Dig into the poll, and you'll find that in the most recent internals they've put on their website — which track from Oct. 9 to 15 — Obama is winning the West (+6), the East (+4) and the Midwest (+4). The only region he's losing is the South. But he's losing the South, among likely voters, by 22 points. That's enough, in Gallup's poll, for him to be behind in the national vote. But it's hard to see how that puts him behind in the electoral college. If Gallup is right, then that looks to me like we're headed for an electoral college/popular vote split. Last night, I spoke with Frank Newport, editor in chief of Gallup, to ask him if I was missing something. He said I wasn't. "That's certainly what it looks like," he said. But Newport was cautious in interpreting his numbers. Gallup's poll cheered Romney supporters because it showed Romney gaining ground even after the second debate. But Newport didn't see it like that. Remember, he warned, it's a seven-day poll. "I think we're still seeing leftover positive support for Romney, and I don't think we're seeing impact yet from the second debate," he said. What you think is going on in the race depends on whether you think the electorate will ultimately look more like Gallup's "likely voter" model, where the race is a blowout, or all registered voters, where it's a dead heat. So I asked Newport to explain the likely voter model to me. "The likely voters model takes into account changes in the response to questions about how closely they're following and how enthusiastic they are," he said. "It's not just capturing underlying movement — it's representing changes in enthusiasm." That sounds, I replied, like a model that would tend to overstate the effects of major events that favored one candidate or the other, as their supporters would grow temporarily more enthusiastic and attentive, while the other side would grow temporarily disillusioned. Newport agreed. "I wouldn't use the word 'overstate,' " he said. "But it would be very sensitive to changes in enthusiasm. The Denver debate clearly had an impact on Romney's people. I think your insight is correct there. Whether we see a dulling of that over the next several days is what I want to see."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350919260571</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 11:21:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350919579046-46</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO Breakout!</Title><Username>shebazds617</Username><Timestamp>1350913728729</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 09:48:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks legit.

Florida, Missouri and North Carolina have now shifted from Toss-Up to Leans Romney.</Msg><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1350924583971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:49:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350924720504-69</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO Breakout!</Title><Username>shebazds617</Username><Timestamp>1350913728729</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 09:48:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing this here.</Msg><Username>graham_natalie576</Username><Timestamp>1350924720504</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:52:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350924756707-70</Id><Topic><Title>Michele Bachmann In Peril As Opponent Jim Graves Nears In Polls</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350921797954</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:03:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Plus the Michigan basketball team as SEC of Dick- fense !</Msg><Username>settegast_scholar</Username><Timestamp>1350924756707</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:52:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350924774828-71</Id><Title>Florida , Missouri and North Carolina likely Romney</Title><Msg>Bad news for Obama, I mean Obozo.</Msg><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1350924774828</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:52:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350924824461-72</Id><Topic><Title>The Trend is Our Friend</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1350923886779</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:38:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OReilly had some professor on the other night (forgot his name) says Romney will win by 5-7 points and get around 330 electoral votes.

Then I hope he goes on TV like W and says the voters have given him a clear mandate to continue his policies. LOL the baggers heads will explode. The FiveThirtyEight forecast was essentially unchanged again on Sunday, with Mr. Obama retaining a 67.6 percent chance of winning the Electoral College, little different from his 67.9 percent odds on Friday and Saturday. These estimates might seem to be incongruous with national polls that show a nearly tied race. But the FiveThirtyEight method is, principally, an Electoral College simulation, and therefore relies more heavily on state-by-state polls. Our estimates of the popular vote in the critical states are highly similar to those of other Web sites that use different methods to calculate them.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350925726246</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 13:08:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350925964265-88</Id><Title>Anyone else notice</Title><Msg>how the market started going down as soon as Romney started to go up in the polls?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350925964265</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 13:12:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350926101652-89</Id><Title>I am glad.I moved my money to TIVO</Title><Msg>TiVo Wants "Billions" From Google and Cisco</Msg><Username>grodzki2000</Username><Timestamp>1350926101652</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 13:15:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350926118534-90</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO Breakout!</Title><Username>shebazds617</Username><Timestamp>1350913728729</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 09:48:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this one ROCKS!!!subscribe now!!!</Msg><Username>edwards_katie592</Username><Timestamp>1350926118534</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 13:15:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350926616923-91</Id><Title>Will Bammy win a Nobel Peace Prize ...</Title><Msg>when he loses the election?

All Known Communication Services | star date 10/69/18383 | self Posted on October 9, 2009 9:33:14 AM EDT by erman In one of the most surreal and unusual days since the creation of the earth our President has been awarded both the Pulitzer Prize and an Oscar. These awards will join his Nobel Prize on the mantel along with his numerous other awards including; Olympic gold medals for both the summer decathlon and the Winter Olympic medals in figure skating. -MTV music award presented by Kanye West -Grammy Award for thinking about writing a riff for a rap song -Masters Green Jacket because everyone at Augusta National figured he would probably set a course record if he felt like it. -Super Bowl MVP trophy because the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers assured everybody last year that Obama was chiefly responsible for their win Eagle Scout Award-for his efforts in encouraging "safe school czar" Kevin Jennings to take up scouting. -Emmy Award for his innumerable television appearances His Pulitzer Prize was awarded, stated the committee, not for any writing that he may have done, but because of the idea that he may write a book in the future and it would most assuredly be "one of the most profound works of literature since the Bible and Shakespeare." The Oscar was for awarded for Producer, Director, Screenplay, and Best Picture for his work on home video he shot of the family at the Grand Canyon. A movie reviewed by the New York times to be a "seminal moment in cinematic history" that would "revolutionize the way we see a family exploring the inner workings of family desperately trying to save the world". Some have said that Orson Wells may have plagiarized large portions of Citizen Kane in homage to the Obama movies of the past. While Steven Speilberg has stated that the Hussein family has inspired roles in several of his movies, most notably Hans Solo's companion and co-pilot whose name shall not be mentioned. Still up for consideration for the Congressional Medal of Honor, Wimbledon championship trophy and of course NBA Player of the Year honors are left ...... for later this week.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350926991199</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 13:29:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350926995481-95</Id><Topic><Title>You know what is most disturbing?</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1350926781071</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 13:26:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course, all politicians lie.

(The Borowitz Report)—With just hours to go until the third and final Presidential debate, Republican nominee Mitt Romney today voiced his support “for a woman’s most precious right: to choose what she makes for dinner.” In a bid designed to close the gender gap in the race, the former Massachusetts Governor pledged “on Day One” to give women full control over meal planning and preparation. “Pot roast, meatloaf, duck a l’orange—as long as it’s piping hot and on the table when her husband comes home, I don’t care what a gal makes,” he told supporters. Mr. Romney also unveiled his latest immigration proposal, which would allow immigrants to become citizens “by going to fight in Iran.” The nominee’s campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, said that tonight Mr. Romney hopes to improve upon his performance in the second debate, in which he slipped and told the truth three times. “That was surprising for Mitt,” he said. “But even Michael Jordan missed a layup now and then.” .</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350935479322</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 15:51:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350935752396-122</Id><Topic><Title>Romney supports women's rights!</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350935479322</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 15:51:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see you lefties are poking fun at women again.

There was a less noticed, but no less remarkable, moment when Mr. Obama agreed with Mr. Romney on something — and both were entirely wrong. Related in Opinion Taking Note: The Debate Was Great for Democrats, but Not for Liberals (October 17, 2012) Times Topic: United States Elections For Op-Ed, follow @nytopinion and to hear from the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, follow @andyrNYT. The exchange began with a question about the offshoring of American jobs. Part of Mr. Obama’s answer was that federal investments in education, science and research would help to ensure that companies invest and hire in the United States. Mr. Romney interrupted. “Government does not create jobs,” he said. “Government does not create jobs.” It was a decidedly crabbed response to a seemingly uncontroversial observation, and yet Mr. Obama took the bait. He said his political opponents had long harped on “this notion that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer. That’s not what I believe.” He went on to praise free enterprise and to say that government’s role is to create the conditions for everyone to have a fair shot at success. So, they agree. Government does not create jobs. Except that it does, millions of them — including teachers, police officers, firefighters, soldiers, sailors, astronauts, epidemiologists, antiterrorism agents, park rangers, diplomats, governors (Mr. Romney’s old job) and congressmen (like Paul Ryan). First, the basics. At last count, government at all levels — federal, state and local — employed 22 million Americans, with the largest segment working in public education. Is that too many? No. Since the late 1980s, the number of public-sector workers has averaged about 7.3 for every 100 people. With the loss of 569,000 government jobs since June 2009, that ratio now stands at about 7 per 100. Public-sector job loss means trouble for everyone. Government jobs are crucial to education, public health and safety, environmental protection, defense, homeland security and myriad other functions that the private sector cannot fulfill. They are also critical for private-sector job growth in two fundamental ways. First, the government gets its supplies from private-sector companies, which is why Republican senators like John McCain have been frantically warning about the dire effects on job creation if Congress moves ahead with planned military spending cuts. (Republicans insisted upon the cuts as part of their ill-advised showdown over the debt ceiling.) Second, government spending on supplies and salaries reverberates strongly through the economy, increasing demand and with it, employment. That means the economy suffers when government cuts back. A report by the Economic Policy Institute examined the effect of recent cutbacks at the state and local level — including direct loss of government jobs and indirect loss of suppliers’ jobs; the jobs that should have been added to keep up with population growth; and the reduction in purchasing power from other cutbacks. If not for state and local budget austerity, the report found, the economy would have 2.3 million more jobs today, half of which would be in the private sector. The government does not create jobs? It most certainly does. And at this time of state budgetary hardship, a dose of federal fiscal aid to states and localities could create more jobs, in both the public and private sectors.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350937798643</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:29:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350937900934-132</Id><Topic><Title>junior and the rest of the libTurds(his other IDs?) still confused</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1350937149783</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:19:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jr might try to sneak up on stage during the debates and try to take mitts face off swearing its bush wearing a mask. bwahahahahahahahahahahaha i think jr has wet brain HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1350937900934</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:31:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350938039113-133</Id><Title>Jesse Jackson Jr winning ????

October 22nd, 2012 7:15 am Axel Tonconogy As both presidential campaigns ratchet up their efforts to capture Ohio’s 18 electoral votes, recent polling suggests the race might already be over—for Mitt Romney. Certain key data from the latest polls suggest that President Obama’s victory in the Buckeye State could be a foregone conclusion — because each survey suggests that President Obama holds a double digit lead among those who have already voted. SurveyUSA’s poll showed Obama leading 57 to 38 percent — a 19-point margin. Rasmussen Reports, a Republican-leaning pollster, found Obama leading by 29 points, 63 to 34 percent. The Wall Street Journal/NBC News showed Obama ahead by 26 points, 63 to 37 percent. A PPP poll found Obama leading by the largest margin of all, 76 to 24 percent. In all of these cases, the numbers cited reflect only those who have already voted. Another important indicator that bodes well for Obama can be found in the registration numbers. According to a memo released by the Obama campaign, four in five in Ohioans who have registered to vote this cycle are either female, younger than 30, or African-American or Latino, which are all demographics that lean strongly Democratic. Additionally, almost two-thirds of Ohioans who registered to vote live in counties where Obama won in 2008. Other favorable statistics for Obama can be found in the early voting data. Specifically, 55 percent of the early-vote ballots requested in 2012 come from women, which is 3 percentage points greater than in 2008. Part of the reason the Obama campaign has been doing so well in Ohio (and swing states in general when compared to his national polling numbers), is that Ohio’s economy is doing better than the national average. Unemployment is currently at 7 percent, down from 7.2 percent, or 0.8 percent below the national figure in September. Many of those jobs are in manufacturing and were created by the auto rescue — sectors that have been a centerpiece of the re-election campaign.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350938119086</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:35:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350938268041-136</Id><Title>IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE CONTROLS THE MONEY SUPPLY...</Title><Msg>How does this 'democracy' work again ?

Poll Romney 48% to 45% Obama &amp; winning in early voting</Title><Msg>Currently, Gov. Romney leads the incumbent by 48% to 45% among likely American voters. Following the first debate earlier this month, Romney held a one point lead. The current results mark a reversal from Monmouth’s mid-September poll when Pres. Obama held a 48% to 45% advantage in vote intention. Currently, 3% of likely voters say they will vote for another candidate and 5% are still undecided about their choice – results which have held steady since June. About 12% of the poll’s likely voter sample reports they have already cast their presidential ballot in early voting. Among this group, Romney got 44% of the vote to 41% for Obama – an edge which is within the margin of error for this sub-group.</Msg><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1350938521014</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:42:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350938590708-141</Id><Topic><Title>3 socialist Obama people arrested</Title><Username>obvaccdismf</Username><Timestamp>1350932606622</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 15:03:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>children do what children do. they are going to be angry if obama wins they just dont get it yet.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1350938590708</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:43:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350938611750-142</Id><Topic><Title>Monmouth U.

Anne and Mitt lived in a flat with concrete floors slept with mattresses on the floor and had children while he was in school. To me that means either he was not eligible because he qualified in two catagories. A. He had a College Deferment B. He had children and was sole support. His money would not have anything to do with this because he gave up his inherited wealth and lived like a pauper. All Mormons who practice unlike Harry Reid become missionaries, as such they would have a religious deferment. Clinton denounced his country in Russia, yet Libs like you embraced him and hated his being called a draft dodger.

Selective Service registration. Obama’s Selective Service registration is public. A copy has been posted publicly, and the Selective Service confirmed that Obama registered for the draft on Sept. 4, 1980, and was given registration number 61-1125539-1. Worth noting is that nobody in the U.S. has been drafted for military service since 1972, the year Obama turned 11. Obama, like other young men turning age 18 since then, was required to register on a standby basis, in case Congress ever resumes an active military draft. Failure to register is technically a crime, and disqualifies a man for federal student aid or from holding certain federal jobs. Yeah I know your answer, the Bush administration covered it up when he was running, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350953387564</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 20:49:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350953711724-229</Id><Topic><Title>Draft Dodger Romney Was Overseas Hiding With Clinton</Title><Username>kaptnkirk53</Username><Timestamp>1350945751871</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 18:42:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama's registration is a FRAUD just like all his other supposed legal documents.

Romney was eloquent, polite, well behaved. Presidential, much more] than Obama who was still angry. Romney wins this debate by holding his own and showing that he is not reckless and irresponsible and won't get us into a war. He scored big on China screwing with us taking our intellectual property, manipulation of currency. Romney hit Obama on his Apology tour. I loved the joke that the tour didn't include Israel. On that Romney increase his vote with Jewish. He pointed out how Obama mistreats Israel our ally. Romney could have hit the embassy murders more, could have made point on Mexico F and F. More could have been made on Terrorism didn't die with OBL. Good point on the failure of the Arab Spring. IMHO, Romney got in his points with no gaffes, no lies, he won the last two debates so he just had to convince women he wasn't to be feared as a Cowboy wanting to go to war. I felt he was more subdued on purpose, he was appealing to undecided , independents and women. As a woman I am looking forward to having guy who doesn't need a teleprompter as President. He is so handsome not like Bush or Obama. He sound and acts Classy, looks like a hunk. I think he came off as a Class Act, Obama is the Chicago Thug Street Organizer. Obama looked desperate. Angry.

Agreed Romney is easy on the eyes and he has a very nice voice. I sense Romney is a deeply religious and honest man who would not lie like Obama did for weeks about Benghazi Embassy. We want the truth especially when it is a mistake. We don't want a President who hides his past, his mistakes and is always lying about his intentions. Our friends and allies around the world don't like Obama, we don't like a President who says one thing publically and when caught on an open mike is telling a different story. We don't want a naive President who let Iran get 4 years closer to a Nuke Holocaust. We don't want a fool who stabbed Mubarak in the back only to let the Muslim Brotherhood replace a man who for 35 years kept his word to us and Peace with Israel. We want real bi partisanship, not broken promises. We need an economic miracle now after Obama made a bad situation worse. We need a man like Romney who knows how to turn losses into success and failure into profit. Hopefully we get a GOP senate too so Romney can turn the economy around in 2 years.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350961156119</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 22:59:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350961165941-299</Id><Topic><Title>too funny, Mitt agreed with every single Obama policy! who is this guy?</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1350960792692</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 22:53:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed????

Better. Obama broke most of his foreign affairs promises like closing gitmo, supporting Israel, getting us totally out of Iraq, not getting into any more countries, like Libya. he said we would be out of Afganistan 2 years ago. Obama's GE jobs council cheif shipped jobs to China, Obama sent 28million bucks overseas for failed green jobs. Obama has strained our relationship with the UK over the Falklands. Was not tough on Pakistan. Obama lost Lech Wallessa over his cutting out the defensive shield and getting nothing in return from Russia Obama has not stopped Iran from sending weapons to Hezzbollah and Hamas.
