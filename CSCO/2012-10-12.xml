CNN’s Gloria Berger said that she would have liked Biden to show less “condescension” and “eye-rolling.” Even MSNBC’s Chris Wallace — said that Biden “was openly contemptuous and disrespectful” of Ryan (h/t Lachlan Markay). “Mr. Vice President, I know you’re under a lot of duress to make up lost ground, but I think people will be better served if we don’t keep interrupting each other,” Ryan said during the debate. CNN’s Erin Burnett said that “Women tended to rate Paul Ryan more highly.”</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350015549093</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 00:19:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350015757087-4</Id><Title>Zebradouche was tonights big loser Biden was better than Zero but he lost too.</Title><Msg>This won't help Obama gain momentum</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350015757087</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 00:22:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350019481021-5</Id><Topic><Title>UNDOCUMENTED IMIGRANT KILLED WHILE WORKING ON 405 FREEWAY WHERE IS OSHA???</Title><Username>republicans_rnot_people_persons</Username><Timestamp>1350001429071</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 20:23:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where was the unionized 'hat check' man?

According to the constitutional scholar Davis Logsdon, of the University of Minnesota, the scenario of Mr. Biden appearing in all the remaining debates, while surely unorthodox, is within the realm of possibility: “According to the Constitution, the Vice-President steps in when the President is unable to fulfill his duties. Based on the first debate, that seems to be the case.” Mr. Biden got off to a strong start in the debate, which began with moderator Martha Raddatz asking him and Rep. Paul Ryan, “Gentlemen, first question: To the best of your ability, smirk sarcastically at your opponent.” The Vice-President rose to that challenge, smiling broadly and snickering throughout all of Mr. Ryan’s answers, and characterizing them with virtually every Irish synonym for sh$t. Mr. Biden’s performance clearly wowed the Democratic voters in the post-debate poll, as ninety per cent of them “strongly agreed” with the statement, “Obama should crush a little bit of Joe Biden into a joint and smoke it.” .</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350053875396</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:57:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350054094451-66</Id><Title>Do you think that anybody will want to debate Biden again? lol...</Title><Msg>Pull your pants down, he said, so that I can spank you.</Msg><Username>barsnippymansford</Username><Timestamp>1350054094451</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:01:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350054238663-67</Id><Topic><Title>GOPers embarassed about last nites debate</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350053875396</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:57:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seems gfo99 doesn't realize sarcasm.That blog was a slam against both Biden and Obama.

Here are Stewart's 10 funniest quotes from the night: 1. "Why is it that if you take advantage of a tax break and you're a corporation, you're a smart businessman, but if you take advantage of something you need to not be hungry, you're a moocher?" 2. After O'Reilly named Clint Eastwood as the famous person he'd pick for U.S. President. Stewart responded by getting out of his chair and addressing the seat cushion: "Why don't we ask him?" 3. "My friend Bill O'Reilly is completely full of #$%$. A good portion of this country has created an alternate universe in which the issues we face revolve around a woman from Georgetown." (Referring to Sandra Fluke) 4. "I'm here to plead to the mayor of Bull#$%$ Mountain. Talk to your people!" 5. While discussing cutting funding for PBS: "Give me back the $800 billion for the Iraq war and children's television is on the house." 6. O'Reilly: "[Fox News] is making a billion dollars a year, so something's going right." Stewart: "Yes, you can't make money selling crap in America." 7. Asked "Which famous person would you save if the U.S. were burning?", O'Reilly answered "Oprah -- she's worth about $100 billion." Stewart replied, "My family?" 8. "The first sentence of the Constitution mentions unions and welfare. I don't know what to tell ya." 9. When asked how he would justify voting for President Obama: "Here's what I would say -- turns out Lincoln ain't running this year." 10. Stewart's advice for young people:"Everybody talks about the entitlement generation. There is no time I would rather live in than now. ...There's a tendency to live in a nostalgic state in this country, and think that other generations possessed an integrity and a tenacity better than the generation that is now.

It is unclear from the above clip, however, what triggered the dispute. [WARNING: The video is peppered with curse words and racial slurs.] The driver of bus 2802 leaves his seat after the woman appears to strike him. "You going to jail now," the driver says twice before throwing an uppercut that knocks the woman to the ground. The driver then throws the woman off the stopped bus, though she climbs back aboard and tussles with him. "She want to be a man, I'm gonna treat you like a man," the driver announces at one point."

The survey conducted this week found 51 percent of likely Florida voters supporting Romney, 44 percent backing Obama and 4 percent undecided.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350065133272</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:05:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350065369289-110</Id><Topic><Title>Big lead for Romney in Florida</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350065133272</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:05:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These are two separate polls from today, so ignore JR. he is pulling his polling out of his #$%$</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350065369289</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:09:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350065466066-111</Id><Topic><Title>Romney ahead in Virginia</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350064800649</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:00:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here is another poll that says JR. is a lying sac of excrement Mitt Romney has taken a commanding 7-point lead over President Barack Obama in another Virginia poll. According to a McLaughlin &amp; Associates poll that had an R+.02 sample, Romney leads Obama in Virginia 51%-44%. Among independents, Romney beats Obama by 11 points, 50%-39%. If these numbers hold for Romney, Romney could be free to expand the electoral map and more aggressively make plays for states like Michigan and Pennsylvania that were considered "reaches" just two weeks ago. In addition, this poll, which has Romney leading by double-digits among independents and has a sample that is more reflective of what the turnout will be in November than other polls, may be a more accurate snapshot of Virginia's electorate than other mainstream media polls.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350065466066</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:11:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350065751099-112</Id><Topic><Title>Report inside with a good link Cisco Systems, Inc.</Title><Username>laticiahzycf47705</Username><Timestamp>1350054501688</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:08:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm looking for great articles, Nice to be here.</Msg><Username>kaciezmjvs61315</Username><Timestamp>1350065751099</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:15:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350066072610-113</Id><Title>I hope Romney gets back at Martha for her biased moderation of debate</Title><Msg>Ryan won the debate even liberal CNN poll showed that. Ryan was double teamed. Martha the Radish let Biden go past his alloted time and always cut Ryan off, sometimes she interrupted when Ryan was attacking Obama's record. Martha the Radish is a good friend of Obama's and she was blocking for him last night Martha the Radish let Joe Biden interrupt Ryans time 82 times, that is some measure of this biatches bias, what moderator lets the rules be broken 82 times? I hope Romney gets even when he is President. He can pull her press pass, deny her interviews, never allow her at a press conference. She is a Democrat political operative, not a journalist, not even a commentator, she is a biased enemy of the GOP and should be treated as one.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350066072610</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:21:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350066343630-114</Id><Topic><Title>What are they thinking?</Title><Username>ettiednm075278</Username><Timestamp>1350049851236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 09:50:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An article that's worth a read.</Msg><Username>darciesnry545421</Username><Timestamp>1350066343630</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 14:25:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350067192694-115</Id><Topic><Title>Anybody watch this debate?</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350055752503</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:29:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not interested in watching an foul mouth obnoxious Jerry Springer wannabe (Jon Stewart) who has a handful of viewers.

She didn't even try to hide the fact that she was going out of her way to help the Obama campaign win the debate.

These seemingly contradictory verses are actually a common form of parallelism found in the Old Testament, where one idea builds upon another. Verse 4 warns against arguing with a fool on his own terms, lest we stoop to his level and become as foolish as he is. Because he despises wisdom and correction, the fool will not listen to wise reason and will try to draw us into his type of argument, whether it is by using deceit, scoffing at our wisdom, or becoming angry and abusive. If we allow him to draw us into this type of discourse, we are answering him “according to his folly” in the sense of becoming like him."</Msg><Username>arnold_schwarzenegger_sukks</Username><Timestamp>1350069829083</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:23:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350070161807-126</Id><Title>Proverbs 29:9 Applies to Joe Biden (the fool)</Title><Msg>Proverbs 29:9 "If a wise man has an argument with a fool, the fool only rages and laughs, and there is no quiet.</Msg><Username>arnold_schwarzenegger_sukks</Username><Timestamp>1350070161807</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:29:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350070396640-127</Id><Title>Pauline Ryan desperately seeking to keep day job</Title><Msg>for now.

Nixon’s “Southern Strategy” will have been dismantled and a new, moderately center-left Democratic coalition built by President Obama. For the first time since 1972, the Rush Limbaugh/Mike Huckabee wing of the GOP will find itself with no clear path to power. (Not that there’s anything remotely holy about Limbaugh; I’m talking demographics here, not theology.) The existential shock would be considerable. Not since the 1960s, when successive civil rights laws overcame the region’s “massive resistance” and ended legal segregation, have certain kinds of white Southerners experienced such anger and trepidation. Boo hoo hoo. Moreover, should Obama be successful in rebuilding the U.S. economy during a second term, and once voters grasp that “Obamacare” has liberated them from the fear of being driven into bankruptcy by medical emergencies, the new Democratic coalition could prove to have a kind of staying power not seen since FDR and Truman. Indeed, it’s been Republican anxiety over that very possibility in the wake of George W. Bush’s spectacular failures that led to the GOP’s Washington version of massive resistance during Obama’s first-term. Or, to put it another way, if President Obama can win in this economy, how could any talented Democratic candidate lose? The temptation for Southern Republicans would be to double down on the crazy, because “conservatism,” so-called, can never fail, only be failed. Also because religious melodrama is really what an awful lot of them are really about. That, and Koch Brothers money. They’re not actually conservatives at all, in the classical sense, but sentimental fanatics seeking to purge the nation of sin; adepts of “limited government” with their noses buried in women’s panty drawers; apostles of a lost Utopia located in a non-existent past, most often in 60s sitcoms like “The Andy Griffith Show.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350082291495</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 18:51:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350082351077-164</Id><Topic><Title>What are they thinking?</Title><Username>ettiednm075278</Username><Timestamp>1350049851236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 09:50:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice one.

Full text follows: Last night, the following statement was made during the Vice Presidential debate regarding the decision of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to force virtually all employers to include sterilization and contraception, including drugs that may cause abortion, in the health insurance coverage they provide their employees: "With regard to the assault on the Catholic Church, let me make it absolutely clear. No religious institution—Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic social services, Georgetown hospital, Mercy hospital, any hospital—none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact. That is a fact." This is not a fact. The HHS mandate contains a narrow, four-part exemption for certain "religious employers." That exemption was made final in February and does not extend to "Catholic social services, Georgetown hospital, Mercy hospital, any hospital," or any other religious charity that offers its services to all, regardless of the faith of those served. HHS has proposed an additional "accommodation" for religious organizations like these, which HHS itself describes as "non-exempt." That proposal does not even potentially relieve these organizations from the obligation "to pay for contraception" and "to be a vehicle to get contraception." They will have to serve as a vehicle, because they will still be forced to provide their employees with health coverage, and that coverage will still have to include sterilization, contraception, and abortifacients. They will have to pay for these things, because the premiums that the organizations (and their employees) are required to pay will still be applied, along with other funds, to cover the cost of these drugs and surgeries. USCCB continues to urge HHS, in the strongest possible terms, actually to eliminate the various infringements on religious freedom imposed by the mandate.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350084090796</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 19:21:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350084398424-169</Id><Title>Biden lied about Iran not having a Nuke device ready</Title><Msg>The IAEA says they tested one without fissile material, they have photographic satellite evidence.
