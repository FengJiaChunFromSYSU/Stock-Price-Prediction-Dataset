Christians aren't the only religion which believes in eternity. It might be argumentum ad populum to say so, but you are way outnumbered. I am a Shamanist. We believe in the eternal soul.

That leaves the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in place, which it extended. The only trouble is the United States never ratified the accords, which call for reducing national emissions of CO2 and related gases to 1990 levels by 2020. To make matters worse, in the intervening years, Canada and Japan opted out of the accords. With Doha a failure, and Kyoto in tatters, everyone knows Global Warming was a Al Gore/Obama TAX SCAM!!! The United States has become one of the cleanest, greenest countries on earth, relative to the size of its gross domestic product. In 2008, CO2 emissions were about 1,600 million metric tons a year, according to the EIA. Today, they are 1,300 metric tons, a drop of nearly 20 percent. America's greenhouse gases are back to 1992 levels. This summer's heat wave was caused by the solar maximum not Global Warming. Trading carbon credits will not do jack to change the weather. Are you brainwashed? The reason for the change is price, not politics or treaties. Natural gas, which emits 43 percent less CO2 than coal, and releases no particulate matter into the atmosphere, is now the cheapest fuel available for producing electricity since the technology of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, was perfected. As a consequence, the electricity industry has made a lightening fast changeover in the fuels it uses. In 2008, about half of America's electricity was produced by burning coal, with 20 percent produced from natural gas, according to the EIA. Today, 40 percent of our electricity comes from natural gas with coal's share just 32 percent. Obama doesn't like coal. Obama doesn't like oil. Obama wants recession to control the lemmings. Obama has spent like a drunken sailor and now the cupboards are bare. A deep recession followed by three years of lackluster growth contributed to America's unprecedented reduction in emissions. But while those reductions in emissions are likely to be temporary, the gains from the utility industry moving to natural gas are likely to be permanent. The reason for that is that the nation's largest natural gas fields have barely been developed. Obama does not support the Pickens plan. Obama does not support fracking. Obama is prosecuting natural gas drillers. Obama is NOT prosecuting marijuana smokers. American consumers have been brainwash into thinking that buying cheaper will make them wealthier.... well, it ain't gonna happen because cheaper items only breed cheaper wages. 1975 was the last year America had a trade surplus. that's 37 years of Retail (that makes nothing) taking dollars from the "have's" in America and giving those dollars to the "have-nots" of foreign lands.... Wal*Mart has their Global Procurement Office in China.... what you may not know....Wal*Mart puts less than 5% foreign in all their stores in China.....that keeps the Chinese currency in China helping each hand it touches... The American dollar can't help anyone in America if it be in a foreign hand. America has a 6 to 1 trade deficit with China. America needs to wake-up and smell the coffee!!!</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1355585087812</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 10:24:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355585985554-43</Id><Topic><Title>BAN ALL GOVT UNION TEACHERS !!!</Title><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1355565789944</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 05:03:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Disband the unions.

It's not known how many of those have contributed to the *** sub-prime housing mortgage meltdown ***, but it has affected every state, including Arizona. The problem began years ago when banks were forced to give mortgages without confirming social security numbers or borrower identification. As a result, illegal immigrants were able to obtain home mortgages which they could not afford. *** Obama is not enforcing laws against choomers and illegal aliens because he identifies with them.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1355586239810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 10:43:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355586292822-45</Id><Topic><Title>Blame it on the gay people</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355581627416</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 09:27:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Blame Obama.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1355586292822</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 10:44:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355586460765-46</Id><Title>Ya gonna want to attend a football game in Mi?

Amidst a lameduck session that has spawned a host of right-wing legislation, including a so-called “right-to-work” law and an extreme abortion ban, a “sweeping rewrite of Michigan’s concealed handgun law” was also approved yesterday. The legislation changes Michigan’s gun laws in a number of ways, including making it easier for people to receive a gun permit and opening up “gun free zones,” including schools and elsewhere, to people carrying concealed firearms. The legislation is the largest rewrite of Michigan’s concealed weapon law since lawmakers made hard-to-obtain permits much easier for adults to receive beginning July 2001. Applications exploded. There were 351,599 permit holders as of Dec. 1, one for every 20 adults. Most of the attention on the new bill has focused on provisions allowing hidden handguns in places where they are now forbidden, such as schools, university dorms and classrooms, and sporting stadiums. The bill now sits on Gov. Rick Snyder’s (R) desk, who must decide whether to approve or veto the legislation.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355586460765</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 10:47:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355587947124-47</Id><Topic><Title>Al Qaeda leader instructs terrorists to purchase firearms at U.S. gun shows</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1355580740253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 09:12:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GOP supports terrorists they think it helps them politically</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355587947124</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 11:12:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355590538505-48</Id><Title>Needs a bigger vocabulary</Title><Msg>Can anybody explain why both Junior and dumbivan call everybody else either retarded, teabillies,or teabaggers?

This was an evil act and to create policies and programs based on the propensity for men to do evil is justified and appropriate. This is the wrong time, too raw, too soon, too much unbearable emotion to make clear decisions and policies. That school was clearly well programed, was NEARLY as secure as you can make a school, and as best I can see, lacked only one ingredient that MAY have prevented this particular horror, an armed guard on premise. They had a secure entrance, and so forth. There will be time to evaluate better strategy, but knee jerk reaction is too often in error. Even when bright minds attempt it. Certainly this was an unspeakably evil act. The power of men to oppose evil, so tightly bound into each human heart, is limited, but the effort is worth it. The Christian message, beginning with the celebration of the Christ child's birth, is that men must be born again, so radically changed that it is best to compare it to a 'new start, a re-birth', breaking the hold of evil over that man's heart and life. This hope is available to one and all, and the promise of a new life, of such remarkable quality that it is labeled 'eternal' is the promise of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the hope we have is that life is not over when the human body is interred, but mankind has the example of the risen Christ and the promise of paradise and unending joy. "If it were not so, I would not have told you. I go to prepare a place for you..... ...and will come again" Peace......even and especially now, to all, even my Democratic friends.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1355596083444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 13:28:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355596136516-57</Id><Topic><Title>how about that union thug saving all those children?</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1355595873953</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 13:24:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She acted like a true hero, not a thug.
