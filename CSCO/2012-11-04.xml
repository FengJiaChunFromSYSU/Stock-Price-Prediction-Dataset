I didn't make it up, what you think they forgot the billions Obama gave Hamas and Fatah. How he wanted Israel to go back to the indefensible 1967 borders. This Zebradouche was in Egypt and Jordan yet never went to Israel. He treated Netanyahu like crap. He is a Mooslim pretender, and has allowed Iran 4 years to get a Nuke. Friends don't let friends get Nuked. Obama is an enemy of the people of Israel American Jews living there understand, American Jews living here in the USA are more interested in abortion, contraceptives, and gays than their 7 million brothers and sisters' safety in Israel. Liberalism is a mental disease.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352001670018</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 00:01:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352001908364-2</Id><Topic><Title>THE "BUSH_HOLE" and the "OBAMA RESCUE".

Jobs not being created Don’t let the official 7.8 percent unemployment rate for September fool you; work-force participation is at a record low and 23 million American are looking for work. Ten times as many people have dropped out of the work force during Obama’s term than have found a job. His last attempt at helping the unemployed—the 2009 stimulus package—cost nearly a trillion dollars with minimal impact on creating actual jobs. 2. Debt crisis spiraling Under Obama, the nation has accumulated nearly $6 trillion in debt over four years and a second term would likely add more. The cost of financing the national debt will quickly skyrocket as interest rates rise. Obama’s only plan to staunch the bleeding is to tax the rich. But even if he succeeds in letting the Bush tax cuts expire for families with incomes over $250,000, the annual deficit of $1.2 trillion would only fall to $1.12 trillion. 3. Obamacare outrages Obama’s signature achievement—the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act—is more unpopular today than it was when he signed it into law. Obamacare adds to the deficit, while raising taxes on Americans of all stripes, even while harming job creation. Many families will lose their current health care coverage and surveys of doctors show many will flee the profession. 4. Foreign policy unraveling The attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi—and the administration’s incompetence after—is a dramatic example of the unraveling of Obama’s entire approach to foreign policy. Now Muslim mobs are protesting the United States around the world, apparently unswayed by Obama’s Cairo outreach. Add his ill-fated Russia “reset,” and his snub of world leaders at the United Nations and the result is a foreign policy with not a single positive achievement. 5. Economic anemia We didn’t expect a rapid recovery after the recession, but we’re past a point where the economy should have begun to show steady growth as businesses become more confident, hire workers and consumer spending increases. But growth this year is under 2 percent. With crushing burdens and uncertainties heaped onto businesses—from Dodd-Frank and Obamacare to EPA regulations and tax hikes—Obama has managed to defy the business cycle. 6. Class warfare rhetoric Obama has taken class warfare to a new level, attacking the successful as being greedy and heartless for not paying their fare share. He demonizes bankers, Wall Street and demands that the “millionaires and billionaires” be taxed at higher rates. The irony of it all is that his policies will do the most harm to the middle class, with his job killing programs, and small businesses, by hiking their taxes. 7. Partisan politics Unlike Presidents Reagan, H.W. Bush, Clinton, and G.W. Bush who all reached across the aisle to secure legislation with bipartisan support, Obama has tried to ram through his agenda without any help, as many of his major initiatives failed to attract a single GOP vote. For a president who promised change, he has only increased its harshness by constantly attacking the opposition. 8. No more Biden After his debate with Paul Ryan, Vice President Joe Biden’s “regular-guy” schtick is wearing thin. His smirking and laughing, when the nation wanted to hear a serious debate on the issues, was demeaning to the office, and makes the idea of “Crazy Joe” being a heartbeat away from the presidency a sobering thought. We can only hope that with a Romney-Ryan victory, Biden will go ahead and get a one-way Amtrak ticket back to Delaware, or better yet, Scranton, Pa. 9. Clean house of incompetents It’s not only the anticipation of Biden’s departure from office that gives cheer, but finally the nation can get rid of the whole gang that couldn’t shoot straight. From White House spokesman Jay Carney and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice’s cloudy account of the Libya attack to Attorney General Eric Holder’s outrageous obfuscation on Fast and Furious, we’ve seen quite enough of Chicago-style politics. 10. No plan for future Just as Obama has found it hard to run on his record, his constant attacks on Romney mask the fact that he doesn’t have much of a plan to turn things around. A president’s normal route for pushing an agenda is often contained in his annual budget request to Congress. Obama’s spending blueprint is such a joke that every year it is the Republicans that introduce it as a bill and then both sides of the aisle unanimously vote against it. His only plan is to tax and spend the U.S. into oblivion, with future generations crushed by a mountain of debt.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1352004906501</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 00:55:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352005157953-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obama said that voting is the best revenge.</Title><Username>jt200942</Username><Timestamp>1351984887034</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 19:21:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is full of hatred.

He’s been using that talent in just about every campaign appearance, and it makes me very happy. These two towering narcissists have never liked each other and everybody knows it. Here’s Bill’s latest smiling backstab, courtesy of the Washington Free Beacon: “I hear all these people say, ‘Oh, I was so enthusiastic four years ago. I had so much hope for change. And I’m disappointed.’ And this, that, and the other thing. Let me tell you something: I may be the only person in America, but I am far more enthusiastic about President Obama this time than I was four years ago.” Hillary 2016.

Biden's statement to the press: "Ya know, I kinda put my foot in my mouth the other day...

By 1817, Smith's family had moved to the "burned-over district" of western New York, an area repeatedly swept by religious revivals during the Second Great Awakening. Smith family members held divergent views about organized religion, but they believed in visions and prophecies and engaged in folk religious practices typical of the era. Smith briefly investigated Methodism, but he was generally disillusioned with the churches of his day. In the early 1820s, along with other male members of his family, Smith began using a seer stone to search for buried treasure. Also during this period, Smith said he had a series of visions, the first of which he later said was a theophany. In 1823, Smith said angel directed him to a nearby hill where he said was buried a book of golden plates containing a Christian history of ancient American civilizations. According to Smith, the angel prevented him from taking the plates in 1823, but the angel told him to come back in exactly a year with the "right person," perhaps his brother Alvin, who died before the 1824 visit. Nevertheless, Smith continued to return to Cumorah over the next three years, reporting to his family that he had not yet been allowed to take the plates. Meanwhile, during one of Smith's treasure hunting expeditions, he fell in love with Emma Smith from Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, and eloped with her in 1827. Returning with Emma to the hill in 1827, Smith said the angel allowed him to take the plates but forbade him from showing them to anyone except those to whom the angel directed. As news of the plates spread, Smith's former treasure hunting associates sought to share in the proceeds. Intending to translate the plates himself, and hoping to avoid interference from his Palmyra associates, Smith moved to Harmony Township to live with his in-laws.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1352048662900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 12:04:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352048773334-64</Id><Topic><Title>the guy who dodged the Vietnam War wants you to vote for the Love of Country!</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1352047493803</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:44:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many dodged the Vietnam war.Most famous was Bill Clinton.

At a recent campaign stop, Obama urged those booing Mitt Romney's name to not boo, but that "voting is the best revenge." Scary that a presidential candidate let alone the president would say such a thing! Revenge against whom? For what purpose? In the lingo of Obama-speak, let me interpret. Obama has been playing the class warfare card for some time. He hates the "rich" — the truly successful in America who are also the job creators. He wants to tax them more. He wants them to "spread the wealth around." He believes they are "taking" from the poor and middle class. Simply put, he sees the world as a socialist.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352050903296</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 12:41:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352051510452-70</Id><Title>George Will predicts 321-217 Romney landslide</Title><Msg>I am not alone.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352051510452</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 12:51:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352051662842-71</Id><Title>Micheal Barone Romney 315, Obama 223</Title><Msg>I am not alone.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352051662842</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 12:54:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352052117917-72</Id><Topic><Title>Micheal Barone Romney 315, Obama 223</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352051662842</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 12:54:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which candidate will get the electoral votes of the target states? I'll go out on a limb and predict them, in ascending order of 2008 Obama percentages -- fully aware that I'm likely to get some wrong. Indiana (11 electoral votes). Uncontested. Romney. North Carolina (15 electoral votes). Obama has abandoned this target. Romney. Florida (29). The biggest target state has trended Romney since the Denver debate. I don't see any segment of the electorate favoring Obama more than in 2008, and I see some (South Florida Jews) favoring him less. Romney. Ohio (18). The anti-Romney auto bailout ads have Obama running well enough among blue-collar voters for him to lead most polls. But many polls anticipate a more Democratic electorate than in 2008. Early voting tells another story, and so does the registration decline in Cleveland's Cuyahoga County. In 2004, intensity among rural, small -town and evangelical voters, undetected by political reporters who don't mix in such circles, produced a narrow Bush victory. I see that happening again. Romney. Virginia (13). Post-debate polling mildly favors Romney, and early voting is way down in heavily Democratic Arlington, Alexandria, Richmond and Norfolk. Northern Virginia Asians may trend Romney. Romney. Colorado (9). Unlike 2008, registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats, and more Republicans than Democrats have voted early. The Republican trend in 2010 was squandered by weak candidates for governor and senator. Not this time. Romney. Iowa (6). The unexpected Romney endorsements by the Des Moines Register and three other newspapers gave voice to buyer's remorse in a state Obama carried by 10 points. Democrats' traditional margin in early voting has declined. Romney. Minnesota (10). A surprise last-minute media buy for the Romney campaign. But probably a bridge too far. Obama. New Hampshire (4). Polls are very tight here. I think superior Republican intensity will prevail. Romney. Pennsylvania (20). Everyone would have picked Obama two weeks ago. I think higher turnout in pro-coal Western Pennsylvania and higher Republican percentages in the Philadelphia suburbs could produce a surprise. The Romney team evidently thinks so too. Their investment in TV time is too expensive to be a mere feint, and, as this is written, Romney is planning a Sunday event in Bucks County outside Philly. Wobbling on my limb, Romney. Nevada (6). Democratic early-voting turnout is down from 2008 in Las Vegas' Clark County, 70 percent of the state. But the casino unions' turnout machine on Election Day re-elected an unpopular Harry Reid in 2010, and I think they'll get enough Latinos and Filipinos out this time. Obama. Wisconsin (10). Recent polling is discouraging for Republicans. But Gov. Scott Walker handily survived the recall effort in June with a great organizational push. Democrats depend heavily on margins in inner-city Milwaukee (population down) and the Madison university community. But early voting is down in university towns in other states. The Obama campaign is prepared to turn out a big student vote, but you don't see many Obama signs on campuses. Romney. Oregon (7), New Mexico (5), New Jersey (14). Uncontested. Obama. Michigan (16). Romney chose Pennsylvania, where there's no auto bailout issue.

Via Drudge, we see that a new poll puts Romney slightly ahead in Michigan. Susquehanna poll that finds Pennsylvania tied 47-47 must be sending chills down David Axelrod’s spine. Pennsylvania absolutely is in doubt, and the Democrats are scrambling belatedly to give that state the attention it deserves. Pennsylvania is a state where the NRA’s late entry into the race could be important. Then we have Minnesota. An American Future Fund poll which was shared with the press has Romney leading by one in Minnesota, 46-45. Their prior polls have shown Minnesota to be much closer than generally believed; they had Obama ahead by only one point around six weeks ago. So the current survey shows a mild swing in Romney’s favor. Romney could carry Minnesota. The Democrats think so, too. Bill Clinton will be in St. Cloud today, ostensibly campaigning against Michele Bachmann. But the Democrats wouldn’t waste Clinton on trying beat Michele; she is too good a retail politician and her district is too conservative. Clinton’s real mission, I suspect, is to fire up Minnesota Democrats whose spirits are flagging due to Obama’s uninspiring campaign. I assume Clinton’s event will be held in a high school gymnasium, the Obama campaign’s usual venue these days. Paul Ryan, meanwhile, will be in Minnesota later this afternoon, conducting a rally in an airplane hangar. Romney upset in Minnesota will be the surprise kick in the ash for Obama. I laugh in your face like Joe Biden.

Venezuela has better elections that USA under Obama's banana republic regime. With the presidential election expected to hinge on Ohio, the state’s former secretary of state, GOP stalwart Kenneth Blackwell, is warning that a little-known change in the Buckeye State’s absentee-ballot process could lead to a “nightmare scenario.” And that scenario could force the entire country to wait 10 days after the election to find out who will be the next president of the United States. It’s a complicated situation, to say the least, but one that could have a far-reaching impact on the Nov. 6 election process. For the first time in the key swing state’s history, Blackwell says, virtually all Ohio voters this year were mailed an application for an absentee ballot. In previous elections, most Ohio voters had to request an application for an absentee ballot to receive one. Cast Your Vote for Romney Early! The concern is that thousands of Ohio voters may complete the absentee-ballot application and receive an absentee ballot, but not bother to complete and mail in the ballot. Anyone who is sent an absentee ballot — including those who do not complete it and mail it in — and later shows up at the polls on Election Day to cast their ballot in person will be instructed to instead complete a provisional ballot. And under Ohio election law, provisional ballots cannot be opened until 10 days after an election. “I would just say that this is a potential nightmare-in-waiting,” says Blackwell. Blackwell believes that could result in an unprecedented number of provisional ballots being filed – some 250,000 or more. Such a large number of ballots being held, presumably under armed guard, for 10 days until they can be opened, would bring to mind the historic 2000 post-election battle in Florida. That recount was marked by ballot disputes — and inevitably, lawsuits.

But there is the chance that they could be biased in either direction. If they are biased in Mr. Obama’s favor, then Mr. Romney could still win; the race is close enough. If they are biased in Mr. Romney’s favor, then Mr. Obama will win by a wider-than-expected margin, but since Mr. Obama is the favorite anyway, this will not change who sleeps in the White House on Jan. 20. My argument, rather, is this: we’ve about reached the point where if Mr. Romney wins, it can only be because the polls have been biased against him. Almost all of the chance that Mr. Romney has in the FiveThirtyEight forecast, about 16 percent to win the Electoral College, reflects this possibility. Yes, of course: most of the arguments that the polls are necessarily biased against Mr. Romney reflect little more than wishful thinking. Nevertheless, these arguments are potentially more intellectually coherent than the ones that propose that the leader in the race is “too close to call.” It isn’t. If the state polls are right, then Mr. Obama will win the Electoral College. If you can’t acknowledge that after a day when Mr. Obama leads 19 out of 20 swing-state polls, then you should abandon the pretense that your goal is to inform rather than entertain the public. But the state polls may not be right. They could be biased. Based on the historical reliability of polls, we put the chance that they will be biased enough to elect Mr. Romney at 16 percent.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1352062096823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 15:48:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352062620394-104</Id><Title>YOU GOTTA LOVE THE REDNECK TEA BAGGERS!!!

Her over the top spending is coming to light thanks to a GLOBE CELEBRITY MAGAZINE special investigation plus a web video detailing wanton waste of our taxpayer dollars as our economy sinks, and we struggle just to pay monthly bills! GLOBE is reporting President Obama “blew up at Michelle” in a fierce WH fight over her outrageous spending, especially for her many vacations funded mainly by American taxpayers. Taking a trip to Spain in 2010 with her daughter Sasha and friends and staff, Michelle stayed at a very high end hotel where the “royal villa costs $6,500 a night” according to GLOBE! YouTube reports our first lady flew out on Air Force Two at a cost of $149,000, and a Secret Service tab of $98,000. The entire trip came in at $497,000 with an unreported extra cost for her staff. Just four months later, her trip to Hawaii cost an extra $64,000 because she wanted to take an early flight. This cost $251,000 in police overtime/ $16,000 rentals for Secret Service and Navy Seals; and $134,000 for her staff to stay at the Moana Hotel in Hawaii! She rented a winter White House for another $38,000. Remember flying out dog Bo on a plane other than the president took to Martha’s Vinyard? And what happened to all of the videos and cost tabulations when her older daughter flew down to Mexico with several young friends, all under the protection again of our Secret Service? Why was that trip data squashed? This latest video burning up the web contains documentation on only 16 trips she took, including a four day hop to Chicago in 2010 after the famous couple’s date night in New York City in March of 2010. Other relaxing jaunts involve trips to Maine and Martha’s Vinyard where she rented digs on our dime such as a $50,000 rental home weekly fee. Michelle’s trip to South Africa in June, 2011, cost over $500,000 million, and just two months later, she vacationed again out at Martha’s Vinyard. Other trips were to Panama City, Florida, the Grand Canyon, Vail and Aspen for a turn on the slopes, plus a pop over to Oregon to visit family. One Christmas in Hawaii cost a whopping $1.5 million!! Those $500 plus sneakers Michelle was shown wearing at a DC area food bank had to be another rude example of throwing it all up in our faces. And GLOBE even reports an expenditure of $5,000 for fancy lingerie. Was this paid for out of her personal accounts or what? Who would have the insensitivity to show up at an event purportedly to help the poor wearing such expensive footwear? Another YouTube video has been redone in three speeds to allegedly show her whispering in her husband’s ear: “All This For a Damn Flag!”</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352064436841</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 16:27:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352064602851-113</Id><Title>socialist democrat Obama "revenge"</Title><Msg>Barack Obama telling voters that they could get "revenge" on GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney by voting next week.

Losing Illinois?</Title><Msg>Massive Decrease in Early and Absentee Voting—in Chicago Daniel Halper November 4, 2012 11:56 AM The Illinois Republican party claims early and absentee voting has precipitously fallen since the 2008 presidential election. According to the numbers, at this point in 2008, there were 260,376 early voters and 304,290 absentee voters. Now, the party maintains, there are 195,064 early voters and 46,232 absentee voters. That's a loss of 57 percent of voters, since the last election. This, the Illinois Republican party says, is a terrible sign for Democrats. "Chicago is the heart and soul of the Democratic Party," says Illinois Republican party chair Pat Brady. "You can't get much more solid blue than Chicago and of course it's the President's home base - literally. If voter participation in the President's home base is down 57% from four years ago, the President is in serous trouble nationally." President Barack Obama's reelection headquarters are located in his hometown of Chicago. But the numbers provided by the state's Republican party are different than what's appearing in the local papers. "We believe the Chicago Board of Elections is misrepresenting their numbers in making comparisons to 2008," a spokesman for the Illinois Republican party explains. "According to the numbers we see in the State Board of Elections database, there is a significant fall off in reported absentee voting in city of Chicago. The Chicago Board of Elections is reporting 240k in early voting and claiming it's on track to surpass 2008 - but they're actually combining 2012 Early Voting and absentee voting, and then comparing that sum to 2008's early voting numbers (excluding absentee). There is a significant 57% drop in voter participation in the City of Chicago from 2008 - in the President's hometown. I'd also point out that despite the Chicago Board's point that early voting is four days shorter this year than in 2008, Illinois recently instituted "vote-by-mail" without an excuse needed, i.e. early voting by mail. This did not exist in 2008 and should have vastly expanded the numbers."</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352077244836</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 20:00:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352077376320-186</Id><Topic><Title>THEY KILLED 4400 AMERICANS IN IRAQ BUT NOW THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BENGAZI</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1352071961086</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 18:32:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are WRONG.
