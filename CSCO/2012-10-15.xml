We don’t have people that become ill, who die in their apartment because they don’t have insurance.” and in the real world Washington -- Uninsured people die prematurely at a rate that equals several additional deaths per day in highly populated states, such as Texas, Florida and California, according to recent analyses by the consumer group Families USA. The reports, released in March and April, are based on earlier studies by the Institute of Medicine and the Urban Institute, a policy research organization. Overall, uninsured people between the ages of 25 and 64 were 25% more likely to die than their same-aged insured counterparts, concluded the 2002 Institute of Medicine report from 2000 data. This increased mortality equaled an additional 18,000 deaths in 2000. The Urban Institute found that lack of insurance caused 22,000 adults' deaths in 2006.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350321028400</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 13:10:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350321468247-68</Id><Topic><Title>Female Tea Party Leader Thinks Women Shouldn't Vote - I agree if they are talking about racist rhonda</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350318380443</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 12:26:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they clearly agree on what they feel the role of women in society should be, Ann Romney herself pledged subservience in her marriage vows.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350321468247</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 13:17:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350321686461-69</Id><Topic><Title>Female Tea Party Leader Thinks Women Shouldn't Vote - I agree if they are talking about racist rhonda</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350318380443</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 12:26:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you enjoy talking to yourself????

Antag, president of the Mahoning County St. Vincent De Paul Society in Youngstown, told the Washington Post that the Romney campaign had not asked to make the Saturday visit to the soup kitchen. He said that he runs an apolitical faith-based organization which has bylaws barring it from hosting political candidates, and that the visit jeopardized donations from private individuals. Play VIDEO Paul Ryan makes unauthorized stop at soup kitchen "They showed up there and they did not have permission," he said. "They got one of the volunteers to open up the doors." Antag added that Ryan and his family "did nothing" while on the premises. "He just came in here to get his picture taken at the dining hall," he said. Ryan was photographed cleaning "large metal pans that did not appear to be dirty" during a 15-minute visit, the Post previously reported. While television cameras rolled and photographers snapped pictures, the Wisconsin congressman discussed washing dishes while he was younger. He said he would get calluses on his fingers due to the heat from the industrial machine. You can see the video at left. When Ryan arrived on the site in the early afternoon, the kitchen was clean and the dining area was empty, according to a pool report. After his time in the kitchen Ryan spoke to homeless people outside the soup kitchen, but reporters were kept monitoring the conversation.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350341871234</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 18:57:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350341926851-140</Id><Topic><Title>what a phony, sad to think a man like this could become a congressman</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350341871234</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 18:57:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ryan couldn't be bothered to actually help out and meet the people he intends to starve to death</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350341926851</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 18:58:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350344032627-141</Id><Title>Obama's "A" game: make excuses; lie; pass the blame; shirk responsibility</Title><Msg>Four more years of that?

If Romney gets elected the baggers have lost everything they stood for. LOL Texas Republican congressman Ron Paul pointedly refused to endorse his party's presidential contender, Mitt Romney, arguing that neither he nor President Barack Obama would make necessary cuts to public spending that would avert a fiscal catastrophe. "No," the iconoclastic Libertarian bluntly told CNBC's "Futures Now," when asked about whether he was prepared to endorse Romney. He accused both the former Massachusetts governor and the president of being captive to similar interests. "Both within the establishment where they need the Federal Reserve as lender of last resort to make sure that you take all the risk in the world," Paul said. He linked the Fed -- his favorite foil -- and the Washington political establishment together as part of a "one party system" that refuses to make necessary but difficult choices to cut spending. (Read more: Ron Paul Vows to Continue Campaign Against Status Quo.) "I've been in this business a long time and believe me there is essentially no difference from one administration to another no matter what the platforms," said Paul, a former hopeful for the GOP nomination. "The foreign policy stays the same, the monetary policy stays the same, there's no proposal for any real cuts and both parties support it."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350347514587</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 20:31:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350347651103-158</Id><Topic><Title>We are going to open our OWN oil fields</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1350347450272</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 20:30:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you appreciate of course that the number of oil/gas rigs drilling in the U.S. under Obama is more then double the number that were being drilled under Bush right?

Century Mine said they want President Barack Obama to stop what they term the war on coal - and to stop spreading mistruths about them. Miners gathered Friday afternoon to express their opposition to Obamas energy and environmental policies, which they believe threaten their jobs. Miner Mitch Miracle read aloud a letter the miners mailed to Obama that outlines some of their concerns. The miners said Obamas campaign team is running ads filled with blatantly false statements about the miners regarding their participation in Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romneys August campaign stop at the Century Mine. These ads assert that the miners were forced to attend the event by the mines owner, Robert Murray. There are numerous false statements and absolute lies concerning our participation in this event, mostly started by a local shock jock radio host, the miners letter to Obama states. Why would you (Obama) lie about the 500 working miners who have signed this letter? We, the employees of the Century Mine would request you immediately stop these false ads. This summer, Murray Energy Corp., parent company of the Beallsville mine, cut or relocated 56 workers with the closure of the Red Bird West mine near Brilliant. Murray also cut 29 mining jobs from The Ohio Valley Coal Co.s Powhatan No. 6 Mine. All of this was done, Robert Murray said, because of Obamas war on coal."

According to the Congressional Budget Office, however, the government will lose about $24 billion on the bailout. “We got back every dime we used to rescue the financial system, but we also passed a historic law to end taxpayer-funded Wall Street bailouts for good,” Obama said in Miami Thursday. The Congressional Budget Office--based on figures from Obama’s own Office of Management and Budget---gives a different assessment. “The cost to the federal government of the TARP’s transactions (also referred to as the subsidy cost), including grants for mortgage programs that have not yet been made, will amount to $24 billion,” said the CBO report, which was released on the same day Obama spoke."
