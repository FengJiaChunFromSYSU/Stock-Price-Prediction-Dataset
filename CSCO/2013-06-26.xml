Can anyone trust John Kerry?? "Never lie, cheat or steal" is the West Point motto. When a witness perjures himself at trial, the judge notes that his testimony lacks credibility. Should we elect a known proven liar to lead us in wartime?? I draw a direct comparison of General Benedict Arnold of the Revolutionary War, to Lieutenant John Kerry. Both went off to war, fought, and then turned against their country. General Arnold crossed over to the British for money and position. John Kerry crossed over to the Vietnamese with his assistance to the anti-war movement, and his direct liaison with the Vietnamese diplomats in Paris. His reward. Political gain. Senator..United States. His record as a Senator for twenty years has been pitiful. Conjure up, if you will, one major bill that he has sponsored.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1372225906141</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 01:51:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372228059664-7</Id><Topic><Title>is CSCO gonna RUN ???</Title><Username>rogerwalker513</Username><Timestamp>1371787455387</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 00:04:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DXPO</Msg><Username>tryme877</Username><Timestamp>1372228059664</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 02:27:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372246935675-8</Id><Topic><Title>John Kerry -- Edward Snowden</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1372217794978</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 23:36:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gail - you ARE a psycho</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372246935675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 07:42:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372246955538-9</Id><Topic><Title>Dem Dang Obama Futures Be Down Again!</Title><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1372219616279</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 00:06:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>greg - you are a simpleton</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372246955538</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 07:42:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372247011279-10</Id><Topic><Title>Dem Dang Obama Futures Be Down Again!</Title><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1372219616279</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 00:06:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>futures up 60 greg is as close to trig palin as deadpaining</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372247011279</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 07:43:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372247208909-11</Id><Topic><Title>Arizona governor: Racial discrimination doesn’t ‘take place any longer’</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372214929338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 22:48:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NSA Leak Spooks Terrorists Members of al Qaeda and pretty much every other terrorist organization are now reportedly switching up their communication tactics in response to the leaked details of the NSA’s surveillance program. According to two anonymous U.S. intelligence officials, this poses a major problem for keeping an eye on operatives and staying ahead of potential plots. The officials would not explain what, exactly the terrorists are doing—switching their email accounts or cell phone providers for example—but did specify that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the organization’s Yemeni branch, was one of the first to change up.</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372247208909</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 07:46:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372248140855-12</Id><Topic><Title>Two reasons why blacks are still hated by many</Title><Username>steady_eddy</Username><Timestamp>1372211628660</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 21:53:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ranked number 1, you were up late posting dead, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372248140855</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372248506519-13</Id><Title>About to Become #1 Big Data Play</Title><Msg>Concurrent (CCUR) looks ready to become the #1 hottest Big Data play! Big Data company Tableau Software (DATA) just went public and raised $254.2mm at $31 and finished its first day of trading up 63.7% to $50.75, and is now $54.42 up 75.5% from its IPO. DATA has a market cap of $3.13 billion with sales of only $143mm! CCUR is currently $7.50 with an enterprise value of only $43.29mm or 0.68X sales of $63.23mm vs. DATA trading with a price/sales ratio of 22! The VC firm that funded Facebook, Accel Partners, announced last week they are spending $100mm to form Big Data Fund 2. According to Google Trends, interest in Big Data Analytics has increased every month of 2013, with buzz up 66.7% since the end of December. In the 19 months since Accel formed their first $100mm Big Data Fund, interest in Big Data Analytics has increased an unbelievable 567%! We are about to experience a modern day Gold Rush as Big Data revolutionizes a wide range of industries - including the $100 billion cable TV industry! A new article "How Big Data Keeps Cable TV Watchers Hooked" discusses pay-TV operators using Big Data to launch ad campaigns that follow users from TV to the web, while stopping users from migrating to NFLX. TWC is using Concurrent (CCUR)'s Big Data solutions, which have already processed 15 BILLION media transactions for pay-TV operators! CCUR could double or triple as Big Data investors begin to discover it! CCUR only needs a business valuation of 2X sales for it to more than double to $17, and a business valuation of 3X sales for it to more than triple to $24.22! CCUR's revenues, gross profits, operating income, and EPS - has risen quarter-after-quarter for 12 months straight! Besides TWC, other major clients of CCUR include Charter, Cox, Rogers, and Virgin Media!</Msg><Username>asj48493</Username><Timestamp>1372248506519</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:08:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372249567472-14</Id><Topic><Title>Two reasons why blacks are still hated by many</Title><Username>steady_eddy</Username><Timestamp>1372211628660</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 21:53:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes one % black population.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1372249567472</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:26:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372249640557-15</Id><Topic><Title>Arizona governor: Racial discrimination doesn’t ‘take place any longer’</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372214929338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 22:48:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jr you are the biggest threat to this country.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1372249640557</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:27:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372250104784-16</Id><Topic><Title>Arizona governor: Racial discrimination doesn’t ‘take place any longer’</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372214929338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 22:48:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>2%</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372250104784</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:35:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372250347421-17</Id><Title>RACE HATE CREATION when dems dont get their way</Title><Msg>A Minnesota state representative has apologized for a tweet in which he referred to black Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as "Uncle Thomas."

They are in the sweet spot of growth. What bodes well for titanium, is that all new generation aircraft are increasingly titanium dependent in an effort to reduce the aircraft weight and, correspondingly, fuel consumption, without compromising safety. Looking forward 20 years Boeing sees growth being driven by regional aircraft – such as the 787, Airbus – by large aircraft carrying more passengers on long-haul journeys. The much-awaited Dreamliner is 15% titanium by weight, while Airbus’s A380 consumes several times more titanium than a single aisle plane. PCP has almost a monopoly on the ability to cast titanium, this isn't a trade, buy it and look at it in 10 years it will be a 10 bagger minimum.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372255529290</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:05:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372255555999-57</Id><Title>DOMA dead</Title><Msg>LOL tea billies lose again</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372255555999</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:05:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372255645687-58</Id><Topic><Title>media is fair and balanced</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372254819507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:53:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>only have the one id Ivan, never made much sense to me to post under alternate id's on an anonymous message board</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372255645687</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:07:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372255740163-59</Id><Topic><Title>Gold dropping again signals...</Title><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1372252302705</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:11:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ROTF!! greg you are riot!@!</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372255740163</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:09:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372255763908-60</Id><Topic><Title>media is fair and balanced</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372254819507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:53:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course, I believe you.lol</Msg><Username>joe_b73</Username><Timestamp>1372255763908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:09:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372255785391-61</Id><Topic><Title>Dem Dang Obama Futures Be Down Again!</Title><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1372219616279</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 00:06:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great call greg ROTF!!!</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372255785391</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:09:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372256169123-62</Id><Topic><Title>media is fair and balanced</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372254819507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:53:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>believe sarah palin 'joe' cracker</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372256169123</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:16:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372256460376-63</Id><Topic><Title>media is fair and balanced</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372254819507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:53:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Find another poster for your silliness, Junior.

LMFAO</Title><Msg>Republicans decided that Tuesday morning was a good time to start attacking President Obama over the failed attempt to extradite former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who recently left Hong Kong for Russia. On CBS This Morning, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) said that the Snowden affair showed that the administration is becoming “more incompetent every day”: Well, first of all, how is it that a 29-year-old contractor with one year at Booz Allen Hamilton can get this kind of security clearance, get this kind of access to this kind of intelligence, walk out with a thumb drive and give it to the world? I mean, how is it that our security clearances are so low that something like this can happen? That’s number one. Number two, once we’ve discovered that this person has stolen our secrets, has leaked them, you’d think we’d have a better job of following up with that in China and these other countries But “incompetent” was too kind a word for Senator John McCain (R-AZ), who preferred “impotent”: The 2008 GOP nominee for president linked Snowden to an overwhelming pattern of “leading from behind,” adding that Russia’s unwillingness to cooperate indicated the president’s “reset” with the country had failed. “It’s reminiscent of the days of the Cold War, when you hear a Russian spokesman saying that [Snowden’s] not in Russia when every shred of evidence indicates that he is,” McCain said on CNBC. “We’ve got to start dealing with Vladimir Putin in a realistic fashion for what he is. He’s an old KGB colonel apparatchik that dreams of the days of the Russian empire, and he continues to stick his thumb in our eye in a broad variety of ways.” McCain then moved on to Syria, blasting the president for declaring that the use of chemical weapons was the “red line” and then only responding to their use by arming the rebels.

The NSON Opinion Strategy poll was conducted by interviewing random individual in the downtown area of 12 different U.S. cities: New York, Hanover, Providence, Louisville, Indianapolis, Nashville, Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, Denver, Seattle, and San Diego. Regardless or different biases that can be argued about how the cities where chosen it comes to no surprise that GOP is loosing touch with the electorate.

Gohmert believes that America is morally worse off today than during slavery. Although some white conservatives sincerely believe that, it is doubtful that slaves, who were sold, beaten, and ripped away from their families, would have agreed. Before you write this off as an isolated incident, remember that in 2011, Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann signed “The Marriage Vow”, which suggested that black families were better off during slavery. “Slavery had a disastrous impact on African-American families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an African-American baby born after the election of the USA’s first African-American President,” read the pledge. The Iowa group which circulated the pledge eventually deleted the offending passage and apologized. And just two weeks ago, Arkansas lawmaker Jon Hubbard defended slavery in his book, “Letters to the Editor: Confessions of a Frustrated Conservative”, calling it a “blessing in disguise” for blacks. More and more it seems that conservatives desire to convince everyone that slavery was not that bad, and blacks should just shut up and be more appreciative. They’re rewriting history at a furious speed to cover up what can’t be hidden – the utter immorality of taking away the freedom of another human being.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372265670480</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:54:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372265889536-150</Id><Title>Flath Earth Society and their president thinks anthropogenic climate change is real</Title><Msg>This is how widespread belief in climate change is: "In his big speech on climate change today, President Obama mocked Republicans who deny the existence of man-made global warming by derisively referring to them as members of 'the Flat Earth Society.'

First the water...the face of the deep...without form or limits...just Water. Then the Land sitting in and on the Water, the Water then as now being flat and level, as is the very Nature of Water. There are, of course, mountains and valleys on the Land but since most of the World is Water, we say, "The World is Flat". Historical accounts and spoken history tell us the Land part may have been square, all in one mass at one time, then as now, the magnetic north being the Center. Vast cataclysmic events and shaking no doubt broke the land apart, divided the Land to be our present continents or islands as they exist today. One thing we know for sure about this world...the known inhabited world is Flat, Level, a Plain World. We maintain that what is called 'Science' today and 'scientists' consist of the same old gang of witch doctors, sorcerers, tellers of tales, the 'Priest-Entertainers' for the common people. 'Science' consists of a weird, way-out occult concoction of gibberish theory-theology...unrelated to the real world of facts, technology and inventions, tall buildings and fast cars, airplanes and other Real and Good things in life; technology is not in any way related to the web of idiotic scientific theory. ALL inventors have been anti-science. The Wright brothers said: "Science theory held us up for years. When we threw out all science, started from experiment and experience, then we invented the airplane." By the way, airplanes all fly level on this Plane earth. —[21]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372266569600</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:09:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372266723238-159</Id><Topic><Title>in teabillistan</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372266569600</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:09:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are one goofy goofy muther, I do agree with that!</Msg><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1372266723238</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:12:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372268113329-160</Id><Title>(IGXT) MCap $28 M/ Price 0.55 / NDA accepted by FDA / $2++ Very Soon RALLYYYYYYYY</Title><Msg>Another 2 NDA filings and 2-3 Partnerships coming this Year ..Only 20 M on the float .GLTA IGXT has the Potential to hit $10++ within 2 Year !

Maybe they should corellate this? Carbon taxes don't reduce gasses, they ship production overseas. Growing algae requires no pesticide, produces fish food, and creates American jobs while reducing our carbon footprint. 95% of the fish in the ocean are gone. This can be correlated to a lack of food from "clean water" meddling of environmentalists. Fish grow faster when they are fed. Correlate this: The dirty water of the gulf oil spill resulted in the largest ever harvest of American Shrimp and Lobster.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372269771807</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:02:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372269811729-178</Id><Topic><Title>May have spotted Junior</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1372269101652</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:51:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thats a good fantasy! how long have you been a shut-in?</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372269811729</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:03:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372269819685-179</Id><Topic><Title>Just saw what I looked like in the mirror</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1372269711717</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:01:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that the best you can come up with ??/LOL FUNNY!!!!</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1372269819685</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:03:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372269826226-180</Id><Title>artemiagrower and I can finally have that white wedding we were hoping for!</Title><Msg>Thank goodness DOMA was struck down by the Supreme Court !</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1372269826226</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:03:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372269840076-181</Id><Topic><Title>In MoonBatistan</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372269771807</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:02:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sophistry</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372269840076</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:04:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372269883492-182</Id><Title>Edward Snowden HERO patriot</Title><Msg>only guy left in this country to risk his life for the constitutional rights of American citizens.

Yes, I am an investor in Coal, and I too am upset. One liberal author summed it up in the following sentence: "Obama is legally mandated to act on curbing carbon emissions, following a court's determination that carbon dioxide is a pollutant. " As usual, the moonbats get it wrong intentionally to push an agenda. The mandate would also indicate that Obama is required to remove the extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. So, where are the moonbats who are pushing algae? I wouldn't mind if Obama acted in our interests, but he is just playing with smoke and mirrors and killing American jobs. Did you know that 90% of the fish in the ocean are gone? Where are the moonbats to insist that we feed the remaining ones to make them grow? Algae feeds fish, and reduces the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. More fish means more fishing jobs.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372271336323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:28:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372271394495-205</Id><Topic><Title>Can't we all just get along?</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372271336323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:28:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>alot are in support of obama and his new coal policy thanks thogh art</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372271394495</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:29:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372271437149-206</Id><Topic><Title>Can't we all just get along?</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372271336323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:28:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A lot would breath his farts if you find a way to package them.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372271437149</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:30:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372271489697-207</Id><Topic><Title>Can't we all just get along?</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372271336323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:28:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A lot just think you can't trust a black guy - and then have weird fart fantasies</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372271489697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:31:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372271528638-208</Id><Topic><Title>THE UNITED STATES OF SODOM</Title><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1372270967180</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:22:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>iranian mullahs have the same complaint</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372271528638</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:32:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372271673469-209</Id><Topic><Title>THE UNITED STATES OF SODOM</Title><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1372270967180</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:22:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>junior, I heard the media tried to get your take on the scrotus' ruling but they couldn't get you because you were involved in a 3 way with Obama and Larry Sinclair at Boy scout's office.</Msg><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1372271673469</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:34:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372271724129-210</Id><Topic><Title>Can't we all just get along?</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372271336323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:28:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the rest of the world would join us it would be a great idea.Unfortunately they wont.And our attempts at reducing pollution will have little effect.

This is an important step to free them from that unfair and heinous obligation.” Justice Scalia added that the Voting Rights Act had “thrust upon the shoulders of millions of Americans the terrible and unwanted burden of exercising their rights in a democracy.” “Many of them have been forced to drive to polling places, wait in line, and then cast their vote because of the oppressive requirements of this Act,” he wrote. “It is our honor and duty to free them from those hardships.” In conclusion, Justice Scalia wrote, “Our message today to the American people is simple: we are voting so you won’t have to.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372273167848</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:59:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372273390712-224</Id><Topic><Title>Can't we all just get along?</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372271336323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:28:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I actually agree with you!

Surdyka was in an upstairs bedroom when the sound of loud voices caught her attention. Startled, Surdyka minutes later opened a window, she said, and heard a "dominate aggressive voice" and a lighter voice from "a boy." She said it was dark and raining so she couldn't see clearly who the people were. "I could see two people on the ground, one on top of each other," Surdyka said. "They were wrestling or shuffling." Then she said she heard two cries for help. "They were excruciating," she said. "I felt like it was the boy's voice." Soon after, as she was dialing 911, Surdyka heard three "pops." She later saw Zimmerman get up and walk toward her window. She said Zimmerman didn't look hurt and that he put his hand on his forehead.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372273877621</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:11:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372274014825-231</Id><Topic><Title>HEY STUPID MEDIA MORONS AND LIBS: The Scotus Ruling today</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1372273448535</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:04:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well jay perhaps you should read a little closer, SCOTUS also refused to overturn lower court ruling that Prop 8 was unconstitutional, woopsie</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372274014825</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:13:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372274112680-232</Id><Title>tea billies can't figure out why they can't afford health care</Title><Msg>Then there's the record $159 million pension benefit of John Hammergren, the current chairman and CEO of drug distributor McKesson Corp. MCK +4.02% That's how much he would have received in a lump-sum payment had he voluntarily departed on March 31, McKesson disclosed in its annual proxy filing on Friday. Compensation consultants say it's by far the largest pension on file for a current executive of a public company, and almost certainly the largest ever in corporate America. It's also more than double the value of the 54-year-old Mr. Hammergren's pension six years ago. "I've never seen a pension that high," says James F. Reda, a New York executive-compensation consultant whose firm, Gallagher HR Consulting, helped analyze Mr. Hammergren's pension for The Wall Street Journal. He said the benefit is "excessive" given that Mr. Hammergren has been one of the highest-paid executives in the U.S. in recent years, averaging more than $50 million a year.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372274112680</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:15:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372274157417-233</Id><Topic><Title>Can't we all just get along?</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372271336323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:28:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Democrats could do it.

But a short time later, Jeantel said she heard Martin let out a profanity on the phone. Jeantel testified that Martin then said Zimmerman was behind him and she heard Martin ask: "What are you following me for?" She says she heard Martin's phone headset fall and then Martin say "Get off!" The phone went dead shortly after and Jeantel says she didn’t speak to Martin again.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372276290770</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:51:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372276532939-252</Id><Topic><Title>creepy #$%$ cracker- ouch</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372276290770</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:51:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you trying the case on the Yahoo CSCO board??

Young, Wesley Lowery and John R. Ellement, Globe Correspondents and Globe Staff ATTLEBORO — Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez executed his acquaintance Odin L. Lloyd because Hernandez was upset that Lloyd had spoken at a Boston nightclub on June 14 with people Hernandez “had troubles with,” a prosecutor alleged today. In a dramatic hearing in Attleboro District Court, a Bristol County prosecutor said surveillance videos in Boston, in North Attleborough, and even in Hernandez’s own home linked him to the slaying several days later of Lloyd. Lloyd was shot five times in a North Attleborough industrial park, including once as he lay on the ground, raising his arm in a desperate attempt to save his own life, prosecutor William McCauley said. The prosecutor said Hernandez, who was accompanied by two men, had the means, motive, and opportunity to kill Lloyd and had been the prime mover in the crime. “He orchestrated his execution,’’ McCauley, said. The identity of Hernandez’s two confederates was not disclosed at Hernandez’s arraignment. McCauley said Hernandez summoned his two friends, then drove to Fayston Street in Boston’s Dorchester section early on the morning of Monday, June 17, where Lloyd, a 27-year-old semipro football player, left his home, got in the car, and then rode south to North Attleborough. Along the way, Lloyd alerted relatives in a text message, asking them, “Did you see who I am with?” After they asked who, he replied cryptically, “NFL,” the prosecutor said. “Just so you know,’’ Lloyd added. It was the last text message he sent before he died, McCauley said. In the North Attleborough industrial park where Lloyd was murdered, surveillance videos captured the men arriving in the same silver Nissan that Lloyd had gotten into in Dorchester, the prosecutor said. Once near a wooded area, Lloyd started climbing out of the car, and was shot once, which knocked him to the ground. As he lay there, he raised his arm and was shot multiple times. Five spent .45-caliber spent shell casings were later recovered, McCauley said. When Hernandez returned home around 3:30 a.m. Monday, surveillance video at his house showed him walking through his house holding a pistol in his hand, the prosecutor said. Not-guilty pleas were entered on his behalf. Judge Daniel J. O’Shea ordered Hernandez held without bail. Hernandez attorney Michael Fee, arguing for bail, said the prosecution case was “circumstantial ... not strong.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372277849177</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:17:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372277865475-266</Id><Topic><Title>creepy #$%$ cracker- ouch</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372276290770</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:51:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The press and the prosecution seem to be arguing a "racially motivated" second degree attack on an innocent young black child.

However, the DNA results and the Autopsy results do not support Zimmerman's claim that Trayvon Martin "caused" injuries to his face or head. Meaning, DNA results and the Autopsy suggest Trayvon Martin is not the "cause" of Zimmerman's injuries. So Zimmerman's alleged self defense claim might not fly with the jury since none of the forensic results suggest Trayvon Martin touched Zimmerman in any way, shape or form. The Jury will see the DNA report shows that none of Zimmerman's DNA was under Martin's fingernails. George Zimmerman was damn near bald on the night he followed, search for, then found and killed Trayvon Martin. In order for Trayvon Martin to grab Zimmerman's bald head tight enough to slam his head into the sidewalk over a dozen times, some of Zimmerman's DNA would have gotten underneath Trayvon Martin's fingernails. The DNA results show none of Zimmerman's DNA under Martin's fingernails: The Jury will see the DNA report shows that none of Zimmerman's DNA was found on the cuffs/sleeves of Martin's hoodie. George Zimmerman told detectives (time 34:46 in video after the orange squiggle) that he had "blood all over [his] face and eyes." We know from pictures officer's took of Zimmerman moments after he killed Trayvon that Zimmerman did not really have blood</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372278985803</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:36:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372279016407-277</Id><Topic><Title>creepy #$%$ cracker- ouch</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372276290770</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:51:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Common for who?

A forensic expert says that the gunshot was fired upward, because of the combination of distances when a "contact mark" found on the clothing, but the torso shows several inches of distance. The distance of the clothing from the body verifies that Trayvon was on top, and standing over Zimmerman. The lack of DNA on Trayvon is odd. Do you suppose the eyewitnesses were lying about a struggle between two people?</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1372280776174</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:06:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372280833280-285</Id><Title>congrats to jrdumbmagoo</Title><Msg>jr can be married now. big step foward for gay rights...I do agree it was the right thing to do.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1372280833280</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:07:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372280894486-286</Id><Topic><Title>creepy #$%$ cracker- ouch</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372276290770</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:51:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>creepy cracker...travon was a racist...surprise.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1372280894486</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:08:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372281144097-287</Id><Topic><Title>creepy #$%$ cracker- ouch</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372276290770</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:51:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'creepy cracker...travon was a racist...surprise.' in this one sentence - you can see how trig-like deapainting is</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372281144097</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:12:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372281266897-288</Id><Topic><Title>congrats to jrdumbmagoo</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1372280833280</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:07:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior has decided to stay single and play the field.

Temperatures could near 130 degrees in some spots in the desert Southwest, where the worst of the heat is forecast. The weather service has issued "extreme heat warnings" across parts of Arizona, California and Nevada, which means that "temperatures are forecast to reach dangerous levels that will stress the body if precautions are not taken," according to a weather service bulletin. The all-time record high of 117 degrees could be broken Saturday in Las Vegas, according to AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alan Reppert. The average high this time of year in Sin City is around 102 degrees, he says. Reno is also poised to brush up against its all-time heat record of 108 degrees, last reached in July 2007 and first set in July 2002. "It's a potentially historical event that we're looking at here, and the heat is encompassing all of Nevada, all of Utah and Arizona," weather service meteorologist Brian Brong in Reno says.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372283166864</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:46:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372283264038-295</Id><Topic><Title>Blacks, Asians, Latins, Some Whites and Women: United Over Voting Rights and Control of Women's Body</Title><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1372281518348</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:18:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah saw how effective it was making you tea billies throw a wobbly, LOL now go off like a prom dress again skippy, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372283264038</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:47:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372283628864-296</Id><Title>you can see how far the tea billies have taken over the GOP</Title><Msg>Legislation that was passed overwhelmingly by the GOP house and Senate doesn't have a chance under the current tea billie congress Graham believes Section 4 is no longer useful comes in spite of the fact that the Justice Department blocked the voter ID passed in his state in 2011 in part because of data that revealed the law would have a disproportional impact on black voters. Mississippi Rep. Alan Nunnelee had a similar response, praising his state for making progress while ignoring the fact that the Justice Department had held its voter ID up to significant scrutiny in recent months. “Mississippi has come a long way since 1964,” he said in a statement. “And today has the highest number of African-American elected officials in the country. This is strong evidence that rules designed to right the wrongs of previous generations have outlived their usefulness.” Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker more doubtful, and perhaps more realistic. He told Huffington Post he’s uncertain lawmakers will “ever” come together to restore the law. Despite its 2006 re-authorization with wide bipartisan support–unanimous in the Senate and only a few dozen Republicans in the House opposing it–he thinks the legislation is doomed today. ”I just cannot imagine–I’m just being honest–Congress ever coming to terms with what they could agree on.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372283628864</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:53:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372283925078-297</Id><Title>csco help</Title><Msg>Can you help me?

And he still supported it after his 100th. In six years as warden of the Huntsville Unit, the prison that houses Texas' death chamber, O'Reilly supervised about 140 executions — more than any other warden in state history. Now retired, he reflected on his career this week as the nation's busiest death penalty state prepared to execute its 500th inmate since resuming capital punishment in 1982. The 62-year-old said he has no regrets about a process he considered to be a relatively unemotional and small part of his job.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372284834756</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 18:13:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372285568795-299</Id><Topic><Title>Gonna be hard for this guy to slip by St. Peter, killing 140 people was a small part of his job</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372284834756</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 18:13:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Woman scheduled to be executed in Texas tonight.

A spokesman for Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George told The Hill on Tuesday that Issa had requested investigators “narrowly focus on tea party organizations.” The subsequent audit concluded the IRS used “inappropriate criteria” to single out for additional scrutiny tea party groups that applied for tax exempt status. The findings lead almost every politician, including President Barack Obama, to denounce the IRS. Several Republicans suggested the audit indicated the White House had a Nixonian “enemies list.” Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Issa said the IRS appeared to have been targeting Obama’s political opponents “perhaps not on his request” but “on his behalf.” But new documents have revealed that liberal and progressive groups received similar treatment from the IRS. The “inappropriate criteria” used to single out tea party groups — so-called “Be On the Look Out” (BOLO) memos — also singled out progressive and “Occupy” groups.</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate1</Username><Timestamp>1372300244818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 22:30:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372300389350-333</Id><Topic><Title>No scandal here</Title><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1372290548933</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 19:49:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Puzzling that Issa is trying to void her 5th amendment protection if it will bring him down too, isn' t it?
