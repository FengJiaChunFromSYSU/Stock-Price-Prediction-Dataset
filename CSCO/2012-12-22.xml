Obama and the Dems then sit in judgment and decide what they will and will not accept. It is nuts. Obama is leading from behind. I say go over the cliff and then we can have a real discussion of our long term fiscal problems. If the Clinton era taxes were so great and contributed to our prosperity, we will go back to them on January 1st. Let the Dems explain why we should revert back to the Bush tax cuts for the middle class since they portrayed the Bush tax cuts as for the wealthy. Obamacare will raise our taxes and spending regardless. Debt ceiling will be the real fight. Doubt it. Once SS and Medicare payments can't be made, there will a huge outcry that no politician can ignore.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1356161162478</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 02:26:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356167950562-2</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO would certainly come to be the ticker to pay attention to this month.</Title><Username>leroybeasley75</Username><Timestamp>1356091089736</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 06:58:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>okay dude .</Msg><Username>steinhoff_scott</Username><Timestamp>1356167950562</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 04:19:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356170813291-3</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO would certainly come to be the ticker to pay attention to this month.</Title><Username>leroybeasley75</Username><Timestamp>1356091089736</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 06:58:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so happy for this.</Msg><Username>phillipsg48</Username><Timestamp>1356170813291</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 05:06:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356174224986-4</Id><Topic><Title>BLACK MAN THROWS SOCK FULL OF FECES AT FEMALE TRAIN PASSENGER</Title><Username>algore_eats_his_own_boogers</Username><Timestamp>1355973749363</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 22:22:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not suprized.

He then put himself in for three purple hearts and a transfer out of Nam. As for the Silver Star, he beached his boat( which was a dereliction of duty) and chased a wounded teenage VC into the jungle and shot him in the back. All these things I've stated are verifiable on Google. I was there a year.I never killed a baby,cut off anybodies arms,or raped any young girls as Kerry charged. 99.9% of the guys there served honorably .But Kerry denigrated all of us to further his career.

In the end this global warming scam is a fradulent scheme concocted by liberals to justify new higher taxes. *** You nailed it. The Kyoto meetings a couple weeks ago failed.

Chris Murphy, whose district includes Newtown, called LaPierre's words "the most revolting, tone deaf statement I've ever seen." New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, blasted them as "a shameful evasion of the crisis facing the country." And former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said he found the remarks "very haunting and very disturbing." This wave of criticism continued Saturday. New York's normally politically polar opposite tabloids, for instance, offered the same take: The Daily News' headline called LaPierre the "Craziest Man on Earth," while Rupert Murdoch's New York Post ran with, "Gun Nut! NRA loon in bizarre rant over Newtown." Rick Huffman, another CNN iReporter and a retired police officer, cut up his NRA membership card in the wake of the mass shooting, which he said changed his views on gun control. "There's got to be a limit to what they let citizens have at their disposal," the Michigan resident said. Both sides, at least, appear to agree something needs to be done to prevent more mass shootings like what happened December 14 in the once quiet Connecticut town. President Barack Obama used his speech at a prayer service for the massacre's victims to call for action and subsequently tapped Vice President Joe Biden to lead a group charged with coming up with solutions.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356232837605</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 22:20:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356233734824-52</Id><Topic><Title>UNJUSTLY HIGH TAXATION REQUIRES REBELLION</Title><Username>clayveuss_johnson</Username><Timestamp>1356229919650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 21:31:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't get me wrong, one of you moronic idiots just might get up the courage to go into an grade school and kill a bunch of children, but that's as much courage as any of you punks have.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356233734824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 22:35:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356234023708-53</Id><Topic><Title>LOL NRA did more to get guns outlawed then anyone eles could</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356232837605</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 22:20:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>killing weapon industries is a Big $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ business.LoL!</Msg><Username>bvioml123</Username><Timestamp>1356234023708</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 22:40:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356234278120-54</Id><Topic><Title>To all Christians on Christmas,... remember what the infamous M;uslim said</Title><Username>ivanhoeofoloxly</Username><Timestamp>1356223099710</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 19:38:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey! jesus was born 2012 years ago. today, Christians still flood the earth.</Msg><Username>bvioml123</Username><Timestamp>1356234278120</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 22:44:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356234417334-55</Id><Topic><Title>UNJUSTLY HIGH TAXATION REQUIRES REBELLION</Title><Username>clayveuss_johnson</Username><Timestamp>1356229919650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 21:31:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>boston tea party rebirth!</Msg><Username>bvioml123</Username><Timestamp>1356234417334</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 22:46:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356234890563-56</Id><Topic><Title>UNJUSTLY HIGH TAXATION REQUIRES REBELLION</Title><Username>clayveuss_johnson</Username><Timestamp>1356229919650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 21:31:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I do not say this lightly: the blood of patriots has historically been the seed of freedom, but not ours alone.

NBC's David Gregory will interview LaPierre on "Meet the Press" Sunday morning. The NRA effectively had been silent until Friday, exactly one week after Adam Lanza shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown and killed 20 children -- none of them older than 7 -- and six adults. He used a "Bushmaster AR-15 assault-type weapon" to mow down his victims, said Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance, before killing himself with a handgun. The rampage ignited renewed national debates over gun control, mental health care and school safety. Instead of expressing openness to more stringent gun control measures, LaPierre doubled-down and gave no hint he would support any restrictions, including those on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356236518343</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 23:21:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356236846261-63</Id><Topic><Title>NRA to go on TV tomorrow</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356236518343</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 23:21:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only one I can think of not wanting armed police at schools are child molesters.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1356236846261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 23:27:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356238500010-64</Id><Topic><Title>Who cares what this pecker-wood says?</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1356231735557</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 22:02:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah pecker head, Obama is going to ask the 85% of the country that believes in his policies to take the political guns out of the hands of the 15% of you nut cases, turns out democracy wins, you "patriots" that think killing 6 year old children advances democracy lose, hey here is an idea, all you gun nuts and baggers that believe what you believe stand up for what you believe and shoot your children!!</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356238500010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 23:55:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
