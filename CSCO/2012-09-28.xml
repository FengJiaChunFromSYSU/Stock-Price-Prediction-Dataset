The key is the economy, say political science professors Kenneth Bickers of CU-Boulder and Michael Berry of CU Denver. Their prediction model stresses economic data from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, including both state and national unemployment figures as well as changes in real per capita income, among other factors. “Based on our forecasting model, it becomes clear that the president is in electoral trouble,” said Bickers, also director of the CU in DC Internship Program. According to their analysis, President Barack Obama will win 218 votes in the Electoral College, short of the 270 he needs. And though they chiefly focus on the Electoral College, the political scientists predict Romney will win 52.9 percent of the popular vote to Obama’s 47.1 percent, when considering only the two major political parties. “For the last eight presidential elections, this model has correctly predicted the winner,” said Berry. “The economy has seen some improvement since President Obama took office. What remains to be seen is whether voters will consider the economy in relative or absolute terms. If it’s the former, the president may receive credit for the economy’s trajectory and win a second term. In the latter case, Romney should pick up a number of states Obama won in 2008.” Their model correctly predicted all elections since 1980, including two years when independent candidates ran strongly, 1980 and 1992. It also correctly predicted the outcome in 2000, when Al Gore received the most popular vote but George W. Bush won the election. The study will be published this month in PS: Political Science &amp; Politics, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Political Science Association. It will be among about a dozen election prediction models, but one of only two to focus on the Electoral College. While many forecast models are based on the popular vote, the Electoral College model developed by Bickers and Berry is the only one of its type to include more than one state-level measure of economic conditions. In addition to state and national unemployment rates, the authors looked at per capita income, which indicates the extent to which people have more or less disposable income. Research shows that these two factors affect the major parties differently: Voters hold Democrats more responsible for unemployment rates while Republicans are held more responsible for per capita income. Accordingly -- and depending largely on which party is in the White House at the time -- each factor can either help or hurt the major parties disproportionately. Their results show that “the apparent advantage of being a Democratic candidate and holding the White House disappears when the national unemployment rate hits 5.6 percent,” Berry said. The results indicate, according to Bickers, “that the incumbency advantage enjoyed by President Obama, though statistically significant, is not great enough to offset high rates of unemployment currently experienced in many of the states.” In an examination of other factors, the authors found that none of the following had any statistically significant effect on whether a state ultimately went for a particular candidate: The location of a party’s national convention; the home state of the vice president; or the partisanship of state governors. In 2012, “What is striking about our state-level economic indicator forecast is the expectation that Obama will lose almost all of the states currently considered as swing states, including North Carolina, Virginia, New Hampshire, Colorado, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida,” Bickers said. In Colorado, which went for Obama in 2008, the model predicts that Romney will receive 51.9 percent of the vote to Obama’s 48.1 percent, again with only the two major parties considered. The authors also provided caveats. Factors they said may affect their prediction include the timeframe of the economic data used in the study and close tallies in certain states. The current data was taken five months in advance of the Nov. 6 election and they plan to update it with more current economic data in September. A second factor is that states very close to a 50-50 split may fall an unexpected direction. “As scholars and pundits well know, each election has unique elements that could lead one or more states to behave in ways in a particular election that the model is unable to correctly predict,” Berry said. Election prediction models “suggest that presidential elections are about big things and the stewardship of the national economy,” Bickers said. “It’s not about gaffes, political commercials or day-to-day campaign tactics. I find that heartening for our democracy.”</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348808022704</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 00:53:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348810304954-2</Id><Topic><Title>Soros donates 1 million to Obama superpac after Obama snubs Netanyahu</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1348796826481</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 21:47:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good, Netanyahu is an ahhzzhol.

In the report, Goldman Sachs wrote, "We reiterate our Conviction Buy on Cisco, as we believe there are two areas where the market is underestimating the company's long-term earnings potential and applying an unwarranted discount to the multiple. (1) In the area of software-defined networking (SDN), we believe Cisco will be able to achieve significant differentiation through its integration of ASICs, hardware, and software. We believe its ASICs in particular will increase in importance, as demonstrated by Cisco's introduction of a 10Gb switch last week based on its own ASIC that has significantly better latency than Arista's, which had previously led using merchant silicon. (2) We believe it will become increasingly apparent in coming months that the set-top box (STB) market is likely to experience secular growth rather than secular decline, as STBs evolve to home gateways that integrate with a carrier's cloud to stream video to various end devices around the home. In our view, Cisco is uniquely well positioned to benefit from that secular shift, both in STBs and infrastructure, given its main competitor – Motorola Mobility – is likely less focused on that post its acquisition by Google. Separately, Mr. Chambers sounded very confident on the competitive landscape and Cisco's margin trajectory, and continues to expect dividend increases." Goldman Sachs maintained its Buy rating and $24 price target on Cisco Systems, which closed Thursday at $18.80.</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1348838005794</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 09:13:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348838553473-25</Id><Topic><Title>Goldman report on CSCO this AM: $24 target</Title><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1348838005794</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 09:13:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like my recent BUY at $18.40 earlier this week is looking pretty good.

One of the odder little subplots of the 2012 election has been the growth of poll denialism among Republicans. As Mitt Romney's chances have grown ever dimmer, a cottage industry has sprung up on the right claiming that presidential polls suffer from liberal bias and Romney is really doing better than they say. "When the published poll shows Obama ahead by, say, 48-45," explains conservative pundit Dick Morris, "he's really probably losing by 52-48!" Now, this is hardly in the same league as climate denialism or evolution denialism. What's more, it's perfectly understandable. It's human nature to cast around for reasons to stay optimistic about a political contest that you feel deeply about. I remember a milder version of the same thing happening in 2004, as liberals dug deep into the October poll numbers trying to convince themselves that John Kerry had a better chance to beat George Bush than the topline numbers suggested. One poll had a small sample size. Another one had a bad likely voter screen. A third one suffered from a known house effect. Etc. But it's what happened next that's instructive. A couple of years after the 2004 election, a guy named Nate Silver started deconstructing polls in minute detail and explaining exactly what made some polls good and others bad. His approach was unsparingly rigorous and his overarching message was: don't kid yourself. The numbers are what the numbers are, and they don't care if you're a liberal or a conservative. Week after week, Silver dug deep into the minutiae of how polls are put together and how they're conducted, writing lengthy, table-laden posts that often meandered through several thousand words. Liberals loved it. Before long he was, for all practical purposes, the liberal patron saint of polling. So far at least, the conservative approach has been....different. Their patron saint going into the last few weeks of the 2012 campaign is Dean Chambers, a blogger who runs a site called UnSkewed Polls. Chambers does not dig deep into the numbers. He doesn't explain sample sizes and cell phone biases. He does just one thing: he reweights all the polls so they have the same proportion of Democrats and Republicans estimated by Rasmussen Reports, a pollster with a longstanding Republican house effect. Then he announces what the numbers are after his reweighting is done. Romney is a big winner every time. Chambers doesn't even pretend that his approach has any rigor. He adopted it, he told BuzzFeed, after seeing a poll that "just didn't look right." After a closer look, he decided that none of the others looked right either. And what does he think accounts for this widespread blundering among the nation's pollsters? Not simple incompetence, Chambers says. It's all quite deliberate. "Any poll that says NBC, CBS, or ABC is going to be skewed and invested in trying to get this President re-elected," he explained. This is, to put it bluntly, nuts. And it suggests a fundamental difference between left and right, one that Chris Mooney wrote about earlier this year in The Republican Brain. Neither side has a monopoly on sloppy number crunching or wishful thinking, but liberals, faced with a reality they didn't like, ended up accepting reality and deciding to learn more about it. That's the Nate Silver approach. Conservatives, faced with a reality they didn't like, invented a conspiracy theory to explain it and then produced an alternate reality more to their liking. It's a crude and transparently glib reality, but that's apparently what the true believers want.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1348843119016</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:38:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348843610502-42</Id><Title>Demaind improving</Title><Msg>The technicals at stoxline website show strong buy this morning with the $23.07 target price in six months..</Msg><Username>cmrexsne</Username><Timestamp>1348843610502</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:46:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348844588544-43</Id><Title>Please don't puke after drinking this Tea.</Title><Msg>'Tea Party' Groups Attempting to Purge Voting Rolls in Ohio Posted: 28 Sep 2012 06:00 AM PDT Click here to view this media Here we go again with more dirty tricks from Republicans trying to steal another presidential election -- Tea party groups work to remove names from Ohio voter rolls: Lori Monroe, a 40-year-old Democrat who lives in central Ohio, was startled a few weeks ago to open a letter that said a stranger was challenging her right to vote in the presidential election. Monroe, who was recovering from cancer surgery, called the local election board to protest. A local tea party leader was trying to strike Monroe from the voter rolls for a reason that made no sense: Her apartment building in Lancaster was listed as a commercial property. "I'm like, really? Seriously?" Monroe said. "I've lived here seven years, and now I'm getting challenged?" Monroe's is one of at least 2,100 names that tea party groups have sought to remove from Ohio's voter rosters. The groups and their allies describe it as a citizen movement to prevent ballot fraud, although the Republican secretary of state said in an interview that he knew of no evidence that any more than a handful of illegal votes had been cast in Ohio in the last few presidential elections. "We're all about election integrity — making sure everyone who votes is registered and qualified voters," said Mary Siegel, one of the leaders of the Ohio effort. Some Democrats see it as a targeted vote-suppression drive. The names selected for purging include hundreds of college students, trailer park residents, homeless people and African Americans in counties President Obama won in 2008. [...] The tea party groups, scattered around the state, have joined forces under the banner of the Ohio Voter Integrity Project. It is an offshoot of True the Vote, a Texas organization that has recruited volunteers nationwide to challenge voter rosters and work as poll watchers. True the Vote was founded by Catherine and Bryan Engelbrecht, a couple who run an oil field equipment manufacturing firm in Rosenberg, Texas. In Ohio, election records show, one of the project's top priorities has been to remove college students from the voter rolls for failure to specify dorm room numbers. (As a group, college students are strongly in Obama's camp.) Voters challenged include 284 students at the Ohio State University campus in Columbus, 110 at Oberlin College, 88 at College of Wooster, 38 at Kent State — and dozens more from the University of Cincinnati, Miami University, Lake Erie College, Walsh University, Hiram College, John Carroll University and Telshe Yeshiva, a rabbinical college near Cleveland. So far, every county election board that has reviewed the dorm challenges found them invalid.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1348844588544</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 11:03:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348844838020-44</Id><Topic><Title>republican's know most American's blame gwbush for the mess the country is in.

OH THANKS FOR THAT CHECK !</Title><Msg>Viper tongues hat in hand.... Texas Gov. Rick Perry decided Thursday to accept the $17 billion his state has coming to it, after days of hemming and hawing about the handout. South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal Op-Ed page in November titled “Don’t Bail Out My State,” did the same. They’re in good company; Minnesota’s Tim Pawlenty criticized the plan loudly while Congress debated it, then said he owed it to his constituents to take it. Alabama Gov. Bob Riley stepped up his criticism of the bill after announcing he would take the $2 billion his state gets from it. Republicans in the House even boasted about the bacon the bill would bring home, after engineering a unanimous vote against it. When just about every state is in a financial crunch, thanks to the collapsing economy, it’s hard to hold the line and actually turn down the cash. “It’s #$%$ stupid,” said one Republican consultant in Washington. “If the money’s there, they’d be nuts to not take it … If it’s a question of, ‘Hey, the money’s going to be spent, so we might as well spend it in our state,’ that’s just nuts to turn it down.”</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1348850011772</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 12:33:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348850047495-71</Id><Topic><Title>Media Matters Lemmings out in force today</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1348847107117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 11:45:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody cares what you have to say BOYsurfer, you haven't figured out the difference between the truth and a lie.

The most reliable leading indicator in the world is showing that the president has the election wrapped up. Dick Morris — the Fox News analyst who is always wrong – said Wednesday: “If the election were held today, Mitt Romney would win by a margin of four or five points.” This allows everyone else to predict with near certainty that Barack Obama will win a second term. Since Morris was forced out of the Clinton White House in a scandal that involved toes and a prostitute, he has amazed and delighted Fox News audiences by being wrong about everything, earning a reputation as the “world’s worst political pundit.” Morris’ many greatest hits include predicting that the nominees in the 2008 presidential election would definitely be Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice; naming an exact date — July 27, 2012 — when President Obama would come and take Americans’ guns; and asserting with 100 percent confidence that Donald Trump would run for president in 2012. Most impressive of all, Morris gets paid well to make these predictions based on his access to what he calls “the real polls.” What’s strange about the Republican establishment this election is that Dick Morris is no longer an outlier. Karl Rove and the rest of the right-wing media are very well aware that Mitt Romney’s campaign is crumbling. But they insist that what’s actually going on is a concerted effort by the mainstream media to inflate Obama’s lead and demoralize Republican voters. They’re unskewing polls and arguing sample size as if they believe in witchcraft-like statistics. If I were conspiracy minded, I would suspect that Fox News had Dick Morris predict a Romney victory just to make Democrats overconfident. The Obama campaign must be aware that Morris has guaranteed its triumph, but they say they’re still running as if they’re down ten points in every swing state. They know that more than the future of the country is at stake. What would happen to reality as we know it if Dick Morris were actually right about something?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1348858616649</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:56:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348858681549-108</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi-GATE</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1348857886012</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:44:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't really even HAVE a job, do ya Hon?</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1348858681549</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:58:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348858691206-109</Id><Title>OH BOY....Now even Democrats want to know why Obama LIED.</Title><Msg>Lead Democrats are asking the WhiteHouse for information on Benghazi.

The first version of the plan would cost seniors around $6,000 more a year than current Medicare. The corresponding Medicaid cuts would strand millions of seniors who use the program to pay for Medicare deductibles and nursing homes. Is this really what Mitt wants to be talking about? Today he brought out a white board to explain how he’d save Medicare for current and future generations. By repealing Obamacare and its savings, however, he would make Medicare insolvent by the end of his first term. If you’re a Republican talking about Medicare in a general election, you’re probably losing.

What about the 16 homicides in Chicago every day? They are just as sad, but that's all black on black violence, and to quote Jesse Jackson, 'When a black man kills another black man, it's just Miller time." More cultural and civilization decline. The gangsta culture in black areas of America would scare you crapless if you had to live there day in and day out. Why does no one in the black community SERIOUSLY address this? Young black men are the most dangerous element in any young black man's life. Statistically young black men are far safer in prison that out on the street where their risk of homicide by another young black male skyrockets. Democrats have pretended to care about black folks for decades. They don't. All serious evaluations of the black culture point to the absence of fathers in the lives of young black men as the major cause of severe and deadly violence. An involved, active father is the only parameter that changes ALL young men from deadly killers to occasionally crazy nutters, but not so very dangerous to each other if they grew up with an active, involved, concerned and engaged dad. Isn't that interesting.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1348872092893</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:41:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348872113358-161</Id><Topic><Title>Romney winning in Florida</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348859908726</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 15:18:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most polls are 1000 or less,stupid .You made the same dumb statement under your Magoo id earlier today.LOL</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1348872113358</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:41:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348872164957-162</Id><Title>Libs think it would look bad if we vote out "the 1st "black" president"</Title><Msg>1st of all he is Bi Racial, raised by white people in Hawaii, and Indonesia.

Not surprisingly, when Tea Partiers show up and rally by the thousands, they get all but ignored, while 30 Occupy Wall Street crazies in masks will always get wall-to-wall coverage and admiration. TV shows and movies take cheap shots at Tea Party conservatives, often linking them to murder-of-the-week cases on insipid crime procedurals or dismissing them as “birthers.” But a new Associated Press poll shows tea party supporters may have the last laugh in November. The AP/GFK poll shows that 31% of likely voters consider themselves Tea Party supporters. With 131 million votes cast in the 2008 elections, that translates into an incredible voting bloc of 41 million Tea Party supporters waiting to cast ballots. These voters have already made their voices heard in Wisconsin earlier this year, as well as in Republican primaries in Texas and Nebraska. That 31% of likely voters figure is greater than the 19% who described themselves as either strongly or somewhat liberal. Surprisingly, liberals have escaped media characterization as being a small, fringe-like group with little power or influence. At 19% of likely voters, self-described liberals would have a turnout of 25 million voters, some 16 million fewer voters than the Tea Party. The good news for Mitt Romney and other Republican hopefuls is that the Tea Party supporters also appear ready to turn out in much higher numbers than all other voters. For instance, while they only made up 23% of the initial polling sample, which was a sample of all adults, their numbers improve as unlikely voters were removed by the AP from the data. When unregistered and unlikely voters were taken out of the poll, their share of the vote increased by 35%, to nearly one-third of the voting population. Meanwhile, self-described liberals fell 11% from the initial sample to the likely voter sample, while moderates increased by 3% and conservatives increased by 8%. This enthusiasm gap could make the difference in November. Once unregistered and unlikely voters were removed from the AP poll sample, Obama’s share of the vote plummeted by 10%, while Romney’s share of the vote increased by 28%. That support is driven, of course, by a supposedly dead movement. Overall, the poll shows a statistical tie with Obama at 47%, and Romney at 46%.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348875630637</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 19:40:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348876253050-171</Id><Title>21 Ways Obama has Raised your taxes</Title><Msg>President Barack Obama has signed into law 21 new or higher taxes on the American people. The full list is below: 1. A 156 percent increase in the federal excise tax on tobacco: On February 4, 2009, just 16 days into his administration, Obama signed into law a 156 percent increase in the federal excise tax on tobacco, a hike of 61 cents per pack. The median income of smokers is just over $36,000 per year. 2. Obamacare Individual Mandate Excise Tax (takes effect in Jan 2014): Starting in 2014, anyone not buying “qualifying” health insurance — as defined by Obama-appointed HHS bureaucrats — must pay an income surtax according to the higher of the following: 1 Adult 2 Adults 3+ Adults 2014 1% AGI/$95 1% AGI/$190 1% AGI/$285 2015 2% AGI/$325 2% AGI/$650 2% AGI/$975 2016+ 2.5% AGI/$695 2.5% AGI/$1390 2.5% AGI/$2085 The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that six million American families will be liable for the tax, and as Americans for Tax Reform has pointed out, 100 percent of Americans filing a tax return (140 million filers) will be forced to submit paperwork to the IRS showing they had “qualifying” health insurance for every month of the tax year. (Bill: PPACA; Page: 317-337). 3. Obamacare Employer Mandate Tax (takes effect Jan. 2014): If an employer does not offer health coverage, and at least one employee qualifies for a health tax credit, the employer must pay an additional non-deductible tax of $2,000 for all full-time employees. Applies to all employers with 50 or more employees. If any employee actually receives coverage through the exchange, the penalty on the employer for that employee rises to $3,000. If the employer requires a waiting period to enroll in coverage of 30-60 days, there is a $400 tax per employee ($600 if the period is 60 days or longer).Bill: PPACA; Page: 345-346. Combined score of individual and employer mandate tax penalty: $65 billion/10 years. 4. Obamacare Surtax on Investment Income (Tax hike of $123 billion/takes effect Jan. 2013): Creation of a new, 3.8 percent surtax on investment income earned in households making at least $250,000 ($200,000 single). This would result in the following top tax rates on investment income: Bill: Reconciliation Act; Page: 87-93 Capital Gains Dividends Other* 2011-2012 15% 15% 35% 2013+ (current law) 23.8% 43.4% 43.4% 2013+ (Obama budget) 23.8% 23.8% 43.4% *Other unearned income includes (for surtax purposes) gross income from interest, annuities, royalties, net rents, and passive income in partnerships and Subchapter-S corporations. It does not include municipal bond interest or life insurance proceeds, since those do not add to gross income. It does not include active trade or business income, fair market value sales of ownership in pass-through entities, or distributions from retirement plans. The 3.8 percent surtax does not apply to non-resident aliens. 5. Obamacare Excise Tax on Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans (Tax hike of $32 billion/takes effect Jan. 2018): Starting in 2018, new 40 percent excise tax on “Cadillac” health insurance plans ($10,200 single/$27,500 family). Higher threshold ($11,500 single/$29,450 family) for early retirees and high-risk professions. CPI +1 percentage point indexed. Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,941-1,956 6. Obamacare Hike in Medicare Payroll Tax (Tax hike of $86.8 billion/takes effect Jan. 2013): Current law and changes: First $200,000 ($250,000 Married) Employer/Employee All Remaining Wages Employer/Employee Current Law 1.45%/1.45% 2.9% self-employed 1.45%/1.45% 2.9% self-employed Obamacare Tax Hike 1.45%/1.45% 2.9% self-employed 1.45%/2.35% 3.8% self-employed Bill: PPACA, Reconciliation Act; Page: 2000-2003; 87-93 7. Obamacare Medicine Cabinet Tax (Tax hike of $5 billion/took effect Jan. 2011): Americans are no longer able to use health savings account (HSA), flexible spending account (FSA), or health reimbursement (HRA) pre-tax dollars to purchase non-prescription, over-the-counter medicines (except insulin). Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,957-1,959. 8. Obamacare HSA Withdrawal Tax Hike (Tax hike of $1.4 billion/took effect Jan. 2011): Increases additional tax on non-medical early withdrawals from an HSA from 10 to 20 percent, disadvantaging them relative to IRAs and other tax-advantaged accounts, which remain at 10 percent. Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,959. 9. Obamacare Flexible Spending Account Cap – aka “Special Needs Kids Tax” (Tax hike of $13 billion/takes effect Jan. 2013): Imposes cap on FSAs of $2500 (currently unlimited). Indexed to inflation after 2013. There is one group of FSA owners for whom this new cap will be particularly cruel and onerous: parents of special needs children. There are thousands of families with special needs children in the United States, and many of them use FSAs to pay for special needs education. Tuition rates at one leading school that teaches special needs children in Washington, D.C. (National Child Research Center) can easily exceed $14,000 per year. Under tax rules, FSA dollars can be used to pay for this type of special needs education. Bill: PPACA; Page: 2,388-2,389. 10. Obamacare Tax on Medical Device Manufacturers (Tax hike of $20 billion/takes effect Jan. 2013): Medical device manufacturers 409,000 people in 12,000 plants across the country. This law imposes a new 2.3 percent excise tax on total sales, even if the respective company does not earn a profit.
