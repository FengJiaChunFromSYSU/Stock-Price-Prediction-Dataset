North Korean military is massing on the border with South Korea to re-unify Korea. Two unfinished wars are re-kindling -- Korean war never officially ended and the Mooslime do not like that the US and Britain established Israel on what the Arabs consider their land. Leaving the Palestinians without a state was a mistake and has led to expressions of frustration manifested in the various hijackings and terrorist acts of the last 40 years against Israelis at the Munich Olympics, Lockerbie, USS Cole, 9/11, etc. The rise of Mooslime fundamentalism from the confidence engendered by the successful OPEC stunt in the 70's led by Gadaffi and others has led Iran to build a nuke so they can eliminate Israel.

The video riffed off her speech at CPAC, in which Palin railed against “the big consultants, the big money men, and the big bad media.” But there’s an irony alert ahead: the current stated purpose of SarahPAC is to raise money ahead of the 2014 election—most of which will be spent on conservative consultants. Don't believe me? Well, this is a perfect time to page through SarahPAC’s Federal Election Commission filings, which—helpfully enough—were just released yesterday. Seen through the lens of the invaluable Center for Responsive Politics, Palin’s PAC spent $5.1 million in the last election cycle (more than it raised in that time period, raising some questions about Palin’s claims of fiscal responsibility). SarahPAC recently released a new promotional video, titled "Loaded for Bear." But the real news comes when you look at how donors’ money was actually doled out: just $298,500 to candidates. The bulk of the rest of it, more than $4.8 million, went to—you guessed it—consultants.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364652454594</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 10:07:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364652465488-35</Id><Topic><Title>Advice for everyone is the doorstep to the temple of wisdom is a knowledge of our own ignorance.</Title><Username>venshdave</Username><Timestamp>1364651209883</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 09:46:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumb saying somebody posts all the time is funny.

The video riffed off her speech at CPAC, in which Palin railed against “the big consultants, the big money men, and the big bad media.” But there’s an irony alert ahead: the current stated purpose of SarahPAC is to raise money ahead of the 2014 election—most of which will be spent on conservative consultants. Don't believe me? Well, this is a perfect time to page through SarahPAC’s Federal Election Commission filings, which—helpfully enough—were just released yesterday. Seen through the lens of the invaluable Center for Responsive Politics, Palin’s PAC spent $5.1 million in the last election cycle (more than it raised in that time period, raising some questions about Palin’s claims of fiscal responsibility). SarahPAC recently released a new promotional video, titled "Loaded for Bear." But the real news comes when you look at how donors’ money was actually doled out: just $298,500 to candidates. The bulk of the rest of it, more than $4.8 million, went to—you guessed it—consultants.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364665130879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 13:38:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364672871589-62</Id><Title>IMPROVE BUS SERVICE AND GET RID OF PASSENGER TRAINS</Title><Msg>We've reached the point of no return on wasteful subsidies</Msg><Username>allouezsup</Username><Timestamp>1364672871589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 15:47:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364673509238-63</Id><Topic><Title>Sarah getting kick backs from consultants, send her more money tea bilies, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364665130879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 13:38:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kickbacks???

We proposed and tested mediation models in which lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice, an effect mediated through the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (social conservatism, right-wing authoritarianism) and low levels of contact with out-groups. In an analysis of two large-scale, nationally representative United Kingdom data sets (N = 15,874), we found that lower general intelligence (g) in childhood predicts greater racism in adulthood, and this effect was largely mediated via conservative ideology. A secondary analysis of a U.S. data set confirmed a predictive effect of poor abstract-reasoning skills on antihomosexual prejudice, a relation partially mediated by both authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact. All analyses controlled for education and socioeconomic status. Our results suggest that cognitive abilities play a critical, albeit underappreciated, role in prejudice. Consequently, we recommend a heightened focus on cognitive ability in research on prejudice and a better integration of cognitive ability into prejudice models.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364674042044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 16:07:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364674151437-67</Id><Title>funny how easy it is to separate the dumb tea billies from their money, LOL</Title><Msg>ZeekRewards scam leaves N.C. town millions poorer Mitch Weiss, AP Writer10:42a.m. EDT March 30, 2013 (Photo: Chuck Burton, AP) STORY HIGHLIGHTS Paul Burks was mastermind of one of biggest Ponzi schemes in U.S. history Securities and Exchange Commission received complaints, waited months to take action against Burks Losses total $600 million; Burks paid $4 million fine and is cooperating with court to recover investment losses LEXINGTON, N.C. (AP) — In the hardware store on South Main Street, the owner pulled Caron Myers aside to tell her about the best thing to happen in years to this once-thriving furniture and textile town. Did she hear about the online company ZeekRewards? For a small investment, she could make a fortune. He had invested. So had his grandsons. And so were more and more people in Lexington, including doctors, lawyers and accountants. Skeptical at first, Myers drove a few blocks to the company's one-story, red-brick office and spotted a line of people circling the building. She was sold, and plunked down several thousand dollars. But months later, Myers, like hundreds of thousands of others, discovered the truth: ZeekRewards was a scam.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364674151437</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 16:09:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364674270900-68</Id><Topic><Title>Science proves tea billies are stupid, no wonder they don't believe in science</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364674042044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 16:07:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bet most teapartiers dont say " filet minion ", you moron.LOL Tell us about eating at upscale restaurants, you phony.LOL</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1364674270900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 16:11:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364675590590-69</Id><Topic><Title>Science proves tea billies are stupid, no wonder they don't believe in science</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364674042044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 16:07:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumb is a nobody who lies trying to impress strangers on the net .Kind of sad actually.</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1364675590590</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 16:33:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364676039083-70</Id><Topic><Title>Nearly all of Angry Obama's public appearances these days are complaint, finger-pointing events</Title><Username>maxwizard688</Username><Timestamp>1364582892013</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 14:48:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thats because the money set aside for lil jesses jrs going to the pokey party got seequestersd, and Oboomba got #$%$</Msg><Username>joespada282</Username><Timestamp>1364676039083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 16:40:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364677306233-71</Id><Title>funny Ivan changing ids and posting multiple times</Title><Msg>it's pretty funny how I can pull his chain, headed out to the closer country club for dinner tonight, LOL it's funny I can remember when you could get dinner and wine for less then $200</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364677306233</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 17:01:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364677389016-72</Id><Title>`R`O`M`N`E`Y` 2012!!!!!!
