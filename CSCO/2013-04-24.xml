CCUR has a video-on-demand (VOD) technology reach of 50mm households, even larger than CSCO's VOD reach! Their competitor Harmonic (HLIT) rose to a new 52-week high of $6.02 on Tuesday and afterhours reported a non-GAAP EPS loss of ($0.02) down $0.05 from a non-GAAP EPS profit of $0.03 in 2012. HLIT's trailing 12 month non-GAAP EPS fell from $0.25 down to $0.20 and HLIT afterhours was trading for $5.89 with a P/E of 29.45. HLIT's non-GAAP EPS declined $0.05 year-over-year but CCUR reports earnings on April 23rd and CCUR is expected to report GAAP EPS of $0.09 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 vs. GAAP EPS of $0.04 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 in 2012. CCUR's trailing 12 month non-GAAP EPS is expected to increase by $0.05 from $0.35 up to $0.40! CCUR could have double the trailing 12 month EPS of HLIT and CCUR closed Tuesday at only $6.77 per share! With HLIT trading at $5.89 after hours on Tuesday, CCUR could be ready to rally to double HLIT's share price and reach $11.78 per share! CCUR has only 8.72mm o/s, a market cap of $59.03mm, $24.6mm in cash, no debt, and a very low enterprise value of only $34.43mm or just 0.55X its trailing revenue of $62.59mm. CCUR has huge gross margins of 58.81%, which are 30.69% greater than HLIT's gross margins of 45%. HLIT has an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.93 and CCUR deserves a multiple that is 30.69% higher, which would give CCUR a ratio of 1.22 and value CCUR at $11.58 per share! HLIT just sold their low margin cable access business for $46mm in cash. It was breaking even with $52.9mm in revenue and sold for 0.87X revenue when it only had gross margins of 30%! CCUR's gross margins are nearly double and CCUR is about to report their 5th consecutive quarter of profitability! Even an enterprise value/revenue ratio of just 1 would value CCUR at $10 per share! CCUR could break $10 within the next two weeks!</Msg><Username>frankf4u489</Username><Timestamp>1366787230419</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 03:07:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366802329002-4</Id><Topic><Title>Csco is smoking JNPR big time!</Title><Username>chillywilley830</Username><Timestamp>1366770753885</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 22:32:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seems like every quarter Juniper or another competitor drags Cisco down and Cisco still comes out with good earnings but only retraces what it lost.

Plans to release illegal immigrants in anticipation of looming budget cuts were announced earlier this week, but the report by The Associated Press detailed the policy had already taken effect and on a much larger scale. Citing federal documents, the agency said more than 2,000 illegal immigrants facing deportation had been released from immigration jails and plans exist to release 3,000 more people by the end of the month. The newly disclosed figures are significantly higher than what the Obama administration acknowledged this week as a "few hundred" who were released without the White House’s direct knowledge.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1366818650031</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 11:50:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366818838424-23</Id><Topic><Title>People On Terrorism Watch List Not Blocked From Buying Guns</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1366817467902</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 11:31:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The most effective way to reduce gun violence is to just keep lib-tards from being able to buy firearms.</Msg><Username>tljarvis1968</Username><Timestamp>1366818838424</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 11:53:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366819109604-24</Id><Topic><Title>-LQQK- Where will CSCO Bounce?

W. said he really didn't care, and was not bothered about the existence of Bin Laden. Youtube words of the dunce if you dispute in any way. the Great Barack Obama has come up with a very workable deficit reduction budget that your cretins like Ted Cruz/Rand Paul/Paul Ryan #$%$ on cause they want to STEAL money from old people who have paid into SS and medicare. Both foreign and domestic policy is spot on. The GREAT Barack Obama, who will retain office for 3.5 more years, voted in by a significant majority of Americans is LEADING and the #$%$ pukes who are listening to fools like you, Walter, and their meal ticket #$%$bags like the Koch bros and the NRA stand in the way of progress. As soon as corporate America realizes that Obamacare is the LAW OF THE LAND and they will reap financial and tax benefits of employing Americans instead of shipping jobs overseas and to Mexico..then a flood gate of idle capital will usher in a new prosperity not unlike the 90s.
