That is Fact. Chambers spent at least $80 billion in repurchases, that is a lot of money per share that could have gone for dividends. Brad was also right that Chambers paid himself a lot for a company whos stock even after the $80 billion spent repurchasing stock went down over the past 12 years, from $22 per share average to $15 just a few weeks ago. Me I just think that Chambers is in with the shorts, the stock runs up in the week before CC and beats 8-9 times out of `10 CC's but Chambers boots the Guidance teeing it up for the shorts to make a killing and shafting the longs. Brad was more right than you guys, or Cisco would be now $40-60 dollars, and we would have only 3 billion shares in the float. Also, I think Chambers should have given us all a $3 one time divvy like Microsoft did.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1345090315377</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:11:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345090509582-2</Id><Title>Think 27 in a year as CSCO takes dividend to $1.00/share</Title><Msg>Chambers said CSCO is going to keep raising dividend and get to a 50% return of the near 12B/year cash that is increasing.</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1345090509582</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:15:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345090890804-3</Id><Topic><Title>The status of CSCO</Title><Username>yourdaddy3980</Username><Timestamp>1345089506358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 23:58:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fmi - what technology exactly is it that everyone must catch up with, that csco has? the us govt 'will' continually pay for necessary leading edge technologies...if they won#$%$ because it isn't necessary.</Msg><Username>two_iron_man</Username><Timestamp>1345090890804</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:21:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345091765691-4</Id><Title>Conoco phillips has 5 percent dividend and oil is at 94.

(Pink Sheets:HIMR) ("Hollund" or the "Company") announced today that the company has executed a MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) formalizing Hollund's exclusive right to manage and operate a patented underwater robotic resource technology. Part of Hollund's pursuit of this license was to enhance the potential to acquire concessions the South American Project Development Team cited as a $2 Billion Dollar opportunity in Brazil. Having now secured the technology, Hollund is well positioned to benefit from planed future developments targeted at the Tucurui and Balbina dam reservoirs. "Now that we have secured an exclusive license agreement, we have the ability to market and operate the technology across a number of disciplines," stated Peter Meier, President of Hollund Industrial Marine. "This includes underwater gold mine dredging, spill response clean up, disaster recovery and environmental remediation. However, to be clear, we are completely focused on our core business model; which is to secure underwater tree harvesting concessions." It is expected that a formalized licensing agreement will be executed inside of September 2012. However, the MOU is binding for a term of 10 years. The MOU grants Hollund the full rights to begin selling, managing and operating the underwater robotic resource technology exclusively and immediately. Management suggests the MOU provides a much more lucrative arrangement for Hollund. "Now, instead of receiving a finder's fee for procuring underwater forestry concessions, we can share in the greater portion of a concession's revenue," continued Meier. "Revenue generated from a single log can range between $750 and $2,000. Value is based on the region of the world where the underwater timber is harvested as well as the actual tree species and size. This patented technology will enable us to harvest inundated forests at depths of 120ft; giving Hollund an advantage in extracting larger trees and greater volumes." People close to the company suggest the real excitement resides in 'what's next' for Hollund as a result of the exclusivity. That 'next' is the potential relationship expected to now be furthered with North Cal (premier reclaimed woods company) based on this license. Securing this license appears to have been a prerequisite for North Cal to continue forward with Hollund in a strategic partnership. A strategic arrangement with North Cal at this juncture could accelerate Hollund's growth and substantially evolve the business model. Should Hollund secure a strategic relationship with one of the country's most prominent woods product and distribution sources, the company could ensure a dedicated global sales outlet for its timber. The company's revenue potential would also be positively impacted by this relationship quite significantly. Utilizing the support of North Cal, Hollund could become a beacon to the various global 'Go Green' initiatives. Having now secured this exclusive license, management suggests that the stage has been set for Hollund and North Cal to seek a formal arrangement. Sources suggest that at the very least, an MOU or LOI could be completed within the month. Hollund has aggressively stepped up discussions with pending concession prospects in South America.

To date we have only received a partial return for year ending 2010 and a "projection" of taxes for year ending 2011. Unfortunately this is inadequate documentation to evaluate your financial history and allegiances, which are critical to understand your previous behavior. Given the disappointing Swiss bank accounts and Cayman shell corporations that we have previously discussed, these documents are now critical to better understand your past financial background. This understanding is in turn required in order to make an informed decision regarding your capability to perform the financially sensitive position that you have applied for. If you have recently released the tax returns for years ending 2000-2011, please accept our sincere apology and we will continue to evaluate your application. If however we do not receive your tax records for the years ending 2000-2011 , we regret that we will be unable to process your application, and unable to consider you for the position for which you have applied. If this is the case, we want to send our appreciation for your effort and application and encourage you to reapply when you are better able to meet with our admittedly high standards. Thank You and Best Regards. The American People.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345122782390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:13:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345122851729-66</Id><Title>Opens at $18.60 - Closes at $19.30 ---</Title><Msg>This one is going higher today shorts will cover at the open for huge volumes..........</Msg><Username>iroc88joe1234</Username><Timestamp>1345122851729</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:14:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345122857711-67</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO FRAUD PUMP: LET US DUMP TODAY ..CHAMBERS IS FRAUD RAPE CROOK AT CSCO</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1345122459644</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:07:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I suggest you sell your 100 shares and get out it may go down because of your sell.</Msg><Username>jasm5</Username><Timestamp>1345122857711</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:14:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345123732599-68</Id><Topic><Title>dear Mitt</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345122782390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:13:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't the IRS part of OBumbles' bloated federal government?

Romney’s plan is to repeal Obamacare and replace it with patient-centered reforms that control cost throughout the health care system and extend the solvency of Medicare,’’ Saul said. ‘‘He will then implement real entitlement reform that places Medicare on a sustainable long-term footing so that future generations of Americans will not have to worry whether the program will be there for them.’’ But Obama’s cuts were not directly aimed at Medicare’s 48 million beneficiaries; instead they affect hospitals, insurers, nursing homes, drug companies and other service providers. Simply undoing the cuts would restore higher payments to those service providers. And that would cause Medicare to spend money faster. ‘‘The fact of the matter is, what Romney is proposing now is to roll all that back, which would mean that Medicare would reach insolvency eight years earlier, which would mean that seniors would lose benefits,’’ David Axelrod, a senior political adviser to Obama, said Thursday on MSNBC’s ‘‘Morning Joe.’’ Romney’s running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, kept the Obama cuts in his budget, which envisions greater savings by shifting future retirees into private insurance plans with a fixed payment from the government to help cover their premiums. ‘‘If you are going to restore (Obama’s cuts), then what it’s going to do is complicate the financial condition of Medicare,’’ said former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, a fiscal conservative who says government health care programs are too costly. ‘‘It’s going to affect your long-term plan to reform Medicare and reduce the deficit and mounting debt burdens,’’ said Walker, now heading the Comeback America Initiative, which promotes deficit reduction.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345124011451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:33:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345124042632-72</Id><Title>Red Flag</Title><Msg>Intense Competition Cisco is a market leader in many segments of the network equipment business.

Swiss banks are turning over thousands of employee names to U.S. authorities as they seek leniency for their alleged role in helping American clients evade taxes, according to lawyers representing banking staff. At least five banks supplied e-mails and telephone records containing as many as 10,000 names to the U.S. Department of Justice , according to estimates by Douglas Hornung, a Geneva- based lawyer representing 40 current and former employees of HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)'s Swiss unit, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) The data handover is illegal, said Alec Reymond, a former president of the Geneva Bar Association, who is representing two Credit Suisse staff. "The banks are burning their own people to try and cut deals with the DoJ," said Hornung. "This violation of personal privacy is unprecedented in the Swiss banking industry." Swiss banks want to settle a U.S. tax-evasion probe after the DoJ indicted Wegelin &amp; #$%$ Feb. 2 for allegedly helping customers hide money from the Internal Revenue Service. Credit Suisse, HSBC and Julius Baer, which have said they expect to pay fines to resolve the tax matter, are handing over data to mollify the U.S., according to Hornung.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345124437931</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:40:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345124574146-80</Id><Title>Corporations are over taxed</Title><Msg>hell we only sent Boeing $605 million in taxpayer money last year NEW YORK (AP) -- Twenty-six big U.S. companies paid their CEOs more last year than they paid the federal government in tax, according to a study released Thursday by a liberal-leaning think tank. The study, by the Institute for Policy Studies, said the companies, including AT&amp;T, Boeing and Citigroup, paid their CEOs an average of $20.4 million last year while paying little or no federal tax on ample profits, according to regulatory filings. On average, the 26 companies generated net income of more than $1 billion in the U.S., the study said. The study blasted tax rules allowing unlimited deductions for CEO "performance-based" pay, like many stock options. It said the five biggest performance payers among the 26 companies took $232 million of these deductions last year. Among the "kingpins" it criticized was CEO James McNerney Jr. of Boeing. It said he got $18.4 million in pay last year while his company received a tax refund of $605 million.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345124574146</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:42:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345125635159-81</Id><Title>why isn't holder in jail yet ?? above the law ??</Title><Msg>they should cuff this arrogant pos and take him to the holding tank until he releases all records on fast and furious ... where is obumbles on this ... we all know!!</Msg><Username>hoe.inthewall</Username><Timestamp>1345125635159</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:00:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345126234529-82</Id><Title>Sell your "unlocked" Facebook shares and buy CISCO!!!</Title><Msg>Perfect timing.</Msg><Username>basicarmandy</Username><Timestamp>1345126234529</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:10:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345126235955-83</Id><Topic><Title>Corporations are over taxed</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345124574146</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:42:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess that means that either their CEOs are overpaid or they are paying too little in taxes. Why shouldn't corporations pay their fair share of taxes? After all, it was Romney who said, "Corporations are people, too." Well, if "corporations are people," then they should pay the same taxes as people. Corporations use the roads, bridges, airways, police and fire department protection, ambulance services, and all the other things that taxes pay for. They're protected by the military. If they're using the ports and harbors, they rely on Coast Guard aids to navigation and port security. In fact, corporations get far more value for their tax dollars than the rest of the population combined. They often get government funding for research and development and then get to profit from the results. I don't mind paying my fair share as long as everyone else, including corporations, pay theirs.</Msg><Username>skinz4q</Username><Timestamp>1345126235955</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:10:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345126360228-84</Id><Title>P/E of only 9 on 2013 earnings, with 30B net cash and 3.2% dividend rate</Title><Msg>what shorts can ask for?

"America generates more than twice as much electricity from wind than when I took office," Obama said in the cornhusker state. "So my attitude is let's stop giving taxpayer subsidies to oil companies that don't need them, and let's invest in clean energy that will put people back to work right here in Iowa." Since 2008 wind power output has jumped from 25-gigawatts to 50-gigawatts, or enough to now power 15 million homes, according to the American Wind Energy Association. The wind energy sector currently employs 37,000 workers nationwide including 7,000 jobs in Iowa and 5,000 in Colorado.Without the credit, the expansion of wind power would come to a halt and thousands of people could lose their jobs. The tax issue in discussion currently grants wind energy companies a $0.02 tax credit for every kilowatt-hour generated. The tax credit will cost the federal government $1.6 billion this year. Romney would let the benefit expire in an effort to limit government intervention and return to what he considers a more pure form of free-market principles. However, Iowa's Republican Governor Terry Branstad and Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) disagree with Romney on this issue and are pushing to extend the credit. The increase in both jobs and wind energy output is due in large part to President Obama's $800 billion economic stimulus package passed during his first months in office, which allotted $90 billion to clean energy investment. According to Time magazine senior reporter Michael Grunwald, the Obama's stimulus bill, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, was the most "transformative energy bill in history." Not only did the bill create the largest wind farms in the world, it created more solar farms and a state-of-the-art electric and lithium battery industry, says Grunwald in the accompanying interview, noting the vast details in his new The New New Deal.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345131646422</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:40:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345131806206-116</Id><Title>dividends v/s stock buybacks</Title><Msg>I prefer dividend increases v/s buybacks...most companies do not do well in the timing of stock buybacks.

Swiss banks are turning over thousands of employee names to U.S. authorities as they seek leniency for their alleged role in helping American clients evade taxes, according to lawyers representing banking staff. At least five banks supplied e-mails and telephone records containing as many as 10,000 names to the U.S. Department of Justice , according to estimates by Douglas Hornung, a Geneva- based lawyer representing 40 current and former employees of HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)'s Swiss unit, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) The data handover is illegal, said Alec Reymond, a former president of the Geneva Bar Association, who is representing two Credit Suisse staff. "The banks are burning their own people to try and cut deals with the DoJ," said Hornung. "This violation of personal privacy is unprecedented in the Swiss banking industry." Swiss banks want to settle a U.S. tax-evasion probe after the DoJ indicted Wegelin &amp; #$%$ Feb. 2 for allegedly helping customers hide money from the Internal Revenue Service. Credit Suisse, HSBC and Julius Baer, which have said they expect to pay fines to resolve the tax matter, are handing over data to mollify the U.S., according to Hornung.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345131871360</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:44:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345132214242-118</Id><Title>what does joe biden know about slavery.</Title><Msg>hahahaha what an insult to african americans. how selling 3 trillion in debt to china going to enslave us idiot! our kids are now slaves to obamas drunken sailior spending.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345132214242</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:50:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345132732979-119</Id><Topic><Title>RASMUSSEN: ROMNEY-RYAN DISTANCING LEAVING OBAMA-BIDEN IN DUST</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1345128995781</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:56:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Better do some reading,bio.

Romney might well have thought in 2007 and 2008 that there was nothing to fear about a non-disclosed offshore account he'd set up years earlier precisely because it wasn't disclosed. But then came the settlement and the rush of non-disclosers to apply for the amnesty. Failing to apply for the amnesty and then getting charged by the IRS would have been both financially and politically disastrous. So amnesty it was.

President Obama wants to extend the wind energy tax credit that's set to expire at the end of the year. The tax incentive is opposed by many Republican lawmakers including his presidential opponents. During an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Ryan eluded to such tax incentives as a form of "crony capitalism and corporate welfare" and he essentially called green energy a "fad." During campaign stops last week in Colorado and this week in the battleground state of Iowa, Obama has been touting the benefits of America's bourgeoning wind industry. "America generates more than twice as much electricity from wind than when I took office," Obama said in the cornhusker state. "So my attitude is let's stop giving taxpayer subsidies to oil companies that don't need them, and let's invest in clean energy that will put people back to work right here in Iowa." Since 2008 wind power output has jumped from 25-gigawatts to 50-gigawatts, or enough to now power 15 million homes, according to the American Wind Energy Association. The wind energy sector currently employs 37,000 workers nationwide including 7,000 jobs in Iowa and 5,000 in Colorado.Without the credit, the expansion of wind power would come to a halt and thousands of people could lose their jobs.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1345137930908</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 13:25:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345138199294-163</Id><Topic><Title>NO JOBS NO JOBS NO JOBS NO JOBS --THANKS FOR NOTHING OLDBAMA!</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1345137636969</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 13:20:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He saved the auto industry !

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), built a career in Washington. But the wife of Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick spent a decade in Washington herself, first as a congressional aide and then as a corporate lobbyist, whose clients included the cigar industry, a logging company, drugmakers, the health insurance industry and a nuclear power plant. The details of Janna Ryan's lobbying career come as Democrats and Republican party insiders question whether Paul Ryan's career in government, and his scant private sector experience, are at odds with Mitt Romney's pro-business, anti-Washington message. Ryan, born Janna Christine Little, quit her lobbying job shortly after marrying her husband in late 2000, but by all accounts she was an effective lobbyist before that. Over just three years, Ryan's 20 corporate clients paid more than $2.7 million in lobbying fees to her two employers, Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Williams &amp; Jensen, according to records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Her clientroster reads like a who's who of some of America's most politically polarizing corporate interests. Drug industry clients included the Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers Alliance (PhRMA), Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and Novartis. Oil industry clients included Conoco and Marathon Oil. Big health insurance companies Blue Cross Blue Shield and Cigna were also on the list.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345142428384</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:40:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345142797566-187</Id><Title>Romney admits he is a tax felon</Title><Msg>Presumed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said he has reviewed his tax returns and that over the last decade he always paid at least 13 percent of his income in taxes.

The campaign is reacting to Romney's statement today that he has never paid less than 13 percent of his income in taxes during the past decade. The spokeswoman says Romney "has forefeited the right to have us take him just at his word." Romney is still declining to release his returns from before 2010. He has released his 2010 tax return and says he will release his return for 2011 before the November election. He told reporters in South Carolina today that Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid's suggest that Romney may have paid no taxes in some years is "totally false." Reid, citing an anonymous source, has charged that Romney didn't want to release any more returns because the Republican had paid no taxes in some years. The White House isn't commenting on Romney's tax rate. A spokesman says President Barack Obama believes it's a "useful and valuable" tradition for candidates to put forward multiple years of tax returns -- though it's "not always comfortable" for them to do so.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345146849528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 15:54:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345146864529-240</Id><Title>Anybody heard from the shorts from yesterday?</Title><Msg>I haven't.

This election should be 100% about creating jobs. There are none out there to be had, unless you create one for yourself (good luck getting financing from the banksters). Noone is hiring. Companies continue to consolidate and move jobs to the lowest lcost of labor regions, whether that is in the country (states with the lowest taxes and lowest salaries)or out of the country. In my humble opinion, Obama had his 4 years to do something about it and all he does is blame the previous administration for everything. He spent trillions of dollars of taxpayers money to pass his entire agenda unopposed and it did not work to create a single job. When he took office, the country was $5 trillion in debt (which is a vast sum) and he has now tripled or quadrupled that amount of debt. This is outrageous and detrimental for the country. Obama also does not take responsibility, nor never will, for promoting an anti-business climate that has made business reluctant to extend themselves to help people get employed. Instead, he has fostered an atmosphere of entitlement for the masses, while grandstanding against the successful entrepeneurs and creating social warfare in order to obtain votes. Our society is capitalist, not socialist, not communist and not a government tyranny. Nowhere does it say that to be fair, we must take money from the successful and give it out in such large quantities to the masses so that they have no incentive to ever find work or to ever take a lower paying job than the last one that they had or to expect Uncle Sam to provide for all their needs, including cable TV, video games, imported beer and Restless Legs Syndrome medication. Instead they might want to use those restless legs, get off the couch, turn off the TV, wipe the potato chips off their T-shirt, recycle the beer bottle and use all their resources to find some gainful activity. What we need is someone with a plan, any plan, to create jobs, not just a plan to reward their friends. Is Mitt Romney, the best man for the job. That remains to be seen. However, (and I mean this in the nicest possible way without being mean, condescending or patronizing) only a fool would allow Obama to destroy this great nation of ours.</Msg><Username>kz7m</Username><Timestamp>1345150814915</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 17:00:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345151298891-297</Id><Topic><Title>Presidential Election</Title><Username>kz7m</Username><Timestamp>1345150814915</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 17:00:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>capitalism failed - (had to be bailed out by US citizens - which is socialism) romney failed as gov of Mass to create jobs - and exported jobs to China at stain capital - you are delirious. as for Pinocchio ryan - his votes including tarp and the auto bailout put the US in a hole for trillions - and now he is some kind of deficit expert - ITS NOT WHAT YOU SAY ITS WHAT YOU DO - US BUSINESSES ARE MAKING MONEY HAND OVER FIST - you present fox news drivel - learn to think for yourself -</Msg><Username>hulksweider2000</Username><Timestamp>1345151298891</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 17:08:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345151318538-298</Id><Title>POINT OF NO RETURN...</Title><Msg>THAT point may not be the percentage of people WHO DO NOT PAY TAXES...50% being point of no return, but it may be the intellectual construct that Obimbo is pushing so hard...YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT!!! When a sizable part of the population actually, truly believes that government intervention is important, and not just a flaming nuisance, the tipping point may have been reached. Truly, for me and those of my mind set, the private sector is indeed the engine of prosperity. Government is a brake, a drag, the friction that prevents development and distribution, a barely needed commodity and one that should at all times be very small. When the warriors of my mind set approach a minority, you become a nation of slaves.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1345151318538</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 17:08:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345151994724-299</Id><Topic><Title>How dumb is dumb.ivan?</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1345146047731</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 15:40:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whats the matter Dumb Dumb, having trouble cashing those checks your BIG MOUTH is writing?

They cut 7800 jobs which impacted 3.8% of their operation while at the same time cutting prices. This has to squeeze margins and can't be sustainable. They have 1200 additional job cuts coming. The 3rd and 4th quarter are usually stronger for tech and we have an election coming. I think Chambers is playing the next two quarters in hopes the ecomomy gets a post election bump and that they can outlast their competitors by lower cost. The dividend created the necessary smoke. The question is, what happens when the smoke clears. If the global economy shows some life it will be a brillant play, if it doesn't, I think Cisco retreats back down into the mid teens.</Msg><Username>goobushead</Username><Timestamp>1345153589095</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 17:46:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345153700421-306</Id><Topic><Title>Mitts a liar</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345146849528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 15:54:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are truly sad.

Ryan and Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney, charge that Obama's 2010 health law would weaken the popular Medicare health plan for the elderly by reducing its costs by $716 billion over the coming 10 years. On Thursday, Ryan acknowledged that his own budget plan would keep the savings included in Obama's Affordable Care Act even as it would do away with the law itself. "When you repeal all of Obamacare what you end up doing is that repeals (those savings) as well. In our budget we've restored a lot of that," he said, referring to the savings. Ryan's statement underlines the fact that his own budget plan, which passed the House of Representatives this spring, envisions spending $205 billion less on Medicare than Obama would during that time period. Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen, an Obama ally, told reporters Ryan would not use those savings to improve health coverage. "While the Ryan plan took the savings, they did not plow any of the money back into strengthening Medicare benefits and in fact they used the money as part of their plan for additional tax cuts for the very wealthy," Van Hollen said on a conference call.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345156251329</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:30:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345156299566-330</Id><Title>Ryan wants another 200 billion from medicare next year</Title><Msg>Ryan's statement underlines the fact that his own budget plan, which passed the House of Representatives this spring, envisions spending $205 billion less on Medicare than Obama would during that time period.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345156299566</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:31:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345156348250-331</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan admits he wants to gut medicare to give tax cuts to the rich</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345156251329</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:30:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ANOTHER lie by another far left LIAR.

I’m sure waiting for Harry to put up who it was that told him what he says they told him. I don’t believe it for a minute, by the way. But every year I’ve paid at least 13 percent and if you add in addition the amount that goes to charity, why the number gets well above 20 percent." Pay close attention to that last part about the money that goes to charity. First of all, his "charity" is a cult with giant edifices that contribute only about 1% of its income to actual charity work. The rest is invested in shopping centers, amusement parks, and paying for imbeciles to ride bikes in white shirts and black ties while proselytizing in foreign countries (to get close to Mitt's money). Since he uses the "charitable contributions" to get DOWN to the 13% mark, is he now analogizing his those contributions to shadow taxes? What kind of morons are you people supporting?

On Thursday, Ryan acknowledged that his own budget plan would keep the savings included in Obama's Affordable Care Act even as it would do away with the law itself. "When you repeal all of Obamacare what you end up doing is that repeals (those savings) as well. In our budget we've restored a lot of that," he said, referring to the savings. Ryan's statement underlines the fact that his own budget plan, which passed the House of Representatives this spring, envisions spending $205 billion less on Medicare than Obama would during that time period. Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen, an Obama ally, told reporters Ryan would not use those savings to improve health coverage. "While the Ryan plan took the savings, they did not plow any of the money back into strengthening Medicare benefits and in fact they used the money as part of their plan for additional tax cuts for the very wealthy," Van Hollen said on a conference call.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345162987424</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 20:23:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345163180182-361</Id><Title>Obama's not real any more</Title><Msg>He started out as fiction and he will leave as fiction.

Besides, we all know that many of the FleeceBook pages belong to the Fluffy's and Spot's of the world. Besides I know several kids who have a "public" facebook page... you know... the one's that parents can "friend" and a "private" facebook page where parents and other family are strictly prohibited !! I bet the number of "real" pages is 1/2 what they report to the investment community.</Msg><Username>buckibrown2</Username><Timestamp>1345171219773</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 22:40:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345172029496-404</Id><Topic><Title>Sell Cisco and Buy FaceBook?
