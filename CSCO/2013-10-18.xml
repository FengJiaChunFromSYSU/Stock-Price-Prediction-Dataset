Susan Collins (R-Maine) because they viewed it as a worse than proposals from Boehner. It would have locked in next year’s even-deeper government spending levels and suspended the medical device tax, a key funding stream for Obamacare that’s unpopular with both parties. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors called Reid, Sen. #$%$ Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). The president didn’t want Democrats anywhere near that deal, and the Senate leaders, in turn, warned the rank and file to hold back and avoid committing to the deal. The president reiterated his concerns in a Saturday meeting with Democratic leaders, and they made clear that they couldn’t accept the proposal.Wow...they played that beautifully. Obama, as the face of the party, still gets to seem somewhat reasonable while people are calling Reid the real intransigent player on the Democratic side. Yet this whole time its actually the WH thats unwilling to take any deals. This actually makes sense now cause people were shocked last Saturday when Reid rejected the Collins proposal, since there were already 6-7 Dems on it and it was looking like the vehicle that would come out of the Senate. Collins herself felt Reid's rejection and the subsequent pullback from Dem Senators came out of nowhere and was unexpected. Now we know its cause the WH told them to kill it.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382096664399</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 07:44:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382096792477-14</Id><Topic><Title>Coward Boehner Surrendered</Title><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1382096634707</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 07:43:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boehner can't get a vote out under his caucus for nothing.

The people there are flocking to the ACA. We should bring to this fight the discipline of the union workers who hold firm on their strikes and suffer on principle. There can be no worse patriotic move right now than to sign up for Obamacare just to save a few hundred bucks a month. It will end up costing America much more than that. Takes a minute to truly unpack that one. Everyone who might save money using Obamacare is unpatriotic, destroying America and deserves to rot in Hell for all eternity. Almost wish this was some kind of a liberal plant but the problem is I've met people who think just like this.

On the contrary, it has been an ongoing process, dating back to the Republican takeover of the House in 2010. And the damage is large: Unemployment in America would be far lower than it is if the House majority hadn’t done so much to undermine recovery. A useful starting point for assessing the damage done is a widely cited report by the consulting firm Macroeconomic Advisers, which estimated that “crisis driven” fiscal policy — which has been the norm since 2010 — has subtracted about 1 percent off the U.S. growth rate for the past three years. This implies cumulative economic losses — the value of goods and services that America could and should have produced, but didn’t — of around $700 billion. The firm also estimated that unemployment is 1.4 percentage points higher than it would have been in the absence of political confrontation, enough to imply that the unemployment rate right now would be below 6 percent instead of above 7.</Msg><Username>junior_the32</Username><Timestamp>1382100758236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 08:52:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382101214061-26</Id><Topic><Title>Interest in healthcareDOTgov down 88%....</Title><Username>proconsul_gallio</Username><Timestamp>1382072020188</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 00:53:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Delaware reported they had ONE signup the first week!!!

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) plans to read the Affordable Care Act, he told reporters today. “It’s definitely been on my must-read list for a while now,” Sen. Cruz said of the law often referred to as Obamacare. “Things have just been so hectic around here lately, I couldn’t get to it.” The Texas Senator said that he started reading the law this morning and observed, “So far, it’s pretty dry.” “It’s not a page-turner, that’s for sure,” he said. “But it’s caused so much controversy, it must have some pretty juicy stuff in it. I’ll keep reading it and see what I find.” Sen. Cruz said that when he finishes reading the Affordable Care Act, he plans to read the United States Constitution. “People kept bringing it up the last few weeks,” he said. “So I’m kind of curious to see what all the fuss is about.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382118054323</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 13:40:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382118080635-138</Id><Topic><Title>must be a "thumbs down bot on this board ... hmmm?</Title><Username>deadpainting_is_a_coward</Username><Timestamp>1382114533080</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 12:42:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Congrats.You learned how to spell " and" on the first try .I'm switching to another Junior id,so get ready to make a new one,Magoo.lol BTW, this is it, no more responses.

Aaron Schock, R-Ill., referring to the tea partyers’ tactics. “Clearly the leadership followed certain members’ tactics, certain members’ strategies, and they proved not to be all that successful. So I would hope that we learn from the past.” And in the tea billie rabbit hole, they are patting themselves on the back for achieving nothing except to ostracize themselves from voters. LOL Tea partyers hold a contrary view. Boehner, they say, solidified his standing as the GOP’s leader by holding the line against compromise as long as he did. And the standoff, they add, has increased their movement’s clout. “I think it builds credibility, because I think Democrats did not think that we would press this,” said Rep. John Fleming, R-La. “And now they know that we will, and that we might do it again.” On a similar note William Travis is reported to have said, just before he and all his men died at the Alamo, I think we built some creditability by holding out so long.

Too much baggage with Billy boy and Monica Sex lies and Cigars, plus Obama &amp; Hillary failed to take a firm stand against the Libyan insurgents who beat and murdered our ambassador in Benghazi, and it took her nearly two weeks to acknowledge it was a terrorist attack. Bill taught her well how to cover-up and lie. But the DNA Bill left on Monica’s Dress exposed a lie on Bill.
