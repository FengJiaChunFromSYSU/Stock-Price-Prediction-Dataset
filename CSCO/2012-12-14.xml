While the increase was approved in September, neither the public nor the Democratic House minority was informed until this week, Roll Call reports.The contract now authorizes Bancroft PLLC and former Solicitor General Paul Clement (R) to spend up to $2 million in to defend DOMA — the second increase to what was originally a $1 million cap. The U.S. Department of Justice stopped defending the 1996 law in February 2011 after determining the law to be in conflict with the U.S. Constittuion.House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) denounced the increased expense in a statement: It’s bad enough that Speaker Boehner and House Republicans are wasting taxpayer dollars to defend the indefensible Defense of Marriage Act – and losing in every case. Now, they have reached a new low – signing a secret contract to spend more public money on their legal boondoggle without informing Democrats. Their actions are simply unconscionable; their decisions are utterly irresponsible.Hiding this contract from voters in the midst of an election season was a cynical move at best, and a betrayal of the public trust at worst. With Americans focused on the creation of jobs and the growth of our economy, Republicans should not be spending $2 million to defend discrimination in our country. Though Lungren lost re-election in November, the Republicans maintained control of the House — and its operating budget.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355500442758</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 10:54:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355500468050-32</Id><Topic><Title>All the liberals who think taxes help gov revs are now</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355421018253</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 12:50:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I may be stoooopid but at least I am proud of it!

Know who’s expert at camouflage? Veterans. And a whole lot of their organizations hate the “chained CPI.” Sneaky … But Simple The headline for Derek Thompson’s Atlantic piece calls the “chained CPI” “the sneaky, complicated idea that could end the fiscal cliff showdown.” There’s ongoing chatter that both parties might use it to solve their budget impasse, in large part because they think it’s too complex and wonkish for voters to grasp. But while it is sneaky, it’s not that complicated. In fact, the “chained CPI” concept can be explained in one sentence: It calculates cost-of-living increases much more slowly than before, by subtracting the cost of the things you can’t afford to buy anymore. See? I did it in 22 words and 113 characters – short enough to tweet. I’ll bet you understood it even if you hadn’t heard of it before. And not only understood it, but sensed its implications: As a financially-strapped public downgrades from fresh food to canned food … to cat food … their benefits will keep plunging along with their way of life. And yet hope springs eternal among policymakers. Last year the President even said that “most folks would hardly notice” if this cut to the government’s cost-of-living adjustment was enacted. Guess what: The nation’s veterans noticed. Standing Up A wide range of organizations representing the nation’s veterans signed a joint letter to leaders in Congress which said “we are writing to express our opposition to changing the formula used to calculate the annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) because of the harmful effects it will have on veterans and Social Security benefits.” The organizations signing on to the letter (17 in all) spanned generations, with the Vietnam Veterans of America and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. It includes former enlisted personnel as well as the Military Officers Association of America. Gold Star Wives, an organization of widows and widowers whose spouses died while on active duty, was represented. And so was the VFW, or Veterans of Foreign Wars, an organization that had traditionally been staunchly conservative. Here’s a thought for politicians who might be considering the “chained CPI”: When you’ve lost the VFW, you’ve lost America. Getting It Right Their letter’s a cogent and very well-written analysis of this proposed benefit cut, which it rightly describes as a “misguided policy.” Here’s a sample: “ The average retirement benefit of a veteran receiving Social Security was about $15,500 in 2010 … A veteran with average earnings retiring at age 65 would get nearly a $600 benefit cut at age 75, and a $1,000 cut at age 85. By age 95, when Social Security benefits are probably needed the most, that veteran would face a cut of $1,400 – a reduction of 9.2 percent. That’s absolutely correct. The chained-CPI would also raises taxes for most Americans, and in a very backhanded way: by forcing people into higher tax brackets much more quickly. Know what wouldn’t get a tax hike under the chained CPI? Income above $250,000. The veterans’ groups also quote Congressional Budget Office estimates of the chained CPI’s deficit impact: $208 billion over ten years through cuts to Social Security benefits, and through higher taxes – on everybody but the wealthy. (They’d pay a little more, but the tax hikes would strike hardest at those in the $30-$40,000 income range, and would generally affect those earning $100,000 per year of less.) The veterans note that roughly half this amount, $112 billion, “would come from Social Security cuts, which veterans rely on very heavily for both retirement and disability benefits.” “Another 11 percent of the savings,” the letter notes, “would come from VA benefits, civilian pensions, and military retirement pay.” Eldernet $208 billion also happens to be very close to my estimate of the amount our government will pay pharmaceutical companies for their bloated profit margins over the next ten years. We could probably save $150 billion of that through negotiation and competition among drug providers – but Congress has forced us to pay retail instead. Think the elderly “won’t notice”? Older Americans’ viral email chains are dazzling to behold. Once you get past all the crazy fonts in different sizes and colors – and the GIF cartoon animations of cute animals and oldsters playing golf – these emails keep them well informed about Social Security and Medicare. And they don’t need emails to tell them that their current cost-of-living adjustments can’t keep up with their expenses. (That’s why economists have proposed the “CPI-E,” a higher adjustment for the elderly and disabled who rely on items like medical care and transportation, which go up in cost more quickly than most other items.) Attention Must Be Paid Let’s get this straight: The “chained CPI” takes money out of the pockets of veterans, the disabled, the elderly and everybody with a job – except the wealthiest of the wealthy. And we could get the money from Big Pharma and other health profiteers instead. The “chained CPI” is opposed by the young and the old, the left and the right. So who’s the constituency for this thing, anyway? Silly question. The polls are clear: Our elected officials were called to Washington for a different mission. Any politician who thinks they can infuriate pretty much the entire electorate because they’ll have billionaire cash on their side just isn’t paying attention. The good news is that our nation’s veterans have a lot of experience bringing recalcitrant recruits to attention.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355500943979</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 11:02:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355501038895-37</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Declare CHECKMATE in Fiscal Cliff Negotiations</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1355485947407</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 06:52:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am only skilled in classic debate.

Related: Higher Taxes Will Create Jobs and Cut the Deficit: David Cay Johnston Bartlett, a former advisor to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and Congressman Ron Paul, explains why the GOP tax pledge has harmful consequences for the economy. Government spending will rise over the coming decades as more baby boomers retire. But if tax revenues don't keep pace with spending, the federal government will be forced to increase borrowing, which will increase interest payments on the debt. According to Bartlett, a GAO report projects that the Republican plan to keep revenues at just under 18% of GDP will cause interest on the debt to surge from 19.2% of the deficit this year to 62% in 2020. Related: Fiscal Cliff Deal Likely but U.S at Risk of "Looking Ridiculous," Rivlin Says Bartlett is not advocating big spending increases --- he'd rather trim spending-- but he says revenues must keep up with spending. Going over the fiscal cliff is a move in that direction because revenues would rise as the Bush-era tax cuts expire for everyone, not just the top 2%, at the same that spending is reduced. "Revenues are too low rather than spending too high," he tells The Daily Ticker's Aaron Task. Bartlett doesn't know if and when Republicans and Democrats will agree to fiscal cliff deal, but he predicts that any deal will not happen "before the absolute last possible minute."

"The regional brigade commander was ordered to open an investigation," Israeli Defense Forces spokeswoman Avital Leibovich said in an email. No further information will be provided until the investigation is complete. Yousri Al Jamal and Ma'amoun Wazwaz said a foot patrol stopped them as they were driving to a nearby checkpoint where a Palestinian teenager had just been shot dead by an Israeli border guard. Their car was clearly marked 'TV' and they were both wearing blue flak jackets with 'Press' emblazoned on the front. The soldiers forced them to leave the vehicle and punched them, striking them with the butts of their guns. They accused them of working for an Israeli NGO, B'Tselem, which documents human rights violations in the occupied West Bank, the Reuters cameramen said.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355502736979</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 11:32:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355502945708-48</Id><Topic><Title>(APPY) MCAP $19 M // FDA APPROVAL THIS MONTH //FLOAT 6 M = RALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</Title><Username>blockbuster.hunter</Username><Timestamp>1355502426304</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 11:27:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What are they getting approved?

The actual ruling of ROE v. Wade cites the legal fact that a fetus cannot survive on it's own, and is not considered a citizen until it is actually born, and therefore has no civil rights.

People choke to death on food every day – those people need to be shot. Smoking cigarettes kills hundreds of thousands of people every year – we could be shooting them, instead. People get terminal cancer all the time – are you saying they shouldn’t own guns? If everyone who owns a gun would just shoot ONE non-gun-owning person, soon everyone would own a gun and there would be no problem because they could also shoot pregnant women who want to have abortions and single women who want contraceptives. There isn’t one single problem in America that can’t be solved by shooting someone. (Although SOME people would need to be shot more than once.)</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355512673740</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 14:17:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355512679284-102</Id><Topic><Title>Guess all the Libs saying Repubs are racist re: Susan Rice...</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1355507921917</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 12:58:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how come jr says the president is black, what about the 50% white in him that stuck around and raised the bast child to who he is today. black dad was gone ASAP...that never happens , I dont understand was dad a racist or just a black thing?</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355512679284</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 14:17:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355512837550-103</Id><Topic><Title>CT SHOOTINGS TODAY MAKE THE CASE FOR CONCEAL AND CARRY</Title><Username>deeperharbor</Username><Timestamp>1355508697064</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 13:11:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Arming every adult with a trigger finger in schools will result in WAY more deaths than the 27 today.

Gun Show Loophole Currently, in over 30 states, one can walk into a local gun show and purchase a weapon from a “private seller,” who does not have to conduct any kind of background check. For example, a .50 caliber sniper rifle, which can take down a helicopter. The NRA has fought to block any and all efforts to pass a federal law closing this infamous gun show loophole, as well as any efforts in the states. (But remember, they are anti-crime!) Timothy McVeigh was once one of these “private sellers” on the gun-show circuit, and everyone from the Columbine killers to members of Hezbollah have obtained firearms this way. Not surprisingly, just like most other sentient beings (including 85% of gun owners not in the NRA), 69% of NRA members , when polled by conservative Republican Frank Luntz, think this loophole should be closed.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355518299758</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 15:51:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355518337994-159</Id><Topic><Title>GOP vows to protect gun rights</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355517919350</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 15:45:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dont forget your other invectives DumbivanJunior.

Terror Gap If you are put on the U.S. terror watch list you cannot board an airplane. You can, however, still purchase guns and explosives. According to the Government Accountability Office , “From February 2004 through February 2010, 1,228 individuals on the watch list underwent background checks to purchase firearms or explosives; 1,119, or 91 percent, of these transactions were approved." NRA members understand this even if their leadership stubbornly tries to protect the gun-ownership rights of terrorists (but they’re patriots, I tell you!). Eighty-two percent of NRA members think this gap should be closed.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355518360015</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 15:52:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355518449583-162</Id><Topic><Title>so much hate in america now</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355513551048</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 14:32:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you think it's bad now, PLEASE don't open a US History book.

The NRA is the most dangerous, revolutionary organization in the USA, with fascist, libertarian and KKK roots. To many guns are symbols of power, including sexual and religious symbols. The recent 2nd amendment ruling by the Supreme Court (5 to 4) is wrong. I suspect that Obama is too weak to address this issue head on, and the House is in the pocket of the NRA.

Therefore, Congress must act on what is stated law, and face the reality that access to firearms reaches beyond what the Second Amendment intends to achieve.

In March 1982, 25 years ago, the small town of Kennesaw – responding to a handgun ban in Morton Grove, Ill. – unanimously passed an ordinance requiring each head of household to own and maintain a gun. Since then, despite dire predictions of “Wild West” showdowns and increased violence and accidents, not a single resident has been involved in a fatal shooting – as a victim, attacker or defender. The crime rate initially plummeted for several years after the passage of the ordinance, with the 2005 per capita crime rate actually significantly lower than it was in 1981, the year before passage of the law. Prior to enactment of the law, Kennesaw had a population of just 5,242 but a crime rate significantly higher (4,332 per 100,000) than the national average (3,899 per 100,000). The latest statistics available – for the year 2005 – show the rate at 2,027 per 100,000. Meanwhile, the population has skyrocketed to 28,189. By comparison, the population of Morton Grove, the first city in Illinois to adopt a gun ban for anyone other than police officers, has actually dropped slightly and stands at 22,202, according to 2005 statistics. More significantly, perhaps, the city’s crime rate increased by 15.7 percent immediately after the gun ban, even though the overall crime rate in Cook County rose only 3 percent. Today, by comparison, the township’s crime rate stands at 2,268 per 100,000. This was not what some predicted. In a column titled “Gun Town USA,” Art Buchwald suggested Kennesaw would soon become a place where routine disagreements between neighbors would be settled in shootouts. The Washington Post mocked Kennesaw as “the brave little city … soon to be pistol-packing capital of the world.” Phil Donahue invited the mayor on his show. Reuters, the European news service, today revisited the Kennesaw controversy following the Virginia Tech Massacre. Police Lt. Craig Graydon said: “When the Kennesaw law was passed in 1982 there was a substantial drop in crime … and we have maintained a really low crime rate since then. We are sure it is one of the lowest (crime) towns in the metro area.” Kennesaw is just north of Atlanta. The Reuters story went on to report: “Since the Virginia Tech shootings, some conservative U.S. talk show hosts have rejected attempts to link the massacre to the availability of guns, arguing that had students been allowed to carry weapons on campus someone might have been able to shoot the killer.” Virginia Tech, like many of the nation’s schools and college campuses, is a so-called “gun-free zone,” which Second Amendment supporters say invites gun violence – especially from disturbed individuals seeking to kill as many victims as possible. Cho Seung-Hui murdered 32 and wounded another 15 before turning his gun on himself.</Msg><Username>bullbear308</Username><Timestamp>1355529819590</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 19:03:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355529923308-270</Id><Title>NRA CELEBRATES SHOOTING, AS INBREEDS FLOCK TO GUN STORES</Title><Msg>to buy more guns.

JAPAN IS A POLICE STATE! Japanese police arrest whoever they like and whenever they like for whatever reason they want. Japanese Police: * Can punish any citizen with 20-23 days incarceration - no questions asked. * Search people and private property at will without warrants. They do it all the time even if there is a law against it. * Routinely break other laws at will with little or no recourse to the victims. * Extort money from accused people as a condition for their release form 20-23 days incarceration (playing the role of judge and jury). * Have extensive relations and dealings with the Japanese mafia. * Covering up brutality, beatings, shootings and generally any other problems is the norm in Japan and not the exception. * Rely so extensively on forced confessions during the 20-23 days of incarceration that that their actual police skills are poor. * Have a bad habit of ignoring the majority of basic complaints people bring to them, which in turn has resulted in a large number victims whose attackers keep coming after them. "If there's no blood on the floor or no broken bones then we don't want to mess with it" is the de facto motto of Japanese police. It makes for good business for the mafia since they they end up getting a lot of business the Japanese police will not take care of. * Hurt someone in a traffic "accident"? You're going to jail and the "police" (not a judge) will let you out after you have paid off the victim as much money as the victim is requesting. Don't pay, then you go to trial where the judge will do the same thing and put you in jail. The "result" (victim injured) is the only thing that matters in Japan. Little kid (or big adult) darts in front of your car on a busy road with no way to stop... you're going to jail. That's Japanese justice. * The police together with the prosecutor, enjoy a 98% conviction rate for anyone sent to trial. 20-23 days at will incarcerations + 98% + conviction rate = a pathetic justice system.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1355531927210</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 19:38:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355532456776-279</Id><Title>MAP OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS AROUND THE WORLD...</Title><Msg>Google "school shootings around the world map" If you are an inbreed skip, as you will not understand the pattern.
