They're the building trade unions, the operating engineers, the construction workers, the cops, the firefighters. We needlessly antagonize them. So on just two issues, national defense and reaching out to what I believe are really hardcore workers WHO SHOULD BE part of the Republican majority." Referring to Christian Nationalists Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), King told ABC News in reference to Hilary Clinton, “I think she’s very strong on foreign policy, and I think that if we nominate someone from our isolationist wing of the party, she’ll destroy them.” “I’m not a big fan of Ted Cruz,” King said. “He’s too much of an isolationist,” and “has too negative a view.” He also hasn’t forgiven Cruz for voting against relief for Hurricane Sandy victims after raking in big money for Florida disasters. “Ever since the days of Eisenhower, Republicans have been the party of strong national defense. Right now, the main potential candidates — such as Rand Paul and Ted Cruz — are isolationists who barely mention the threat of Islamic terrorism. I don’t want isolationism to be emblematic of the national Republican Party.” King’s words are not a big surprise. Everyone – except Democrats, that is – is jockeying for position right now to see who is going to win the primary lottery so they get to be the guy to lose to Hilary Clinton. We’ve already seen Ted Cruz kissing up to religious zealots and racists in Iowa. Let’s face it, no Republican woman is going to challenge for the presidency. Even before she sank into this legal morass, Michele Crazy Bachmann showed about how far a woman can go in the GOP (Palin, tagging along on John McCain’s coattails and dragging him down, doesn’t count).</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1374500740691</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:45:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374500782637-43</Id><Topic><Title>zimmerman was high on prescription pills!!</Title><Username>williarndavis960</Username><Timestamp>1374498952688</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:15:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just kidding, I know the information is already out there.</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1374500782637</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:46:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374500810420-44</Id><Topic><Title>zimmerman was high on prescription pills!!</Title><Username>williarndavis960</Username><Timestamp>1374498952688</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:15:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh I remember - they didnt charge zimmy for weeks - that way he has no blood tests etc isnt zimmy's dad a judge? pretty smart!!!</Msg><Username>doremiifa85</Username><Timestamp>1374500810420</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:46:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374500982662-45</Id><Title>Welcome to Portage County, the Fracking Waste Disposal Capital of Ohio!!</Title><Msg>Welcome to Portage County, the Fracking Waste Disposal Capital of Ohio!! A small part of Ohio has secured the ignominious honor of becoming the most successful foul frackwater dumping ground in the state. As fracking—pumping a briny solution of water, lubricants, anti-bacterial agents, and a cocktail of other chemicals into underground shale formations at high pressure to fracture the rock and extract trapped natural gas—has expanded in the Midwest, so has the need for disposing of used fracking fluid. That fracking waste can be recycled or processed at wastewater treatment facilities, much like sewage. But most of the waste—630 billion gallons, each year—goes back into the ground, pumped into disposal wells, which are then capped and sealed. A bunch of it ends up underneath Portage County. This 500-square-mile county pumped 2,358,371 million barrels—almost 75 million gallons—of fracking brine into 15 wells last year, driving enough liquid into the ground to fill a train of tanker cars that would stretch 37 miles. Most of the waste came from out of state. Almost 58 percent of the waste injected into Ohio wells is trucked in—much of it from Pennsylvania and West Virginia. More than 200 disposal wells dot the state, which has looser regulations than its neighbors. The Columbus Dispatch recently reported that Ohio injected just over 14 million barrels of fracking waste into disposal wells in 2012, and more than 8 million came from other states—an uptick of 19 percent from 2011. And despite Republican Gov. John Kasich saying he's not thrilled about the amount of waste crossing state lines, federal commerce protections prevent the state from barring legal substances from being shipped in. Because Ohio regulates its own disposal wells, the waiting period to get approval to drill a new well is about five weeks, compared to upwards of eight months in Pennsylvania, where the feds are in charge.</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1374500982662</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:49:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374501004023-46</Id><Topic><Title>zimmerman was high on prescription pills!!</Title><Username>williarndavis960</Username><Timestamp>1374498952688</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:15:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You still think your id game is cute, moron???</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1374501004023</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:50:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374501175771-47</Id><Topic><Title>zimmerman was high on prescription pills!!</Title><Username>williarndavis960</Username><Timestamp>1374498952688</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:15:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I and all other white racists from Florida defend George Zimmerman to the max !</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1374501175771</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:52:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374501235541-48</Id><Title>If zimmerman was black and Trayvon had been white</Title><Msg>If zimmerman was black and Trayvon had been white zimmerman would be serving a life sentence for murder one, black woman gets 20 years for firing a warning shot.</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1374501235541</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:53:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374501456405-49</Id><Topic><Title>zimmerman was high on prescription pills!!</Title><Username>williarndavis960</Username><Timestamp>1374498952688</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:15:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>both of our ids are separate and distinct though.</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1374501456405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:57:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374501529488-50</Id><Topic><Title>If zimmerman was black and Trayvon had been white</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1374501235541</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 09:53:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Totally unfair what happened to that woman,but thats what mandatory sentencing does.Get the politicians to change the laws so judges have some leeway,moron.

At an outrageous cost of $1.5 trillion, it is the most expensive weapon program the world has ever seen. Even worse, it doesn't work as intended and funnels money away from other priorities needed to fight 21st century threats and strengthen America. Yet Lockheed Martin and an army of lobbyists are determined to protect their cash cow and record profits by pressuring Congress to keep the F-35 alive. The F-35 is a bad deal for America and it's time to stop it. While politicians across the country call for massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, American taxpayers are being asked to continue spending billions of dollars a year on one of the most wasteful programs in the history of the military. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the most expensive weapon system in history. To purchase, operate, and maintain the jets is estimated to cost $1.5 trillion over the life of the program. This would be bad enough if the F-35 actually worked, but its development has been plagued by design flaws, technical failures, and a host of other problems that mean even under the best circumstances, the F-35 is years away from meeting minimal operational standards. With an army of lobbyists at its disposal, Lockheed Martin - maker of the F-35 - is fighting hard to make sure nothing changes. That's why we need to speak out and tell Congress that with millions of Americans still out of work, the middle class being crushed, and an economy in dire need of recovery, this is insanity. Our members of Congress know that the state of the social safety net will be a critical issue in upcoming elections. If enough of us speak up to our elected officials and let them know that we want them to end the F-35 program instead of gutting Social Security and Medicare, they'll know that letting this insane weapons program continue will prove politically costly.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1374502873611</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 10:21:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374503990771-59</Id><Title>America will thrive under Obama...</Title><Msg>Despite Obama...</Msg><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1374503990771</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 10:39:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374504232906-60</Id><Topic><Title>America will thrive under Obama...</Title><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1374503990771</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 10:39:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like they did with Bush?</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1374504232906</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 10:43:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374504286497-61</Id><Title>Best idea from the Hill this year.</Title><Msg>Congressman Proposes No More Cap on Social Security Tax for the Wealthy Posted: 22 Jul 2013 07:00 AM PDT U.S. Rep. Rush Holt has launched the third in his series of whiteboard videos making the case for bold progressive ideas. In the new video, “Social Security,” Holt argues that millionaires and billionaires should pay the same percent of their income to Social Security as middle-class workers. “Ordinary people contribute about 6 percent of their paycheck to Social Security,” Holt explains in the video, “but someone earning a million dollars pays less than 1 percent. That's because Congress has given millionaires and billionaires a free pass: an absolute cap on their social security taxes." Holt proposes asking the wealthy to pay the same tax rate into Social Security as the middle class. “That would save Social Security, ” Holt says, “no need to raise the retirement age or cut benefits. This isn't rocket science; it isn't even fifth grade math." You can view Rep. Holt's other videos in the whiteboard series, at the links for “Wall Street” and “Student Loans." BTW, Rep. Holt is also running for the U.S. Senate in NJ, competing with Newark Mayor Cory Booker, the favorite.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1374504286497</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 10:44:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374504950966-62</Id><Topic><Title>America will thrive under Obama...</Title><Username>libs_r_a_plague</Username><Timestamp>1374503990771</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 10:39:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior, why does my id say I've been a member since July, 2009 but your fake doremi says April 2013 ???

The proposed law, which faces major opposition in the Florida legislature, would make it illegal for people in the state to shoot each other for no reason whatsoever. “Under the provisions of Don’t Shoot Me for Absolutely No Reason, you will be required to have an actual reason for shooting someone,” said a spokesman for the measure, Harland Dorrinson. “This will be a first in Florida.” The controversial bill has already drawn the ire of the National Rifle Association, which issued a statement today saying that requiring someone to have a reason to shoot another person would violate the Second Amendment. “If you force someone to have a reason to shoot someone, soon you will be taking away his right to shoot that person altogether,” the N.R.A. said. “We are not in principle against the idea of having a reason to shoot someone,” the N.R.A. continued. “But we believe you should be allowed to shoot the person first and have the reason second.” Even if Don’t Shoot Me for Absolutely No Reason somehow passes in the legislature, Florida Gov. Rick Scott said today that he would veto it, telling reporters, “Making people in Florida have a reason to shoot each other would fundamentally change our way of life.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1374506841276</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 11:27:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374507748138-65</Id><Title>Chicago Hearing for Shooting Death of 6-Month-Old Girl Today; Left Silent</Title><Msg>Willis maintains that the baby was not his intended target, and will be ineligible for the death penalty in Illinois, where it has been outlawed.
