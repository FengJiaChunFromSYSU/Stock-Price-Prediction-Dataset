This is like a wet dream to underwiters. Young, fit folk who won’t make many claims or none at all will be helping support losses from older, frailer insureds – and can’t even default on their premiums when their pocket is tight. That’s a recipe for definite and sutainable underwriting profit – and subsequently huge investment profit from the return on those premiums while they’re invested in all kinds of other stuff pending any claims payouts. Investment profit is where insurance companies usually make the bulk of their bottom line. So, says ABC, health insurers are worried that Republicans can’t agree on exactly how to repeal Obamacare – all at once, keep some bits, which bits? – nevermind agree on exactly what can replace it. The Romney campaign’s lack of specifics in particular, on this as on so many other issues, has left insurance bigwigs asking the Romney campaign “where are we going to make even bigger profits, that we should back you and repeal?” Robert Laszewski, an industry consultant and blogger, says the tension is becoming unbearable. “I spend a lot of time in executive offices and board rooms, and they are good Republicans who would like to see Romney win,” said Laszewski. “But they are scared to death about what he’s going to do.” The industry has three items in particular it wants stripped out: cuts to Medicare Advantage private insurance plans; a requirement that insurers spend 80 percent of premiums on medical care or rebate the difference to their customers; and new taxes on insurance companies. But CEOs don’t share the visceral objection that many Republicans have to a bigger government role in health care. Industry executives “are Republicans in the sense that they’re worried about the bottom line and they want to retain private sector involvement,” said Hoagland, the former Cigna vice president. “But some of their bottom line is now driven by Medicare and Medicaid. So it’s not like they’re red or blue. It’s more like purple.” In my humble opinion, the real biggie there is the 80% requirement – cutting that would create a federally-subsidized, no holds barred, cash cow that can be milked ad infinitum for investment profits to keep shareholders smiling as well as for executive compensations, golden parachutes and bonuses on a scale usually reserved for the stratospheric level of Wall Street financiers and oil bosses. Still, all around the show, the health insurance industry wants to have its Obamacare cake and eat it too.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351600261933</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 08:31:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351600352958-17</Id><Topic><Title>Obama KILLS 4 Americans</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1351561559896</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 21:45:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry DOUCHEBAG, I'm not dodging anything.

"I was on the phone for the third time yesterday, last night, with the president of the United States. He called me at midnight last night as he was seeing reports," he said before adding that President Obama accelerated the designation of New Jersey as a major disaster area "without the usual red tape." "The cooperation has been great with FEMA here on the ground and the cooperation from the president of the United States has been outstanding. He deserves great credit," Christie added. or you can have the GOP response A Failure in Evacuation The death toll from Katrina, which was just under 2,000, was ultimately caused by a failure to evacuate the entire population in the hurricane’s path in a timely manner. Although evacuations went relatively smoothly, a delay in a mandatory evacuation meant that many stayed in the path of Katrina until 19 hours before landfall. A lack of understanding about what the conditions would be like after Katrina caused the government to be slow in evacuating and rescuing individuals after the storm had passed. Lack of Federal Preparation The federal government delayed recognizing the significance of Katrina, and thus, considerably slowed the effectiveness of the National Response Plan, which was designed to be utilized in domestic disasters. President Bush did not receive adequate advice from his disaster counsel, and various federal agencies did not fully understand how to execute their role under the national plan. FEMA Provided an Uncoordinated and Untargeted Response FEMA was simply unprepared for a disaster on the scale of Katrina and was overwhelmed by the logistics of the situation. The supply chain of personnel and aid was not clear, and thus, resources weren’t dispersed in the most useful manner. Even before Katrina, FEMA had a record of lacking trained personnel to procure necessary services and supplies.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351603629676</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 09:27:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351603718987-27</Id><Title>Is Brownie still in charge of FEMA?</Title><Msg>who is Obama's political appointee to head FEMA if Brownie is gone?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351603718987</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 09:28:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351604376754-28</Id><Topic><Title>a tale of two presidents</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351603629676</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 09:27:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In another 4 days we can expect Obama to fly back from his vacation and fly over NYC at 10,000 feet to check out the damage.

Scientists have long taken a similarly cautious stance, but more are starting to drop the caveat and link climate change directly to intense storms and other extreme weather events, such as the warm 2012 winter in the eastern U.S. and the frigid one in Europe at the same time. They are emboldened because researchers have gotten very good in the past decade at determining what affects the variables that create big storms. Hurricane Sandy got large because it wandered north along the U.S. coast, where ocean water is still warm this time of year, pumping energy into the swirling system. But it got even larger when a cold Jet Stream made a sharp dip southward from Canada down into the eastern U.S. The cold air, positioned against warm Atlantic air, added energy to the atmosphere and therefore to Sandy, just as it moved into that region, expanding the storm even further. Here’s where climate change comes in. The atmospheric pattern that sent the Jet Stream south is colloquially known as a “blocking high”—a big pressure center stuck over the very northern Atlantic Ocean and southern Arctic Ocean. And what led to that? A climate phenomenon called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)—essentially, the state of atmospheric pressure in that region. This state can be positive or negative, and it had changed from positive to negative two weeks before Sandy arrived. The climate kicker? Recent research by Charles Greene at Cornell University and other climate scientists has shown that as more Arctic sea ice melts in the summer—because of global warming—the NAO is more likely to be negative during the autumn and winter. A negative NAO makes the Jet Stream more likely to move in a big, wavy pattern across the U.S., Canada and the Atlantic, causing the kind of big southward dip that occurred during Sandy. Climate change amps up other basic factors that contribute to big storms. For example, the oceans have warmed, providing more energy for storms. And the Earth’s atmosphere has warmed, so it retains more moisture, which is drawn into storms and is then dumped on us. These changes contribute to all sorts of extreme weather. In a recent op-ed in the Washington Post, James Hansen at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York blamed climate change for excessive drought, based on six decades of measurements, not computer models: “Our analysis shows that it is no longer enough to say that global warming will increase the likelihood of extreme weather and to repeat the caveat that no individual weather event can be directly linked to climate change. To the contrary, our analysis shows that, for the extreme hot weather of the recent past, there is virtually no explanation other than climate change.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351611655485</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 11:40:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351611928510-57</Id><Title>LATEST RASMUSSEN POLLS PROJECT ROMNEY TO WIN 279+ ELECTORAL VOTES</Title><Msg>According to the latest Rasmussen state polls, Mitt Romney is trending to win the presidency; he should win at least 279 electoral votes.

I suppose the Republicans are only interested in 9/11 heroes when they're used as political props.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351613767555</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 12:16:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351613837116-73</Id><Title>The GOP supports the military</Title><Msg>veterans they don't support so they filibustered these .R. 1168 -- Veterans Retraining Act H.R. 1171 - Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program Reauthorization H.R. 1293 -- Disabled Veterans Home Improvement and Structural Alteration Grant Increase Act</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351613837116</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 12:17:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351614006036-74</Id><Topic><Title>Bammy feeling the pressure..</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1351596602501</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 07:30:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>now as he contemplates how he blamed Bush for everything that went wrong with hurricane Katrina. *** Not much he can do in D.C. but yell and cuss at people on the phone.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351614006036</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 12:20:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351614304154-75</Id><Topic><Title>Is Hurricane Sandy Barack Obama's Fault?</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1351595155802</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 07:05:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You care to brag about Obama's response to Benghazi, dumdum.</Msg><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1351614304154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 12:25:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351614310312-76</Id><Topic><Title>This is some GREAT REPORT on GE</Title><Username>shawandahegg553296</Username><Timestamp>1351604346224</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 09:39:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hope this is good.

Even though the economy has officially been recovering for more than three years, most Americans still do not feel the recovery. Unemployment remains high. The poverty level is higher than it was when President Obama took office. Despite an increase in the U.S. population, fewer Americans are working today than when President Obama was inaugurated. In August, twice as many Americans went on food stamps as found jobs according to Forbes. Much of the blame for the lagging recovery belongs to President Obama. In spite of his 2008 campaign promises, President Obama has passed a bundle of tax increases for the middle class as well as the wealthy. The most infamous of these is the individual mandate in Obamacare, which was ruled by the Supreme Court to be a tax. Obamacare actually contains a bevy of new taxes in addition to the individual mandate -- 20 more taxes totaling more than $675 billion. In addition to taxes, President Obama has also dramatically increased the number of expensive regulations with which businesses must comply. The American Action Forum estimates that Obama’s regulations, including Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law, cost the economy more than $488 billion. The paperwork required to comply with these regulations is equal to what it would take to build 220 Empire State Buildings. These factors combine with the federal debt that has increased by more than 40 percent to $16 Trillion under President Obama and the looming fiscal cliff, which is comprised of even more tax increases coming at the end of this year, to create uncertainty for businesses. This uncertainty and the cost of the tax increases that Obama has promised if he is reelected make businesses reluctant to hire or expand.

The Des Moines Register, Iowa’s largest and most influential paper. They endorsed Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996, Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004, and Barack Obama in 2008. But this year, they endorsed Romney. Why? In the end, they said, it came down to a simple test. “Which candidate could forge the compromises in Congress to achieve these goals? When the question is framed in those terms, Mitt Romney emerges the stronger candidate.” The paper goes on to note that “early in his administration, President Obama reached out to Republicans but was rebuffed.” The problem, they say, is that “since then, he has abandoned the effort, and the partisan divide has hardened.” I’m not sure that’s an accurate read of the situation — Obama spent most of 2011 negotiating with John Boehner — but that’s neither here nor there. The point is that’s how the Register sees it, and it stands in contrast with Romney, who “succeeded as governor in Massachusetts where he faced Democratic majorities in the legislature.” The Orlando Sentinel also endorsed Obama in 2008 and Romney in 2012, and their reasoning is similar to the Register’s. “The next president is likely to be dealing with a Congress where at least one, if not both, chambers are controlled by Republicans,” they write. “It verges on magical thinking to expect Obama to get different results in the next four years.”</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351619187476</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 13:46:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351619926583-118</Id><Title>Romney's relentless surge in polls drowning Barack Obama</Title><Msg>Romney pouring it on now urging voters in Ohio to vote early.

The Supreme Court on Monday heard oral arguments in Clapper v. Amnesty International, a case which will determine whether or not the government’s warrantless surveillance of American citizens can be challenged in court, even when the specifics of the program are secret. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was enacted by Congress in the 1960s and 70s and regulates the government’s conduct of intelligence surveillance inside the United States. In 2001 – following the 9/11 attacks – President Bush illegally authorized the National Security Agency to launch a warrantless wiretapping program, in breach of FISA “and in 2008 Congress ratified and expanded that program, giving the NSA almost unchecked power to monitor Americans’ international phone calls and emails,” the ACLU explains. Court challenges to the government’s new surveillance laws have come forth since 2001, but the government has typically stopped the judicial process in its tracks, arguing that the case cannot proceed because aspects of the program must remain secret for national security reasons and that plaintiff’s don’t have “standing” to challenge the law unless they know for sure they have been surveilled. Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director, participated in the oral arguments on Monday and firmly told the Supreme Court justices that the new FISA surveillance laws are unconstitutional. But “the constitutionality of the global spying is not directly at issue,” writes Lyle Denniston at the SCOTUS blog. ”[T]he sole issue is whether anyone has a legal right to file a lawsuit against it.” “As part of its concerted campaign to prosecute whistleblowers and to classify state secrets,” writes Jeff Rosen at The New Republic, “the Obama administration has taken a position in Clapper that makes the Bush administration pro-secrecy campaign seem pale in comparison: namely, that no one can challenge warrantless surveillance unless the government tells you in advance that you’re being surveilled—which national security interests prevent it from doing.” The New York Times called the Obama administration’s position in the case “a particularly cynical Catch-22: Because the wiretaps are secret and no one can say for certain that their calls have been or will be monitored, no one has standing to bring suit over the surveillance.” The Obama administration has fought tooth and nail to keep the details of its surveillance activities hidden from the public. For years it has insisted that its snooping on Americans’ phone and email communications fell perfectly within the law. But last month, the ACLU, “after months of litigation,” was provided with some internal documents that showed a dramatic increase in surveillance of Americans.

The president has great political skills and a dazzling smile. He and his wife are glamorous figures. He’s a black man, and that matters greatly. History was draped over Obama like a cape. His bona fides in that sense were as unimpeachable as Bobby Kennedy’s. The crowd adored Obama, although not as much as I think he adored himself. Liberals were intolerant of anyone who had doubts. Obama was not a man, but a totem. A single critical column from me during the campaign triggered a fusillade of invective. The famous and esteemed told me off. I was the tool of right-wing haters, a dope of a dupe. But somewhere between the campaign and the White House itself, Obama got lost. It turned out he had no cause at all. Expanding health insurance was Hillary Clinton’s longtime goal. Obama never espoused a cause bigger than his own political survival. This is the gravamen of the indictment from the left, particularly certain African Americans. They are right. Young black men fill the jails and the morgues, yet Obama says nothing. Bobby Kennedy showed his anger, his impatience, his stunned incredulity at the state of black America. Obama shows nothing.

They know that if this election is a referendum on whether we are today better off, the president will lose. So for months, they tried to create the illusion that all was well. To support this fantasy, the campaign relies on two critical distortions and lies: the claim that Obama “created” 4.5 million jobs and the claim that he “saved” the auto industry. Aren't you sick of being lied to by Obama? Although it’s true that we have created some new jobs, the 4.5 million figure fails to account for the millions of jobs lost during Obama’s presidency or for the significant increase in the working-age population since January 2009. Bottom line: There are fewer people working now than when Obama took office. As for the auto industry, Obama didn’t “save” it. He merely paid off Big Labor in the form of taxpayer-funded guarantees that union contracts would not be renegotiated. Even with this bailout, Chrysler ultimately collapsed and was bought by the Italian automaker FIAT. GM now lags behind its competitors; the company’s stock continues to fall and many analysts predict General Motors will soon return to bankruptcy. Bottom line: The notion that the American car industry only exists today because of government money is downright absurd. In rewriting the question “Are Americans better off today than they were four years ago,” Obama concedes that they are not.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351623478735</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 14:57:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351623564895-132</Id><Topic><Title>economy is worse than it seems</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351623369434</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 14:56:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are just waiting until after the election to let you know that and the Eurozone is going to collapse in November as well.

Paul Ryan's decision to immediately cancel campaign events scheduled for today in Colorado. “I was kind of surprised,” Brown said yesterday afternoon. “I don’t know if it was necessary.” Brown further attacked the president for being overly vigilant in suspending his campaign activities for the storm, after he carried on campaigning in the wake of the attacks on the U.S. embassy in Libya on Sep. 11. The ex-disaster relief chief said it would be inappropriate for Mitt Romney to make hay out of this on the campaign trail, but added, “I think at some point somebody is going to raise that issue: why now and why not then?” Obama’s efforts have thus far been effusively praised by New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, one of Mitt Romney’s key campaign surrogates. But Brown initially cast doubt over the operational benefit of having the president physically stationed at the White House as the storm approached.</Msg><Username>fluteman_qreg</Username><Timestamp>1351624742210</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 15:19:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351624744175-139</Id><Title>Clemson president scolds students, fans for booing Obama</Title><Msg>Iowa City, Iowa (CNN) - Her husband may be taking a hiatus from the campaign trail, but first lady Michelle Obama isn't.

The main issue is cell phones and the changing America that most are under-representing. Our likely voter sample includes 30 percent reached on cell-phones from a cell-phone sample conducted in parallel with our random-digit phone sample. Some other surveys have moved to that level and methodology, but most have not. They are missing the new America, and we’re not sure we are keeping up either.[1] In the real America, most Americans are now cell-phone only or cell-phone mostly users. With no one really sure what is the right proportion for the likely electorate, everyone has been cautious but that may be the riskier option. Pay attention to this. In the last half of 2011, 32 percent of adults were cell-phone only according the Center for Disease Control that is the official source on these issues; 16 percent were cell phone mostly. But the proportion cell-phone only has jumped about 2.5 points every six months since 2008 – and is probably near 37 percent now. And pay attention to these numbers for the 2011 adult population: · More than 40 percent of Hispanic adults are cell phone only (43 percent). · A disproportionate 37 percent of African Americans are cell only. · Not surprisingly, almost half of those 18 to 24 years are cell only (49 percent), but an astonishing 60 percent of those 25 to 29 years old only use cell phones. · But it does not stop there: of those 30 to 34 years, 51 percent are cell only.[2] You have to ask, what America are the current polls sampling if they are overwhelmingly dependent on conventional samples or automated calling with no cell phones? Democracy Corps reached 30 percent by cell; 35 percent were cell only or cell mostly, but only 15 percent are cell only, well short of where we should be. Does it matter? We combined the nearly 4,000 interviews from our most recent polls to look at the political consequences of these different samples – and to see how this race has evolved through the lens of cell phones and landlines. Boy does it matter. We will mostly let the graphs speak for themselves. The cell-phone only and mostly users give Obama about a 10-point lead over Romney, while the big blocs of dual users largely break even. Those reached by cell phone supported Obama by 11 points but those reached on landlines only Obama a 1-point advantage. If you look at the election through cell phones, you see Obama gain an 11-point lead in the convention and post-convention period, but if you look at landline respondents, the race has been close and pretty stable. Voters reached on cell phones are not only more likely to vote for Obama, they are attitudinally and culturally distinct. They are less conservative but not perhaps more libertarian – giving both the NRA and gay marriage very favorable ratings. Of course, we know those reached on cell phones are much younger and speaking to them on cell phones is obviously a precondition for getting their vote preference right. But cell phones are also critical to representing the new diversity of the American electorate. Those reached on cell are 29 percent minority – close to the minority percentage in the 2008 electorate; those reached on landlines are only 21 percent minority – looking much closer to the demographics of some other national surveys. Democracy Corps’ last national survey before the final debate was conducted over four days with weekend daytime calling – the kind of calling period you need when trying to have a full cell-sample. It showed Obama with a 3-point lead nationally and 2 points among the smaller most-likely electorate. We will soon see where the race stands. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Democracy Corps national surveys include two samples-- one generated via Random Digit Dialing, and another separate sample for cell phones. We used an RDD sample frame of cell phones and apportioned the cell frame via census regions according to the latest CDC National Health Survey Interview (NHIS) Wireless substitution to increase CPO interview likelihood and CPO representation. We used a dual-frame, full overlap methodology allowing any cell user type to screen into the survey regardless of which frame respondent was contacted in.30 percent (300) respondents in each Democracy Corps survey are reached on cell phones.

For those new to this, Nate is a sports statistician turned political statistician, who has been maintaining a model that takes lots and lots of polling data — most of it at the state level, which is where the presidency gets decided — and converts it into election odds. Like others doing similar exercises — Drew Linzer, Sam Wang, and Pollster — Nate’s model continued to show an Obama edge even after Denver, and has shown that edge widening over the past couple of weeks. This could be wrong, obviously. And we’ll find out on Election Day. But the methodology has been very clear, and all the election modelers have been faithful to their models, letting the numbers fall where they may. Yet the right — and we’re not talking about the fringe here, we’re talking about mainstream commentators and publications — has been screaming “bias”! They know, just know, that Nate must be cooking the books. How do they know this? Well, his results look good for Obama, so it must be a cheat. Never mind the fact that Nate tells us all exactly how he does it, and that he hasn’t changed the formula at all. This is, of course, reminiscent of the attack on the Bureau of Labor Statistics — not to mention the attacks on climate science and much more. On the right, apparently, there is no such thing as an objective calculation. Everything must have a political motive. This is really scary. It means that if these people triumph, science — or any kind of scholarship — will become impossible. Everything must pass a political test; if it isn’t what the right wants to hear, the messenger is subjected to a smear campaign. It’s almost besides the point to notice that the whole notion that Nate Silver is somehow serving Obama’s interests by skewing the results is bizarre. This race is going to be decided by actual votes, not perceptions of “momentum”. But then posturing and bragging seems to be central to the right’s theory, for reasons I don’t get. Anyway, it’s another disgraceful episode. And the fact that the National Review ran with this tells you all you need to know about the publication.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351626960877</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 15:56:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351627966728-152</Id><Title>CHristie Shows Distain for Romney; Christie Endorses Obama</Title><Msg>This is the final turn in the 2nd election of Obama.

To top it all off, George W. Bush’s laughable FEMA director, “Heck of a job, Brownie” Michael Brown, is criticizing Obama for reacting too quickly to Sandy.

At the time, his comments barely made a ripple. Now, with FEMA leading the rescue efforts after Hurricane Sandy, the question of what Romney would do with the agency if he were to become president suddenly seems a lot more salient. And suddenly Romney doesn’t want to talk about it, presumably because the prospect of gutting the budget for first responders or pushing them into the private sector wouldn’t be very popular when they are breaking their backs to help people after the hurricane. Throughout the day following Hurricane Sandy’s landfall, reporters traveling with Romney have asked him what he’d do with FEMA—they asked him 14 different times, according to this report—and he has refused to answer. The question is all the more awkward because Romney has recast today’s campaign rally as a “storm relief event.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351634136231</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 17:55:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351634138888-185</Id><Topic><Title>BENGAZI, LYBIA</Title><Username>sidesaddlex</Username><Timestamp>1351633950397</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 17:52:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The administration has botched Benghazi before,during, and after the attack.

You’ve been a chief executive of a state. I was just in Joplin, Mo. I’ve been in Mississippi and Louisiana and Tennessee and other communities dealing with [disaster], whether it’s the tornadoes, the flooding, and worse. FEMA is about to run out of money, and there are some people who say, ‘Do it on a case-by-case basis,’ and some people who say, you know, ‘Maybe we’re learning a lesson here that the states should take on more of this role.’ How do you deal with something like that? “ROMNEY: Absolutely. Every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that’s the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that’s even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut—we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we’re doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we’re doing that we don’t have to do? And those things we’ve got to stop doing, because we’re borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we’re taking in. We cannot— “KING: Including disaster relief, though? “ROMNEY: We cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we’ll all be dead and gone before it’s paid off.

The model points to a Mitt Romney victory. Ken Bickers from CU-Boulder and Michael Berry from CU-Denver, the two political science professors who devised the prediction model, say that it has correctly forecast every winner of the electoral race since 1980. "Based on our forecasting model, it becomes clear that the president is in electoral trouble," Bickers said in a press statement. The model shows 320 electoral votes for Romney and 218 for Obama, according to The Associated Press. The model also suggests that Romney will win every state currently considered a swing state which includes Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Colorado.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351646245417</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 21:17:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351646403342-231</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN ROMNEY WINS THE POPULAR VOTE AND 330 ELECTORAL VOTES, BECAUSE OF SANDY</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1351636824869</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 18:40:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you lonely ?</Msg><Username>fluteman_qreg</Username><Timestamp>1351646403342</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 21:20:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351646712298-232</Id><Topic><Title>Hurricane Sandy</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351636641047</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 18:37:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are few undecideds left.But they go 3-1 for the challenger when they do vote.This bodes well for Romney in all the close states.
