Written by Francois Dubois, S.J. Topics: Barack Obama, John McCain, bailout, twinkies Tuesday, 20 November 2012 Obama smiles while Twinkies die! WASHINGTON, DC (ABSNN) - Arizona Senator John McCain ripped President Barack Obama's failure to offer a bail out to Twinkie producer Hostess Brands this afternoon. Speaking before the US Senate, McCain called Obama a "heartless, Godless un-American," and compared him to the "liberal socialist union organizers and #$%$ carpet baggers who invaded the south following the Civil War." He said much more but it made no more sense than did that first paragraph. "Sure, Obama bailed out the union workers in the rust belt auto industry, because that is where the votes were that elected him over me in 2008," he told an almost empty Senate Chamber. "But what did he do for the open shop, Texas based Hostess Brands who made America what it is today? Nothing, absolutely nothing because Texas went for Romney. I'm flummoxed by his perfidy," McCain shouted. He was twice interrupted during his speech by Senate pages that were sent by Harry Reid to tell him he was missing a very important, classified briefing regarding the attack on the Benghazi embassy, hearings he had insisted upon having. "Benghazi is old news, dammit! I'm talking about the all-important Twinkie Recovery Bill I am proposing right now. We must save the Twinkie," said McCain.

The Republican governor, who will face re-election in 2013 and is considered a contender for the U.S. presidency in 2016, has a 67 percent favorability rating among registered voters in the state, up from 48 percent in October. The boost is notable because Christie's ratings have stayed steady between 44 and 50 percent for his nearly three years in office, according to David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353510041192</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 10:00:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353510131894-21</Id><Topic><Title>McCain Backs Away From Benghazi Conspiracies- Sen.

The highlight of the day came with Sen. Orrin Hatch's (R-Utah) aides, when tax counsel James Lyons walked out in disgust after 5-7 minutes, according to one of the PMs who was there. 'He was snarky from the very beginning,' the PM told HuffPost Hill of Lyons, who reportedly was frustrated that the millionaires weren't properly answering his questions. When another staffer asked them if they would accept the recommendations of the Simpson-Bowles commission, Lyons reportedly jumped in and said they were a 'mouthpiece for Democrats' and demanded that they answer his questions about how a few millionaires paying extra in taxes would affect the national deficit. When the PMs tried to answer the Simpson-Bowles question, Lyons said, 'If you're going to #$%$ off, why am I here?' He then walked out, leaving a surprised group of PMs who promised to take the incident public. The rest of Hatch's staffers met with the PMs for another 20 minutes. 'Poor little millionaires who had a hard time listening to anything or anyone who doesn't want to raise taxes,' replied Hatch spokeswoman Antonia Ferrier. 'In the spirit of Thanksgiving, they could easily and generously cut a check to the U.S. Treasury.'"</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1353510179450</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 10:02:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353510647441-24</Id><Title>Did the GOP learn anything from the election</Title><Msg>woopsie nope, they are working hard to make sure they lose the next election again. The war on women continues. Democrats did well in Ohio on November 6, with President Obama claiming the state's electoral college votes and Sherrod Brown pulling out a tight race for his Senate seat. But the state's Republicans weren't going to let defeat in the statewide races slow them down. Instead, they immediately returned to their pre-election agenda: targeting Planned Parenthood. On Nov. 14, House Republicans voted in a lame-duck session to advance House Bill 298, which would likely strip public funding for Planned Parenthood in the state.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353510647441</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 10:10:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353511342371-25</Id><Topic><Title>Texas Democrat calls for Rick Perry to be drug tested</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1353161886291</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 09:18:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Texas will go DNC in 2016 once Obama gets immigration reform, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353511342371</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 10:22:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353511424488-26</Id><Topic><Title>Texas Democrat calls for Rick Perry to be drug tested</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1353161886291</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 09:18:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Immigration reform will be Obama's method of gerrymandering the states, LOL and the GOP can't do anything about it without slitting their own throat, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353511424488</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 10:23:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353511627198-27</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Lib/Commies, remind me again how 410,000 newly unemployed is a good thing</Title><Username>obozolies</Username><Timestamp>1353510954681</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 10:15:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We're back to 2008/2009 levels</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1353511627198</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 10:27:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353511675583-28</Id><Topic><Title>McCain Backs Away From Benghazi Conspiracies- Sen.

NYT: "Mr. Christie has been explaining himself to Republicans ever since. His lavish praise for Mr. Obama's response to the storm, delivered in the last days of the presidential race, represented the most dramatic development in the campaign's final stretch. Right or wrong, conventional wisdom in the party holds that it influenced the outcome. But behind the scenes, the intensity of the reaction from those in Mr. Christie's party caught him by surprise, interviews show, requiring a rising Republican star to try to contain a tempest that left him feeling deeply misunderstood and wounded... in the days after the storm, Mr. Christie and his advisers were startled to hear from out-of-state donors to Mr. Romney, who had little interest in the hurricane and viewed him solely as a campaign surrogate, demanding to know why he had stood so close to the president on a tarmac. One of them questioned why he had boarded Mr. Obama's helicopter, according to people briefed on the conversations." [NYT] Obama now has 50.73% of the overall vote, identical to the 50.73% Bush won in 2004.

During the opening monologue of NBC's Tonight Show, the host said David Petraeus's mistress Paula Broadwell had more information about Benghazi than United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice (video follows with transcript and commentary): “More problems for General Petraeus," teased Leno. "After searching the home of his mistress Paula Broadwell, the FBI said it found classified material on her personal computer." "In fact," he continued, "agents said she had more information about Benghazi than our U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, okay? We should have talked to her." Interesting that Leno considers this far more important than President Obama's obedient media that are predictably defending Rice so that she can become Secretary of State despite having clearly lied to the American about the attack on our consulate in September.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353516513323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:48:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353516547193-68</Id><Topic><Title>Bus bombing in Israel shows the nature of the subhuman Pallies</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353514133953</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:08:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>entirely possible, in fact likely</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353516547193</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:49:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353516653611-69</Id><Topic><Title>Bus bombing in Israel shows the nature of the subhuman Pallies</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353514133953</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:08:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As Bob Grant said "they're sick out there and getting sicker"</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353516653611</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:50:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353516697834-70</Id><Title>We told you so, LOL</Title><Msg>yeah Santorum could have pulled the women, minority and hispanic vote, LOL Conservatives want to push GOP more to the right after Romney loss WASHINGTON - Evangelical leaders and conservative activists have a simple message for establishment Republicans about Mitt Romney’s failed presidential bid: We told you so. After nearly two weeks of listening to GOP officials pledge to assert greater control over the party and its most strident voices in the wake of Romney’s loss, grass-roots activists have begun to fight back, saying that they are not to blame for the party’s losses in November. "The moderates have had their candidate in 2008 and they had their candidate in 2012. And they got crushed in both elections. Now they tell us we have to keep moderating. If we do that, will we win?" said Bob Vander Plaats, president of the Family Leader, a Christian group that opposed Romney during the Iowa caucuses 10 months ago.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353516697834</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:51:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353516814773-71</Id><Topic><Title>ever notice those who dont pay any taxes</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1353516170073</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:42:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What I have noticed, is that they are so stupid that they think "income tax" is the same as capital gains tax. If you raise the income taxes on people who earn more than $250,000, you still don't affect any capital gain realizations. If you raise the capital gains rate by a mere 2%, you correct a large portion of the deficit without causing a major market disruption. If it doesn't mediate the problem, you raise it another percent the next year. You don't raise taxes in big bites unless you want to cause major disruption. Sounds typical of Anarchist Liberals to suggestmassive increases.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1353516814773</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:53:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353516839617-72</Id><Topic><Title>ever notice those who dont pay any taxes</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1353516170073</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:42:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is why so many states want to secede, the producers don't want the moochers to be in charge.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353516839617</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:53:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353516902620-73</Id><Topic><Title>Leno:Petraeus's Mistress knew About Benghazi Than Susan Rice'</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353516513323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:48:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Susan Rice = Affirmative action</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353516902620</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:55:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353517052554-74</Id><Topic><Title>Leno:Petraeus's Mistress knew About Benghazi Than Susan Rice'</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353516513323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:48:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>JR. = unemployed moocher</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353517052554</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:57:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353517219028-75</Id><Topic><Title>Leno:Petraeus's Mistress knew About Benghazi Than Susan Rice'</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353516513323</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:48:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>junior, you seem to be the expert on hate. why are you such a 'hater'?

This would leave the GOP reeling heading into the 2014 election year and would exact much less of a toll on a president who will never again face the voters. Republicans would also find themselves with massive, across the board tax hikes and would have to beg and plead with the White House to sign off on a 2013 deal to renew expired tax cuts and reverse painful defense spending cuts. They would also have no mechanism to force any kind of entitlement or tax reform, which Democrats are not really that hot about anyway and could easily just ignore and spend two years lambasting their opposition as completely incapable of adult-style governance. All that really matters in these things is leverage. Which side do you think has it?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353520881383</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 13:01:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353520937299-112</Id><Title>Obama likely to get another Nobel Peace Prize</Title><Msg>for fixing the middle east,</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353520937299</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 13:02:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353521159236-113</Id><Topic><Title>why does obama hate our children?</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1353519184572</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 12:33:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He doesn't hate our kids.

Wouldn't Judeo Christian ethics about whether or not STEALING 90% of your income by confiscatory tax policies would be more germane than 'age of the earth' questions?

Its dirt cheap. Plus I think we are getting some sort of a repatriation deal as part of fiscal cliff resolution. To answer your question, I started buying April 20 calls about three weeks back when they were about 40 cents going into earnings and CSCO was falling like a rock everyday. The stock hit about 16.60 and the calls hit 25 cents, and I was lucky enough to buy my last 500 of 2000 calls at 25 cents. Average cost of about 30-31 cents per call. Since earnings, CSCO is up to 18.50 range and those calls are at about 55 cents. I am making pretty good money but this will pale in comparison if the stock should hit 22 or higher before April. I intend to hold past next earnings in February, nervously, if it doesn't hit 22 by then. Will be nice if it hit 25 (dream on!). My 2000 calls will be a cool 1 million!</Msg><Username>grantuphill</Username><Timestamp>1353525690933</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:21:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353525928015-145</Id><Topic><Title>Fischer on Rubio: ‘Eyewitness account’ in Bible proves Earth created in 7 days</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1353523180160</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 13:39:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Miriam Ferguson is often credited with a quote allegedly spoken in reference to bilingualism in Texas schools: “If English was good enough for Jesus Christ, it ought to be good enough for the children of Texas.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353525928015</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:25:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353526072943-146</Id><Title>One less crooked dem</Title><Msg>Jesse Jackson Jr. to resign.

Israel said the expanding Hamas media empire is part of the Islamists' "terrorist operations," although it stopped short of branding everyone working for it as a potential target in its offensive against Gaza's Hamas rulers. Al-Aqsa TV, which employed the two journalists, said they were killed on the job, and it accused Israel of trying to silence those documenting the suffering of Gaza's civilians.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353531203826</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:53:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353531449052-165</Id><Topic><Title>watch how well this works out for them</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353531203826</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:53:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe Hamas shouldn't have started lobbing those missiles into Israel .They knew Israel would respond.</Msg><Username>hairyroid</Username><Timestamp>1353531449052</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:57:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353531501990-166</Id><Title>new GOP plan to steal yet another presidential election</Title><Msg>course it would be the last time a Republican got elected except in a few racist counties. On Sunday, Phillips proposed an action plan -- getting Electoral College voters in states won by Romney to boycott the validation of the election result by the December 17 deadline. "The 12th Amendment specifies the quorum or the necessary number of states for the College to act, is 2/3," Phillips wrote. "In other words, if 17 states refuse to participate, the Electoral College does not have a quorum." Without a quorum to decide the presidency, he continued, the Republican-led U.S. House will decide and presumably choose Romney.

Israel maintained a strict blockade over Gaza from 2007-2010. During that time, Israel limited food supplies entering Gaza and maintained a baffling list of items that were banned or permitted as part of a broader effort to topple the violently anti-Israel Hamas by squeezing the economy. In the January 2008 document, Israel determined how to ensure that Gazans eat 2,279 calories of food each day, a figure in line with World Health Organization guidelines. It broke down the calorie allocation by various food groups, and in minute details. It said that males aged 11 to 50 required 316.05 grams of meat per day, and women in the same age group needed 190.47 grams of flour. The analysis also included adjustments for locally grown farm products as well as an assessment of the kinds of food imports that would be needed to sustain the population. Israel's Defense Ministry resisted years of attempts to release the guidelines, and consented only after an Israeli advocacy group, Gisha, won a Supreme Court order. Gisha contends that Israel calculated the calorie needs for Gaza's population in order to restrict the quantities of goods and basic products it allowed in during the first three years after Hamas violently overran the territory. Critics say the policy amounted to collective punishment of Gaza's already impoverished population of more than 1.5 million. "The official goal of the policy was to wage 'economic warfare' which would paralyze Gaza's economy and, according to the Defense Ministry, create pressure on the Hamas government," Gisha said in a release Wednesday. Israel controls the only official cargo crossings into Gaza, and greatly limited the flow of goods into the territory following the Hamas takeover. Israeli officials have said the flow of goods was often limited because of frequent Palestinian attacks on the crossings. As part of its policy, Israel used odd, secret guidelines to differentiate between humanitarian necessities and nonessential luxuries. The result was that military bureaucrats enforcing the blockade allowed frozen salmon and low-fat yogurt into the Hamas-ruled territory, but not cilantro or instant coffee. Gisha's director, Sari Bashi, said official military documents from that period indicate that the Israeli guidelines on calorie intake were in fact the basis of policy. For example, the guidelines recommend allowing 300 calves into Gaza each week to fulfill the territory's meat needs. In a September 2008 court case, the government rejected a request by an importer to bring more calves into Gaza, saying 300 animals were sufficient, using an identical figure from the guidelines. In a U.S. diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks last year, American diplomats quoted their Israeli colleagues as saying the blockade was meant to push the area's economy "to the brink of collapse." The embargo crippled Gaza's economy and wiped out tens of thousands of jobs by banning raw materials and suffocating trade. Gaza also frequently suffered from shortages of basic consumer goods.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353534634215</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 16:50:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353534873875-181</Id><Title>Hillary probably the best Sec of State in History</Title><Msg>her election in 2016 is likely to be the greatest landslide in history</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353534873875</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 16:54:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353534929816-182</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Base is DYING</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1353531700960</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 16:01:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought Romney would win but I didn't lose any sleep over it.
