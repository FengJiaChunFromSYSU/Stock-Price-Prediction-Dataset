Most people think Nagin should be rewarded for his corrpution and criminal activity. Democrat Politicians (like Jon Corzine) can embezzle billions from senior retirement mutual funds and not even get charged with a crime because he donated millions to Obama and the democrat party. Nobody cares how corrupt the goverment has become. I think this generation is the last American generation that can say that their lives were better than their parents. The kids of the next generation will have a very hard life and will be poorer than their parents and will be oppressed by this socialist democrat run goverment.</Msg><Username>global_warming_hunchback</Username><Timestamp>1358573925931</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 00:38:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358581269423-3</Id><Title>HSBC, THE CRIMINALS THAT ARE TOO BIG TO PUT IN JAIL</Title><Msg>Google it folks, for 10 years there were dealing with the enemies of this country, and nobody is getting shut down or going to jail.

W. Bush to realize what has been achieved in the last four years. In a two party system, the achievements depend on whether there is COLLUSION, COMPROMISE, or COLLISION between the governing parties. In Clinton years, the parties COMPROMISED. In G. W. Bush years, they COLLUDED. In Obama's first term, they COLLIDED. Nation had budget surplus during Clinton years. Nation's debt almost doubled during G.W. Bush years [also Reagan years], and we had two wars of choice with one still going on, and the economy went in to a tail spin. The VP [Virtual President] #$%$ Cheney and the Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told the nation that "Deficits &amp; Debts don't matter" and that the banks should be deregulated to let the "Free Market" take its course. When the then Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neal, objected to the huge tax cuts for the rich, #$%$ Cheney told him " We deserve it, we won the election, didn't we?" and fired him.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1358612511524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 11:21:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358612962285-8</Id><Title>Lance Armstrong</Title><Msg>Pride of Texas!!!!

"I'm going to vote against this," Christie said before the 15-1 vote. "You don't die from the flu." Christie backed down somewhat from his comment on Friday. What he meant to say, he said, was that "People should not die from the flu." "First of all, that's $3 million that the federal government doesn't really have," Christie said of the funding proposal. "It's borrowed money we eventually have to pay back. But more important is the media's embellishment of the extreme fear of encouraging flu vaccinations. "Every year there's going to be a flu," he said, "and vaccines create synthetic immunity, which does not trump natural immunity to disease." Christie, who said he has never taken a flu shot, suggested the medical community should focus more attention on prescription drug abuse that claims thousands of lives annually in the U.S. Dr. Joshua Septimus, associate professor of internal medicine at Methodist Hospital in the Texas Medical Center, called Christie's comments irresponsible. "That is totally wrong," he said. "The flu kills anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands in the U.S. alone. There is very good evidence that the flu shot reduces deaths from the flu. That flu vaccine is a very low risk and with very high potential benefits." Immunity issues Added Septimus, "I'm furious that a public official would make such an irresponsible statement. If even one person dies as a result of his comment, then he (Christie) is responsible. A flu shot is one of the safest medical developments we have, and it saves lives." Curtis Allen, spokesman at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said this year's flu season is particularly severe. Especially hit hard, he said, are children under 6 months of age and the elderly. Doctors recommend that children under 6 months are not immunized. Allen took issue with Christie's contention that people develop natural immunity to influenza. "The influenza strains mutate and change, and different influenza viruses circulate each year," he said. "Therefore, you cannot develop an immunity that will carry you over to the next year. "It doesn't matter how healthy you are, how much you exercise, how many vitamins you take or how much sleep you get," he said. "Anyone can be ill with influenza if they have not had a vaccine. Influenza can be a serious and deadly disease."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358630939158</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:28:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358630986541-37</Id><Topic><Title>tea baggers don't believe in science, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358630939158</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:28:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>teabaggers want little kids to die, taht's why they love the NRA</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358630986541</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:29:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358631452715-38</Id><Title>woospie, GUNS ARE SO FUN!!!

Officers say the two are responsible for the shooting that killed 17 year-old Tyrone Lawson, a Morgan Park High School student who was preparing to leave Wednesday’s game between his school and Simeon High School. The shooting followed a fight that broke out in Chicago State’s gym while the players were shaking hands.

The same impulses toward extremism are used to justify war between Sunni and Shia, between tribes and clans. It leads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos. In less than two years, we have seen largely peaceful protests bring more change to Muslim-majority countries than a decade of violence. And extremists understand this. Because they have nothing to offer to improve the lives of people, violence is their only way to stay relevant. They don’t build; they only destroy. [...] The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. But to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated, or churches that are destroyed, or the Holocaust that is denied.” Addressing the U.N.

Every level of society is affected. In the midst of such continual strife, God calls His people to be ‘peacemakers’. “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.” We need to note, this morning, as we consider this verse, that there are THREE TYPES OF PEOPLE: - Peace-breakers; - Peace-fakers; - Peace-makers. 1. PEACE-BREAKERS. Peace-breakers are those people who go out of their way to break down relationships; to cause trouble and division. They’re the deliberately confrontive people - they have to confront, disagree with everything. But their motivation is self; they are manipulative/self-seeking. For such people, the Bible has strong words: “Now I beseech you brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.” (ROMANS 16:17-18) We can’t AFFORD to have peace-breakers in the church, for divisive people cut away the very life principles of the local assembly. They staunch the move of God; they will destroy revival.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358639034745</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 18:43:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358639222331-54</Id><Topic><Title>MLK day tomorrow</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358616935461</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 12:35:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you don't even know what a christian "dumbivan".

The charge was filed Friday as a criminal "information," which means it was negotiated and that a guilty plea is expected in federal court. Defense attorney Steve Fishman declined to comment Saturday. Hathaway is resigning Monday, months after a series of questionable real estate transactions first were revealed by a Detroit TV station. Hathaway and her husband, Michael Kingsley, deeded a Florida home to Kingsley's daughter while trying to negotiate a short sale on a house they couldn't afford in Grosse Pointe Park. In a short sale, a bank agrees to a sale that wipes out any remaining mortgage, a significant benefit for any borrower. The 2011 deal went through and erased the couple's $600,000 debt in Michigan. Five months later, in 2012, the debt-free Windermere, Fla., home worth more than $600,000 went back in their names for $10. The bank fraud charge says Hathaway made false statements to ING Direct, transferred property to others and failed to disclose available cash _ all in an effort to fool the bank into believing she had a severe financial hardship. Kingsley, also a lawyer, has not been charged"</Msg><Username>citizens_against_toxic_waste</Username><Timestamp>1358644586405</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:16:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358646343080-84</Id><Title>OBAMA BOASTED THAT TERORISM WAS OVER WHEN HE GOT BIN LADEN WHAT HAPPEN IN BENGHAZI AND ALGERIA???</Title><Msg>Obama boasted that terorism was over when he got bin laden what happen in benghazi and algeria???</Msg><Username>super_samoann</Username><Timestamp>1358646343080</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:45:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358646562221-85</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA BOASTED THAT TERORISM WAS OVER WHEN HE GOT BIN LADEN WHAT HAPPEN IN BENGHAZI AND ALGERIA???</Title><Username>super_samoann</Username><Timestamp>1358646343080</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:45:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey when you're right you're right! spot on!</Msg><Username>donkeydouchebags</Username><Timestamp>1358646562221</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:49:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358646616317-86</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA BOASTED THAT TERORISM WAS OVER WHEN HE GOT BIN LADEN WHAT HAPPEN IN BENGHAZI AND ALGERIA???</Title><Username>super_samoann</Username><Timestamp>1358646343080</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:45:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we were lied to by the monkey in chief!

Three people were injured in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the Dixie Gun and Knife Show at the state fairgrounds, a quarterly event that usually draws thousands of people. State agriculture department spokesman Brian Long said a 12-gauge shotgun discharged as its owner unzipped its case for a law enforcement officer to check at a security entrance. Two bystanders were hit by shotgun pellets and taken to a hospital. A retired deputy sheriff suffered a slight hand injury. Long said the shotgun's owner, 36-year-old Gary Lynn Wilson, brought the weapon to the show to find a private buyer. Sheriff Donnie Harrison said it was too early to know whether Wilson might be charged. In Indiana, police said a 54-year-old Indianapolis man was injured when he accidentally shot himself while leaving a gun show. State Police said Emory L. Cozee was loading his .45 caliber semi-automatic when he shot himself in the hand as he was leaving the Indy 1500 Gun and Knife show at the state fairgrounds. Loaded personal weapons are not allowed inside the show. Cozee was hospitalized for treatment. Police say the shooting was accidental and no charges will be filed. Meanwhile, authorities in Ohio said a gun dealer in Medina was checking out a semi-automatic handgun he had bought when he accidentally pulled the trigger, injuring his friend. The gun's magazine had been removed from the firearm but one round remained in the chamber, police said. Police Chief Pat Berarducci said it appears the bullet struck the floor and the man was wounded in the arm and leg. Berarducci said the man was taken by helicopter to a Cleveland hospital. His condition was not immediately known. Copyright 2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
