What is this?</Title><Msg>The GOP Thinks You Don't Know S$it From Shinola —By Kevin Drum | Tue Dec. 4, 2012 10:56 PM PST Chris Frates reports that Republicans are frustrated that everyone is misinterpreting their opposition to raising tax rates on the wealthy. So on Monday, a group of K Street's "top GOP communicators" got together to discuss how they can change the narrative that they're the ones getting in the way of a fiscal cliff deal: "How can we fight back against that and how can we make that point and how can we message that we're the party of small business owners and we're not defending the rich?" asked a meeting participant. It's sort of fascinating to read this kind of thing. The obvious problem Republicans have is that their single-minded opposition to raising tax rates on the rich is, in fact, employed in defense of the rich. Even the fabled low-information voter knows this perfectly well, and mounting a messaging campaign to convince the public that Republicans are actually defending small businesses is an exercise in futility. It will just convince people that Republicans are unusually shameless hucksters who think their constituents can't distinguish fecal matter from shoe polish. But reading stories like this, I wonder if the GOP brain trust understands this? Have they drunk their own Kool-Aid so deeply that they truly think they're not defending the rich? Or is stuff like this purely for public consumption, and they just haven't figured out yet that it has no chance of working? It's a mystery.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354881328255</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 06:55:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354881583366-18</Id><Topic><Title>White House Admits Obama's TAX INCREASE PLAN CANT PASS DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED SENATE</Title><Username>giggling_democrat_hyeena</Username><Timestamp>1354861237374</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 01:20:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Would that be Harry Reid and THEN Senator Obama who stood up in front of the Senate in 2005 and said that you can't change the rules?

HUD: Five Million Fraudulent Mortgages Held by Illegals Posted on Tuesday, October 07, 2008 8:55:53 PM One illegal alien was arrested this year in Tucson after allegedly using a stolen social security number to buy two homes and rack up over $780,000 in bad debt. Some five million fraudulent home mortgages are in the hands of illegal aliens, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. It's not known how many of those have contributed to the subprime housing mortgage meltdown, but it has affected every state, including Arizona. The problem began years ago when banks were forced to give mortgages without confirming social security numbers or borrower identification. As a result, illegal immigrants were able to obtain home mortgages which they could not afford. One illegal alien was arrested this year in Tucson after allegedly using a stolen social security number to buy two homes and rack up over $780,000 in bad debt. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1354893091730</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 10:11:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354893278326-52</Id><Topic><Title>Speaking of unemployment, it doubled under Bush.........</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354891600944</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 09:46:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's " advice".

The cliff is not a massive spending bill. It's a spending cut. Obama might have to negotiate increases in spending. Good luck with that scenario. The possibility of a downgrade might appear when the debt ceiling is approached, but the reduced spending and higher taxes of the cliff make that a bit slower. If obama learns the meaning of "negotiation," and tickles a few republicans with his witty charm for putting Americans back to work, the downgrade becomes more possible. I see them selling snowcones to eskimos as a brighter possibility.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1354912649324</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 15:37:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354912929737-199</Id><Topic><Title>OH JEEZ OH BOY!</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354911207018</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 15:13:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would never have thought the average would be so high, 80 really?

ABC News has learned that the Presidential Inaugural Committee will accept unlimited corporate donations to help fund Obama's inauguration festivities next month, reversing a voluntary ban on the money he imposed on the inaugural four years ago and during the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Obama will also allow individuals to contribute up to the legal maximum for the 2013 inauguration - $250,000 - lifting a $50,000 cap he voluntarily imposed in 2008, sources said. The shift appeared to be driven by fundraising challenges in the wake of a multi-billion dollar campaign. Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney each raised north of $1 billion for the election cycle - historic highs - according to Federal Election Commission filings released Thursday. Obama's 2009 inaugural celebration cost $47 million. Officials said cost considerations for the 2013 festivities would mean less elaborate events than four years ago. There will not be a star-studded concert on the National Mall, for example, and there will be fewer inaugural balls.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1354915941233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 16:32:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354916287237-209</Id><Topic><Title>obamer socilized the meddisine - deadpainting</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354908457620</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:27:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>llike ROTFLOL</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1354916287237</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 16:38:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354916759914-210</Id><Topic><Title>Former Walker appointee given 2 years in prison for stealing $51K from Wis. veterans’ groups</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354914784631</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 16:13:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Charles Powell Jr., 61, the city's Democratic Party chairman, was found guilty .."

The 14-year-old boy told jurors at his parents' sex abuse trial he began having intercourse with his mom on his eighth birthday, about a year after his dad began showing him pornography. The parents denied the allegations, but a Wilkes-Barre (WILKS'-ba-ree) jury convicted them on all counts Friday. The parents will be sentenced early next year.

He might reference psychological projection, and suggest that Junior had some material inbreds in his past. That wouldn't be surprising. In the south, I wouldn't doubt that "workers" were bred intentionally, and family expressions were intensified by the breeding. Junior seems to think that inbreeding creates idiots, but it is actually not as common as carrying the beneficial traits. Royalty discovered the drawbacks. They bred for quality, and created a few throwbacks in the process.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1354925057367</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 19:04:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354925089506-225</Id><Topic><Title>why teabaggers prefer home schooling</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354917979598</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 17:06:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You need a reading teacher.

Issa was charged with carrying a concealed weapon; he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of possession of an unregistered firearm, and was sentenced to six months' probation and a small fine.[7][13] Issa has said he believes the record has since been expunged.[7]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354932646898</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 21:10:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354932771562-257</Id><Topic><Title>obama the self server.</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1354915941233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 16:32:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YOU RACIST POS !!!!

It happened last month in an intermediate Spanish class at Achieve Early College High School in McAllen, Texas — a city located about 10 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. Wearing red, white and green, students had to memorize the Mexican anthem and pledge and stand up and recite them in individually in front of the class. That didn’t go over well with sophomore Brenda Brinsdon. The 15-year-old sat down and refused to participate. She also caught it all on video: Brinsdon said she complained to the school principal, Yvette Cavazo, who told her it was part of the curriculum and that she should participate. Her father, William, also got involved, calling the school district superintendent to complain. (baggers don't play well with others, it's why they are unemployable) When Brenda made clear she would not stand up and recite the pledge, she was given an alternative assignment: an essay on the history of the Mexican revolution. Meanwhile, other students continued with their presentations, which took place over the course of several days. School district spokesman Mark May defended the presentations, saying it’s a state requirement for upper-level language classes to teach about foreign culture. According to the state’s Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills standards, students are expected to gain “knowledge and understanding” of other cultures and use the language to demonstrate understanding of different practices and perspectives.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354935569116</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 21:59:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354935628869-269</Id><Topic><Title>ANOTHER OBAMA TSA UNION WORKER ARRESTED FOR STEALING IPADS FROM PASSENGERS</Title><Username>arnold_schwarzenegger_sukks</Username><Timestamp>1354845270976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 20:54:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Black criminals are costing American taxpayers big money.
