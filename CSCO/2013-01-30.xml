Elise Foley: "President Barack Obama made an economic and moral case on Tuesday for the need for comprehensive immigration reform, vowing he would send legislation to Congress and insist on a vote if bipartisan efforts there fail. 'I'm here today because the time has come for common sense, comprehensive immigration reform,' he said in a Las Vegas speech... His plans for reform broadly matched with the 'gang of eight' framework, but included progressive elements such as a call not mentioned in the speech for same-sex couples to be given equal treatment to heterosexual ones in immigration law, an idea some Republicans have said would essentially kill any bipartisan legislation. Like the Senate gang, Obama said there must be a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently living in the country. But his proposed pathway, though arduous, would not require certain metrics to be met on border security before green cards could be distributed, a central tenet of the Senate plan meant to stave off charges of 'amnesty.'"</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359555585039</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:19:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359556097631-27</Id><Topic><Title>Negative GDP and a lie from Dow Jones</Title><Username>carpet.bomber</Username><Timestamp>1359554269762</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:57:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Will Obama have a news conference today to brag about negative growth ??Or does he just do that when there's good news??</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1359556097631</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:28:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359556556088-28</Id><Topic><Title>bush had 9 quarters of negative growth</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1359553593912</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:46:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound a lot like alsmith, Alfalfa.LOL.

US economy contracts for the first time in 3-1/2 years EMMANUEL DUNAND / AFP - Getty Images The U.S. economy stopped dead in its tracks in the last three months of 2012 as the halting recovery was slammed by the biggest cut in defense spending in 40 years, fewer exports and sluggish growth in company stockpiles. The slowdown has provoked worries that the fiscal cliff standoff in Washington at the end of the year took a larger-than-expected bite out of economic activity in the fourth quarter and would continue to pressure businesses and consumers in the new year. The Commerce Department said Wednesday the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter. That's a sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent growth rate in the July-September quarter. It was the economy's first decline sine the 2007-2009 recession and the worst performance since the second quarter of 2009. The surprise contraction could raise fears about the economy's ability to handle tax increases that took effect in January and looming spending cuts. The weakness may be because of one-time factors, though. Government spending cuts and slower inventory growth subtracted a total of 2.6 percentage points from growth. Both are volatile. And they offset faster growth in consumer spending, business investment and housing. The contraction, coming against a backdrop of tightening fiscal policy, could spur fears of a new recession and create an urgency for policymakers to deal with outstanding budget issues. Economists polled by Reuters had expected output to increase at a 1.1 percent rate. None of the economists surveyed had predicted a contraction. Related:Are you struggling in the suburbs? We want to hear from you. A pick-up in consumer spending and a rebound in business investment, however, curbed the slide in output and offered some hope for the recovery, which will be severely tested as Washington tightens its belt. The biggest question going forward is how consumers react to the expiration of a Social Security tax cut. Congress and the White House allowed the temporary tax cut to expire in January, but reached a deal to keep income taxes from rising on most Americans. The tax increase will lower take home pay this year by about 2 percent. That means a household earning $50,000 a year will have about $1,000 less to spend. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less. Already, a key measure of consumer confidence plummeted this month after Americans noticed the reduction in their paychecks, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. The GDP data was published as officials at the Federal Reserve wrap-up a two-day meeting. The report will likely provide ammunition for officials at the U.S. central bank to stay on their ultra-accommodative policy stance. Economists say a growth pace in excess of 3 percent would be needed over a sustained period to significantly lower high unemployment. The economy has struggled to hold above a 2 percent growth pace. For the whole of 2012 the economy grew 2.2 percent. The economy was slammed by a monster storm in late October, which caused extensive damage along the East Coast, which was expected to have cut around 0.5 percentage point off fourth-quarter growth. Businesses, caught with too much inventory in their warehouses in the third quarter, slowed their stock building in the final three months of the year. That slowdown sliced 1.27 percentage points from fourth-quarter GDP growth. That was the biggest drag in two years. Excluding inventories, the economy grew at a 1.1 percent rate, slowing from the third quarter's 2.4 percent. Government spending tumbled at a 6.6 percent rate, as defense outlays plunged at a 22.2 percent pace, wiping out the previous quarter's gains. Government subtracted 1.33 percentage points form growth. The decline in defense spending was the largest since 1972. Export weakness also weighed on growth. Exports have been hampered by a recession in Europe, a cooling Chinese economy and storm and strike-related port disruptions. Overall trade cut a quarter of a percentage point from GDP growth. Exports fell for the first time since the first quarter of 2009. Not all the details in the report were bleak. Importantly, consumer and business spending showed some strength, and income available to households after taxes and inflation increased substantially in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose at a 2.2 percent rate, accelerating from the prior quarter's 1.6 percent growth pace. Business investment rebounded after its first drop in 1-1/2 years in the prior quarter. The housing market was another bright spot. Residential construction grew at a 15.3 percent rate after notching a 13.5 percent growth pace in the third quarter.

The carrying of weapons outside the home could be severely limited under the guidelines and weapons could be confiscated for negligence of Law.

Government Spending was largely to blame Government spending as a whole declined 6.6% in Q4 after rising 3.9% in the prior quarter. Defense spending fell 22%, the biggest drop since 1972. By contrast, defense spending was up 12.9% in Q3. Cynics find the notion of a sharp reversal in government spending immediately after a Presidential election suspicious, but the drop had a very real impact on GDP. Regardless, Paulsen thinks the defense spend was a "one-off that won't be repeated."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359566497037</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 12:21:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359566510270-85</Id><Title>US GROWTH LOWER THAN CUBA?

The one-time Florida congressman said the Sandy Hook tragedy hit particularly close to home, not only because he lives in Connecticut, but he has young children, one son has Asperberger's, as apparently did the gunman. While noting that he kept a 100% voting rating with the National Rifle Congress while in Congress, he did some soul-searching after the carnage in Connecticut. "Friday changed everything and it must change everything," Scarborough said somber, prepared remarks for the morning news show on Monday "Politicians can no longer be allowed to defend the status quo," he said. "They must instead be forced to defend our children. Parents can no longer take no for an answer from Washington when the topic turns to protecting our children." Scarborough linked gun violence in the United States to a "violent popular culture, a growing mental health crisis and the proliferation of combat-styled weapons." "I say good luck to the gun lobbyist, good luck to the Hollywood lawyer who tries to blunt the righteous anger of millions of parents by hiding behind twisted readings of our Bill of Rights," Scarborough said. He added that he used to view the gun control debate "as a powerful symbolic struggle between individual rights and government control,"but no longer.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359570440482</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 13:27:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359570514767-131</Id><Topic><Title>Al gore lost 25 million in apple</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1359570270989</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 13:24:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am already planning to move away from the rising ocean.

A massive storm system raked the Southeast on Wednesday, spawning tornadoes and dangerous winds that overturned cars on a Georgia interstate and demolished homes and businesses, killing at least two people. The storm system tossed vehicles on Interstate 75 in Georgia into the air, onto their roofs and into the grassy shoulder. The highway was closed for a time, and another main thoroughfare remained closed until crews could safely remove downed trees and power lines from the road. Authorities were working to rescue people reportedly trapped in homes and buildings. The storm decimated that city's downtown area and wiped out parts of a large manufacturing plant, killing at least one person and sending nine to hospitals, Bartow County officials said. Residents said no traces remained of some roadside produce stands — a common sight on rural Georgia's back roads.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359583827921</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:10:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359583898008-242</Id><Title>Oblunder's Appointments...</Title><Msg>You have the tax cheat Timothy Geithner of course but what about some others?

Most of these suburban shops, officials say, are law-abiding businesses that operate responsibly. But a small percentage—fewer than 1 percent, the city says—are responsible for nearly half of all the firearms used in crimes in Chicago. It's not just Chicago: "Prior to May 1999, a single gun store sold more than half of the guns recovered from criminals in Milwaukee, WI, shortly following retail sale." * Assuming that figure is accurate, it still leaves tens of thousands of then-illegal guns to account for. In 1992, Don Terry looked into the city's illegal gun market and found that obtaining a gun on the street was also easy: The gangs and other criminals also get weapons through barter, or "trade-ins." The gangs trade narcotics for the guns of drug-addicted burglars, who will sell a $500 pistol for less than $100. "We get half our guns through trade-ins with dope fiends," said a gang member on the South Side. "If you wanted a gun right now, we could put in an order and you'd have it. It's like going through the drive-through window. 'Give me some fries, a Coke and a 9-millimeter.' " Terry spoke to one gang leader who got his first gun from a drug addict, had just bought 27 guns an addict stole from a retired police officer's house, and regularly went to gun shows to buy and then resell at a substantial profit on the black market—a combination of the many ways guns are exchanged in the city.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359586070005</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:47:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359586202000-251</Id><Topic><Title>Giant Global Warming Storms destroying unbelieving south, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359583712455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:08:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So says the troglodyte !!!

Gerald Hume Before their third visit, detectives talked with one of Janet Hume's friends, who gave them troubling news. "Janet Hume told her that Gerald has recently bought several guns," according to the police affidavit, which was seeking a search warrant for the Hume home. Axelrod on guns: 'An opportunity' Yoakam: Newtown an 'anomalous horror' Bill would allow concealed guns on campus Bloomberg on guns: 'There's a limit' That third time police went to check on Janet Hume, all hell broke loose. Universal background check: What does it mean? Gerald Hume held police at bay for 11 hours, barricading himself inside the home as a police helicopter flew overhead. During negotiations, police records show Hume admitted shooting his mother in the chest. At 4:30 a.m. on November 14, an Oklahoma City Police tactical unit finally forced its way into the home. Hume pointed his 9mm Glock at them. An officer used a stun gun on him; another fired a beanbag rifle at him. But police still had to rush him, pushing him down with their shields. Police then quickly searched Hume's home, finding Janet Hume's body in a bedroom, the affidavit said. While Hume's lawyer declined to be interviewed, the inventory of items seized from the home in relation to the case tells a gruesome story. In addition to the handgun and three rifles, police also removed a Whirlpool freezer, a reciprocating saw and a serrated kitchen knife, according to the inventory, filed with the search warrant. They also seized a pair of blood-splattered safety glasses and a white plastic trash bag containing women's clothing that was "cut up/stained," the document said. Authorities found parts of Janet Hume's body inside the freezer, along with the body of a house cat, the district attorney told the Oklahoman newspaper. Gerald Hume was described in the affidavit as a "known schizophrenic (who) hears voices, and requires treatment" and who has had "several mental health interventions with OCPD" and a history of violent behavior. He didn't steal his guns or borrow them. He bought them. "He bought them like any normal person would -- he got them at Walmart," said Oklahoma City Police Capt. Dexter Nelson. Hume bought the rifles at the Walmart in Moore, Oklahoma, on September 25. The next day he bought the Glock at Gun World in the nearby town of Dell City, according to Nelson. Both are federally licensed gun dealers that conduct background checks. The checks, in theory, are supposed to stop certain people -- including the mentally ill with a history of violence -- from buying them.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359586520769</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:55:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359586602984-254</Id><Topic><Title>Giant Global Warming Storms destroying unbelieving south, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359583712455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:08:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You fecking racist cu(n)ts are always blaming Fox for people having enough common sense to know how the story of chicken little ends.

The CO2 therapy of anthropogenic global warming is really bunkum and you know it!!! As the ice recedes in Northern Europe, early settlements are being uncovered revealing the fact that early man lived in these exact spots 10-12,000 years ago. Interesting. There has been ice there for hundreds of years, and now, there is less ice and the evidence is that there was no ice there 10,000 years ago.....'global warming' before men burned fossil fuel...if it even is 'fossil fuel'.

An arrest warrant states that Rodrigo Abad Diaz of Duluth, Ga., was fatally shot in the head Saturday as he tried to drive away from Phillip Sailors' home in Lilburn, northeast of Atlanta. According to Diaz's friends, who were in the vehicle at the time of the incident, the 22-year-old had received incorrect directions from a GPS device which led him to Sailors' driveway, the Atlantic Journal-Constitution reports. They were in the area to pick up a friend. Sailors' attorney, Michael Puglise, tells The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he was home with his wife late at night, and assumed the young man arrived to commit a home invasion. Puglise says Sailors was defending his home and maintains his innocence. guess that was just more black gang violence, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359598448247</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 21:14:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359598503663-322</Id><Topic><Title>Children running this country</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1359594685010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 20:11:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most young people today don't no anything about WORK all they no is someone owes them a living thats the reason this country going under no one wants to WORK get off your butts and do something.</Msg><Username>shwdl</Username><Timestamp>1359598503663</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 21:15:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359598728493-323</Id><Topic><Title>GOP to split into two parties</Title><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1359596606974</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 20:43:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The new center right party will feature Independents, moderate Republicans, and anti-Obama Democrats.
