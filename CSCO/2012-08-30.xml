On the heels of a better than expected fourth quarter earnings report, in which the company reported an adjusted EPS ($0.47) above the Street’s expectations ($0.45), the stock has risen more than 10% in two weeks. In addition to sporting impressive year-over-year revenue (4.4%) and earnings (56.0%) growth, Cisco also boosted its dividend by a whopping 75%. With this increase, shares of CSCO now sport a projected dividend yield of 2.9%, and CEO John Chambers has vowed to devote half of the company’s future free cash flows to further payment hikes and share repurchases.

Not anymore. Now, says Jeff Greenfield, the veteran political analyst and Yahoo! News columnist, the media is held in such low regard by Americans that getting called out for lying merely serves to confirm a widespread belief that the "liberal media" has an axe to grind against conservative politicians. As a result, the whoppers that dominated Republican VP candidate Paul Ryan's convention speech last night will likely not hurt the candidate's standing with Republican voters, says Greenfield. Rather, they'll reinforce the right-wing view that the media is "in the tank" for President Obama. What facts in particular were observers and fact-checkers up in arms about? Well, for starters, there were once again the claims that Obamacare cuts $716 billion of benefits from Medicare and that Paul Ryan wants to preserve Medicare. The truth is that Obamacare reduces payments to hospitals and doctors by $716 billion, not benefits. Also, far from preserving Medicare, after a 10-year grace period, Romney and Ryan want to radically change it. [ Then Ryan blamed S&amp;P's downgrade of U.S. debt on Obama, when S&amp;P explained explicitly that its downgrade was the result of Congressional Republicans--Ryan included--threatening to cause the country to default. Then Ryan accused Obama of lying to voters in his home state by promising to keep a GM plant open for "hundreds of years" after he was elected, only to have it closed in the first year. The truth is that GM closed the plant before Obama took office.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346341497750</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 11:44:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346341753671-34</Id><Topic><Title>It's not spelled CERANT</Title><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1346182167045</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:29:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since Surf is talking about lying today,how about his CERANT story.....oooopsie I meant CERENT.LOL</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1346341753671</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 11:49:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346341834463-35</Id><Topic><Title>REPUKES GOT A NICE FACIAL LAST NIGHT...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346341497750</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 11:44:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are quoting a Yahoo news columnists?????

These facts can not be disputed. While I believe that the tax code should be completely revised and that some regulations need to be reviewed and perhaps eliminated, the Republican Party apparently does not understand that it is demand that creates growth, and consequently jobs; not lower taxes. If products are in demand and individuals have the funds available they will purchase them. Unfortunately over the past decade real wages have gone down as our country has transitioned from an industrial economy to a service economy. Adding to the problem has been the outsourcing of jobs overseas and the housing crash all of which have resulted in less cash in the pocketbook of the consumer. As a result, overall demand is down and consequently employment. What our country has to do is to get more money into the hands of the consumer. This can be done either through tax policy, public work projects, or an increase in the minimum wage. Reducing uncertainty and developing long-term solutions to the problems facing our country would also give our economy a psychological boost.</Msg><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1346344093513</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:28:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346344127050-40</Id><Title>Hopes dashed CSCO still a useless pos stock to own</Title><Msg>probably go back to 16's now after CIEN killed any hope of networking sector rally.</Msg><Username>cavanyc</Username><Timestamp>1346344127050</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:28:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346344146658-41</Id><Topic><Title>REPUKES GOT A NICE FACIAL LAST NIGHT...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346341497750</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 11:44:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama did make that statement on Feb.13th, 2008 while campaigning for president in Janesville.

By CAL WOODWARD, Associated Press – 20 minutes ago WASHINGTON (AP) — GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan took some factual shortcuts during the Republican convention when he attacked President Barack Obama's policies on Medicare, the economic stimulus and the budget deficit. His running mate, Mitt Romney, was expected to speak later Thursday in the convention's culmination. A closer look at some of Ryan's remarks Wednesday at the GOP convention in Tampa, Fla.: ___ RYAN: "And the biggest, coldest power play of all in Obamacare came at the expense of the elderly. ... So they just took it all away from Medicare. Seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars, funneled out of Medicare by President Obama." THE FACTS: Ryan's claim ignores the fact that Ryan himself incorporated the same cuts into budgets he steered through the House in the past two years as chairman of its Budget Committee, using the money for deficit reduction. And the cuts do not affect Medicare recipients directly, but rather reduce payments to hospitals, health insurance plans and other service providers. In addition, Ryan's own plan to remake Medicare would squeeze the program's spending even more than the changes Obama made, shifting future retirees into a system in which they would get a fixed payment to shop for coverage among private insurance plans. Critics charge that would expose the elderly to more out-of-pocket costs. ___ RYAN: "The stimulus was a case of political patronage, corporate welfare and cronyism at their worst. You, the working men and women of this country, were cut out of the deal." THE FACTS: Ryan himself asked for stimulus funds shortly after Congress approved the $800 billion plan, known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Ryan's pleas to federal agencies included letters to Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis seeking stimulus grant money for two Wisconsin energy conservation companies. One of them, the nonprofit Wisconsin Energy Conservation Corp., received $20.3 million from the Energy Department to help homes and businesses improve energy efficiency, according to federal records. That company, he said in his letter, would build "sustainable demand for green jobs." Another eventual recipient, the Energy Center of Wisconsin, received about $365,000. ___ RYAN: Said Obama misled people in Ryan's hometown of Janesville, Wis., by making them think a General Motors plant there threatened with closure could be saved. "A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said: 'I believe that if our government is there to support you ... this plant will be here for another hundred years.' That's what he said in 2008. Well, as it turned out, that plant didn't last another year." THE FACTS: The plant halted production in December 2008, weeks before Obama took office and well before he enacted a more robust auto industry bailout that rescued GM and Chrysler and allowed the majority of their plants — though not the Janesville facility — to stay in operation. Ryan himself voted for an auto bailout under President George W. Bush that was designed to help GM, but he was a vocal critic of the one pushed through by Obama that has been widely credited with revitalizing both GM and Chrysler.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346344741291</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:39:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346345023871-47</Id><Topic><Title>RASMUSSEN REPORTS: NO MORE RYAN BOUNCE, IT'S NOW A TIE!!</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo28</Username><Timestamp>1346335836250</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 10:10:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>personal attacks = you lose the argument</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo28</Username><Timestamp>1346345023871</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:43:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346345033591-48</Id><Title>dont worry about the markets folks</Title><Msg>uncle Benny will be sure to speak ASAP and say we are ready to print more us debt and give it to banks to hoard.

The truth is that those savings come primarily from slowing the rate of growth in payments hospitals and doctors and do not take away any benefits from seniors, unlike Ryan's plan to end Medicare by turning it into a voucher program in which seniors rather than the government will bear increasing health care costs. Moreover, Ryan's own Medicare plan contains the same $700 billion in costs savings. It just goes to show that a good defense is a good offense with the man who wants to end Medicare as we know it claiming it's President Obama who wants to cut Medicare. • Ryan accused President Obama of "adding more debt than any other President before him." The truth is that the biggest driver of the debt have been the Bush tax cuts, the unfunded wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Republican-backed Medicare drug program which wasn't paid for, all of which Paul Ryan voted for. • Ryan blamed Obama for the shutting down of a GM plant in Ryan's home district in Janesville, Wisconsin. The fact is that the plant shuttered in 2008 while George Bush was still President. President Obama's program to keep GM alive saved hundreds of thousands of jobs. • Ryan gave moving homilies to the responsibility of the strong to protect the weak. The truth is that the Medicaid cuts in Ryan's budget would deny health care to millions of the poor and prevent millions more middle class families from affording nursing homes. • Ryan appealed to young people without jobs living in their parent's homes. Cuts to student loans in Ryan's budget would deny millions of them the chance to go to college and obtain the skills to get high-paying jobs. • Ryan blamed President Obama for last summer's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard and Poor's. But S&amp;P itself stated that the downgrade was caused primarily because Congressional Republicans, like Ryan, refuse to consider raising revenues. Ryan is a master practitioner of The Big Lie, the propaganda technique in which if you lie big and often enough, people will believe the lie.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346345796970</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:56:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346345812975-54</Id><Title>GOP=smaller goverment= DO NOTHING FOR HURRICANE FAMILYS=REALLY !!!!!</Title><Msg>I will never vote GOP AGAIN</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1346345812975</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:56:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346345967819-55</Id><Topic><Title>GREAT SPEECH BY RYAN...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346296085521</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 23:08:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wona see BIDEN in chainnnn. idiot lier</Msg><Username>michael9mdva</Username><Timestamp>1346345967819</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:59:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346346764374-56</Id><Title>PUKES: "RYAN THE SMARTEST GUY IN CONGRESS"</Title><Msg>Funny in the old days we used to call them Con Men.

One line, though, stuck out more than the rest, particularly because it's Ryan who is attacking President Barack Obama on the subject: It began with a perfect Triple-A credit rating for the United States; it ends with a downgraded America. That's Ryan, a leading member of the House of Representatives, attacking Obama for the S&amp;P downgrade of the U.S.'s credit rating in 2011. That's a pretty standard attack for Mitt Romney, but it carries a lot more weight coming from Ryan. There were a number of facts that didn't match up in Ryan's speech. But unlike other attacks Ryan fibbed Wednesday night — the Janesville, Wisc., GM plant among them — the downgraded credit rating is not exactly a politically savvy move. Look at who the S&amp;P blames in its statement: Compared with previous projections, our revised base case scenario now assumes that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, due to expire by the end of 2012, remain in place. We have changed our assumption on this because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues, a position we believe Congress reinforced by passing the act. Key macroeconomic assumptions in the base case scenario include trend real GDP growth of 3% and consumer price inflation near 2% annually over the decade. S&amp;P downgraded the U.S., in part, because of a revised expectation that the Bush tax cuts would remain in place. They assumed this because of Republicans' unwillingness to enact any measures raising revenue, and they completely slammed House Republicans — including Paul Ryan — for doing so.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346347164135</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:19:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346347222982-61</Id><Topic><Title>GOP=smaller goverment= DO NOTHING FOR HURRICANE FAMILYS=REALLY !!!!!</Title><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1346345812975</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:56:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yea those billions spent on the sea wall was money well spent. imagine if she were a cat 5. so you are saying it is the governments responsiblity to insure homes now too? good to know. if I knew that i would have built my home in a swamp like NO.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346347222982</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:20:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346347307996-62</Id><Topic><Title>dont worry about the markets folks</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346345033591</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:43:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sold it long ago. thanks</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346347307996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:21:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346347503098-63</Id><Title>liberals on the board sound afraid</Title><Msg>they dont want to have to work if mitt wins. they know the free ride ends. to bad they will have to pay their fair share.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346347503098</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:25:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346347639440-64</Id><Topic><Title>liberals on the board sound afraid</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346347503098</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:25:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NO ONE WILL WORK IF MITT wins, he'll eliminate jobs and put the tax burden back on the middle class!</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo28</Username><Timestamp>1346347639440</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:27:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346347726753-65</Id><Title>MR.

In fact, a recent analysis of satellite data "utterly obliterates" the previous record, set in 2007. The chief culprit? Global warming. The potential upshot? Longer and more intense extreme-weather events such as heat waves, cold spells, and droughts. (Read more about extreme weather in National Geographic magazine.) On Monday, researchers at the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center said the rate of Arctic sea ice decline is now the highest that has ever been observed for the month of August. In August of this year, the sea ice disappeared at an average rate of about 39 square miles (a hundred square kilometers) per day—or about twice as fast as normal, NSIDC scientists say. Moreover, the area of Arctic sea ice around the North Pole had shrunk to 1.58 million square miles (4.1 million square kilometers)—the smallest measurement since 1979, when satellite observations began. By comparison, said NSIDC's Julienne Stroeve, Arctic sea ice cover in the 1970s and '80s at this time of year was typically in excess of 2.7 million square miles (7 million square kilometers). The worst news of all? The new record probably won't last long. With up to three more weeks of the melting season left, said Stroeve, the total is likely to shrink further.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346350029245</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:07:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346351361736-80</Id><Topic><Title>used to be people were embarrassed to outright lie</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346344741291</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:39:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which people?

The CNN/ORC poll asked Americans and registered voters whether or not Mitt Romney should release more than two years of tax returns. By a margin of 63%-36%, those polled felt that Romney should release more tax returns. Among registered voters, the result was a similar 61%-37% split. What is remarkable about popular opinion on Romney’s tax returns is the across the board agreement that he should release more years. Sixty four percent of men and 63% of women agree that Romney should release more tax returns. By a margin of 55%-43%, white voters think Romney should release more returns. Non-white voters overwhelmingly (81%-19%) want Romney to release more tax returns. A majority of every age group polled, from 18-34 year olds (76%) to those 65+ (53%) want to see more tax returns released. Both college grads (62%) and non-college grads (64%) think Romney should release more tax returns. Every region of the country from the Northeast (71%) to South (59%) through the Midwest (63%) and West (59%) wants Romney to release more.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346358327782</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:25:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346358812519-115</Id><Topic><Title>What happened to CIENA ? did you see it ?</Title><Username>kored35</Username><Timestamp>1346358103252</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:21:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cisco RIPPING away market share from the competitors.

TAMPA, Fla. — Paul Ryan’s acceptance speech at the Republican convention contained several false claims and misleading statements. Delegates cheered as the vice presidential nominee: Accused President Obama’s health care law of funneling money away from Medicare “at the expense of the elderly.” In fact, Medicare’s chief actuary says the law “substantially improves” the system’s finances, and Ryan himself has embraced the same savings. Accused Obama of doing “exactly nothing” about recommendations of a bipartisan deficit commission — which Ryan himself helped scuttle. Claimed the American people were “cut out” of stimulus spending. Actually, more than a quarter of all stimulus dollars went for tax relief for workers. Faulted Obama for failing to deliver a 2008 campaign promise to keep a Wisconsin plant open. It closed less than a month before Obama took office.

John Kerry ran for president; you know, his wife, who has hundreds of millions of dollars, she never released her tax returns. Somehow this wasn’t an issue.” — Mitt Romney, on Fox News, July 16, 2012 “It's standard for the last Republican nominee, the last Democratic nominee.” — Romney senior adviser Ed Gillespie, on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” July 15, 2012, answering a question on why Romney will release only two years of tax returns. In trying to fend off demands — from both Democrats and even some Republicans — that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney release more than two years of tax returns, his campaign has sought to claim that releasing two years of tax returns is normal. (Romney so far has released his 2010 return and an estimate for his 2011 return.) Is that really the case? Let’s check out Gillespie’s claim, presumably about McCain and President Obama, and Romney’s claim that the tax returns of Teresa Heinz Kerry were “not an issue.” The Facts The Tax History Project run by TaxAnalysts has a fascinating Web page with the tax returns of presidents and presidential candidates, dating all the way back to Franklin D. Roosevelt. McCain, it is correct, released two years of tax returns, but Obama released seven years of tax returns. Looking over the years at Obama’s returns, one can see how he suddenly became a wealthy man in 2005 from sales of his reissued memoir. In that year, he earned more than $1 million in income from book sales. So Gillespie is simply wrong to claim that it is standard for the “last Democratic nominee.” (The Romney campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) In fact, McCain is really the exception. John Kerry in 2004, Al Gore in 2000, George W. Bush in 2000, Bob Dole in 1996, Bill Clinton in 1992 and Michael Dukakis in 1988 all released many years of tax returns when they ran for president against the incumbent, either at the time or because they had routinely released tax returns while in public office. (There was no incumbent in 2000.) Dole, in fact, released tax returns for a whopping 30 years. Of course, Romney’s father, George Romney, is famous for having released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968, saying “one year could be a fluke.” As BuzzFeed showed, he paid an effective tax rate of 50 percent — those were days before the Reagan tax cuts. And what of Kerry’s wife? Romney must have missed the controversy, largely fanned by Republicans, about her tax returns, in which they darkly suggested that she was secretly funding her husband’s presidential campaign. (She inherited the Heinz fortune from her late husband, and it was worth at least $500 million.) A quick check of the clips shows that it was rather big issue, so much so that she eventually made public the first two pages of her 2003 return. That was not enough for Republicans, who wanted an even broader look. Amusingly, we see that the Wall Street Journal editorial page complained that, with an effective tax rate of 12.4 percent, “she is paying a lower average rate than nearly all middle-class taxpayers paid in 2001” — similar to the line that the Obama campaign has been using about Romney’s tax rate. Romney, in his Senate race against Ted Kennedy in 1994, demanded that Kennedy release his tax returns, and Kennedy refused. In his 2002 race for governor, Romney cited Kennedy’s refusal, quoting him as saying, “I value my privacy.” Romney added: “I think he was right and I was wrong.” He never released his tax returns in that campaign. However, Romney did provide the McCain campaign with 23 years’ worth of tax returns as part of the vetting process for being considered for vice president. Those returns were not released publicly. The Romney tax returns for the years 2008 and 2009, which he has not released or shared with others, would reflect his earnings during the depths of the recent economic crisis.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346375174595</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 21:06:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346375217235-150</Id><Title>the humanized french speaking Mitt is about to lecture us</Title><Msg>not sure if i should go to bed or watch this rich c-riminal so called executive give his speech tonight?</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346375217235</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 21:06:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346375310888-151</Id><Title>"Je suis Mitt Romney nous allons faire la fête"</Title><Msg>watch the Romney girl on u-tube</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346375310888</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 21:08:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346375333137-152</Id><Topic><Title>the humanized french speaking Mitt is about to lecture us</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346375217235</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 21:06:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think your boyfriends want you to come to bed.They have something for you.</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1346375333137</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 21:08:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346375375757-153</Id><Title>Je suis Mitt Romney et j'ai été humanisé par la reine Anne</Title><Msg>take that white trash</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346375375757</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 21:09:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346375446091-154</Id><Title>Je suis Mitt Romney et je voudrais te faire foutre dans le cul</Title><Msg>censor that Yahoo!</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346375446091</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 21:10:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346375548475-155</Id><Title>Je suis Mitt Romney et je vous enverrai vos enfants américains à mourir pour les juifs</Title><Msg>we must save the homeland</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346375548475</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 21:12:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346375638575-156</Id><Title>MSNBC whiners</Title><Msg>Lawrence ODonnell and Rachel Muffdiver still crying about the doctored " you didn't build that" gaffe.

No explanation how he plans to do ANYTHING.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346384668589</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:44:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346384700059-267</Id><Topic><Title>MSNBC SUCKS</Title><Username>darnmadd2</Username><Timestamp>1346384423989</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:40:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I meant "full of lies" sorry</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346384700059</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:45:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346384864134-268</Id><Title>msnbc was all nagetive</Title><Msg>What a bunch of clown they are</Msg><Username>darnmadd2</Username><Timestamp>1346384864134</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:47:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346384973600-269</Id><Topic><Title>MSNBC SUCKS</Title><Username>darnmadd2</Username><Timestamp>1346384423989</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:40:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeh fox news is so fair and balanced.</Msg><Username>cdmovado</Username><Timestamp>1346384973600</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:49:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346385110212-270</Id><Title>MSNBC SUCKS</Title><Msg>ALL NAGETIVE,WHAT A BUNCH OF CLOWNS THEY ARE</Msg><Username>darnmadd2</Username><Timestamp>1346385110212</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:51:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346385149286-271</Id><Title>mcain and eastwood should be in old age nut house</Title><Msg>??????????</Msg><Username>cdmovado</Username><Timestamp>1346385149286</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:52:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346385326907-272</Id><Topic><Title>POINT NUMBER ONE MITT...PEEEEEEEEEEEEASE</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346382059476</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:00:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>surf, you are one stupid Pecker-wood.

On this measure, while it was Romney who ran the Olympics, Ryan earned the gold. The good news is that the Romney-Ryan campaign has likely created dozens of new jobs among the legions of additional fact checkers that media outlets are rushing to hire to sift through the mountain of cow dung that flowed from Ryan’s mouth. Said fact checkers have already condemned certain arguments that Ryan still irresponsibly repeated.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346385581158</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:59:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
