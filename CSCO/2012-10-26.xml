Dionne Jr. Opinion Writer How the right wing lost in 2012 The right wing has lost the election of 2012. The evidence for this is overwhelming, yet it is the year’s best-kept secret. Mitt Romney would not be throwing virtually all of his past positions overboard if he thought the nation were ready to endorse the full-throated conservatism he embraced to win the Republican nomination. E.J. Dionne Jr. What Romney’s moderation conceals If conservatism were winning, does anyone doubt that Romney would be running as a conservative? Yet unlike Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater, Romney is offering an echo, not a choice. His strategy at the end is to try to sneak into the White House on a chorus of me-too’s. The right is going along because its partisans know Romney has no other option. This, too, is an acknowledgment of defeat, a recognition that the grand ideological experiment heralded by the rise of the tea party has gained no traction. It also means that conservatives don’t believe that Romney really believes the moderate mush he’s putting forward now. Not to put too fine a point on it, but if the conservatives are forgiving Romney because they think he is lying, what should the rest of us think? Almost all of the analysis of Romney’s highly public burning of the right’s catechism focuses on such tactical issues as whether his betrayal of principle will help him win over middle-of-the-road women and carry Ohio. What should engage us more is that a movement that won the 2010 elections with a bang is trying to triumph just two years later on the basis of a whimper. It turns out that there was no profound ideological conversion of the country two years ago. We remain the same moderate and practical country we have long been. In 2010, voters were upset about the economy, Democrats were demobilized, and President Obama wasn’t yet ready to fight. All the conservatives have left now is economic unease. So they don’t care what Romney says. They are happy to march under a false flag if that is the price of capturing power. The total rout of the right’s ideology, particularly its neoconservative brand, was visible in Monday’s debate, in which Romney praised one Obama foreign policy initiative after another. He calmly abandoned much of what he had said during the previous 18 months. Gone were the hawkish assaults on Obama’s approach to Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Israel, China and nearly everywhere else. Romney was all about “peace.” Romney’s most revealing line: “We don’t want another Iraq.” Thus did he bury without ceremony the great Bush-Cheney project. He renounced a war he had once supported with vehemence and enthusiasm. Then there’s budget policy. If the Romney/Paul Ryan budget and tax ideas were so popular, why would the candidate and his sidekick, the one-time devotee of Ayn Rand, be investing so much energy in hiding the most important details of their plans? For that matter, why would Ryan feel obligated to forsake his love for Rand, the proud philosopher of “the virtue of selfishness” and the thinker he once said had inspired his public service? Romney knows that, by substantial margins, the country favors raising taxes on the rich and opposes slashing many government programs, including Medicare and Social Security. Since Romney’s actual plan calls for cutting taxes on the rich, he has to disguise the fact. Where is the conviction? The biggest sign that tea party thinking is dead is Romney’s straight-out deception about his past position on the rescue of the auto industry. The bailout was the least popular policy Obama pursued — and, I’d argue, one of the most successful. It was Exhibit A for tea partyers who accused our moderately progressive president of being a socialist. In late 2008, one prominent Republican claimed that if the bailout the Detroit-based automakers sought went through, “you can kiss the American automotive industry good-bye.” The car companies, he said, would “seal their fate with a bailout check.” This would be the same Mitt Romney who tried to pretend on Monday that he never said what he said or thought what he thought. If the bailout is now good politics, and it is, then free-market fundamentalism has collapsed in a heap. “Ideas have consequences” is one of the conservative movement’s most honored slogans. That the conservatives’ standard-bearer is now trying to escape the consequences of their ideas tells us all we need to know about who is winning the philosophical battle — and, because ideas do matter, who will win the election.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351253076306</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 08:04:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351253386430-18</Id><Title>great buy is AMD... huge winner going forward AMD</Title><Msg>AMD.. easy triple..</Msg><Username>buywhenallbazh</Username><Timestamp>1351253386430</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 08:09:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351253607224-19</Id><Topic><Title>Best commonsense assessment of the race to date.</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351253076306</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 08:04:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now that is LAUGHABLE.

This is why I have been posting the UNSKEWEDPOLLS, I never believed that Obama was doing that well. Reports that women are even in support for the candidates. Reports that Romney is ahead with crucial independents by double digits, that he is ahead at least +5 with men. All this to me meant Obama had to be behind more that 2%. It just didn't make sense he was that close. Gallup identifies likely voters using a series of seven questions that ask about current voting intentions and past voting behavior. The resulting sample of likely voters has proven to give a generally accurate prediction of the final election outcome. For example, in 2004, Gallup's final likely voter estimate (before undecideds were allocated to the candidates) showed George W. Bush with a two-percentage-point advantage over John Kerry in an election Bush won by just over two points. And Gallup's final 2008 estimate showed Barack Obama outpolling John McCain by 11 points, a slight overestimate of Obama's seven-point margin of victory. The lack of change in the composition of the electorate in recent years is not unexpected, given that there are limits on how great a share of the electorate a subgroup can represent -- mainly its share of the overall U.S. adult population. For example, if 12% of all Americans are black, turnout among blacks would have to be proportionately greater than that of other racial groups for their share of the electorate to exceed 12%. The fact that 11% of likely voters this year are black indicates that turnout among blacks may be slightly less than among other racial groups. To the extent the electorate looks different now compared with 2004 or 2008, those changes may have as much to do with changes in the larger national adult population as with differential turnout by group this year. For example, the largest changes in the composition of the electorate compared with the last presidential election concern the partisan affiliation of voters. Currently, 46% of likely voters identify as Democrats or lean Democratic, compared with 54% in 2008. But in 2008, Democrats enjoyed a wide 12-point advantage in party affiliation among national adults, the largest Gallup had seen in at least two decades. More recently, Americans have been about as likely to identify as or lean Republican as to identify as or lean Democratic. Consequently, the electorate has also become less Democratic and more Republican in its political orientation than in 2008. In fact, the party composition of the electorate this year looks more similar to the electorate in 2004 than 2008. Additionally, the percentage of nonwhite voters, now 20%, has risen significantly since 2004 (15%) -- though it is similar to 2008's 19% -- largely due to the proportionately greater growth of the nonwhite population in the United States over the past decade.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351267906346</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:11:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351268013033-75</Id><Topic><Title>obama using air force one and our tax dollars to campaign</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351263956394</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:05:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>plane owners need to pay their fair share.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351268013033</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:13:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351268115399-76</Id><Title>almost 7 trillion of new nat debt added</Title><Msg>in less than four years...no budget. must be that george bushes fault.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351268115399</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:15:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351268210513-77</Id><Topic><Title>obama using air force one and our tax dollars to campaign</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351263956394</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:05:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your point is the N is suppose to walk or take a bus, get it straight , He is POTUS, Obama 2012 , Elected and Not Selected !</Msg><Username>settegast_scholar</Username><Timestamp>1351268210513</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:16:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351268651267-78</Id><Topic><Title>ROMNEY LEADING POLLS</Title><Username>scott4usa</Username><Timestamp>1351231135184</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 01:58:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh so we can call Bush a monkey but if we rate Obama we have to grade on a curve and give him some slack right?

UNBELIEVABLE</Title><Msg>From sources who were on the ground in Benghazi that an urgent request from the CIA annex for military back-up during the attack on the U.S. Consulate and subsequent attack several hours later was denied by U.S. officials -- who also told the CIA operators twice to "stand down" rather than help the ambassador's team when shots were heard at approximately 9:40 p.m. in Benghazi on Sept. 11. Former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods was part of a small team who was at the CIA annex about a mile from the U.S. Consulate where Ambassador Chris Stevens and his team came under attack. When he and others heard the shots fired, they informed their higher-ups at the annex to tell them what they were hearing and requested permission to go to the consulate and help out. They were told to "stand down," according to sources familiar with the exchange. Soon after, they were again told to "stand down." Woods and at least two others ignored those orders and made their way to the Consulate which at that point was on fire. Shots were exchanged. The quick reaction force from the CIA annex evacuated those who remained at the Consulate and Sean Smith, who had been killed in the initial attack. They could not find the ambassador and returned to the CIA annex at about midnight. At that point, they called again for military support and help because they were taking fire at the CIA safe house, or annex. The request was denied. There were no communications problems at the annex, according those present at the compound. The team was in constant radio contact with their headquarters. In fact, at least one member of the team was on the roof of the annex manning a heavy machine gun when mortars were fired at the CIA compound. The security officer had a laser on the target that was firing and repeatedly requested back-up support from a Specter gunship, which is commonly used by U.S. Special Operations forces to provide support to Special Operations teams on the ground involved in intense firefights. The fighting at the CIA annex went on for more than four hours -- enough time for any planes based in Sigonella Air base, just 480 miles away, to arrive. Fox News has also learned that two separate Tier One Special operations forces were told to wait, among them Delta Force operators. Watch "Special Report Investigates: Death and Deceit in Benghazi" on Fox News at 1 p.m. ET on Saturday, 3 p.m. on Sunday and 10 p.m. on Sunday. A Special Operations team, or CIF which stands for Commanders in Extremis Force, operating in Central Europe had been moved to Sigonella, Italy, but they too were told to stand down. A second force that specializes in counterterrorism rescues was on hand at Sigonella, according to senior military and intelligence sources. According to those sources, they could have flown to Benghazi in less than two hours. They were the same distance to Benghazi as those that were sent from Tripoli. Specter gunships are commonly used by the Special Operations community to provide close air support. According to sources on the ground during the attack, the special operator on the roof of the CIA annex had visual contact and a laser pointing at the Libyan mortar team that was targeting the CIA annex. The operators were calling in coordinates of where the Libyan forces were firing from. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday that there was not a clear enough picture of what was occurring on the ground in Benghazi to send help. "There's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking going on here," Panetta said Thursday. "But the basic principle here ... is that you don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on." U.S. officials argue that there was a period of several hours when the fighting stopped before the mortars were fired at the annex, leading officials to believe the attack was over. Fox News has learned that there were two military surveillance drones redirected to Benghazi shortly after the attack on the Consulate began. They were already in the vicinity. The second surveillance craft was sent to relieve the first drone, perhaps due to fuel issues. Both were capable of sending real time visuals back to U.S. officials in Washington, D.C. Any U.S. official or agency with the proper clearance, including the White House Situation Room, State Department, CIA, Pentagon and others, could call up that video in real time on their computers. Tyrone Woods was later joined at the scene by fellow former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty, who was sent in from Tripoli as part of a Global Response Staff or GRS that provides security to CIA case officers and provides countersurveillance and surveillance protection. They were killed by a mortar shell at 4 a.m. Libyan time, nearly seven hours after the attack on the Consulate began -- a window that represented more than enough time for the U.S. military to send back-up from nearby bases in Europe, according to sources familiar with Special Operations. Four mortars were fired at the annex. The first one struck outside the annex. Three more hit the annex. A motorcade of dozens of Libyan vehicles, some mounted with 50 caliber machine guns, belonging to the February 17th Brigades, a Libyan militia which is friendly to the U.S., finally showed up at the CIA annex at approximately 3 a.m. An American Quick Reaction Force sent from Tripoli had arrived at the Benghazi airport at 2 a.m. (four hours after the initial attack on the Consulate) and was delayed for 45 minutes at the airport because they could not at first get transportation, allegedly due to confusion among Libyan militias who were supposed to escort them to the annex, according to Benghazi sources. The American special operators, Woods, Doherty and at least two others were part of the Global Response Staff, a CIA element, based at the CIA annex and were protecting CIA operators who were part of a mission to track and repurchase arms in Benghazi that had proliferated in the wake of Muammar Qaddafi's fall. Part of their mission was to find the more than 20,000 missing MANPADS, or shoulder-held missiles capable of bringing down a commercial aircraft. According to a source on the ground at the time of the attack, the team inside the CIA annex had captured three Libyan attackers and was forced to hand them over to the Libyans. U.S. officials do not know what happened to those three attackers and whether they were released by the Libyan forces. Fox News has also learned that Stevens was in Benghazi that day to be present at the opening of an English-language school being started by the Libyan farmer who helped save an American pilot who had been shot down by pro-Qaddafi forces during the initial war to overthrow the regime. That farmer saved the life of the American pilot and the Ambassador wanted to be present to launch the Libyan rescuer's new school.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351268999679</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:29:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351269071132-82</Id><Topic><Title>Gallup: Likely turnout shows GOP 36% to Dem 35% means a blow-out for Romney</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351267906346</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:11:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>60% of whites support Romney</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351269071132</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:31:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351269087272-83</Id><Title>air force one abuse...pay your fair share obama</Title><Msg>This is from Mark Knoller of CBS. The pilots and crew of Air Force One are flying more hours than a rookie on a beer run. They are tired of it too, and are adding more crew to Air Force-1 - I know this for a fact because I'm one of the instructors that trains the crews. Our company (Atlas Air) has had the Air Force-1 and E-4 contract for over two years and I've been doing it for about 8 months now. Last year (2010) Obama flew in Air Force One 172 times, almost every other day. White House officials have been telling reporters in recent days that the Democrat doesn't intend to hang around the White House quite so much in 2011. They explain he wants to get out more around the country because, as everyone knows, that midterm election shellacking on Nov. 2 had nothing to do with his health care bill, over-spending or other policies, and everything to do with Obama's not adequately explaining himself to his countrymen and women. And with only 673 days remaining in Obama's never ending presidential campaign, the incumbent's travel pace will not likely slacken. At an Air Force-estimated cost of $181,757 per flight HOUR (not to mention the additional travel costs of Marine One, Secret Service, logistics and local police overtime), that's a lot of frequent flier dollars going into Obama's carbon footprint. $80 Million every time it lands &amp; takes off. We are privy to some of these numbers thanks to CBS' Mark Knoller, a bearded national treasure trove of presidential stats. According to Knoller's copious notes, during the last year, Obama made 65 domestic trips over 104 days, and six trips to eight countries over 22 days. Not counting six vacation trips over 32 days.He took 196 helicopter trips, signed 203 pieces of legislation and squeezed in 29 rounds of left-handed golf. Obama last year gave 491 speeches, remarks or statements. That's more talking than goes on in some entire families, at least from fatherly mouths.In fact, even including the 24 days of 2010 that we never saw Obama in public, his speaking works out to about one official utterance every 11 waking hours. Aides indicate the "real good talker" believes we need more.Related: Obama spends nearly half his presidency outside Washington, plans to travel more Related: Vacationer-in-Chief Spends $1.75 Million to Visit Hawaiian ChumsObama has spent over $5.76 Billion taxpayer dollars flying around in Air Force One, and probably another $100 Billion on his entourage. Obama is just another tin-pot dictator living lavishly at the expense of his subjects. According to the Constitution, no money is to be expended that has not been appropriated by Congress. Are they not paying attention?According to Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, all Presidential appointments are to be made with the advice and consent of the Senate, providing two-thirds of the Senators agree. He has appointed more than two dozen czars without so much as consulting the Senate. Those czars are unconstitutionally appointed. We could save lots of money by removing the czars and their staffs. And by eliminating much of the bureaucracy we could balance the budget. Why has the Congress not thought of these things?</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351269087272</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:31:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351269195819-84</Id><Title>Bradley effect, Obama's finished, he is tapped out.

Mitt Romney, the argument goes, is conveniently forgetting his real agenda, flipping his positions to better appeal to the electorate. Since Mr. Romney's conservative base would surely disagree, this raises the question of whether the president isn't himself suffering from a psychological malady that experts call "projection." *** "I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program"—Illinois state Sen. Barack Obama, June 2003. "I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter"—President Obama, August 2009. *** "Leadership means that the buck stops here. . . . I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt limit"—Sen. Barack Obama, March 2006. "It is not acceptable for us not to raise the debt ceiling and to allow the U.S. government to default"—President Obama, July 2011. *** "I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages"—Obama questionnaire response, 1996, while running for Illinois state Senate. CloseAssociated Press ."I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage"—Sen. Obama, November 2008, while running for president. "It is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married"—President Obama, May 2012. *** "We have an idea for the trigger. . . . Sequestration"—Obama Office of Management and Budget Director Jack Lew in 2011, as reported in Bob Woodward's "The Price of Politics." "First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed"—President Obama, October 2012. *** "If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election"—Sen. Obama, 2007. "We've made the decision not to participate in the public financing system for the general election"—Sen. Obama, June 2008. *** "I will never question the patriotism of others in this campaign"—Sen. Obama, June 2008. "The way Bush has done it over the last eight years is . . . [he] added $4 trillion by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back. . . . That's irresponsible. It's unpatriotic"—Sen. Obama, July 2008. "I don't remember what the number was precisely. . . . We don't have to worry about it short term"—President Obama, September 2012, on the debt figure when he took office ($10 trillion) and whether to worry about today's $16 trillion figure. *** "[Sen. Hillary Clinton believes] that . . . if the government does not force taxpayers to buy health care, that we will penalize them in some fashion. I disagree with that"—Sen. Obama, Jan 2008, opposing the individual mandate for health insurance. "I'm open to a system where every American bears responsibility for owning health insurance"—President Obama, June 2009, supporting the individual mandate. *** "Instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times when America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive"—President Obama, April 2009, in France. "We have at times been disengaged, and at times we sought to dictate our terms"—President Obama, April 2009, in Trinidad and Tobago. "Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing"—Barack Obama, October 2012, on whether he went on a global apology tour. *** "The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel"—Sen. Obama, September 2008. "Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years"—President Obama, January 2010. *** "So if somebody wants to build a coal-fired plant, they can, it's just that it will bankrupt them"—Sen. Obama, January 2008, on his plans to financially penalize coal plants. "Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution"—Sen. Obama, August 2008. "Here's what I've done since I've been president. We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades. We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment"—President Obama, October 2012. *** "If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition"—President Obama, 2009. "We've got a long way to go but . . . we've come too far to turn back now. . . . And that's why I'm running for a second term"—President Obama, October 2012.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351272796982</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 13:33:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351273053329-113</Id><Topic><Title>oh look how cute my little pet follows me around habging - wetbrain ROTFG!!!</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1351272576203</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 13:29:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>see how it hangs on my every post...like i am its god or somthing...how cute.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351273053329</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 13:37:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351275251403-114</Id><Topic><Title>romnisia hahahahahahahahahahaha</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351272796982</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 13:33:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>liberals quiet about this one. bwahahahahahahahaha children leading children.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351275251403</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:14:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351275328866-115</Id><Title>remember before the 3rd debate</Title><Msg>when Mitt spent every minute saying Obama's policies were all wrong, and then in the 3rd debate decided that he agreed with all of Obama's policies, LOL just to funny</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351275328866</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:15:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351275492214-116</Id><Title>Obama-Baloney hahahahahahahahahahaha</Title><Msg>Obama-Baloney hahahahahahahahahahaha DEMS now push election commercials about women and their first time !

Romney’s testimony in a post-divorce lawsuit brought in 1990 by Sullivan Stemberg was unsealed on Thursday in Norfolk Probate and Family Court at the Globe’s request. Sullivan Stemberg sued unsuccessfully to amend the couple’s financial agreement after Staples went public in 1989 and closed its first day of trading at $22.50 per share. Stemberg left his wife in February 1987, and the divorce was finalized in July 1988. Before the official split, the couple negotiated an agreement in which Sullivan Stemberg got 500,000 shares of Staples stock, which Stemberg valued at $2.25 per share. Sullivan Stemberg also kept the couple’s Dedham home, worth $690,000 at the time, and in February 1988 sold 175,000 shares of Staples stock at $2.25 per share -- before it went public -- to pay off the mortgage. She sold another 80,000 shares two months later, at $2.48 per share. Raise Your Voice Click to contact candidates or elected officials about this issue. “In my opinion, that’s a good price to sell the securities at,” Romney, now the Republican nominee for president, testified in June 1991. After that, the number of Sullivan Stember’s shares shrank to 81,667 due to a three-for-one reverse stock split just before Staples had its initial public offering. On April 28, 1989, the company made its initial public offering at $19 per share and ended its first day at $22.50. This came barely a year after Sullivan Stemberg’s sale of more than half of her shares at less than $2.50 a share (pre-split).</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351286882857</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 17:28:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351287019570-161</Id><Topic><Title>Remember in the primary</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351286619374</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 17:23:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>kind of defensive aren't you flute, I mean Rhonda, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351287019570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 17:30:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351287023003-162</Id><Title>Obama called Bush unpatriotic for running up 4 trillion in debt.</Title><Msg>In O'Losers own words, what does that make him?
