If the election were held today, 55 percent of physicians reported they would vote for Romney while just 36 percent support Obama, according to a survey released by Jackson &amp; Coker, a division of Jackson Healthcare, the third largest health care staffing company in the United States Fifteen percent of respondents said they were switching their vote from Obama in 2008 to Romney in 2012. The top reasons cited for this change was the Affordable Care Act and the failure to address tort reform. Leadership style, failure to follow through on campaign promises, unemployment and the general state of the economy were also factors. “Doctors are highly motivated this year to have their voice heard, particularly after passage of the Affordable Care Act,” said Sandy Garrett, president of Jackson &amp; Coker. “No doubt, the health care law has stirred many passions in the medical community.” Fifty-five percent of physicians said that they favored “repeal and replace” Obamacare, while 40 percent said “implement and improve”.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349152833341</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 00:40:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349159577345-2</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA IS A COMMUNIST DICTATOR...</Title><Username>fluteman_qreg</Username><Timestamp>1349144280920</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 22:18:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, they are fkng leeches zuking the soul of America, until there is nothing left but a carcass.

Do you just like posting the same nonsense. About 90% of Cisco's cash is overseas where they have ALREADY paid tax on it in the country that they made the profit. If they bring it home they will be TAXED AGAIN. MOST global companies are in the same boat. Obama and Democrats don't have a clue, they should have created a tax holiday of say something like 5-8% and a trillion dollars would have come flowing into the US. Talk about a stimulus. Don't worry, President Romney and responsible patriots in congress will take care of it in 2013 and then you will get your special dividend.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1349182809743</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:00:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349182824571-17</Id><Topic><Title>FLUTEMAN_GREG offers sexual favors to Pres.

We did it in 2004 when our Dearest leader stole Ohio and we will do it again this time.</Msg><Username>fluteman_qreg</Username><Timestamp>1349196266737</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:44:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349196348614-71</Id><Title>BIG NEWS, POLL : ROMNEY 53%, MAOB 38 %</Title><Msg>ROMNEY 2012, PERIOD</Msg><Username>mishaelena</Username><Timestamp>1349196348614</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:45:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349196533274-72</Id><Topic><Title>A judge on Tuesday blocked Pennsylvania's divisive voter identification requirement from going into effect on Election Day, delivering a hard-fought victory to Democrats who said it was a ploy to defeat President Barack Obama and other opponents who said it would prevent the elderly and minorities from voting.</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1349190769765</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 11:12:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obambles is evil for wanting old people to vote.

Written by Francois Dubois, S.J. Topics: Barack Obama, Mitt Romney, 2012 Presidential Election, Joseph Biden, DNC, Punk #$%$ #$%$ Monday, 1 October 2012 "Romney is our #$%$," says a smiling Joe Biden ORLANDO FL (ABSNN) - Only days before the first scheduled Presidential debate, Mitt Romney stunned the nation this morning when he admitted that he was "a paid employee of the Democratic National Committee." "It is true; I am a shill for the Obama Campaign. I had no intention of winning the presidency. I'm just in it for the money. I need the money because Ann's face-lifts are so expensive," Romney said to a hushed overflow crowd packed into the Tupperware Auditorium just outside Orlando. "Joe Biden came to me two days after President Obama was inaugurated in March 2009. He told me that the DNC would pay me $100,000,000 if I could win the 2012 Republican nomination for President," Romney stated. "The day after I was formally nominated by the Republican Party, the check from the DNC cleared my Salt Lake City bank. Now I'm out of here!" Nothing else Romney said could be clearly heard due to the shouts and cat-calls that filled the auditorium. In the ensuing rioting, Romney was hustled from the arena by his Secret Service detail and several members of the Orange County (FL) sheriff's office. Several persons were injured in the fracas. Romney remains incognito at this time. President Obama released this statement through his White House Press Office at noon today, Washington time: "While it is true that the Democratic National Committee paid Governor Romney $100,000,000 to secure the Republican nomination, there is absolutely no law prohibiting our doing so. Governor Romney was paid to win the nomination, but not to win the election. He was well compensated for making bizarre statements about subjects that he knows absolutely nothing at all about, thus #$%$uring I will remain in office to fulfill my Presidential legacy." The Republican National Committee released this statement: "What in the fruck is going on here? Can they do that?" "It's a done-deal. At this point it's a moot point; if you get my point," Vice President Biden told reporters, in no uncertain (?) terms.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1349203950114</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:52:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349204001699-102</Id><Title>WHEN MITT BECOMES PRESIDENT ...</Title><Msg>He will reduce the debt by increasing it by 5 Trillion.

This suspends the rollout of the law passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Governor Tom Corbett. Measures had been taken to make it easier for Pennsylvanians to obtain identification, but the judge wrote, “I question whether sufficient time now remains to attain the goal of liberal access….” However, the law has not been struck down. The court was forced to reconsider the law after the Pennyslvania Supreme Court demanded a review of the restrictions. The Nation’s Ari Berman recently told The National Memo that the law was designed to fight a “phantom menace”: The state of Pennsylvania, which passed a voter ID law in 2012 that was purportedly designed to stop in-person voter fraud, admitted in a recent court filing: “there have been no investigations or prosecutions of in-person voter fraud in Pennsylvania; and the parties do not have direct personal knowledge of any such investigations or prosecutions in other states.” In 2008, 2,745,069 registered voters in Pennsylvania did not vote. But the state legislature acted after the 2010 election to make voting more difficult as part of a wave of voting restriction laws the likes of which have not been seen since the Civil Rights era. Mitt Romney recently said he had a “secret” that made him sure that he was going to win the Keystone State. But the secret has been out for a while. Mike Turzai, the Republican House Leader in Pennsylvania, famously revealed the true intention of the law at a Republican State Committee meeting earlier this year: “Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania… done.” This victory for the Voting Rights Act is one of several that have severely dampened the GOP’s apparent strategy of limiting access to the polls for Obama voters.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1349205695345</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:21:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349205935979-109</Id><Title>Benghazi scandal just getting started</Title><Msg>Seems pleas for security were denied for several months going back from September 11.

What did An illegal fireman name his two sons ??? HoseA and HoseB YOU AIN'T CHIT WET ! LIKE I SAID COWARDS, THIEVES and CRIMINALS: Mexico's Immigration Law: Let's Try It Here at Home By J. Michael Waller, Citizens for a Constitutional Republic Mexico has a radical idea for a rational immigration policy that most Americans would love. However, Mexican officials haven't been sharing that idea with us as they press for our Congress to adopt the McCain-Kennedy immigration reform bill. That's too bad, because Mexico, which annually deports more illegal aliens than the United States does, has much to teach us about how it handles the immigration issue. Under Mexican law, it is a felony to be an illegal alien in Mexico. At a time when the Supreme Court and many politicians seek to bring American law in line with foreign legal norms, it's noteworthy that nobody has argued that the U.S. look at how Mexico deals with immigration and what it might teach us about how best to solve our illegal immigration problem. Mexico has a single, streamlined law that ensures that foreign visitors and immigrants are: •in the country legally; •have the means to sustain themselves economically; •not destined to be burdens on society; •of economic and social benefit to society; •of good character and have no criminal records; and •contributors to the general well-being of the nation. The law also ensures that: •immigration authorities have a record of each foreign visitor; •foreign visitors do not violate their visa status; •foreign visitors are banned from interfering in the country's internal politics; •foreign visitors who enter under false pretenses are imprisoned or deported; •foreign visitors violating the terms of their entry are imprisoned or deported; •those who aid in illegal immigration will be sent to prison. Who could disagree with such a law? It makes perfect sense. The Mexican constitution strictly defines the rights of citizens -- and the denial of many fundamental rights to non-citizens, illegal and illegal. Under the constitution, the Ley General de Poblacion, or General Law on Population, spells out specifically the country's immigration policy. It is an interesting law -- and one that should cause us all to ask, Why is our great southern neighbor pushing us to water down our own immigration laws and policies, when its own immigration restrictions are the toughest on the continent? If a felony is a crime punishable by more than one year in prison, then Mexican law makes it a felony to be an illegal alien in Mexico. If the United States adopted such statutes, Mexico no doubt would denounce it as a manifestation of American racism and bigotry. We looked at the immigration provisions of the Mexican constitution. [1] Now let's look at Mexico's main immigration law. Mexico welcomes only foreigners who will be useful to Mexican society: •Foreigners are admitted into Mexico "according to their possibilities of contributing to national progress." (Article 32) •Immigration officials must "ensure" that "immigrants will be useful elements for the country and that they have the necessary funds for their sustenance" and for their dependents. (Article 34) •Foreigners may be barred from the country if their presence upsets "the equilibrium of the national demographics," when foreigners are deemed detrimental to "economic or national interests," when they do not behave like good citizens in their own country, when they have broken Mexican laws, and when "they are not found to be physically or mentally healthy." (Article 37) •The Secretary of Governance may "suspend or prohibit the admission of foreigners when he determines it to be in the national interest." (Article 38) Mexican authorities must keep track of every single person in the country: •Federal, local and municipal police must cooperate with federal immigration authorities upon request, i.e., to assist in the arrests of illegal immigrants. (Article 73) •A National Population Registry keeps track of "every single individual who comprises the population of the country," and verifies each individual's identity. (Articles 85 and 86) •A national Catalog of Foreigners tracks foreign tourists and immigrants (Article 87), and assigns each individual with a unique tracking number (Article 91). Foreigners with fake papers, or who enter the country under false pretenses, may be imprisoned: •Foreigners with fake immigration papers may be fined or imprisoned. (Article 116) •Foreigners who sign government documents "with a signature that is false or different from that which he normally uses" are subject to fine and imprisonment. (Article 116) Foreigners who fail to obey the rules will be fined, deported, and/or imprisoned as felons: •Foreigners who fail to obey a deportation order are to be punished. (Article 117) •Foreigners who are deported from Mexico and attempt to re-enter the country without authorization can be imprisoned for up to 10 years. (Article 118) •Foreigners who violate the terms of their visa may be sentenced to up to six years in prison (Articles 119, 120 and 121). Foreigners who misrepresent the terms of their visa while in Mexico -- such as working with out a permit -- can also be imprisoned. Under Mexican law, illegal immigration is a felony. The General Law on Population says, •"A penalty of up to two years in prison and a fine of three hundred to five thousand pesos will be imposed on the foreigner who enters the country illegally." (Article 123) •Foreigners with legal immigration problems may be deported from Mexico instead of being imprisoned. (Article 125) •Foreigners who "attempt against national sovereignty or security" will be deported. (Article 126) Mexicans who help illegal aliens enter the country are themselves considered criminals under the law: •A Mexican who marries a foreigner with the sole objective of helping the foreigner live in the country is subject to up to five years in prison. (Article 127) •Shipping and airline companies that bring undocumented foreigners into Mexico will be fined. (Article 132) All of the above runs contrary to what Mexican leaders are demanding of the United States. The stark contrast between Mexico's immigration practices versus its American immigration preachings is telling. It gives a clear picture of the Mexican government's agenda: to have a one-way immigration relationship with the United States. Let's call Mexico's bluff on its unwarranted interference in U.S. immigration policy. Let's propose, just to make a point, that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) member nations standardize their immigration laws by using Mexico's own law as a model.</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1349211838381</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 17:03:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349212006127-140</Id><Topic><Title>WARN ACT, for the BORDER that states</Title><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1349210970036</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 16:49:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CRIME ONLY PAYS FOR MEXIHOLE !

In the video above, Donovan Hunter of Stunning Developments, Inc. showcases the new BattleProd, the world’s first weapon-mountable pain compliance-inducing stun baton which Hunter says is designed for use in “crowd control applications.” The weapon was on display at the recent 2012 SOFIC (Special Operations Forces Industry Conference), described as “the defense industry’s premier event,” and attended by military and police professionals. The event was sponsored by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. According to a write-up of the BattleProd by Defense Review, the weapon is “intimidating” and “loud”. “This thing is just too much fun. I mean, what’s not too like? It gives you 3-5 million volts of compliance-inducing electricity either in your hand (handheld variant) or at the end of your weapon (rifle/carbine, weapon-mountable variant). Touch the BattleProd anywhere on the rod (front, sides, etc.), and you’re goin’ down like a sack a’ potatoes. Actually, you’re probably goin’ night-night for a little while,” writes David Crane. The most powerful Tasers can only reach around 50,000 volts and despite being described as “non-lethal” have killed at least 500 Americans. Given that the BattleProd can achieve 5 million volts, concerns surrounding the safety of the device will obviously be paramount. However, in the clip Hunter claims that the weapon cannot kill and that victims fully recover after around 20 minutes. The fact that the weapon is being developed for use by both police and military assets who are increasingly being re-oriented to carry out homeland security operations will increase fears that the BattleProd will be another tool of domestic oppression in the event of widespread civil unrest. As we reported last week, LRAD sonic weapons which are also designed to disperse crowds via non-lethal pain compliance are being deployed “throughout” America in readiness for upcoming national emergencies and other crises. The Department of Homeland Security, the US Army, US Military Police, as well as law enforcement bodies across the country are all making preparations for riots and civil unrest in light of domestic disorder that has gripped Europe as a result of the financial crisis, most recently in Greece and Spain. A recently leaked US Army Military Police training manual for “Civil Disturbance Operations” outlines how military assets are to be used domestically to quell riots, confiscate firearms and even kill Americans on U.S. soil during mass civil unrest. Watch another video clip of the BattleProd in action below.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1349213239029</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 17:27:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349213678990-150</Id><Title>CSCO has huge growth potential in the next 2yrs...</Title><Msg>Company has one of the best CEOs among the technology industry, experienced and knowledgable...He knows how to capture the market transitions.

But what visa is he talking about? The policy does not involve visas. It is a presidential directive to the Department of Homeland Security to temporarily suspend, on a case-by-case basis, the deportations of people who meet certain criteria: young immigrants with clean records who were brought to the United States illegally as children. The Times’s national immigration reporter, Julia Preston, spoke to an immigration lawyer, Margaret Stock. “It is disturbing that he does not know the difference between a visa and deferred action,” Ms. Stock said of Mr. Romney. “Nobody got a visa through this program. That would have required Congressional action.” “This is Immigration Law 101,” said Ms. Stock, who is also a Republican. “It looks like a major fumble by whoever is advising him on immigration.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1349219513347</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 19:11:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349219730759-158</Id><Topic><Title>Romney not connected to the issues</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1349219513347</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 19:11:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Odd that since Romney " has no chance" you spend so much time bashing him.

"I believe in free enterprise. I don't think the government should be telling people what you pay and what you don't pay," Akin said at a town hall meeting on Thursday. The comment came in response to a question about Akin's decision to vote against the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which has made it it easier for women to challenge unequal pay. "I think it's about freedom," Akin added. "If somebody wants to hire somebody and they agree on a salary, that's fine, however it wants to work. So, the government sticking its nose into all kinds of things has gotten us into huge trouble. Hell freedom means we should be able to have slaves if it helps free enterprise."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1349221462664</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 19:44:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349221870017-170</Id><Topic><Title>Joe did it again!!</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1349220064552</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 19:21:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"President Barack Obama has signed into law twenty-one new or higher taxes on the American people."

Sergey Aleynikov, an ex-Goldman Sachs computer programmer, was arrested July 3 after arriving at Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. officials said. Aleynikov, 39, who has dual American and Russian citizenship, is charged in a criminal complaint with stealing the trading software. Teza Technologies LLC, a Chicago-based firm co-founded by a former Citadel Investment Group LLC trader, said it suspended Aleynikov, who started there on July 2. At a court appearance July 4 in Manhattan, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti told a federal judge that Aleynikov’s alleged theft poses a risk to U.S. markets. Aleynikov transferred the code, which is worth millions of dollars, to a computer server in Germany, and others may have had access to it, Facciponti said, adding that New York-based Goldman Sachs may be harmed if the software is disseminated. “The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways,” Facciponti said, according to a recording of the hearing made public today. “The copy in Germany is still out there, and we at this time do not know who else has access to it.” ‘Preposterous’ The prosecutor added, “Once it is out there, anybody will be able to use this, and their market share will be adversely affected.” The proprietary code lets the firm do “sophisticated, high- speed and high-volume trades on various stock and commodities markets,” prosecutors said in court papers. The trades generate “many millions of dollars” each year. Defense attorney Sabrina Shroff said in court that the government’s allegations are “preposterous.” The firm was aware that Aleynikov, who is the father of three young girls, was downloading programs to his personal computer to do work at home and that he hasn’t disseminated the code, the lawyer said. “If Goldman Sachs cannot possibly protect this kind of proprietary information that the government wants you to think is worth the entire United States market, one has to question how they plan to accommodate every other breach,” she said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. $750,000 Bail U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Fox ordered Aleynikov, who earned $400,000 a year, to be held by on $750,000 bail, after prosecutors claimed he posed a threat to the community. Aleynikov planned to earn three times his salary by joining a startup company and engaging in high-volume automated trading, prosecutors said. Aleynikov posted bail today and was released. Aleynikov didn’t speak at the hearing, except to say that he understood the conditions of his bail. Teza, co-founded by former Citadel trader Misha Malyshev, said in an e-mailed statement that it first learned of the allegations on July 5 and suspended Aleynikov without pay following an investigation. The firm “was not aware of the alleged misconduct” and offered to cooperate with the government, according to the statement. Reverse Engineering “Someone stealing that code is basically stealing the way that Goldman Sachs makes money in the equity marketplace,” said Larry Tabb, founder of TABB Group, a financial-market research and advisory firm. “The more sophisticated market makers -- and Goldman is one of them -- spend significant amounts of money developing software that’s extremely fast and can analyze different execution strategies so they can be the first one to make a decision.” Someone could use the code “to implement the same strategies and maybe on certain stocks they can be faster and, in effect, take away money that would normally be Goldman’s,” Tabb said today in a phone interview. “The second thing that they can do is actually analyze the code so that they know what Goldman’s going to do before Goldman does it and kind of reverse engineer Goldman’s strategies and make money basically at the expense of Goldman.” ‘Wake-Up Call’ Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said proprietary electronic data poses significant risks for all financial institutions. “This is a wake-up call to all financial institutions to review their security systems, not just with respect to trading codes, but with respect to all proprietary information,” said Pitt, now chief executive officer of Kalorama Partners LLC in Washington. Goldman appeared to have taken some steps to prevent the theft of its code, Pitt said. “The real question is whether, in light of this outrageous conduct on the part of one of its employees, it should have taken more steps,” Pitt said. Aleynikov spent four hours with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent after his July 3 arrest, Shroff said. He told the agent that he’d done nothing wrong, authorized prosecutors to seize his personal computers, and said he hadn’t known the server he was using was in Germany, she said. 32 Megabits Only 32 of 1,024 megabits of the software code was transferred, Shroff said. “It is not disseminated,” she said of the code. Facciponti said at the hearing that Aleynikov could disseminate the code “in 10 minutes” using a cell phone. Once the government obtains access to the German server, prosecutors will see if Aleynikov transferred other confidential data as well, he said. It’s logical to conclude that Aleynikov planned to use the code at his new company, the prosecutor said. “This is the most substantial theft that the bank can remember ever happening to it, in the sense the entire platform has been taken from it,” Facciponti said. “There has been no breaches anywhere on this magnitude at the bank.” Aleynikov worked at Goldman from 2007 until June, the government said in the complaint. He was part of a team of workers responsible for improving the computer platform. His alleged transfer of computer codes ran from June 1 to June 5, according to prosecutors. Moscow, Rutgers Aleynikov studied applied mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Transportation Engineering before transferring to Rutgers University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 1993 and a master’s of science degree, specializing in medical image processing and neural networks, in 1996, according to his profile on the social-networking site LinkedIn. Before joining Goldman Sachs, he worked for about eight years at IDT Corp., the U.S. vendor of prepaid calling cards, where he led the team responsible for developing routing systems, according to the profile. His profile on LinkedIn describes him as a vice president in equity strategy at Goldman Sachs and includes two recommendations from colleagues at the firm. Goldman Profit Goldman was the world’s biggest and most profitable securities firm until it converted to a bank in September following the bankruptcy of smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman earned $2.3 billion last year, down from a record $11.6 billion in 2007, as market turmoil caused it to report a fourth-quarter loss, its first in a decade as a public company. Goldman’s equities business generated $2 billion of revenue in the first three months of 2009, down 20 percent from the first quarter of 2008, the company reported in April. Second-quarter results are due to be reported next week. Goldman rose $2.97, or 2.1 percent, to $146.46 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The case is U.S. v.

The Head of investor relations left 3 months ago, because she could no longer lie, about the companies activities and accounting. Both left before any investigation into accounting, or investigation into the manipulation of the stock by hedge funds begins. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley. JP Morgan, Piper Jaffray and many other financial institutions have been colluding to manipulate this stock thru proprietary trading in their hedge funds. Goldman Sachs picked NFLX as their latest Ponzi Scheme, because Reed Hastings is just the perfect Machiavellian con-man. Lloyd Blankfein And Reed Hastings are as thick as thieves. It was Goldman Sachs that forced Facebook executives to add Reed Hasting to their Board of directors, to manipulate the stock price. Reed Hasting is a false Messiah, in league with Goldman Sachs, deceiving Americans, and The indolent regulators who have been paid off by Goldman Sachs. The SEC directors are bribed by Goldman not to do their job, with promises of $4 million a year jobs after they leave the SEC, at banks, the very banks they are supposed to regulate. The SEC is corrupted and compromised by Goldman Sachs, "the Great Deceiver" -------------------- NETFLIX(NFLX) Exposing Inside Enrich Scam by Netflix Insiders and their Wall Street Partners All Watch Dog Agencies in USA will be tested:Do they care for working class Pension?

The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those who are listening to liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: On January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took control of Congress: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies had SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION! Remember that day...? January 3rd, 2007 was the day Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney), for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (but...the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? -- OBAMA!!! And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY!!!! So when someone tries to blame Bush... REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car, but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel while they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets are not passed in the White House. They are passed by Congress, and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. Obama has now gone 1,000 days without a budget, and is still blaming it on the Republicans! In that first year, Congress had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending when Bush, somewhat belatedly, got tough on spending increases. For FY 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed Lame Duck President George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of those massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself and a Democratic Congress. In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is: "I inherited a deficit that I voted for, and then I expanded that deficit four-fold since January 20th 2009."</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1349227557472</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 21:25:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349228165721-189</Id><Title>Just Released, 2007 video showing Obama making troubling racist statements.</Title><Msg>FINALLY, the vetting of O'Loser that was never done.
