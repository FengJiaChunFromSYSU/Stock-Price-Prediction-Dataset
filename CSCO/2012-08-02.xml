I don't think they beat the 5% and here is why. If Chambers comes out and beats 5% growth, as a shareholder I'm going to be more than a little upset about the last 3 months of the shareprice spiraling downward. We lost 25% of our value when Chambers warned of growth 2-5% from the 7% concensus, the sheit will hit the fan if he comes in at 6% growth and we lost all that VALUE in the last 3 months. I do think they will meet or beat the bottom line by a penny and come in at around 4% growth. I think the street will be very happy with that. As usual it will all depend on the outlook, if next quarter continues to look weaker, we are in trouble. I think Chambers says to look for the upper end of 5% growth for next quarter and more optimistic for the remainder of the year. Just my opinion but I will be looking for a spot to sell half my holdings into the run-up over the next 2 weeks and if things look a little brighter on the CC, I will buy HIGHER in the next few days. I think many will be cautious.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1343907896728</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 07:44:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343908891482-9</Id><Topic><Title>CHICK FILLET used to be good.</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1343863964646</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 19:32:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ha ha, looks like just about everyone thinks BOYsurfer is a puffer and an idiot.

Delighted customers mobbed the restaurants to try the zesty new sauce, with many chicken fanciers ordering their sandwiches with extra hate. “It’s so spicy it makes your mouth feel like it’s on fire—like a gay couple in hell,” said Harland Dorrinson, who sampled the sauce at a Chick-fil-A in Orlando. But even as Chick-fil-A prepared to call its new hate sauce an instant hit, it faced a challenge from an upstart rival, Wing-n-nuts. The rival chain, based in Falls Church, Virginia, chose today to introduce a new product targeting Chick-fil-A patrons, the Chicken Bacon Bigotwich. “We think we’re going to take a big bite out of Chick-fil-A’s customer base,” said Wing-n-nuts corporate spokesperson Carol Foyler. “Their founder is anti-gay. But ours is anti-gay, anti-immigrant, and anti-woman. When word gets out about that, there’ll be lines around the block.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1343916171406</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 10:02:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343916358191-24</Id><Title>BLS: UNEMPLOYMENT REVISED UP AGAIN!

The rumor is he got into Occidental by affirmative action, got lousy grades, was stoned as he admitted and missed cut classes. Rush got a call from a person at Harvard that Obama missed classes got lousy grades and that Harvard covered up for him. Of course we can't see Obama's grades, like we can Romney's grades because Romney was so smart he got a Harvard MBA and Law degree at the same time. That's right Romney got two simultaneous degrees from Harvard at once. We saw Obama get sweetheart deals from felons, his wife had a no show job, Obama has multiple social security card, a forged birth certificate, and has managed not to produce his own federal budget in 3.5 years as President. There are about 25 million under or unemployed American workers. Romney may be a RINO but the choice between a man who is smart and a lawyer who gave up his law license rather than show his birth certificate. Romney is successful and doesn't need a teleprompter like stumble, mumble Obama. Romney will also improve race relations, won't play the race card, won't force Christian organizations to pay for abortions and birth control which is IMHO against the separation of church and state. I am not proud of Obama he is laughed about in Italy by their PM, the Brits and Germans don't like him , Lech Walessa endorsed Romney, and Isrealis won't share intel with the USA since Obama spoiled the commando raid on Iran's nuke plants a few months back</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1343943667882</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 17:41:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343944433379-113</Id><Topic><Title>why does obama write books</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1343939637854</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 16:33:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually like all other Obama achievements he didn't do it. Just like he didn't publish law review articles at Harvard, or as a visiting college instructor never published law books or dissertations on legal subjects. Obama was not the author of even his own books. Terrorist Bill Ayers has admitted he wrote them for Obama as his Ghost Author. Computer analysis comparing Ayers own books to the so called Obama biographies shows the same words and phrasing used by Ayers in all his writings. I might add recently that many lies and inconsistencies has been found in the Obama bios. Obama has admitted characters were composites incidents didn't happen. This is a social security number scamming con man, who has spent tens of millions hiding his past. His unsavory dealings with criminals, communists, racists and unrepentant terrorists disgusts Americans and is a disgrace to the Presidency.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1343944433379</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 17:53:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343944833348-114</Id><Topic><Title>Romney paid no taxes</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343930538489</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 14:02:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Everyone knows he is rich.

Also noteworthy is that, when contacted by HuffPo, Romney advisor Kevin Madden didn’t say Reid’s allegation wasn’t true, but that Romney has ”gone above and beyond the disclosure requirements by releasing two years of personal tax returns in addition to the hundreds of pages of personal financial disclosure documents he has provided to the FEC and made public.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343946125016</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:22:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343947111113-116</Id><Title>Quiet board tomorrow</Title><Msg>Surfingforboys, Junior,and DeepdumbivanHarbor will all be together at the Chick-fil-a kiss in .

Democrats were quick to wonder why Romney would even engage Reid on the matter, adding another chapter to this bizarre squabble. But that's not particularly fair to the presumptive Republican nominee, who was asked a direct question about the Reid's insistence that an anonymous investor in Bain Capital told him about Romney's zero tax bill. That said, the put-up-or-shut-up line works both ways. Romney could make the whole issue go away (and make Reid look foolish in the process) by simply releasing more tax returns. The campaign showed no willingness to do that, especially under the terms that Reid's established. But that seems likely to just invite even more speculation.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343947490938</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:44:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343947754696-118</Id><Title>latest polls, bad news for Mitt</Title><Msg>52% have an unfavorable view of Romney 37% positive view 50% have a positive view of Obama</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343947754696</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:49:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343947895136-119</Id><Title>latest Pew Poll</Title><Msg>recognized as the most independent polling company shows Obama with a 10 point lead</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343947895136</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:51:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343948075388-120</Id><Title>Mitt is slipping so fast</Title><Msg>the GOP must be thinking it might make more sense to nominate someone else</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343948075388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:54:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343950084138-121</Id><Title>CSCO</Title><Msg>Keep your messages to CSCO.

The media has focused on prolonged unemployment over 8 percent, while generally downplaying a shocker: the soaring number of people unemployed for more than 6 months. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, back in January 2009 when Barack Obama was sworn in, there were 2.6 million people unemployed for more than 6 months. By June 2012, the ranks of the long-term jobless soared more than 100 percent to 5.3 million. President Obama has promoted long-term unemployment by adopting policies that make it harder and more expensive for employers to hire people. He has relentlessly pushed for higher taxes, higher energy costs, compulsory unionism and, of course, Obamacare. One doesn’t need a Harvard degree to figure out that when government makes hiring more difficult and expensive, there’s likely to be less of it...."
