The ladies of Seneca Falls would be proud. Jen Bendery: "After taking heat for stacking House committee chair posts with all white men in the next Congress, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) appears to have found his binder full of women. Boehner announced Friday that Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) will chair the House Administration Committee -- a committee that Miller wasn't even on until now. 'In her new post, Candice will provide the leadership needed to keep operating costs down, save taxpayer dollars and help lawmakers use new technology to better engage with their constituents,' Boehner said in a statement Friday. Given that Miller wasn't on the committee before, Boehner's move is a fairly transparent response to the criticisms he took -- also from some in his own party -- for failing to tap any women or minorities for committee chair slots. Many called the all-white, all-male lineup of committee chairmanships a bad move, given that Republicans are trying to appeal to both of those groups post-election." Boehner should have maybe thought twice about this: Administration is basically the Housekeeping Committee. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has posted the calendar for the first session of the 113th Congress online. Plentiful vacations and no five-day workweeks and don't give us that crap about how you work when you're at home, cuz we're bloggers and we know better.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354368173947</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 08:22:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354369065282-8</Id><Title>A reverse "Swiftboat" is a commin</Title><Msg>GOP PULLING A REVERSE SWIFTBOAT: SUDDENLY IN LOVE WITH JOHN KERRY - Naturally, they want this formidable political force, known far and wide for his everyman appeal, unparalleled windsurfing abilities and stellar grades at Yale, to represent America's interests abroad.

According to Republicans who leaked the bid, President Obama would cut $4 trillion from the deficit, including $400 billion in Medicare savings and $1.6 trillion in revenue from first ending Bush tax breaks on the top earners, capital gains and dividends, and then tax reform. He also called for action to create jobs in payroll tax cuts, unemployment benefit extensions and $50 billion in infrastructure spending and a new mortgage-refinancing program. Basically the president is asking for exactly what he campaigned on. Watch: Yet according to Talking Points Memo’s Brian Beutler, congressional Republicans dismissed the plan as “outlandish” and “unserious.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly laughed aloud as Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner read him the plan. So what’s the GOP’s plan? On Twitter, House Minority Leader Eric Cantor’s Communications Director Rory Cooper said their plan was a bill that replaced the defense cuts in the sequester with other cuts. The bill was passed in September. What’s happened since then? Oh yeah, as Politico’s Ben White reminded Cooper, we had an election. The GOP likes to point out that the president’s re-election was closer than his election, which isn’t typical — except we haven’t had a president elected in such a landslide in more than half a century. President Obama’s total share of the popular vote is the second highest of any candidate since 1988—trailing only himself. And if Mitt Romney had been elected with 332 electoral votes, you don’t think the GOP would be calling that a landslide? Their pre-election predictions, many of which had him winning even fewer electoral votes, were boldly characterized as such. Meanwhile, the House GOP was re-elected into the majority with only eight members losing their seats. However, they won fewer total votes than Democratic House candidates across the country, and owe their majority to masterful gerrymandering. This isn’t to say the GOP has no advantages when it comes to the current negotiations. They still have to approve raising of the debt ceiling early in 2012. Speaker Boehner has already said that would come with a “price.” More Republicans are calling on the GOP to go over the cliff. And senator Patty Murray (D-WA) had said that Democrats are willing to do the same thing if Republicans won’t give on the Bush tax cuts for the rich. So are we just seeing brinksmanship or does the GOP want to go head to head with a president who has just been re-elected and has the greatest platform in world—his inauguration—just weeks away? We’ll soon find out.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354376032807</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 10:33:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354376716673-15</Id><Topic><Title>I'm furious.....</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354376032807</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 10:33:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama stole the landslide by promising to do what he is trying to do, GOP lost in a landslide by promising to do what they are trying to do.

This is fundamentally unsustainable because low wage workers have far less cash to spend back into the economy to generate corporate revenues. The housing bubble and increasing household debt were an attempt to make up for this. They failed. The sovereign debt bubble is an attempt to make up for this. It will fail. Obamacare is an attempt to make up for this. As you have observed, it is quite inefficient and full of vast negative externalities. Not until there is a substantial raise of the top marginal tax rate which forces corporations to incentize productivity from the lower paid workers, will corporate revenues and earnings be able to return to their proper equilibrium. No other change is needed. Liquidity is not needed. Obamacare is not needed. Entitlements are not needed.

Hitler and his followers set about reorganizing the party as a fanatical mass movement, and won financial backing from business leaders, for whom the Nazis promised an end to labor agitation. In the 1930 election, the Nazis won six million votes, making the party the second largest in Germany. Two years later, Hitler challenged Paul von Hindenburg for the presidency, but the 84-year-old president defeated Hitler with the support of an anti-Nazi coalition. Although the Nazis suffered a decline in votes during the November 1932 election, Hindenburg agreed to make Hitler chancellor in January 1933, hoping that Hitler could be brought to heel as a member of his cabinet. However, Hindenburg underestimated Hitler's political audacity, and one of the new chancellor's first acts was to exploit the burning of the Reichstag (parliament) building as a pretext for calling general elections. The police under Nazi Hermann Goering suppressed much of the party's opposition before the election, and the Nazis won a bare majority. Shortly after, Hitler took on dictatorial power through the Enabling Acts. Chancellor Hitler immediately set about arresting and executing political opponents, and even purged the Nazis' own SA paramilitary organization in a successful effort to win support from the German army. With the death of President Hindenburg on August 2, 1934, Hitler united the chancellorship and presidency under the new title of Fuhrer. As the economy improved, popular support for Hitler's regime became strong, and a cult of Fuhrer worship was propagated by Hitler's capable propagandists.

There is about 30% turnover rate whenever a new economic trend is established. 33% of the the one percent is nouveaux riche, another third is barely hanging on from the last change, and the wealthiest is old money, or just too rich to touch. Most of the nouveaux riche are wild spenders and got there because of risk taking in the stocks, bonds, real estate, or commodities. Some of them got there because of media popularity, ie. the movies, music, sports, and politics. The risk taking or spending eventually puts most of them back into the wannabes.

Selling profits when rates are low, then going on TV to say "tax the rich" when they want to take a capital loss.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1354384209654</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 12:50:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354384474521-29</Id><Topic><Title>WOW !

I suppose we should be permitted to kill the guards if they harm our bodies?</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1354416663151</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 21:51:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354417143001-97</Id><Topic><Title>NEW YORKERS WHINE ABOUT OBAMA EXTREMELY SLOW HURRICANE FEMA RESPONSE</Title><Username>obama_bp_oil_spill_horror</Username><Timestamp>1354325614334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 20:33:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is good to see #$%$ who voted for Obama getting what they deserve.</Msg><Username>black_congressional_cacas</Username><Timestamp>1354417143001</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 21:59:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354417158104-98</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO take a clutch of all to go onward on - rudely active takings</Title><Username>marjorie.carrillo45</Username><Timestamp>1353606548797</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 12:49:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Up to 25 by 2/1-- this is a go.</Msg><Username>brat81us</Username><Timestamp>1354417158104</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 21:59:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354417274712-99</Id><Topic><Title>Elections have consequences.</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1354399058893</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 16:57:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What the Heck has this to do with CSCO-- Find another board for your trash</Msg><Username>brat81us</Username><Timestamp>1354417274712</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 22:01:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354417436903-100</Id><Topic><Title>Elections have consequences.</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1354399058893</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 16:57:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The liberal trash was here first.

Yes, in our great kindness and mercy, we will still pay taxes....however, only STATE TAXES....let the states take on the Fed for us......we are all in favor of abandoning the Unites States in Favor of TexAnada.....a combo nation of Canada, except for the French parts...the French parts can join the rest of the Blue Parasites, but the rest of the MidWest, SouthEast, SouthWest, parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and a few other states like Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennesse will form a MORE PERFECT UNION.......of course the US military will move with us, and we will still buy almonds from Calipornia and watch SOME of their #$%$ movies...all the industry in Calipornia will move to Texas, Tennesse, Oklahoma and Florida...Florida will join the New Union and all Yankees will be exiled to Cuba.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1354417841304</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 22:10:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354417919788-102</Id><Topic><Title>AINT NO #$%$ MANDATE!!!
