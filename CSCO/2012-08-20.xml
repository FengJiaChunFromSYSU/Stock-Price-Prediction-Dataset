Without hesitation she responded with another question that seemed to shock even the most staunch conservatives in the room. “Why should women be paid equal to men? Men have been in the working world a lot longer and deserve to be paid at a higher rate. Heck, I’m a working mom and I’m not paid a dime. I depend on my husband to provide for me and my family, as should most women… and if a woman does work, she should be happy just to be out there in the working world and quit complaining that she’s not making as much as her male counterparts. I mean really, all this wanting to be equal nonsense is going to be detrimental to the future of women everywhere. Who’s going to want to hire a woman, or for that matter, even marry a woman who thinks she is the same, if not better than a man at any job. It’s almost laughable. C’mon now ladies, are you with me on this?”</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345437548353</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 00:39:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345437982037-4</Id><Topic><Title>ANN ROMNEY: WOMEN SHOULD BE PAID LESS</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345437548353</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 00:39:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hilary Rosen was right.

The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those who are listening to liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: On January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took control of Congress: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies had SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION! Remember that day...? January 3rd, 2007 was the day Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney), for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (but...the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? -- OBAMA!!! And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY!!!! So when someone tries to blame Bush... REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car, but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel while they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets are not passed in the White House. They are passed by Congress, and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. Obama has now gone 1,000 days without a budget, and is still blaming it on the Republicans! In that first year, Congress had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending when Bush, somewhat belatedly, got tough on spending increases. For FY 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed Lame Duck President George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of those massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself and a Democratic Congress. In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is: "I inherited a deficit that I voted for, and then I expanded that deficit four-fold since January 20th 2009."</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1345477017136</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 11:36:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345477467319-45</Id><Topic><Title>surfandski and dumbivan: have someone read this to you pecker-woods</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1345477017136</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 11:36:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NO he says YOU and your flithy beast dem party are LOSERS!</Msg><Username>drive1973honda</Username><Timestamp>1345477467319</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 11:44:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345477622823-46</Id><Topic><Title>surfandski and dumbivan: have someone read this to you pecker-woods</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1345477017136</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 11:36:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I expected you to read it that way, why not -- after all you are stupid and incapable of understanding even the simplest things in life.

It's easy to check out, if you don't believe it. Be sure and show it to your kids. They need a little history lesson on what's what and it doesn't matter whether you are Democrat or Republican. Facts are Facts!!! Social Security Cards up until the 1980s expressly stated the number and card were not to be used for identification purposes. Since nearly everyone in the United States now has a number, it became convenient to use it anyway and the message was removed. Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat, introduced the Social Security (FICA) Program. He promised: 1.) That participation in the Program would be completely voluntary, No longer Voluntary 2.) That the participants would only have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program, Now 7.65% on the first $90,000 3.) That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year, No longer tax deductible 4.) That the money the participants put into the independent 'Trust Fund' rather than into the general operating fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other government program, and, Under Johnson the money was moved to the General Fund and spent. 5.) That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income. Under Clinton &amp; Gore up to 85% of your Social Security can be Taxed. Since many of you have paid into FICA for years and are now receiving a Social Security check every month -- and then finding that we are getting taxed on 85% of the money we paid to the federal government to 'put away' -- you may be interested in the following: Q: Which Political Party took Social Security from the independent 'Trust Fund' and put it into the general fund so that Congress could spend it? A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the democratically controlled House and Senate. Q: Which Political Party eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding? A: The Democratic Party. Q: Which Political Party started taxing Social Security annuities? A: The Democratic Party, with Al Gore casting the 'tie-breaking' deciding vote as President of the Senate, while he was Vice President of the US AND MY FAVORITE: Q: Which Political Party decided to start giving annuity payments to immigrants? A: That's right! Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party. Immigrants moved into this country, and at age 65, began to receive Social Security payments! The Democratic Party gave these payments to them, even though they never paid a dime into it! Then, after violating the original contract (FICA), the Democrats turn around and tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away! And the worst part about it is uninformed citizens believe it! If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe changes will evolve. Maybe not, some Democrats are awfully sure of what isn't so. But it's worth a try. How many people can YOU send this to? AND CONGRESS GIVES THEMSELVES 100% RETIREMENT FOR ONLY SERVING ONE TERM!!!</Msg><Username>obvaccdismf</Username><Timestamp>1345482348652</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 13:05:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345482381827-54</Id><Topic><Title>what does obama plan to do if</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345473592646</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 10:39:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes and Obama does hahahahahahahahahahaha mr write books about myself all day and golf while flying air force one to get pizza. all I know is obama has talked about helping them but as it turns out they got screwed again.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345482381827</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 13:06:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345483027270-55</Id><Title>obama thinks he is god</Title><Msg>it is not enough for him to write books about himself all day but now -Obama brought to the White House its first ever official videographer. man mr waste tax payers money to make me the center of the universe.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345483027270</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 13:17:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345483037563-56</Id><Title>Can CSCO hit $19.01 today?</Title><Msg>Seems like CSCO lost all it's momentum?</Msg><Username>iroc88joe1234</Username><Timestamp>1345483037563</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 13:17:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345483149796-57</Id><Title>Dear Obama</Title><Msg>thank you for the healthcare tax hike -middle class.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345483149796</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 13:19:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345483307549-58</Id><Topic><Title>another reason Mitt can't release his tax returns</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1342192896694</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-13 11:21:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>..............</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo8</Username><Timestamp>1345483307549</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 13:21:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345483354292-59</Id><Topic><Title>C'mon- YOU REPUBS would PREFER NEWT in a debate</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1339098096000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-06-07 15:41:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>still true though!</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo8</Username><Timestamp>1345483354292</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 13:22:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345483541879-60</Id><Topic><Title>C'mon- YOU REPUBS would PREFER NEWT in a debate</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1339098096000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-06-07 15:41:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>get back to work you mooch.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345483541879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 13:25:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345483740111-61</Id><Title>more tricks from the professional politician</Title><Msg>By creating "West Wing Week," a weekly video review of what the president has done, Chaudhary and the Obama administration were able to bypass traditional media and go directly to the president's supporters.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345483740111</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 13:29:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345484822820-62</Id><Title>just in obama starts a new book</Title><Msg>about himself. he will make his video guy film him writing it.

LOUIS (The Borowitz Report)—Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin doubled down on his controversial remarks about the female body today, proposing a prominent national security role for the uterus. “From what I understand, there’s nothing that the uterus doesn’t know,” Rep. Akin told a reporter on KTVI-TV. “It’s almost like Spiderman’s spidey sense, if you will, except the tingling goes on down in the lady parts.” Rep. Akin said that given the uterus’s extraordinary powers of detection, the female reproductive system should be America’s secret weapon in the war on terror. “If we posted a uterus at every airport and a bunch of them along the border, I would just love to see an evildoer get past defenses like that,” he said. “Not gonna happen, folks. Nothing fools a uterus.” Rep. Akin closed his interview with what he called “the highest praise and respect” for the female reproductive system. “Not a day goes by that I don’t wish I was as smart as a uterus,” he said. .</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1345489051065</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 14:57:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345489309239-80</Id><Topic><Title>greg/gop says women have a rape swqitch</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1345488831790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 14:53:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The one your mother works in.</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1345489309239</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 15:01:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345489880632-81</Id><Topic><Title>Women's Issues, GOP, Missouri</Title><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1345486553970</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 14:15:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Akins said something really stupid and should get out of the race.

In fact, that amendment is a central part of the Republican Party's platform." It also said that Ryan worked with Akin "to try to pass laws that would ban abortion in all cases, and even narrow the definition of 'rape.'
