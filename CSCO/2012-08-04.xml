That’s what drove the unemployment rate up to 8.3 percent. These two factors virtually cancel out the better-than-expected rise in nonfarm payrolls. By the way, the labor force shrunk by 150,000. The participation rate slipped to 63.7 percent. And the overall U-6 discouraged-workers unemployment rate increased to 15 percent. Average hourly earnings registered a slight 0.1 percent increase. But that only adds up to a 1.7 percent increase year-on-year, which is below the rising consumer price index. So Team Obama will undoubtedly continue to tell us that jobs and the economy are getting better, but this mixed employment report takes the steam out of that argument. A couple of other economic reports coming out this week raise red flags. The ISM manufacturing index came in below 50 for the second straight month, and the ISM services index is barely above 50. (Below 50 signals contraction.) Meanwhile, factory orders fell 0.5 percent and are down 2.6 percent at an annual rate over the past three months. Even worse, core capital-goods orders (non-defense, excluding aircraft) fell 1.7 percent in June and have dropped 3.9 percent annually over the past three months. In other words, business investment is still weak. So are real consumer incomes. And the unemployment rate continues to edge higher. All this springs from an economy growing no more than 1.5 to 2 percent. Tax and regulatory threats are everywhere. From Obamacare and the EPA and the NLRB on the regulatory side, to the failure to extend all the Bush tax cuts, it’s a wonder businesses are investing and hiring at all — especially small businesses, which may have stopped dead in recent month</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1344091190922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:39:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344091321906-26</Id><Topic><Title>WHERE DID THE "ignore this user" LINK GO ?</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344091124094</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:38:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ah #$%$ up crybaby--yahoo is one of your own worthless lib dihksuckers</Msg><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1344091321906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:42:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344091340445-27</Id><Topic><Title>RHONDA WINS IDIOT GOLD...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344089974744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:19:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The hairs in my ahzz are smarter than you JB !!!</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344091340445</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:42:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344091410735-28</Id><Title>"Kiss In" falls flat</Title><Msg>Junior and Surf were the only ones smooching and groping each other last night.....and they weren't even at a Chick-fil-a!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1344091410735</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:43:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344091616960-29</Id><Topic><Title>RHONDA WINS IDIOT GOLD...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344089974744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:19:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for proving my point imbecile!

He is a barrage of contradictions. But he does not give a crap because he knows his supporters ARE THAT STUPID. President Barack Obama's reelection campaign slammed Mitt Romney over women's health issues in a new ad released Saturday. The ad, titled "Important," features on-camera interviews with an array of women to emphasize the significance of access to contraception and funding for Planned Parenthood. It comes just days after the Obama administration's birth control mandate took effect, requiring most employers to provide free birth control coverage in their health insurance policies. "This is not the 1950s," a woman named Alex says in the ad. Later, she adds, "I don't think Mitt Romney can even understand the mindset of someone who has to go to Planned Parenthood." The ad then pivots to the infamous clip of Romney saying he would "get rid of" Planned Parenthood. In an interview earlier this year, while offering a few suggestions on how he would reduce the deficit, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee had said, "Of course you get rid of Obamacare, that's the easy one, but there are others. Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that." Those comments quickly resulted in a firestorm, and Romney walked them back just a few days later. The former Massachusetts governor clarified in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times that he would like to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which is a private organization.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344122040331</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 19:14:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344122444229-55</Id><Topic><Title>FLIP FLOPPING WHIMPIE PILE OF GARBAGE...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344122040331</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 19:14:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wonder why Surf is spending the weekend on the net.Surprised he didn't fly down to Buenos Aires to spend some time in his vacation condo.

What you just said is EXACTLY what the left said prior to the 2010 midterms. Americans have had it with all the lies and hatred out of the far left. Iraq will forever be an issue for debate, many Democrats were on board as was half the world. I personally think many weapons from Iraq went to Syria. As far as spending, Obama has spent more in 3 1/2 years than Bush did in 8. By the way, Democrats and Obama as a Senator had FULL control of congress for the last 2 years of GW Bush's 2nd term. When did everything go DOWNHILL? I think you refuse to look at all the real facts and are a bit blinded. I think you guys don't really think before you repeat the same old tired Iraq war line, we have LOST more soldiers in Afghanistan than the entire Iraq war. We are still there and it is a BIG mess. We killed just as many terrorist in Iraq as we have in Afghanistan. If you are going to rail on Iraq I would think you would show the same disdain for Afghanistan. Starting a conflict in Libya without congressional approval is another thing. GW Bush DID have congressional approval for Iraq.
