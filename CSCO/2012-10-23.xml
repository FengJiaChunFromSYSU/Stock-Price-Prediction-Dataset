The candidates were discussing military spending and Romney had just accused Obama of making harmful cutbacks. The President wheeled out what must have seemed like a great, pre-planned zinger: “I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works. You mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military's changed.” The audience laughed, Obama laughed, I laughed. It was funny. But here’s why it was also a vote loser. For a start, Twitter immediately lit up with examples of how the US Army does still use horses and bayonets (horses were used during the invasion of Afghanistan). More importantly, this was one example of many in which the President insulted, patronised and mocked his opponent rather than put across a constructive argument. His performance was rude and unpresidential. Obama seemed to have a touch of the Bidens, wriggling about in his chair, waving his hands dismissively and always – always – smirking in Romney’s direction. By contrast, Romney sucked up the abuse and retained a rigid poker face all night. He looked like a Commander in Chief; Obama looked like a lawyer. Who would you rather vote for? Aside from the horses and bayonets moment, this was essentially a debate without incident. Part of the fault was the format. It’s interesting to note that Romney won the first debate while standing up and Obama did better in the second when walking around. But when both men were forced to sit for 90 minutes, the energy was inevitably reduced and neither broke through the fourth wall convincingly. Romney had a slight edge because he didn’t use his hands so much: Obama blew his closing statements by developing ultra-energetic conjurer’s hands (“Look at the hands, not at the cards, look at the hands…”) But the bigger problem was that they agreed on the essentials, which were all about foreign policy. Romney refused to tackle Obama directly on Libya (I shouted at the TV that he should, but he just wouldn’t listen) and Fast and Furious seems to have been forgotten by the GOP. In everything else, Obama has become so homicidally neoconservative and Romney so desperately peaceful that they’ve met in the middle on most issues. Both would defend Israel in the event of an attack, both want out of Afghanistan in 2014 and neither would let Iran get the bomb. If you want a real debate on foreign policy, you’re just going to have to wait until Rand Paul gets the nomination in 2020. At times this felt almost as boring as that Gingrich v Huntsman debate that I and about 4 other people watched during the primaries. Romney tried his darnedest to bring everything back to the economy and Obama seemed to say in every answer, “So what we need to do in the Middle East is talk more about how rubbish my opponent is.” It’s almost lucky that Obama isn’t running unopposed in this election because then he’d have nothing to run on at all. Where a disagreement did exist was on the question of leadership; Romney wants to be proactive and Obama pledges to remain reactive. Nevertheless, both seem committed to nation building overseas – with Obama throwing in the caveat that he’d like to do some nation building at home, too. The real difference was in style. In his closing statement – after Obama was done making the Ace of Spades disappear – Romney channelled Reagan by looking straight into the camera and asserting his faith in America. It was empty, sugary stuff that will make liberals sick. But it was infinitely preferable to Obama’s constant, nasty attacks. Sometimes in life, the nice guys do win.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350969110827</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 01:11:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350969186060-8</Id><Topic><Title>UK Telegraph: unbiased poll by the Brits: Romney won being Presidential</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350969110827</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 01:11:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>See public opinion will I think be most favorable to Romney and his lead will grow.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350969186060</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 01:13:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350973551950-9</Id><Title>CNN and CBS: Mittens LOST BIG</Title><Msg>'nuf said!</Msg><Username>hello2bushdepression</Username><Timestamp>1350973551950</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 02:25:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350973697671-10</Id><Topic><Title>Flipped over to MSNBC....They have an ABC poll that says Obama won by 30 points</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1350962498425</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:21:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Also CNN and CBS said the same thing.

We believe InterDigital’s recent successful appeal with Nokia will be an important catalyst with other licensees. - Valuation: IDCC shares trade at over 50 times our 2012 EPS estimate, which does not include upside from potential agreements with Nokia, LG, ZTE, and Huawei (largely because of uncertainty in timing). Combined, these opportunities generate annual incremental EPS of up to $5 per year and current valuation reflects a conservative view of the prospects for resolutions with unlicensed vendors, especially in light of the company’s recent favorable appeal against Nokia . With more than 18,000 patents (following the pending sale of 1,700 patents to Intel), InterDigital is the third-largest holder of 3G patents and second-largest holder of essential 4G patents. The company therefore has a formidable and defensible position in the wireless world. According to TechIPm, the company holds an estimated 19% of all the essential patents for the LTE standard. Other top players in the LTE space include Qualcomm, Nokia, LG, and Samsung. According to TechIPm, by July 2010 roughly 81% of all 4G IPR was shared among these five players.</Msg><Username>patentsaddicted</Username><Timestamp>1350983025198</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 05:03:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350990348913-17</Id><Title>ROMNEY 3rd Home run !</Title><Msg>Oblamo, 3 strikes and OUT !!!</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1350990348913</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 07:05:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350990812765-18</Id><Topic><Title>REPUB philosophy = SOCIALISM among Anglosaxons, but Rape and Kill and Capitalism for others</Title><Username>repubs_r_crooks</Username><Timestamp>1350979151575</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 03:59:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NO PROBLEM If you got rid of the 25-50 million illegals and their SPAWN, and thats the most recent ones, since 1965 more like 50-100 million illegals and their SPAWN.

I said as much in several comments on the blogs I read, and in yesterday's post. I felt Candy Crowley set the topic of Libya perfectly and I wanted Romney to take full advantage of it. I was disappointed when he failed to do so last night. Having said that, it turns out that I underestimated Mitt Romney, when it comes to devising a winning strategy. I did this earlier in the election because I felt Romney wasn't responding to the attacks being leveled by Obama. As a result, Romney was making no headway in the polls and it seemed any chances he had of winning the election were fading. Then came the period after the conventions and leading up to the debate. Little by little, Mitt Romney began moving up in the polls, thanks to his being able to spend more of the money he had raised. On a fateful night in Denver, Mitt Romney was seen by many Americans for the first time, unfiltered by the campaign rhetoric of the Obama campaign and the mainstream media. In that process, Romney lowered the boom on the President and he has gained momentum ever since. I believe if we were privy to the private conversations of the Obama campaign, we would have heard them asking, "where did that come from?". You see, I wasn't the only one to underestimate Mitt Romney. Because of his strong and aggressive performances during the first two debates, I expected Mitt Romney to wade into the weeds of Libya and call out the President on his failure to protect our citizens. I expected him to highlight the ever-changing story that has come out of the Obama administration on the attacks in Libya. There was ample ammunition for him to use and I expected, even wanted, him to use it. He didn't, instead choosing to stay above the fray and as a result, looked entirely more presidential than did the current occupant of the White House. At least one of my fellow bloggers was warning that Obama may have had a trap set on Libya. I pondered in yesterday's post that he might have some new information to share, or some bombshell to drop. If that was indeed the case, Mitt Romney refused to take the bait and by staying out of the weeds of Libya, he may very well have prevented himself from being snakebit and suffering a defeat in the final debate. That could have condemned his campaign to spending the final two weeks of the election playing catchup and trying to repair the damage. Instead, he is still riding the momentum that has built for him since the first debate. As much as I would have liked to see Mitt Romney destroy the President on the actions of his administration in Libya, he was smart enough to let bygones be bygones. In so doing, he may have placed this election firmly in his corner. In closing, I want to share a couple of posts I found during my reading of the debate coverage. First, from John Hayward. This is his final impression of the debate. (Human Events) Those who watched the debate live saw a generally presidential Romney, and a frequently petulant Obama. Those who read about it tomorrow will see Romney’s statements holding up better, in those areas where he sharply disagreed with Obama. Those who primarily care about domestic issues heard Romney talk about changing course, and Obama offering more of the same… mixed with another dose of that curious Empty Chair attitude, in which Obama speaks as though he hasn’t been sitting in the Oval Office for the past four years. Next, I want to turn to T. Christopher Williams. Some commentators and bloggers on the right have problems with Mitt Romney and his being a moderate. Here are three paragraphs that address that. (Republican Redefined) Governor Romney is a moderate. That’s what he was in the Republican primary and that’s what he is today. I may not love it, my fellow right wingers may absolutely hate it, but that is who he is. Plain and simple. He believes growing our economy is job #1, priority #1, and issue #1. I think he views commitments like that in Afghanistan as little more than significant drags on that objective. He sees debt and deficits as substantial obstacles to preparedness for future threats around the world. He sees them as the greatest threat to our national security. On that front, I wholeheartedly agree. I also believe Governor Romney knows full well that women will decide this election and they want nothing to do with continued wars, new interventions, and talk of either. They want to hear about jobs, education, and the economy in this election; and they’d rather change the channel than listen to two grown men shout over one another. And because I trust my gut and because I believe Governor Romney was speaking to the 5-7% of undecided voters in 5-7 states Monday night, I do believe he won the last debate of this presidential cycle convincingly. He was all smiles as the debate went on and the president looked increasingly frustrated. In fairness to the president, foreign policy has long been a strong suit of the Right; not the Left. His strengths on this evening and his successes during his tenure can only earn him favor with those on the Right that have already disqualified him on nearly every other issue. And because of that, it was always going to be Governor Romney’s night. The only chance President Obama had was to disqualify him as a potential Commander-in-Chief. And having failed to do so, he conceded the night to his opponent. I leave you with those words to ponder and debate. Let's see how the final two weeks of the debate goes and reserve judgement on Mitt Romney until we see how he will lead America.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350993935976</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 08:05:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350993984196-31</Id><Topic><Title>UK Telegraph: unbiased poll by the Brits: Romney won being Presidential</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350969110827</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 01:11:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ever since the second presidential debate concluded, I have looked forward to the final debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.

Little by little, Mitt Romney began moving up in the polls, thanks to his being able to spend more of the money he had raised. On a fateful night in Denver, Mitt Romney was seen by many Americans for the first time, unfiltered by the campaign rhetoric of the Obama campaign and the mainstream media. In that process, Romney lowered the boom on the President and he has gained momentum ever since. I believe if we were privy to the private conversations of the Obama campaign, we would have heard them asking, "where did that come from?". You see, I wasn't the only one to underestimate Mitt Romney. Because of his strong and aggressive performances during the first two debates, I expected Mitt Romney to wade into the weeds of Libya and call out the President on his failure to protect our citizens. I expected him to highlight the ever-changing story that has come out of the Obama administration on the attacks in Libya. There was ample ammunition for him to use and I expected, even wanted, him to use it. He didn't, instead choosing to stay above the fray and as a result, looked entirely more presidential than did the current occupant of the White House. At least one of my fellow bloggers was warning that Obama may have had a trap set on Libya. I pondered in yesterday's post that he might have some new information to share, or some bombshell to drop. If that was indeed the case, Mitt Romney refused to take the bait and by staying out of the weeds of Libya, he may very well have prevented himself from being snakebit and suffering a defeat in the final debate. That could have condemned his campaign to spending the final two weeks of the election playing catchup and trying to repair the damage. Instead, he is still riding the momentum that has built for him since the first debate. As much as I would have liked to see Mitt Romney destroy the President on the actions of his administration in Libya, he was smart enough to let bygones be bygones. In so doing, he may have placed this election firmly in his corner. In closing, I want to share a couple of posts I found during my reading of the debate coverage. First, from John Hayward. This is his final impression of the debate. (Human Events) Those who watched the debate live saw a generally presidential Romney, and a frequently petulant Obama. Those who read about it tomorrow will see Romney’s statements holding up better, in those areas where he sharply disagreed with Obama. Those who primarily care about domestic issues heard Romney talk about changing course, and Obama offering more of the same… mixed with another dose of that curious Empty Chair attitude, in which Obama speaks as though he hasn’t been sitting in the Oval Office for the past four years. Next, I want to turn to T. Christopher Williams. Some commentators and bloggers on the right have problems with Mitt Romney and his being a moderate. Here are three paragraphs that address that. (Republican Redefined) Governor Romney is a moderate. That’s what he was in the Republican primary and that’s what he is today. I may not love it, my fellow right wingers may absolutely hate it, but that is who he is. Plain and simple. He believes growing our economy is job #1, priority #1, and issue #1. I think he views commitments like that in Afghanistan as little more than significant drags on that objective. He sees debt and deficits as substantial obstacles to preparedness for future threats around the world. He sees them as the greatest threat to our national security. On that front, I wholeheartedly agree. I also believe Governor Romney knows full well that women will decide this election and they want nothing to do with continued wars, new interventions, and talk of either. They want to hear about jobs, education, and the economy in this election; and they’d rather change the channel than listen to two grown men shout over one another. And because I trust my gut and because I believe Governor Romney was speaking to the 5-7% of undecided voters in 5-7 states Monday night, I do believe he won the last debate of this presidential cycle convincingly. He was all smiles as the debate went on and the president looked increasingly frustrated. In fairness to the president, foreign policy has long been a strong suit of the Right; not the Left. His strengths on this evening and his successes during his tenure can only earn him favor with those on the Right that have already disqualified him on nearly every other issue. And because of that, it was always going to be Governor Romney’s night. The only chance President Obama had was to disqualify him as a potential Commander-in-Chief. And having failed to do so, he conceded the night to his opponent. I leave you with those words to ponder and debate. Let's see how the final two weeks of the debate goes and reserve judgement on Mitt Romney until we see how he will lead America.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350993984196</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 08:06:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350994069109-32</Id><Topic><Title>Romney won, from a womans point of view</Title><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1350960317752</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 22:45:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ever since the second presidential debate concluded, I have looked forward to the final debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.

John McCain (R-Ariz) said the president is "not a dictator yet," expressing surprise over the president's prediction during the debate that sequestration "will not happen." "I was astonished, I almost fell out of my chair when the president said, 'Don't worry, sequestration won't happen.' We've been begging the president to sit down with us to avoid what his own secretary of defense said would be a devastating blow to our national security. He just said, 'Don't worry, sequestration won't happen.' He's not a dictator yet," Other Republicans piled on as well with attacks about what they called wasted months in which Obama hasn’t negotiated with lawmakers over a way to avert sequestration. "It is a nice line, but for more than a year the president hasn't lifted a finger to avert the crisis,” said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) “Instead, his policies and positions have increased uncertainty for our troops and the men and women who support them. The effects of sequestration can already be felt. Jobs have already been lost. The president and his party in the Senate have failed to offer even a single real solution that could resolve sequestration. If the president is determined that these cuts won't happen, why has he drug it out this long?” Obama created the fiscal cliff so he can be more flexible with commie buddy Putin after the election.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350996990707</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 08:56:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350997320639-50</Id><Topic><Title>a few teabillys are trying to pretend romney won....</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350997264461</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just to funny, LOL even Beck says Mitt was a disaster, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350997320639</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:02:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350997470808-51</Id><Title>never have i seen so much division in gov</Title><Msg>and between the american people. good job obama pit us against one another.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1350997470808</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:04:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350997604902-52</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO possibly will end up being the company to view this quarter.</Title><Username>singletonrobert11</Username><Timestamp>1350580313152</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 13:11:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am grateful I was really scouting for some thing like this type of thing.</Msg><Username>gibsonyvonne44</Username><Timestamp>1350997604902</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:06:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350997848826-53</Id><Title>FINAL TALLY: OBAMA 2 ROMNEY 1</Title><Msg>MITT LEFT SO MANY QUESTIONS UNANSWERED !</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1350997848826</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:10:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350997898077-54</Id><Title>MITT SAYS HE'LL PULL OUT OF AFGHANISTAN by 2014 ....

Asked what that "job" was, McConnell explained that "the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president." That remark drew the ire of several White House officials. At his daily briefing, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the last thing voters will want after this hard-fought campaign is more non-stop politics in Washington. "There's time for a political campaign now, and there will be time in two years for a presidential campaign. But in the days, in the weeks, in the months after this campaign, the message that voters are going to send and the message that we as elected officials should take is that of working together," he said. Gibbs noted that in an interview with the same publication, Obama talked about wanting to work cooperatively with Republicans next year.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350999132142</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:32:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350999407287-61</Id><Title>Romney pretending to be Obama</Title><Msg>really can't tell them apart now, Romney has etch a sketched himself into a liberal now, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350999407287</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:36:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350999661140-62</Id><Title>CSCO Breakout!</Title><Msg>Break out Stocks with Massive GAINS!

When the presumptive GOP nominee referred to Syria as Iran’s “route to the sea” during the Arizona GOP debate in February, we figured it was just a slip of the tongue. But then a reader counted at least five times in which Romney has used this phrase, including in the Feb. 22 debate, at last month’s American Israel Public Affairs Committee annual conference, in a TV interview (MSNBC, Dec. 21), on the radio (Kilmeade &amp; Friends, Feb. 14) and even in a Washington Post interview (Feb. 10).

Is that why he changed his name? Most likely, Trump has proof that Obama got into college as a foreign exchange student named Barry Soetoro who was adopted by a white woman in Hawaii. He changed his name to Obama and had Bill Ayers write a book to conceal his past. Barry cremated his "mother" and "grandmother" right after the election and tossed their ashes into the ocean so there would be no way to prove he was not genetically related to his adopted mother. The doctor that delivered him is conveniently dead. There is no record of his mother delivering a baby in Hawaii. If you are going to lie, you make it a big lie... like a whole new life history (e.g. how the diplomats got out of Iran in the movie Argo.) Why would someone who has done nothing write an autobiography other than to plant it so that people read the book to figure out who he was.... a Manchurian candidate. He was unknown and undistinguished as a politician in Illinois. Illinois is full of dumb libs who vote for anyone who gets their name on a ballot as a Dem, regardless of whether they can do the job. For example, Jesse Jackson Jr. has done nothing for months and is in the Mayo Clinic for severe mental problems. He has not done his job or campaigned yet his wife is pulling down a salary as a campaign worker. American libs are too easily scammed by politicians.

Mitt Romney's Stunning turnaround in these past 3 debates Obama has lost support among Jewish women voters. Most Jews are Turn Against Obama across the 50 states, A Jewish Women Focus Group of 7,890 on October 22, 2012 President Obama Was arrogant, angry, disrespectfully, condescending and much to aggressive, did not look very presidential at all. Governor Mitt Romney looked much more presidential, ready to be commander-in-chief. America he said, needs a strong economy in order to have a strong military for our National Security now and in the future. We came away from this debate with a very good impression of Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ a safe pair of hands.” We feel he’s tough enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Romney did not attack President Obama's policies, he simply pointed out a few improvements in a respectable way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney seemed more like the president and Barack Obama more like the candidate and challenger. Governor Mitt Romney was calm, thoughtful, relaxed, steady and looked very presidential. He looked and acted ready to take the job as commander-in-chief. Expressed his views on Iran's Nuclear threat and the USA support of Israel, our good friend and ally. He impressed us tonight, in that a vote for him is a vote for American security, peace and safety, a strong economy, a strong military, millions of higher paying jobs, prosperity and quiet peaceful life for us and our families. The world is much to scary these days; Americans aren’t looking for a scary weak president. Tonight we came away with the feeling that President Obama is more the scary one, in America's weaken relationship with Israel, a closer to Nuclear Iran, our weak economy and the huge 16 Trillion Dollars in Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. We can not afford four more years of president Obama's spending and borrowing another 5 or 6 trillion dollars from countries like China. Our jewish women's focus group therefore endorse Governor Mitt Romney for the next president of the United States of America. Obama's Re-Election is very questionable.

It claims the president created 5.2 million new jobs. The total number of jobs added is actually about 325,000. It depends on when you start counting. If you wait until sometime in mid-2009 after all the 8 million layoffs caused by Obama's election were done, then 5.2 million lower paying and part time jobs were created since mid 2009. Net job gain is barely 200,000 new jobs. Meanwhile the U.S. population has grown by at least 5 million during Obama's term so there are more people without jobs now than when he started. The frightening thing is Obama thinks he did a good job. He has handlers around him that pump him up. Obama's circle of true believers have kept him in a bubble and permanently tuned his TV to MSNBC.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351026586467</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 17:09:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351026645018-214</Id><Topic><Title>Oblablah's 'Blueprint for America'</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1351026226666</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 17:03:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He'll blame it all on Obama.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351026645018</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 17:10:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351026665160-215</Id><Title>I WATCHED A RERUN THE DEBATE AT NOON TODAY...</Title><Msg>Obama took Willard to school.

The photos, taken at Frank Marshall Davis' house in Honolulu, appeared in Bizarre Life, Exotique, Secret Pleasures, and Battling Babes. They help illustrate the intimate relationship between Dunham and Davis. Obama's version of his early childhood is false - the family did not split up when the Kenyan Obama went to Harvard as he claimed. In fact, Ann Dunham took "Barry" to Seattle a few weeks after his birth (late August 1961), and began studies at the University of Washington, while the Kenyan remained in Hawaii. All evidence points to a "sham" marriage to cover up an illicit affair with Frank. Barack Obama began regular visits to Frank Marshall Davis' house at the age of 10, and Obama refers to Frank Marshall Davis throughout his autobiography as his childhood "mentor." Dreams from My Real Father makes the case that the Communist Party USA propagandist was both Obama's biological and ideological father, and likely indoctrinated Obama in Marxism during his formative years. Barry Soetoro doesn't look anything like Barack Obama Sr. He has the same facial features and hair as Frank Marshall Davis.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351029864426</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 18:04:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351030673805-229</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH CSCO ANALYST REPORT</Title><Username>danwilliam291</Username><Timestamp>1350653652093</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 09:34:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BUY</Msg><Username>wbrandon329</Username><Timestamp>1351030673805</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 18:17:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351030888827-230</Id><Topic><Title>Newt has the best Ideas and Romney should adopt them</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1332735685000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-03-26 00:21:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I stand by those ideas, and apparently Romney listened to Nute, on drilling, reparations, and cutting cap gains tax.

But that's not proof of anything. It takes two to tango, as they say, and in order for Frank Marshall Davis to be Obama's father, then Stanley Ann Dunham, as a very young girl (she got pregnant at 17) must have been having sex with the much older Davis. Davis turned the condom inside out after he was done and gave it to Barack Sr. She was a wild child. Barry was delivered by a mid wife. That's why Obama is so hot on nurses and ha*tes doctors.

Kudlow (or "Kuddles," as his friends nicknamed him in the '70s) clearly has an addictive personality, and he's incredibly susceptible to fads. While campaigning for Democrat Joseph Duffey (with a young Bill Clinton!) Kudlow (along with everyone else) smoked "reefer" constantly. In late 1980, the longtime registered Democrat and "monetarist" became a dedicated supply-sider "overnight." This landed him a job in the Reagan administration. (In 1995, as a rehabbing Kuddles contemplated becoming a Roman Catholic, a friend described the discredited economic theory as just another "religion" in Kudlow's life.) We've no problem with a bit of recreational drug use—drugs are fun, after all!—but Kudlow spent "tens of thousands of dollars a month" on lengthy binges.

Some of this training takes place on the Bayonet Assault Course, upon which Marines are unleashed to bayonet everything in sight. Learning proficiency in basic bayoneting techniques is part of qualifying for a tan belt, which is required of every recruit. Marines are expected to learn to attach and remove the bayonets from their rifles quickly, so that they might swiftly initiate a charge. While the bayonet dates to the 17th century, it has evolved through technological innovations over the years. In 2003, the Marine Corps replaced its standard-issue bayonet with a longer, sharper model, the OKC-3S. The new model, designed by New York's Ontario Knife Co., was also more effective when brandished as a hand knife - not to mention more ergonomically correct. Perhaps more vitally, the blades were also better able to pierce body armor, a concern particular to modern warriors. More than 120,000 bayonets were commissioned to supply one to each Marine, at an estimated price of $36.35 each, or $4,362,000 total. In addition to potential use in hand-to-hand combat, bayonets are said to be useful for keeping prisoners under control and for "poking an enemy to see whether he is dead." The Marines aren't the only branch of the military to equip its soldiers with bayonets. The Army issues the M9 bayonet knife, which has been in use since the 1980s, but troops have moved away from the detachable knives in recent years. In 2010, the Army began to scale back on bayonet drills in favor of calisthenics, perhaps a wise move given that the soldiers rarely carry bayonets on their rifles, and since the last U.S. bayonet charge was in 1951. Others, however, have still found use for the bayonet charge in recent years. Just last month a British soldier was honored for a bayonet charge on the Taliban that he led in 2011. This charge was reminiscent of another British bayonet charge in Basra, Iraq, in 2004. In 2011, Col. Moammar Gadhafi was also reportedly killed by a bayonet stab to the rear. Obama is the Chief Clown not the Commander in Chief. He doesn't know what his soldiers are doing.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351045894847</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:31:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351046296211-280</Id><Title>EMPTY SUIT POTUS DONT KNOW THAT HORSES STILL USED BY MILITARY</Title><Msg>Empty suit potus who called gi's corpse men - does not know that horses are still used by military what do you expect from a draftdodger illegal alien with a bogus bc?</Msg><Username>who_eats_collard_greens</Username><Timestamp>1351046296211</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:38:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351046892806-281</Id><Topic><Title>NASTY DEMOCRAT CROWD TERORIZE 9 YEAR OLD GIRL( FOR SUPPORTING ROMNEY)</Title><Username>general_colin_bowels</Username><Timestamp>1351045608848</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:26:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It depends on who the democrats are.

Body language of blinking: When reading the body language or nonverbal communication of others one of the items that may identify deceit, lies, stress or even medical conditions is blinking. The action of blinking happens naturally and you can easily make mistakes when it comes to interpreting what blinking means. There are some actions that people really cannot control that perform necessary functions and blinking is one of them. This action keeps the eyes moisturized but also protects the eyes from debris and bright lights. The average person blinks every 3-12 seconds and that can work out to 8-10 blinks per minute unless under stress or medical conditions. Under stress, while fabricating or while lying the rate of blinking may increase. Body language of blinking and lying One common mistake that people make when reading the body language of a boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife is that they are too quick to believe that excessive blinking is a definite sign of lying. One of the signs of deception and or lying can be excessive blinking and through plenty of misinformation it’s an automatic belief in some it means lying. Now it may also be that the man or woman is under stress. You will have to be careful and baseline the person that you are examining to look for traits that would lead you to understand if it is a lie that is causing the blinking or jest the stress of being questioned. You will also want to take a look at the micro expressions that a man or woman has because if the person does not know about the accusations they should show surprise. As a man or woman lies they may have a cluster of body language actions that happen when they start to deceive or fabricate. There may be touching of the face, excessive licking of the lips, a change in the breathing patterns, lack of eye contact, a long rub or stroke of a body part like the arm or leg. With these clusters you may notice that the blink rate would increase. This is where you would want to start questioning the story of what is going on if there is a combination of these items going on. It could be either be the stress of the encounter or the fact that the man or woman is lying and in some instances it could be both. Just take your time before you make a judgment.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1351050144640</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 23:42:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351050655081-288</Id><Topic><Title>I WATCHED A RERUN THE DEBATE AT NOON TODAY...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1351026665160</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 17:11:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well of course you watched tv at noon, you have no job--did you just wake up you welfare khok-sucking slug?
