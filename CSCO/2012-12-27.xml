Bullet added that had even one of the 20 dead children been armed, they could have stopped the attacker in his tracks and proved the importance and sanctity of the Second Amendment and "open carry" and "concealed carry" laws nationwide. Bullet further suggested that given the short attention spans of most Ritalin-addled kids these days, there's no need to train the first graders how to react during an attack beyond telling them to "just shoot the bad man". (Note: The amended media release from the lobbyists replaced the word "black" with "bad, jauntily adding, "my bad".) The proposed First Grader's First Gun will be an automatic with the default setting being "Empty the Mag" so that although it's bullets will be small-calibre, the rapid ripple-fire of the entire mag will offset the calibre and whatever the kid points it at first will be distracted from his goal of mass murder. If several students engage the attacker, then maybe they'll kill him before he kills many of them. Bullet stated that the "gun culture" decried recently by that "pansy" Bob Costas needs to be nurtured from an early age and Friday's incident is a golden opportunity to tell America and the world why that gun culture is so necessary. While Bullet didn't say necessary for what, one of his minions issued a clarification stating that he meant the gun culture is necessary for the continuance of pro-gun lobbyists, of Bullet's near-million-dollar annual salary, and of his "I'm the NRA" ad campaign. He added that if it weren't for these high-profile incidents, the right to bear arms would be forgotten and the self-preservation of pro-gun groups and fundraising would drop precipitously.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1356638738018</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 15:05:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356638881908-132</Id><Title>we are still going over the cliff!!!!!</Title><Msg>Sorry folks, Boehner can't pass anything before Jan 3rd.

Republicans have relentlessly harangued the Senate's Democratic leadership for failing to pass a budget resolution. "1,000 days without a budget," was the title of a typical missive last month. On the weekend Jack Lew, who has just been named Barack Obama's chief of staff after serving as his budget director, defended the Senate by saying it couldn't pass a budget without 60 votes, i.e. without the cooperation of some Republicans. Republicans jumped on Mr Lew, pointing out that under Congress' budget procedure, a budget resolution cannot be filibustered and thus only needs a simple majority vote - typically 51 votes - to pass. Glenn Kessler, The Washington Post's fact checker, awarded Mr Lew four Pinocchios, the top score, for fibbing. In fact, Mr Lew, while wrong on the narrow wording, is right on the substance. It is true that the Senate can pass a budget resolution with a simple majority vote. But for that budget resolution to take effect, it must have either the cooperation of the house, or at least 60 votes in the Senate. Only someone intimately familiar with Parliamentary procedure can explain this. Jim Horney of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is such a person. The following are his edited remarks from our email conversation: It's true that you cannot filibuster a budget resolution in the Senate, because the Budget Act provides special rules for consideration of a budget resolution, including a time limit on debate. So the Senate can pass a resolution with only a majority vote. However, the resolution does not take effect when the Senate passes it. It takes effect in one of two ways: if the House and Senate pass an identical resolution, usually in the form of a conference report; or if the Senate passes a separate Senate Resolution (as opposed to a concurrent resolution, which is what a budget resolution is) that says the House is “deemed” to have agreed to the budget resolution passed by the Senate. But there are no special procedures for the simple Senate Resolution required by this second, “deeming” process, so it is subject to the unlimited debate allowed on almost everything in the Senate. If you do not have the support of 60 Senators to invoke cloture and end a filibuster, or prevent a filibuster from even starting (because everyone knows 60 Senators support cloture), you cannot pass such a deeming resolution in the Senate.Because its rules are different, the House with a simple majority can pass a resolution deeming that the House and Senate have agreed to the House resolution so that it can take effect. This means the allocations in the resolution, such as for appropriations, are in effect in the House and anybody can raise a point-of-order against legislation that would cause a committee to exceed its allocation. But this is for purposes of enforcement in the House only. What the House does has no effect whatsoever on the Senate or its budget enforcement. And vice versa, if the Senate deems that its budget resolution has been agreed to. Does the lack of a budget resolution matter? Jim notes that budget resolutions are supposed to set limits on discretionary spending in appropriations bills and facilitate changes in taxes and entitlements via reconciliation instructions or via allocations to authorizing committees. But nowadays, discretionary spending caps have already been set by the Budget Control Act (which ended the debt ceiling standoff) and there is little or no prospect of cross-party agreement on tax or entitlement policies. Moreover: With the exception of reconciliation legislation, it effectively takes 60 votes to consider any legislation in the Senate so it really does not matter whether the resolution has been adopted; if you have 60, you can consider the legislation, if you don't, you can't. The bottom line is the budget process set out in the Budget Act works pretty well when the Congress can agree on budget policies. When they cannot, no process in the world can make things work smoothly, but Congress muddles through and does what absolutely has to be done (like keeping the government from shutting down or defaulting on the debt). Not having a budget resolution in place is a symptom of the inability to reach agreement – not the cause of Congress not being able to accomplish things. So yes, the Senate could pass a budget resolution, but without the cooperation of the house or 60 votes, that resolution would not take effect; it would be an empty gesture. The fact that the House managed to pass a budget last year, including a major overhaul of Medicare, reflects its different rules that allow it to deem the budget resolution to have taken effect. But it didn't ultimately matter: the provisions in its budget, including the Medicare changes, were not binding on the Senate.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356643597927</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 16:26:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356643837998-165</Id><Topic><Title>Problem for the GOP is things are pretty complex so teabaggers can't understand them, this from the economist for those with better then average IQ's baggers shouldn't waste their time it would be like trying to understand calculus</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356643597927</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 16:26:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So basically, what your saying is Reid is a #$%$, and isn't brave enough to consider passing the Budget without 60 votes.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1356643837998</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 16:30:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356644069426-166</Id><Topic><Title>Problem for the GOP is things are pretty complex so teabaggers can't understand them, this from the economist for those with better then average IQ's baggers shouldn't waste their time it would be like trying to understand calculus</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356643597927</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 16:26:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>told you in advance you wouldn't understand the article, but if you want to go back and try and sound out this sentence.

With members such as the late Strom Thurmond of South Carolina being part of Senate lore with filibusters, lawmakers once actually had to stand on the floor and talk all day and all night to keep debate going. That naturally limited filibusters. In the last decade, however, filibusters haven’t worked that way. The Senate allows “silent” filibusters to force the majority to assemble 60 votes to cut off debate and move legislation. In the words of The Sacramento (Calif.) Bee, “These ‘pseudo-filibusters,’ or ‘obstructionism on the cheap,’ have turned the filibuster from a tool of last resort to a regular part of Senate procedure. … No longer do senators attempt to put together a majority coalition to carry the day. They threaten filibusters and the business of the Senate grinds to a halt.” There will be kicking and screaming from Republicans and likely even some resistance from Democrats, but Reid should get enough support to put “filibustering” back into the filibuster. The 60-vote requirement should be retained to end a filibuster, but if a senator is going to delay the process, he or she should have to physically do so by holding the floor and talking. “I think the rules have been abused, and we are going to work to change them,” Reid has said. “We will not do away with the filibuster, but we will make the Senate a more meaningful place. We are going to make it so we can get things done.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356646649098</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 17:17:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356647005603-185</Id><Title>Reid the leader of mice and chilren</Title><Msg>Apple CEO's pay takes big hit vs. record '11 package...headline reads.

Some examples: - Cost of postal stamps up 40% this year. - Heating up 10% or so this winter (similar increases last year). - Train ticket prices up on average 10% per year. Everything that people use daily goes up and up, while the economy stagnates. This is not surprising as money printing has never fixed any economy in the history of the world - there is not a single example. The BOE has some concerns about inflation getting totally out of hand of course. Of course, all that inflation is caused by money printing. Time to raise taxes and pull back on spending. Obama got re-elected so the timing for a recession isperfect. The rest of the world's major economies are in recession (Japan, England, France, Germany, most of Europe.) We need a double-dip recession now to set up for 3-5 good years ahead.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1356650132891</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 18:15:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356650266115-196</Id><Title>Obama Fan SHARPTON would rather arm DRUG CARTELS then Our schools !?</Title><Msg>Where are the libs priorities ???

The poll also found that views of the gun advocacy group were more positive among gun owners, although owners said the NRA did not always reflect their views. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the Gallup survey said they held a mostly favorable or very favorable view of the NRA, while 38 percent said they had a mostly unfavorable or very unfavorable view of the organization. That is down from a high of 60 percent favorability in 2005, but still far above the low of 42 percent recorded in 1995. Eighty-three percent of Republicans, and 71 percent of gun owners, also had a favorable view of the group, while 36 percent of Democrats and 40 percent of none-gun owners saw the NRA in a favorable light. At least half the respondents in the poll said that the NRA “only sometimes” or “never” reflected their views on guns, whether or not a member of the household owns a firearm. Among gun owners, however, 50 percent of those participating in the poll said the group sometimes reflects their opinions. Gallup conducted the poll of 1,038 people between Dec. 19 to 22 — after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., which left 26 people dead, but before the ambush killing of firefighters near Rochester, N.Y.

When confronted they blamed someone else, out of respect you change those who report to him/ her and even give them the ability to pick many advisors with expertise in areas they may not know much about. How long would you allow this before getting someone else to get the job done? Blaming is not a result. Why would we tolerate this kind of behavior from a politician? It has been almost five years without a budget, twice we have been at a"fiscal cliff". Our credit rating has been downgraded...all of these are a first time in American history. What has stayed constant through all of this? 4 years of broken promises ridiculous debt and spending when does it stop?
