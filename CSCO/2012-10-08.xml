The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those wh... o are listening to liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: On January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took control of Congress: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies had SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION! Remember that day...? January 3rd, 2007 was the day Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney), for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (but...the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? -- OBAMA!!! And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY!!!! So when someone tries to blame Bush... REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car, but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel while they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets are not passed in the White House. They are passed by Congress, and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. Obama has now gone 1,000 days without a budget, and is still blaming it on the Republicans! In that first year, Congress had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending when Bush, somewhat belatedly, got tough on spending increases. For FY 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed Lame Duck President George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of those massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself and a Democratic Congress. In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is: "I inherited a deficit that I voted for, and then I expanded that deficit four-fold since January 20th 2009."</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1349687021068</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 05:03:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349687884427-5</Id><Topic><Title>House Intelligence Committee warning against Huawei &amp; ZTE Corp</Title><Username>davidj_sd</Username><Timestamp>1349671486717</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 00:44:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Translation, CISCO back doors in hardware and software made in CHINA !</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1349687884427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 05:18:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349687973911-6</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA, PELOSI AND REID CONTROLLED EVERYTHING FOR 2 YEARS</Title><Username>high_falutin_heifers</Username><Timestamp>1349665369826</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 23:02:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All they have is Racism, Lies, blame and cheating</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1349687973911</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 05:19:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349688217095-7</Id><Title>Romney has pledged to</Title><Msg>Open our own oil fields, coal mines and rein in EPA That's our Man! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Let's get back to work and let people feed themselves!</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1349688217095</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 05:23:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349693129551-8</Id><Topic><Title>Romney has pledged to</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1349688217095</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 05:23:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>America spends 1.5 billion dollars a day to purchase foreign oil and this is bankrupting our country.

This follows an earlier mailing last month, in which Gilbert sent 1.38 million DVDs of “Dreams from My Real Father” to households in swing state Ohio and an additional 100,000 to New Hampshire and 80,000 to Nevada. Joel Gilbert’s “Dreams from My Real Father” is available at WND’s Superstore Gilbert told WND the direct mail program is aimed at bypassing the mainstream media blackout on his film. “It’s shocking that in the land of the First Amendment, in the ‘information age’ no less, a state of censorship exists on so many levels in the American media today,” Gilbert said. By mailing millions of DVDs to households in swing states, Gilbert aims to get his message heard despite the media blackout: “As long as the major media refuse to cover my film, we are going to continue this publicity campaign by shipping DVDs state-by-state, million-by-million, until the media covers the findings in ‘Dreams from My Real Father.’” Gilbert argues in the documentary that Frank Marshall Davis, the radical poet and journalist who was a card-carrying member of the Communist Party USA, was the real, biological and ideological father of Barack Obama, not Barack Obama, the Kenyan, who came from Africa in 1959 to attend the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. “Barack Obama built his political career on personal appeal – the son of a Kenyan goat herder who stood above politics,” he explained. “However, ‘Dreams from My Real Father’ demonstrates that Obama has a deeply disturbing family background, which he intentionally obscured, to hide a Marxist political foundation. Dreams from My Real father is the story Barack Obama should have told, revealing his true agenda for ‘fundamentally transforming America.’” The logic behind the direct mail campaign Gilbert stressed to WND that his DVD has been at the top of the charts since first released. “My ‘Dreams from My Real Father’ DVD has been the No. 1 documentary on Amazon for weeks,” Gilbert told WND. “However, the mainstream media is still refusing to cover the film, so it remains hard to break through nationally.” Gilbert told WND the mainstream media has shut out coverage of his film to prevent the American people from seeing the research he assembled over two years aimed at showing the official Obama nativity story is a fabrication. “Another reason the mainstream media is reluctant to cover my findings is because it would expose the media as not having done their jobs investigating Obama’s background,” he explained. DVD copies of 'Dreams from My Real Father' “Barack Obama must now come clean,” Gilbert insisted. “Instead of misrepresenting himself as he did in 2008, Obama should say, ‘My father was a Communist Party propagandist and suspected Soviet agent who indoctrinated me into Marxist ideology in my formative years. Please vote for me so I can destroy the American middle class and create a one-party political system.’” Gilbert stresses the extensive research backing the claims made in his film. “I have been to Hawaii twice researching Obama’s inspiring family story of a Kenyan goat herder father. That is twice as many times as all of the mainstream media combined! Who could have imagined that news organizations with hundreds of reporters, and multi-million dollar budgets, wouldn’t investigate a presidential candidate’s background in 2008 and would ignore doing so again in 2012?” His research extended to examine Chicago and the roots of the Frank Marshall Davis ideology. “Davis joined the Communist party in Chicago, only 15 years after the Bolshevik Revolution,” Gilbert said. “You can hear the classic Marxism in Obama’s campaign, the ‘top 1 percent oppressing the 99 percent,’ and ‘you didn’t build your business, it was done on the backs of the proletariat,’ and so on. Marxism is a failed ideology that has no basis in fact in the American reality where the middle class has prospered and the issue of poverty is taken seriously.” Gilbert told WND he believes the publicity resulting from the mailing of 2.7 million DVDs to Florida, Colorado and Iowa, following his September mailing of 1.38 million to Ohio, New Hampshire and Nevada will help “Dreams from My Real Father” remain relevant for years, whether or not Obama is reelected. “The president of the United States promoted a false family background to hide a Marxist political foundation he received from his real father, a Communist Party USA propagandist,” he said. “I think this should be a major news story of the young century, an example of investigative journalism by a grassroots film production company versus a corrupt and lazy mainstream media. The mainstream media would not do their jobs, so I did it for them.” Plan: Mail millions of DVDs Gilbert understands that getting the American public to understand the official Obama nativity story is a fabrication will not be an easy task to accomplish. “Obama’s election was not a sudden political phenomenon,” he explains. “It was the culmination of an American socialist movement that Frank Marshall Davis nurtured in Chicago and Hawaii, and has been quietly infiltrating the U.S. economy, universities and media for decades.” Gilbert told WND plans are in the works to send millions more DVDs of “Dreams from My Real Father” across the nation. Worker prepares to mail out 'Dreams from My Real Father' “Immediate plans are in place to extend the free DVD mailer publicity program state by state, million by million, until the mainstream media covers it,” Gilbert stressed. Gilbert said he was planning next on a million DVDs being mailed to Pennsylvania, Virginia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois. “We can manufacture and ship 1 million DVDs per day out of Southern California,” he explained. “In the meantime, the 2.7 million DVD mailing to Florida, Colorado and Iowa households, and following up on the 1.38 million mailing to Ohio, New Hampshire and Nevada should force the mainstream media to pay attention. This will help expand the market for the film into television, video on demand and even internationally.” “Dreams from My Real Father” mass produced As Gilbert explained in a video describing his DVD mailings to households in swing states, the effort required a mass production effort to duplicate, package and prepare for mailing the first batch of 1.38 million DVDs destined for delivery in Ohio, New Hampshire and Nevada. “The media simply can’t ignore these million DVD mailings forever,” Gilbert said. “I encourage everyone who gets a DVD in the mail to watch it, share it with friends and contact the news media to discuss the information in the film.” Gilbert told WND he hopes his million DVD mailings will stimulate “Dreams of My Real Father” sales, a television deal and possibly even a theatrical release in movie theaters around the nation. “I got the idea for the free DVD mailer publicity program when I received an email from a Bern Nilson in Denver, Colo.,” Gilbert explained. “He wrote, ‘We are on the verge of losing the Constitution. Freedom and liberty are in jeopardy. As a Vietnam War veteran, I ask, what did I fight for? Please, can you get this information out to millions? It is our only hope!’” In a now viral video, Gilbert announced the decision to mail millions of DVDs on July 19, at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. Gilbert has created a “Breaking News” page on the “Dreams from My Real Father” website indicating that he is next planning a mailing of 3 million DVDs to households in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349698153240</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 08:09:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349698292876-13</Id><Topic><Title>U. of Colorado poll update predicts Romney 330 electoral votes to 208 for Obama</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349618870652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 10:07:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bbuummppp</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349698292876</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 08:11:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349698413245-14</Id><Topic><Title>Romney has pledged to</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1349688217095</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 05:23:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let the Moooselims drink their oil, I am tired of $4 gas.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349698413245</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 08:13:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349698987702-15</Id><Title>America land of the free stuff</Title><Msg>Obama and Benny in bed together.

The president and his advisers expected a quick, inexpensive conflict. Instead, we have a war that is costing more than anyone could have imagined. The cost of direct US military operations - not even including long-term costs such as taking care of wounded veterans - already exceeds the cost of the 12-year war in Vietnam and is more than double the cost of the Korean War. And, even in the best case scenario, these costs are projected to be almost ten times the cost of the first Gulf War, almost a third more than the cost of the Vietnam War, and twice that of the First World War. The only war in our history which cost more was the Second World War, when 16.3 million U.S. troops fought in a campaign lasting four years, at a total cost (in 2007 dollars, after adjusting for inflation) of about $5 trillion (that's $5 million million, or £2.5 million million). With virtually the entire armed forces committed to fighting the Germans and Japanese, the cost per troop (in today's dollars) was less than $100,000 in 2007 dollars. By contrast, the Iraq war is costing upward of $400,000 per troop. Most Americans have yet to feel these costs. The price in blood has been paid by our voluntary military and by hired contractors. The price in treasure has, in a sense, been financed entirely by borrowing. Taxes have not been raised to pay for it - in fact, taxes on the rich have actually fallen. Deficit spending gives the illusion that the laws of economics can be repealed, that we can have both guns and butter. But of course the laws are not repealed. The costs of the war are real even if they have been deferred, possibly to another generation. Background American voters must choose: more benefits or more defence $3 trillion budget leaves little for Bush to bank on MoD forced to cut budget by £1.5bn They’re running our tanks on empty On the eve of war, there were discussions of the likely costs. Larry Lindsey, President Bush's economic adviser and head of the National Economic Council, suggested that they might reach $200 billion. But this estimate was dismissed as “baloney” by the Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. His deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, suggested that postwar reconstruction could pay for itself through increased oil revenues. Mitch Daniels, the Office of Management and Budget director, and Secretary Rumsfeld estimated the costs in the range of $50 to $60 billion, a portion of which they believed would be financed by other countries. (Adjusting for inflation, in 2007 dollars, they were projecting costs of between $57 and $69 billion.) The tone of the entire administration was cavalier, as if the sums involved were minimal. Even Lindsey, after noting that the war could cost $200 billion, went on to say: “The successful prosecution of the war would be good for the economy.” In retrospect, Lindsey grossly underestimated both the costs of the war itself and the costs to the economy. Assuming that Congress approves the rest of the $200 billion war supplemental requested for fiscal year 2008, as this book goes to press Congress will have appropriated a total of over $845 billion for military operations, reconstruction, embassy costs, enhanced security at US bases, and foreign aid programmes in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the fifth year of the war draws to a close, operating costs (spending on the war itself, what you might call “running expenses”) for 2008 are projected to exceed $12.5 billion a month for Iraq alone, up from $4.4 billion in 2003, and with Afghanistan the total is $16 billion a month. Sixteen billion dollars is equal to the annual budget of the United Nations, or of all but 13 of the US states. Even so, it does not include the $500 billion we already spend per year on the regular expenses of the Defence Department. Nor does it include other hidden expenditures, such as intelligence gathering, or funds mixed in with the budgets of other departments. Because there are so many costs that the Administration does not count, the total cost of the war is higher than the official number. For example, government officials frequently talk about the lives of our soldiers as priceless. But from a cost perspective, these “priceless” lives show up on the Pentagon ledger simply as $500,000 - the amount paid out to survivors in death benefits and life insurance. After the war began, these were increased from $12,240 to $100,000 (death benefit) and from $250,000 to $400,000 (life insurance). Even these increased amounts are a fraction of what the survivors might have received had these individuals lost their lives in a senseless automobile accident. In areas such as health and safety regulation, the US Government values a life of a young man at the peak of his future earnings capacity in excess of $7 million - far greater than the amount that the military pays in death benefits. Using this figure, the cost of the nearly 4,000 American troops killed in Iraq adds up to some $28 billion. The costs to society are obviously far larger than the numbers that show up on the government's budget. Another example of hidden costs is the understating of US military casualties. The Defence Department's casualty statistics focus on casualties that result from hostile (combat) action - as determined by the military. Yet if a soldier is injured or dies in a night-time vehicle accident, this is officially dubbed “non combat related” - even though it may be too unsafe for soldiers to travel during daytime. In fact, the Pentagon keeps two sets of books. The first is the official casualty list posted on the DOD website. The second, hard-to-find, set of data is available only on a different website and can be obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. This data shows that the total number of soldiers who have been wounded, injured, or suffered from disease is double the number wounded in combat. Some will argue that a percentage of these non-combat injuries might have happened even if the soldiers were not in Iraq. Our new research shows that the majority of these injuries and illnesses can be tied directly to service in the war. From the unhealthy brew of emergency funding, multiple sets of books, and chronic underestimates of the resources required to prosecute the war, we have attempted to identify how much we have been spending - and how much we will, in the end, likely have to spend. The figure we arrive at is more than $3 trillion. Our calculations are based on conservative assumptions. They are conceptually simple, even if occasionally technically complicated. A $3 trillion figure for the total cost strikes us as judicious, and probably errs on the low side. Needless to say, this number represents the cost only to the United States. It does not reflect the enormous cost to the rest of the world, or to Iraq. From the beginning, the United Kingdom has played a pivotal role - strategic, military, and political - in the Iraq conflict. Militarily, the UK contributed 46,000 troops, 10 per cent of the total. Unsurprisingly, then, the British experience in Iraq has paralleled that of America: rising casualties, increasing operating costs, poor transparency over where the money is going, overstretched military resources, and scandals over the squalid conditions and inadequate medical care for some severely wounded veterans. Before the war, Gordon Brown set aside £1 billion for war spending. As of late 2007, the UK had spent an estimated £7 billion in direct operating expenditures in Iraq and Afghanistan (76 per cent of it in Iraq). This includes money from a supplemental “special reserve”, plus additional spending from the Ministry of Defence. The special reserve comes on top of the UK's regular defence budget. The British system is particularly opaque: funds from the special reserve are “drawn down” by the Ministry of Defence when required, without specific approval by Parliament. As a result, British citizens have little clarity about how much is actually being spent. In addition, the social costs in the UK are similar to those in the US - families who leave jobs to care for wounded soldiers, and diminished quality of life for those thousands left with disabilities. By the same token, there are macroeconomic costs to the UK as there have been to America, though the long-term costs may be less, for two reasons. First, Britain did not have the same policy of fiscal profligacy; and second, until 2005, the United Kingdom was a net oil exporter. We have assumed that British forces in Iraq are reduced to 2,500 this year and remain at that level until 2010. We expect that British forces in Afghanistan will increase slightly, from 7,000 to 8,000 in 2008, and remain stable for three years. The House of Commons Defence Committee has recently found that despite the cut in troop levels, Iraq war costs will increase by 2 per cent this year and personnel costs will decrease by only 5 per cent. Meanwhile, the cost of military operations in Afghanistan is due to rise by 39 per cent. The estimates in our model may be significantly too low if these patterns continue. Based on assumptions set out in our book, the budgetary cost to the UK of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through 2010 will total more than £18 billion. If we include the social costs, the total impact on the UK will exceed £20 billion. © Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes, 2008.

It's just what America needs. We need a turnaround specialist. He is a typical Mormon: squeaky clean, doesn't drink alcohol, industrious, and salt-of-the-earth. They don't call Utah the 'beehive' state for nothing. He's not a Chicago political animal or 'pawn'. Massachusetts has the highest ranked public school system in the country. Romney must know something about that since he was governor from 2002 to end of 2006. It's clear that he had some role in that high ranking as policies tend to bear fruit well after they are implemented. Romney's right, $90 billion in "support" to Solar energy or "Green energy" companies would have hired a lot of teachers! He understands that increasing business regulation in a recession or near-recession (EPA for instance) is the wrong thing. He understands that raising taxes on businesses and individuals in a recession, or near-recession is the wrong thing to do. There has been no appetite at all in Congress for new taxes for the past 4 years. Only Obama himself is repeatedly calling for more taxes. None have passed except the taxes associated with ObamaCare. He understands the way forward is true tax reform to lower top marginal rates and lower some taxes while reducing tax credits and deductions to spur final demand (stimulative) while cutting government spending at the same time (contractionary). The intent is a "pro-growth" policy position and will be a delicate balancing act. He's correct in that only growth will solve the current budget imbalance. Romney understands that the European emphasis on tax increases (less or no emphasis on spending cuts) where applied in Spain and Greece, have further hurt growth and have lowered tax revenues even further. It's become clear that their budgets will never balance in that approach. France is trying only taxation-which is failing in the same way before it even starts. It's a vicious downward spiral. Obama is prescribing France's approach. Romney's correct that raising the top individual marginal rate affects a large number of small businesses who file as Sub-chapter S on their tax returns. A higher top marginal rate puts an extra burden on those businesses who happen to employ a large number of people and may hire more. Conversely, a lower top marginal rate lowers small business burdens and will help this group. He's promised to end an era of near-infinite free and 'easy' money, dollar debasement and end the massive monetary "experiment" being conducted by the Federal Reserve by replacing Bernanke. Normalizing interest rates is the correct thing to do to help savers and prevent more market bubbles and the subsequent bursting of bubbles. (The gov't created the housing and personal debt bubbles that got us into our current mess and subsequent 'fixes' are adding more mistakes) He's correct about the immorality of passing massive and mounting debts to the next generation(s). He's correctly understands that the EPA has gone way beyond the Clean Air Act which doesn't include regulating carbon dioxide. (CO2 is still a measly 0.038% in atmosphere or 380 parts per million, is required by plants and is hardly a threat to human health! Exhaled human breath contains 40,0000 parts per million or 4% CO2!) He's against the war against coal and against Obama's plan to force coal power plants to shut down (and replace with what?). It might all be a moot point since natural gas is so cheap now. He's correct that Solar power is not currently a "real" solution to our energy needs. Romney doesn't have a "fetish" for "green" energy. He's a realist. He's a businessman, not an academic. He's for the Keystone Pipeline and the resulting improved energy alliance with Canada. This approach enhances US national and energy security He's promised to increase energy exploration in the lower 48 and Alaska unlike the current administration. He's correctly called out the current administration for actually reducing drilling permits on Federal land (about 40% reduction). However, he didn't 'gig' Obama on his over-reaching Gulf of Mexico drilling ban that was over-turned by a Federal judge as "too broad." Because of the overly broad ban, drilling rigs in the Gulf left.. That's why oil and gas production declined on Federal Lands in the year after the ban. He's correctly pointed out that gas production has risen on private land and fallen on Federal lands (offshore). Oil production would have risen much more if it hadn't been for the drilling ban. Obama tried to claim that he's a big supporter of oil and gas when he's anything but. He's against the "sequestration cuts" of defense as if defense were a "pawn" in some political game. Obama, like European socialists, really wants to cut defense to spend more on "redistribution." Think Europe where there is hardly any defense capability remaining AND their budgets and debt levels are still sky high. There's no end to their spending! Yes, unlike Mitt, I believe that defense spending needs to be reduced responsibly. He's against cap and trade at this time. Capping emissions won't do enough, so why bother? He's correctly called-out the NLRB as an example of an anti-business policy. He's correctly argued about the folly of "Trickle-Down" government He's correctly exposed government "investment" as largely a waste of money. The idea of the Government picking winners and losers is the free market is wrong-headed. He's for State's rights He's for letting The States be the "laboratory" for new policy including moving toward universal health coverage. Devolving as many programs to The States as possible is a good idea. He's proven to be able to work with both Republicans and Democrats in Massachusetts where the legislature was dominated by 87% Democratic majority. He's right about repatriating jobs from Asia (getting 'tough' with China) and improving trade is a priority to help US growth. It's probably too late to call China a "currency manipulator." However, it may bring them to the bargaining table for a change. He believes that free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity. He knows more government programs of redistribution beyond our current entitlement programs is mostly wrong-headed. He's correct about the need to focus on cost control for Medical costs (see controlling medical costs in the link)---it's killing everybody! ObamaCare, with no effort to reduce costs, has and will lead to much higher costs and higher premiums. You can't increase demand on the existing 'system' without increasing supply and expect prices not to go up! Personally, I'm hiding out in Thailand due to rising medical costs in the US. Repeal or modification of ObamaCare will likely reverse some of the cost increases/cost pressures. Romney is right in that people are going to be shocked at the future cost of medical care under ObamaCare. The cost shock was always put off to the 2nd term presumably because it would be "politically inconvenient" if the true costs were known in Obama's first term! Well, they are only now becoming clear. He's correct in calling out the President that the $716 billion cut in Medicare which will fund ObamaCare is a mirage. That magnitude of cuts can not be made in "reducing overpayments" or improvements in "efficiency". Because it's a mirage, it won't be done and the deficit will rise. A voucher system for distributing Medicare benefits seems like a sane way of managing uncontrolled spending and subsequent price increases. Government is largely causing medical cost inflation because government spending is out of control. It can't continue out of control. He knows how to restore confidence in the US Gov't debt market by reforming the cost trajectory of Medicare and other entitlement programs. Obama hasn't really lifted a finger. He's all talk and no action. Romney's right, if we have to borrow from China (or worse, let the Federal Reserve 'print' more money by buying gov't debt!!), then we need to seriously consider a cut. An un-elected board to limit or ration medical care--that is ultimately unaccountable to elected officials--is not the right way to go either. Romney's right, limiting government spending with vouchers and providing choice in a marketplace is better. Romney correctly reported that the CBO itself has said that 10's of millions of people to lose their medical policies at their work under ObamaCare--whereas Obama has always claimed that you'll get to keep your existing policies. It's not true. I wouldn't be able to keep my preference for a high-deductible policy! Romney's right, doctor's are leaving in droves to escape ObamaCare. So, Obama's claim that you'll be able to keep your doctor is in doubt. He's correct that Dodd Frank has institutionalized the largest banks as "too big to fail" and that it hasn't solved taxpayer liability to the big banks. Romney's mentioned bank leverage limits and for complete transparency in the debate. Dodd-Frank with it's 1000s of pages of trying to out-think bankers with an attempt at detailed and prescriptive regulation won't work. Bankers will figure out ways around it. Romney's right, Obama has been a hyper-partisan instead of a "uniter". The way ObamaCare was pushed through without bipartisan input, in the middle of the night, under a phony rush, without anyone reading it, the"waivers", the "bribes" to Democratic senators to coerce them to vote for the ObamaCare "administrative nightmare" was the worst spectacle in lawmaking in modern history. Romney's right, that "the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That's the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best."

While their financial status may appear to be irrelevant, it's not. They're so insulated from anyone who isn't wealthy -- or a lobbyist - that many of them have no idea at all what the rest of us are dealing with: The wealthiest one-third of lawmakers were largely immune from the Great Recession, taking the fewest financial hits and watching their investments quickly recover and rise to new heights. But more than 20 percent of the members of the current Congress — 121 lawmakers — appeared to be worse off in 2010 than they had been six years earlier, and 24 saw their reported wealth slide into negative territory. Welcome to our world, tiny group of Congress members! Most members weathered the financial crisis better than the average American, who saw median household net worth drop 39 percent from 2007 to 2010. The median estimated wealth of members of the current Congress rose 5 percent during the same period, according to their reported assets and liabilities. The wealthiest one-third of Congress gained 14 percent. I'm sure all that perfectly legal insider information comes in handy. Because lawmakers are allowed to report their holdings and debts in broad ranges, it is impossible for the public to determine their precise net worth. They also are not required to reveal the value of their homes, the salaries of their spouses or money kept in non-interest-bearing bank accounts and their congressional retirement plan. For its analysis, The Post used the midpoint of the range of each reported holding and tracked the figures over time to determine whether the relative wealth of lawmakers had increased or declined between 2004 and 2010. Previous studies of congressional wealth have looked at Congress as a whole, rather than tracking the financial trend for each individual lawmaker. The Post created an in-depth financial portrait of each member of Congress. Among the findings: ●The estimated wealth of Republicans was 44 percent higher than Democrats in 2004, but that disparity has virtually disappeared. ●The number of millionaires in Congress dropped after the Great Recession; the 253 who have served during the current session are the smallest group since 2004. The numbers are likely to be underestimated because lawmakers are not required to list their homes among their assets. ●Between 2004 and 2010, 72 lawmakers appeared to have doubled their estimated wealth. ●At least 150 lawmakers reported receiving more income from outside jobs and investments than from their congressional salaries of $174,000 for rank-and-file members. ●Representatives in 2010 had a median estimated wealth of $746,000; senators had $2.6 million. ●Since 2004, lawmakers reported more than 3,500 outside jobs paying their spouses more than $1,000 a year. The lawmakers are not required to report how much the spouses are paid or what they did for the money. ●Lawmakers’ wealth is held in a variety of ways: 127 primarily in real estate, 117 in institutional funds, 75 in their spouses’ names, 51 in essentially cash, 36 in specific stocks and bonds, 32 in high-turnover trading, 30 in business ownership and 20 in agriculture. More than 40 had reported assets of $25,000 or less. The Post also found that some congressional financial interests intersected with public actions taken by legislators: 73 lawmakers sponsored or co-sponsored legislation that could have benefitted businesses or industries in which either they or their families were involved or invested.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1349711679423</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 11:54:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349711680048-71</Id><Topic><Title>ISRAELI THREATS = HIGH GAS PRICES...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1349710683565</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 11:38:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are confusing Yahoo finance's message board with Al Gazira,or some other Terror media channel..

It turns out that when you provide actual women who want birth control with access to birth control, they have way fewer abortions! Weird. The project enrolled 9,256 women aged 14 to 45 from the St. Louis area. For three years, the women were given their choice of birth control at no cost. The national rate of abortion is 19.6 abortions per 1,000 women. The rate for women in the project? 4.4 to 7.5 abortions per 1,000. The effect on teen births was even more remarkable, dropping from 34.3 births per 1000 teens to 6.3. SIX POINT THREE! That’s a better than 80% drop. Let’s see how ‘abstinence only education’ stacks up to that. Anyway, it’s hardly surprising that ubiquitous birth control has this effect, but it’s nice to have some actual numbers. From the TIME Magazine article: The findings come amidst contention over President Obama’s health-care law, which offers women FDA-approved birth control without a copay. As of August 1, contraception is covered for women signing up for new health insurance plans or renewing their existing plans. “[C]hanges in contraceptive policy simulating the Contraceptive Choice Project would prevent as many as 41% to 71% of abortions performed annually in the United States,” the study’s authors wrote. Nearly half of the more than 6 million pregnancies that occur each year are unintended, and about 43% of them end in abortion. Further, about 1 million births are unintended, costing U.S. taxpayers about $11 billion a year in associated expenses. Low-income women with less education are far more likely to have an unintended pregnancy than their wealthier, educated peers. So! Now that that’s nice and settled, I expect religious conservatives and the pro-life movement to embrace this common-sense solution to one of the major issues of our age and back universally available birth control. After all, if you believe that abortion is murder, and that ending it is one of the most important moral considerations we face, this should be a no-brainer. Waiting … waiting … sigh. Goddammit, guys.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1349712904357</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 12:15:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349713383220-83</Id><Title>I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED CISCO TO POP ON HUAWEI NEWS.</Title><Msg>Should bring business their way.

"Even the studies that Romney has cited to claim his plan adds up still show he would need to raise middle-class taxes," said the Obama campaign press release. "In fact, Harvard economist Martin Feldstein and Princeton economist Harvey Rosen both concede that paying for Romney’s tax cuts would require large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000." But that's not true. Princeton professor Harvey Rosen tells THE WEEKLY STANDARD in an email that the Obama campaign is misrepresenting his paper on Romney's tax plan: I can’t tell exactly how the Obama campaign reached that characterization of my work. It might be that they assume that Governor Romney wants to keep the taxes from the Affordable Care Act in place, despite the fact that the Governor has called for its complete repeal. The main conclusion of my study is that under plausible assumptions, a proposal along the lines suggested by Governor Romney can both be revenue neutral and keep the net tax burden on taxpayers with incomes above $200,000 about the same. That is, an increase in the tax burden on lower and middle income individuals is not required in order to make the overall plan revenue neutral. You can check the math that shows Romney's plan is mathematically possible"</Msg><Username>democrat_cocoon_gay_perversions</Username><Timestamp>1349713483997</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 12:24:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349713494960-85</Id><Topic><Title>You need to see this Report!

The new version of the flip-flopping, say anything “Moderate Mitt” showed up for the last debate. Bidden will crush Ryan on Thursday, and the Romney flaws will be exposed for all to see in the final 2 debates. SUMMARY OF THE ROMNEY LIES 1. "I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut." Romney flatly lied about the cost of his proposal to cut income-tax rates across the board by another 20 percent (undercutting even the low rates of the Bush tax cuts). Independent economists at the Tax Policy Center have shown that the price tag for those cuts is $360 billion in the first year, a cost that extrapolates to $5 trillion over a decade. 2. "I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans." Romney has claimed that he will pay for his tax cuts by closing a variety of loopholes and deductions. The factual problem? Romney hasn't named a single loophole he's willing to close; worse, there's no way to offset $5 trillion in tax cuts even if you get rid of the entire universe of deductions for the wealthy that Romney has not put off the table (like the carried interest loophole or the 15 percent capital gains rate.) The Tax Policy Center report concludes that Romney's proposal would create a "net tax cut for high-income tax payers and a net tax increase for lower- and or middle-income taxpayers." Moreover, some of Romney's tax cuts are micro-targeted at American dynasties, particularly his proposal to eliminate the estate tax, which would reduce his own sons' tax burden by tens of millions of dollars. 3. "We've got 23 million people out of work or [who have] stopped looking for work in this country." Romney is lying for effect. The nation's crisis of joblessness is bad, but not 23 million bad. The official figure is 12.5 million unemployed. An additional 2.6 million Americans have stopped looking for jobs. How does Romney gin up his eye-popping 23 million figure? He counts more than 8 million wage earners who hold part-time jobs as also being "out of work." 4. Obamacare "puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have." Romney is reviving Sarah Palin's old death panels lie here. Obamacare does establish an Independent Payment Advisory Board to help constrain the growth of Medicare spending. The body has no authority to dictate the practices of the private insurance marketplace. And the law also makes explicit that this body is banned from rationing care or limiting medical benefits to seniors. 5. "Pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan." In the biggest whopper of the night, Romney suggested that his health care proposal would guarantee coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions. This is just not true. Under Romney, if you have a pre-existing condition and have been unable to obtain insurance coverage or if you have had to drop coverage for more than 90 days because you lost your job or couldn't afford the premiums, you would be #$%$ out of luck. Insurance companies could continue to discriminate and deny you coverage, as even Romney's top adviser conceded after the debate was over.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1349716528422</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:15:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349716920694-98</Id><Topic><Title>You need to see this Report!

The memo comes from the embassy’s “security support team,” a group of 16 special forces soldiers assigned to protect the embassy who were inexplicably removed from Libya in August over their commander’s objections, just one month before the attacks in Benghazi. That commander, Lieutenant Colonel Andy Wood, will testify about their removal before the House Oversight Committee this week. CBS News provides more on Wood’s story: Speaking to CBS News correspondent Sharyl Attkisson, Wood said when he found out that his own 16-member team and a six-member State Department elite force were being pulled from Tripoli in August – about a month before the assault in Benghazi – he felt, “like we were being asked to play the piano with two fingers. There was concern amongst the entire embassy staff.”[...] Wood insists that senior staff in Libya, including Ambassador Stevens, State Department Regional Security Officer Eric Nordstrom, and himself, all wanted and had requested enhanced security. “We felt we needed more, not less,” he tells Attkisson. Asked what response their repeated pleas got from the State Department in Washington, Wood says they were simply told “to do with less. For what reasons, I don’t know.” “We tried to illustrate… to show them how dangerous and how volatile and just unpredictable that whole environment was over there.

The fact that we are here today to debate raising America 's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America 's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, "the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. Senator Barack H. Obama, March 2006 There are two ways to conquer &amp; enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt."

The brits, our favorite lap dog. ******************* LONDON (AP) — A British judge on Monday ordered supporters of Julian Assange to pay thousands of pounds they promised for his bail because the WikiLeaks founder violated the conditions for his release. The 41-year-old Assange violated a condition to report to a police station daily when he sought refuge at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he has been holed up since June 19 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over sex crimes allegations. The WikiLeaks founder and his supporters claim that the Swedish sex case is part of a Washington-orchestrated plot to make him stand trial in the United States over his work with WikiLeaks, which has published thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables and other documents. Both Sweden and the U.S. reject that claim. Former BBC journalist Vaughan Smith, who hosted Assange at his country house for more than a year as the WikiLeaks founder fought extradition, was among the nine supporters who had argued that they should not be punished for trying to "serve the public interest" in the case. But Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle on Monday ordered them to pay 93,500 pounds ($150,000) by Nov. 6, saying that while he accepted the supporters had acted in good faith, they had failed in their "basic duty" to ensure Assange surrendered. "They must have understood the risk and the concerns of the courts," he said in his ruling, ordering each of the nine to pay part of 140,000 pounds ($224,300) originally pledged. Still, the judge said he respected the supporters for acting against their own self- interest in refraining from urging Assange to surrender.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1349726232531</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 15:57:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349726583698-161</Id><Topic><Title>Romney pretends Obama’s free trade agreements simply don’t exist</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1349725693162</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 15:48:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Eff off,Junior.LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1349726583698</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:03:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349726655902-162</Id><Topic><Title>PRISON PLANET, BRITISH LAPDOGS...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1349726232531</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 15:57:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree with you about the Brits!

What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.” – Neil Postman – Amusing Ourselves to Death I despair for my country that has chosen to eat, amuse and borrow itself to death. But my despair is deepest for my children and their future. The greed, corruption, myopia, selfishness, and disregard for the well-being of future generations by current and past generations has left a barren and bleak landscape for my children. The Huxley vision of America consuming and amusing itself to death is coming to a painful conclusion, as the limits of a fiat currency and debt based lifestyle become evident. Those in power are preparing the masses for a more Orwellian vision of America when they are forced to pull the plug on the existing paradigm. The Patriot Act, NDAA, military exercises in our cities, militarization of local police forces, warrantless surveillance of our communications, searches and seizures in our airports and train stations, purchase of millions of rounds of ammo by government agencies, implementation of drone technology, camera surveillance, attempts to control the internet, manipulation of economic data, and executive orders allowing the President to take over all commerce while imprisoning citizens indefinitely without charges, are the next step in our descent into a dictatorship of tears. The question is whether we will stand idly by, fiddling with our gadgets, tweeting about Honey Boo Boo, or will we regain our sense of duty to the future generations of this country. The manipulators are powerful, rich, connected and FEW. Those being manipulated, controlled, and abused are MANY. There will be a revolution in this country whether you like it or not. The existing social order will dissolve during the next fifteen years. What replaces it is up to us. George Carlin described what our owners want. “Politicians are put there to give you that idea that you have freedom of choice. You don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land, they own and control the corporations, and they’ve long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, and the City Halls. They’ve got the judges in their back pockets. And they own all the big media companies so they control just about all the news and information you get to hear. They’ve got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want; they want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I’ll tell you what they don’t want—they don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. That’s against their interest.”</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1349741354367</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 20:09:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349742344504-194</Id><Topic><Title>PEW RESEARCH CENTER POLL...ROMNEY LEADING IN ALL CATEGORIES EXCEPT..</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1349731523627</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 17:25:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stacey Dash endorsed Mitt, means she has brains to go along with her GOP good Looks.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349742344504</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 20:25:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349743168459-195</Id><Title>Mon Oct. 8 Unskewed Polls : Romney Rules</Title><Msg>UnSkewed Polling Data Monday, October 08, 2012 5:37:45 PM Poll Date Sample MoE Skew Obama(D) Romney(R) Spread UnSkewed Avg. 9/24 - 10/4 -- -- +4.3 D 46.7 49.2 Romney +2.5 Pew Research 10/4 - 10/7 1112 3.4 +0 D 45.0 49.0 Romney +4 Politico/GWU/Battleground 10/1 - 10/4 1000 LV 3.1 +4 D 46.0 50.0 Romney +4 Rasmussen 10/3 - 10/5 1500 LV 3.0 +3 D 45.0 51.0 Romney +6 Gallup 9/29 - 10/5 3050 RV 2.0 +5 D 46.0 48.0 Romney +2 NPR 9/26 - 9/30 800 LV 4.0 +7 D 49.0 47.0 Obama +1 National Journal 9/27 - 9/30 LV 4.5 +7 D 46.0 49.0 Romney +3 CNN/ORC 9/28 - 9/30 783 LV 3.0 +3 D 46.0 50.0 Romney +4 ABC News/Wash.

I predict 10/21 is the date the media tries to explain the sudden Romney momentum and explains how they got caught so flat footed. Today they are still trying to say a. its because women hate Romney, yet independents are pro Romney 15% and include women b. its because minorities won't vote for Romney c. its because Joos hate Romney None of this is really factual The media won't even report the U. of Colorado computer model. Notice we are not getting electoral projection any longer out of the lamestream media. they know that there is a 15% enthusiasm gap in favor of a big Romney turnout. Nobody talks about the Catholic and Christian Romney endorsement defying the Johnson IRS tax rules. Nobody is talking about the TEA PARTY events starting up again. Nobody is mentioning that the Romney crowds are bigger than Obama crowds Nobody in the MSM is mentioning the illegal foreign (Arab Money Obama is smuggling)\ into his campaign which is against the law.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349743821823</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 20:50:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349744603006-197</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and the Leftist Media...</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1349729853893</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:57:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>111111111lllllllllllllllllllll</Msg><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1349744603006</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:03:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349744711491-198</Id><Title>O'Reilly said we should not have gone into Iraq and it took him almost 10 years to realize that!</Title><Msg>and over 2 trillion and thousands of dead people! incredible</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349744711491</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:05:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349744903923-199</Id><Title>Watch the O'Reilly-Stewart debate (the Rumble), it is pretty funny</Title><Msg>O'Reilly mentioned a third party will be created, and I think he is 100% correct about that</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349744903923</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:08:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349744952959-200</Id><Title>Can't wait until Thursday's VP debate...</Title><Msg>When Ryan shows up Joe for the bozo he is, that will confirm the mojo from last Wednesday in Romney's favor.. :-)</Msg><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1349744952959</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:09:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349745084521-201</Id><Title>Mitt Romney humanized himself during the debate!</Title><Msg>Anyone lying as much as he did, is definitely a human!</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349745084521</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:11:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349745479587-202</Id><Title>Over 2 trillion wasted in Iraq, now Mitt wants to attack Iran...with your kids!</Title><Msg>Hopefully China is still willing to loan us the money</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349745479587</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:17:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349745565180-203</Id><Topic><Title>O'Reilly said we should not have gone into Iraq and it took him almost 10 years to realize that!</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349744711491</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:05:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Make up your mind, you said 3 trillion yesterday.

Jon Campbell may become one of the Republican "defectors" Traugott says could make a difference in battleground states. Campbell, 49, has voted Republican in nearly every presidential election since he cast his vote for Ronald Reagan in 1980, but this year might be different. For two years his 22-year-old stepdaughter, a self-employed dog trainer, didn't have health insurance. Then Obamacare kicked in and she was allowed onto her father's insurance. "If something had happened to her during those two years it would have been a disaster," Campbell says. The Olathe, Kansas, resident is leaning toward Obama, but not just because of his stepdaughter. Campbell's wife, Barbara, has diabetes and is in the final stages of breast cancer treatment. She's now on his insurance, but if he ever lost his job, his wife would be faced with trying to buy insurance on her own and would surely be rejected. "I'm really torn," he said. "Because of Obama, I now have a wife who can get covered. But really, at heart, I'm a limited-government kind of guy." Campbell said if the election were held today, he'd vote for Obama, but not without a lot of reservations.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1349746131612</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:28:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349746219376-206</Id><Topic><Title>O'Reilly said we should not have gone into Iraq and it took him almost 10 years to realize that!</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349744711491</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:05:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that is my point!!!

Wouldn't you rather have this platform and this man for president than the same old crap ? Gary Earl Johnson (born January 1, 1953) is an American businessman, a former Governor of New Mexico, and the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2012 election.[1] Johnson served as the 29th Governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003, as a member of the Republican Party, and is known for his low-tax libertarian views and his strong emphasis on personal health and fitness. While a student at the University of New Mexico in 1974, Johnson sustained himself financially by working as a door-to-door handyman. In 1976 he founded Big J Enterprises, which grew from this one-person venture to become one of New Mexico's largest construction companies.[2] He entered politics for the first time by running for Governor of New Mexico in 1994 on a fiscally conservative, low-tax, anti-crime platform.[3] Johnson won the Republican Party of New Mexico's gubernatorial nomination, and defeated incumbent Democratic governor Bruce King by 50% to 40%. He cut the 10% annual growth in the budget: in part, due to his use of the gubernatorial veto 200 times during his first six months in office,[2] which gained him the nickname "Governor Veto".[4][5] Johnson sought re-election in 1998, winning by 55% to 45%. In his second term, he concentrated on the issue of school voucher reforms,[6] as well as campaigning for marijuana decriminalization and opposition to the War on Drugs. During his tenure as governor, Johnson adhered to a stringent anti-tax and anti-bureaucracy policy driven by a cost–benefit analysis rationale, setting state and national records for his use of veto powers:[2] more than the other 49 contemporary governors put together.[7][8] Term-limited, Johnson could not run for re-election at the end of his second term. As a fitness enthusiast,[9][10] Johnson has taken part in several Ironman Triathlons, and he climbed Mount Everest in May 2003.[11] After leaving office, Johnson founded the non-profit Our America Initiative in 2009, a political advocacy committee seeking to promote policies such as free enterprise, foreign non-interventionism, limited government and privatization. Johnson announced his candidacy for President on April 21, 2011, as a Republican,[12] on a libertarian platform emphasizing the United States public debt and a balanced budget through a 43% reduction of all federal government spending, protection of civil liberties, an immediate end to the War in Afghanistan and his advocacy of the FairTax. On December 28, 2011, after being excluded from the majority of the Republican Party's presidential debates and failing to gain traction while campaigning for the New Hampshire primary, he withdrew his candidacy for the Republican nomination and announced that he would continue his presidential campaign as a candidate for the nomination of the Libertarian Party.[13] He won the Libertarian Party nomination on May 5, 2012. His vice-presidential running mate is Judge James P. Gray of California.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1349746343229</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:32:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349746435887-208</Id><Topic><Title>IN THE END...I AM VOTING LIBERTARIAN</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1349746343229</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:32:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, he won't be elected but if you give him your vote you are planting a seed.
