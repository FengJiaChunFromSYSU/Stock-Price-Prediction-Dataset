By JENNIFER VALENTINO-DEVRIES A federal judge this week struck down a controversial set of laws allowing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to seek people's records without a court's approval, saying the strict secrecy orders demanded by the laws are not constitutional. Related Read the Judge's Order Covert FBI Power to Obtain Phone Data Faces Rare Test (7/18/12) . Judge Susan Illston, of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, said the laws, which underlie a tool known as a "national security letter," violate the First Amendment and the separation of powers principles. In her order, Judge Illston ordered the government to stop issuing national security letters or enforcing their gag orders, although she said enforcement of her judgment would be stayed pending appeal. A Department of Justice spokesman said the department was "reviewing the order." National security letters date back to the 1980s and were strengthened under the USA Patriot Act, the counterterrorism law put into place after Sept. 11. The letters allow the FBI to get data on phone, financial and electronic records without the approval of a judge or grand jury, as long as the head of an FBI field office certifies that the records would be relevant to a counterterrorism investigation. And they typically come with strict secrecy orders, barring the recipient from acknowledging the case to anyone but attorneys. The California case, a rare test of the national security letter statute, involves an unnamed phone company that has been fighting the letter since 2011. The Wall Street Journal, in a Page One article last year, profiled the case and uncovered clues narrowing down the companies that could possibly be involved.

LOL Let's see the tax is 2.3%, so if everything in the vet's office was subject to it then my bill would go up 2.3% or from $56 to $57.88 but of course almost everything is exempt. Here’s how it will work. Medical devices used only on animals are exempt. However, items including IV pumps, sterile scalpels and anesthesia equipment, which are medical devices that have a dual use- meaning they can be used on people and animals--will be taxed. So the doctors office all his labor, all his furniture and utilities, his nurses, their computers, billing custodial virtually everything except a few scalpels and IV pumps are exempt. My estimate was this made up only 1% of the cost of a vet. Now I have clearly established the possible range of cost increase is somewhere between 1 cent and $1.88, why don't you put together an explanation where you think the costs fall out. Oh yeah you can't cause your stupid and Rush hasn't given you one.

Although most plant matter decomposes where it falls, when plant life containing cellulose-rich stems and leaves is highly abundant and special conditions exist, the plant matter does not totally decompose and is preserved in fossilized form. These types of plants had evolved by the Devonian Period and coal deposits are found in rocks dating from the Devonian period forward. Many coal deposits in Europe and North America date from the Carboniferous periods of the Paleozoic when these areas were covered with forests dominated by large ferns and scale trees. This link is to a very informative site on coal....toward the bottom of the page there is a map of the coal deposits in the US and one specifically for Pennsylvania. The area was on a coastal lowland, and much of the time was covered by very dense swamp vegetation. At the same time, there was an ice age going on in the southern hemisphere. This was not the ice age with mammoths and sabre toothed tigers you usually hear about, but one of several that happened hundreds of millions of years before that one. The build up of ice on the other end of the Earth meant the sea levels would fall, then during interglacial periods it would rise again and flood the land that lowland forests had covered. The plant material would get covered in sand and then limestone as the water got deeper. This formed a sequence of rock layers known as cyclothems, one layer of which is usually coal formed from the buried plant material. The cycle would repeat every few million years, forming different layers of coal. Since at the same time the sea level was going up and down the land was sinking due to plate tectonics, a very thick sequence of rock was able to form and still mostly be from coastal environments. Global warming and cooling are natural cycles that cannot be stopped by an Obama tax scam.

My argument has been all along the tax is minuscule I have never argued there wasn't a tax, I even posted what it was on. When I pointed out to Hairy that the tax would lead to a minuscule increase he said I was wrong, you say I'm right. My original post follows hey hairyroid why don't you explain it? LOL Let's see the tax is 2.3%, so if everything in the vet's office was subject to it then my bill would go up 2.3% or from $56 to $57.88 but of course almost everything is exempt. Here’s how it will work. Medical devices used only on animals are exempt. However, items including IV pumps, sterile scalpels and anesthesia equipment, which are medical devices that have a dual use- meaning they can be used on people and animals--will be taxed. So the doctors office all his labor, all his furniture and utilities, his nurses, their computers, billing custodial virtually everything except a few scalpels and IV pumps are exempt. My estimate was this made up only 1% of the cost of a vet. Now I have clearly established the possible range of cost increase is somewhere between 1 cent and $1.88, why don't you put together an explanation where you think the costs fall out. Oh yeah you can't cause your stupid and Rush hasn't given you one. All you pukes have is unjustifiable indignation.

By playing on these issues, Nixon and other Republicans of this era won many traditionally Democratic votes in the South. Later, GOP opposition to affirmative action, race-based hiring "quotas" and all other methods of compensating for the debilitating legacy of slavery, Jim Crow and segregation fed into what was one of the momentous shifts, a total turnaround in just more than a decade (1970 to 1984) from a solidly Democratic South to a solidly Republican one. A new book about Strom Thurmond, the openly racist senator from South Carolina (he ran as a "Dixiecrat" against Truman in 1948) details how Thurmond's switch from the Democratic Party to the GOP in 1964 was the harbinger and instigator for that shift to a solidly Republican South. Eventually the party became somewhat less overt in its public statements but not in its appeal at the voting booth. Is it a coincidence that most GOP votes come from the core states of the Old Confederacy—Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363456249345</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:50:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363456393369-55</Id><Title>"Irony" Now that is funny</Title><Msg>Junior stuck his foot in his mouth and now using the irony excuse.Who believes it?LOLOLOLOLOL</Msg><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1363456393369</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:53:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363456493983-56</Id><Topic><Title>obviously when obama said' we got 98% of what I asked for' he owned the sequester</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1363455093114</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:31:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's why 174 house republicans voted for it and only 95 house democrats did, LOL tea billies get so confused listening to their hate radio, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1363456493983</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:54:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363456520808-57</Id><Title>It's called a brain fart</Title><Msg>Junior meant Boehner but he typed Obama.Now he has his lame excuses.LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL IRONY!!!!!!!!

However, he is not Kenyan. That is a fabrication. It is genetically impossible for him to claim to have direct Kenyan descent. There are many people in Indonesia who look like (have the same phenotype as) Barry Soetoro. Physical appearance is an expression of your genotype. It is actually quite likely that Stanley Ann is not his biological mother either. Basic Mendelian genetics. Mendel's genetics can be summarized in two principles: 1. the principle of segregation 2. the principle of independent assortment These two principles of inheritance, along with the understanding of unit inheritance and dominance, are the basis of our modern science of genetics. Note that each of the f1 generation of Mendel's pea plants inherited a Y allele from one parent and a G allele from the other. When the f1 plants breed, each has an equal chance of passing on either Y or G alleles to each offspring. With all of the seven pea plant traits that Mendel examined, one form appeared dominant over the other, which is to say it masked the presence of the other allele. For example, when the genotype for pea seed color is YG (heterozygous), the phenotype is yellow. However, the dominant yellow allele does not alter the recessive green one in any way. Both alleles can be passed on to the next generation unchanged. A child will have phenotypic expression from his parents. Obama has neither. In fact, he has big ears that stick out like Lolo Soetoro's. Obama Sr. and Stanley Ann both had small ears. A nose like Lolo Soetoro's. Same body structure and cranial structure as Lolo Soetoro. The family resemblance is striking. Barry received these alleles at conception from Lolo. Barry's genetic near duplicate is a celebrity in Indonesia.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1363464449346</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 16:07:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363464654971-88</Id><Topic><Title>WHY IS OBAMA BORROWING $500,000,000,000 FROM CHINA TO GIVE TO THE USA HATING MOSLEM BROTHERHOOD IN EGYPT??</Title><Username>super_samoann</Username><Timestamp>1363457588231</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 14:13:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The $500 million that Obama borrowed to give to moslem brother hood terorists in Egypt who hate America allows these radicals to buy weapons to use against the USA and adds half a billion dollars to USA deficit.

Perfect size company w/ only 600 mil sales. It has a p/e of 22 and should have one of 40 just to get to the price of a typical fast growing company. Not only should the price rise for a higher p/e but also it should rocket up with the expected fast rise in earnings. We could easily see the price triple in one year considering these items. The SYMBOL: (AL) - a high profit airline leasing business. Company has billions of dollars in new jets ordered from Boeing and Airbus so obviously they expect a lot more business. I have 20 years experience evaluating hundreds of companies, this is one of the top 3 company stocks I have ever found. The company reported great earnings again and also leased 2 - Boeing 777's, and ordered 10 more Boeing 777's. Symbol (AL) Another interesting but more speculative stock is (edap). The company is big into ultrasound and they finished a study showing ultrasound works on prostate cancer without side effects like chemotherapy. The company is applying for approval with the FDA and it is expected to go through on a fast track because of the excellent results. This undiscovered company is priced at only $4.</Msg><Username>emsggim</Username><Timestamp>1363490103964</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 23:15:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
