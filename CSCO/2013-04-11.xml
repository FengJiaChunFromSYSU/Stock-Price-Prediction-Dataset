It’s Washington. Thanks to the 2007 Renewable Fuel Standard law, gasoline refiners are mandated to blend so much plant-based or renewable ethanol into the gas supply that it prevents Celanese or any other fossil-fuel-based ethanols from even competing for the market. Though the RFS caps the blending of corn ethanol at 15 billion gallons a year, it calls for total biofuels blending to grow to 36 billion gallons a year by 2022. Cellulosic ethanol is supposed to make up most of the difference. Maybe you recall President George W. Bush’s 2006 State of the Union address, in which he declared his goal that cellulosic ethanol made from “wood chips and stalks or switchgrass” would be “practical and competitive within six years.” RFS mandated 100 million gallons of cellulosic for 2010, 250 million for 2011 and 500 million this year. thanks George</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365699916176</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:05:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365700426261-42</Id><Title>Obama budget</Title><Msg>Obama wants to cut Soc Sec and increase tax on apack of cigaretsb to $1.94 .I dont smoke .But that will tajke away more money from people who cant afford it .but cant stop the bad habit</Msg><Username>darnmadd2</Username><Timestamp>1365700426261</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:13:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365700649098-43</Id><Topic><Title>Obama budget</Title><Username>darnmadd2</Username><Timestamp>1365700426261</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:13:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually its 94 cents a pack but his budget has no chance anyway.</Msg><Username>hairyroid</Username><Timestamp>1365700649098</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:17:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365700682114-44</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO Is Looking Good!***</Title><Username>kettyhall</Username><Timestamp>1365605101857</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:45:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This ones gonna be hot</Msg><Username>sandraphilips663</Username><Timestamp>1365700682114</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:18:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365701037116-45</Id><Topic><Title>how's that gun control filibuster working out for you tea billies</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365698272155</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 12:37:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How do you know the demographics of who is buying,pal.

LOL Not everyone thinks Bush's speech is good news. Oil refiners complain about mandates telling them how to blend fuels. Critics of Bush's proposal say it will be impossible to hit the proposed requirement of 35 billion gallons a year by 2017 because the main renewable fuel used now, ethanol made from corn, is already driving up corn prices and will use much or all of the U.S. corn harvest. And technology for producing "cellulosic" ethanol from other feedstocks, such as switch grass, has not been proved on a commercial scale yet. Ethanol boosters are not counting on available technology, however. They are counting on new advances for making ethanol and continued government subsidies. A tax credit to refiners amounts to 51 cents per gallon of ethanol; without that credit, ethanol makers such as VeraSun, which earned about $1 a gallon in the second and third quarters last year, would have to slash prices to make their product economical.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365706053543</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 14:47:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365706916272-54</Id><Title>Who ya gonna believe, the 99.83% or the 1/5th of 1 %?</Title><Msg>Climate Change Consensus Is Virtually Unanimous, Neil Wagner, 12/11/2012 A recent analysis of papers appearing in peer-reviewed science journals shows published scientists to be virtually unanimous in their agreement that human-produced carbon dioxide emissions are a significant cause of global warming. Oberlin College geologist Dr. James L. Powell reviewed 13,950 papers published between January, 1991 and early November, 2012, and found that a mere 24 of them dissented. That's [0.17 percent (not even one fifth-of-one percent)]. 1 out of every 581. Powell further makes the point that those 24 were, on average, the least cited of the papers, saying, "Of one thing we can be certain: had any of these articles presented the magic bullet that falsifies human-caused global warming, that article would be on its way to becoming one of the most-cited in the history of science."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1365706916272</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:01:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365708238558-55</Id><Title>The days of the Left are numbered...</Title><Msg>tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock,...</Msg><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1365708238558</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:23:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365708277475-56</Id><Topic><Title>Who ya gonna believe, the 99.83% or the 1/5th of 1 %?</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1365706916272</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:01:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tea billies still think cigarettes are healthy for the body, just like the tobacco companies told them for years</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365708277475</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:24:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365709132906-57</Id><Topic><Title>Cisco Systems, Inc.

According to the Oklahoman, 54-year-old Sooner Tea Party founder Al Gerhart faces up to five years in prison for blackmail and violating the state computer crimes act. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation determined that Gerhart admitted sending an email to state Sen. Cliff Branan (R) "that was intended to threaten and intimidate him." Gerhart had been angry because Branan refused to allow a vote on a bill that would have ensured Oklahoma cities do not participate in Agenda 21, a United Nations initiative to promote environmentally sustainable development. Conspiracy theorists on the right have long thought that Agenda 21 was a "conspiracy to transform America from the land of the free, to the land of the collective” through “a mind-control" tactic called the Delphi technique. Although the Oklahoma state House had passed House Bill 1412, Branan refused to bring it up in the state Senate because he said it was based on a "fringe conspiracy." "Branan, Get that bill heard or I will make sure you regret not doing it," Gerhart wrote in the email. "I will make you the laughing stock of the Senate if I don't hear that this bill will be heard and passed. We will dig into your past, yoru [sic] family, your associates and once we start on you there will be no end to it. This is a promise."
