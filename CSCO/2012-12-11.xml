All this talk of adding jobs doesn't jive with the facts that only net 340k jobs, but the population growth of working age folks trying to enter the workforce looking for their first real job is way larger. Now 59% of workers employed, and 41% not working that could, over 23 million unemployed. All Obama's call for higher taxes on Rich will do is pay for just 2 days of government spending. $80 billion raised taxing the bosses is just 2 days worth of spending. Meanwhile 50% pay nothing and get freebees The upper 5% earners pay 40% of government revenues, businesses pay most of the rest of the revenues. Small businesses are part of the so called rich since their sub S income is on their personal tax return making them seem like they are rich. We haven't seen the end of this recession yet. 70% of added jobs in the past few months were govt. hiring to fool you into thinking Obama deserved reelection.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1355251386580</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 13:43:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355251547384-57</Id><Title>OBAMA'S HUGE Michigan LOSS on RIGHT TO WORK, especially</Title><Msg>since the LAMEDUCK recently came out in support of union duds is MAJOR, BIG-TIME, COLOSSAL anti-Obama news!

It quite literally paid to be part of the Romney universe. American Rambler, a media firm run by Stuart Stevens, Russ Schriefer and Eric Fehrnstrom (all media strategists for Romney), received more than $234 million in payments from the campaign...Spencer Zwick, Romney's finance chairman, saw two of his companies accumulate hefty checks during the election. SJZ LLC took in a total of $9.76 million from the Romney campaign and the Romney Victory Fund, and Victory Group 2012 received $19.25 million from the Romney Victory Fund for fundraising consulting...Another big winner was Targeted Victory, an Internet strategy firm co-founded by Zac Moffatt, an adviser to the Romney campaign. The firm was paid just under $94 million from the Romney Victory Fund for "digital consulting" and "web development" (the total likely includes the cost of placing online ads).</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355251784208</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 13:49:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355251802377-62</Id><Topic><Title>HAHAHA!

THE PRESIDENT HAS SIGNED $1 TRILLION IN DISCRETIONARY CUTS INTO LAW AS PART OF THE BUDGET CONTROL ACT: President Obama signed into law $1 trillion in cuts to discretionary spending over the next ten years. As part of the 2011 debt agreement the President cut $1,028 billion in discretionary spending through the Budget Control Act. Together with another $676 billion in discretionary savings through annual appropriations bills and interest savings, this will reduce spending by over $2 trillion. As a result, annual discretionary spending is projected to fall to its lowest levels on record, measured as a share of the economy. A breakdown of these savings is in Table S-3 (pg 24) of the Mid-Session Review of the President’s Budget. Furthermore, President Obama has proposed and signed into law the elimination of 77 government programs and cut another 52 programs, saving more than $30 billion annually. This includes taking a hard look at areas he thinks are very important to see what programs are not working, duplicative or no longer needed—which is why the Administration has eliminated 16 programs in the Department of Education, 10 programs at Health and Human Services, and 4 programs at the Department of Labor. In addition, President Obama has cut or eliminated entitlements including cutting out the middleman in the student loan program to save $19 billion, reducing payments for abandoned mine land reclamation by almost $1 billion and eliminating the Telecommunications Development Fund, and a range of other policies. THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT FORWARD SPECIFIC CUTS IN MANDATORY HEALTH SPENDING: The President signed into law health savings in the Affordable Care Act that paid for the improving health coverage and reduced the deficit by over $100 billion over a decade. These policies contributed to slowing baseline growth in Medicare and Medicaid to that of GDP on a per capita basis. And, once its policies are fully phased in, the health care law slows the growth in national health spending.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355259295734</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:54:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355259422424-118</Id><Topic><Title>Obama wants all workers to work for unions</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355258633287</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:43:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>obama shake down -unions for campaign money. now he lost must likely they will come after him like they did JFK.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355259422424</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:57:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355259560028-119</Id><Topic><Title>Obama keeps cutting, why won't the GOP go along?</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355259295734</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:54:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>presidents idea of cutting is looting medicare and medicade? he wants to fill it with IOUs.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355259560028</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:59:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355259800900-120</Id><Title>This fiscal cliff if we go over is 100% obamas fault</Title><Msg>every other president in history has been able to smooth division over and come to an agreement except him. here we are again for the second time in his presidency.

According to a new CNN poll, 45 percent of Americans say they will blame the Republicans–compared to the 34 percent who would blame President Obama. That margin of 11 percent is nearly four times the edge that gave the president his re-election. And 53 percent have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party. Why is the public so prone to blame Republican members of the House and Senate? Maybe they’ve been paying attention. Indeed, 7 out of 10 say the GOP has not done enough to compromise with the president. They made stonewalling their strategy in 2009 and have basically not any made exceptions since — except when they were tricked into doing so. A vast majority of Republicans in Congress have signed Grover Norquist’s pledge that basically means they’re unwilling to compromise—though some senators have started to back away from that once-firm commitment. Voters also agree with Democrats on the issues — 56 percent say taxes on the wealthy should be kept high. And even Republicans agree by an 8-percent margin that any deal should include tax increases along with spending cuts. “77% believe that their personal financial situation will be affected if the government goes off the fiscal cliff,” said CNN polling director Keating Holland.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355260470179</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 16:14:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355260691758-129</Id><Topic><Title>business and the people want the GOP to compromise</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355260470179</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 16:14:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>did that poll come from obama phone users as the demographic. look GOP said they will raise taxes...now it is up to obama to cut spending dim wit. business dont care, their taxes go up either way. they are to busy looking for off shore tax havens to care.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355260691758</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 16:18:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355260825685-130</Id><Topic><Title>business and the people want the GOP to compromise</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355260470179</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 16:14:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An article from the viewpoint of "who to blame?"

They stated clearly their only goal was to prevent Obama from being reelected. LOL now they can't understand why the public believes the GOP is the one that won't compromise. The more things change, the more they stay the same. On the eve of midterms elections that could make him House Speaker, John Boehner announced, "This is not a time for compromise." His lieutenant Mike Pence (R-IN) echoed that line, declaring that with a new Republican majority "there will be no compromise" with President Obama and the Democrats. Of course, with their record-setting use of the filibuster, unprecedented obstruction of presidential nominees, and unified no votes on almost every major piece of legislation, the past performance of Congressional Republicans is a guarantee of future results. Even before Barack Obama took the oath office, Republicans leaders, conservative think-tanks and right-wing pundits were calling for total obstruction of the new president's agenda. Bill Kristol, who helped block Bill Clinton's health care reform attempt in 1993, called for history to repeat on the Obama stimulus - and everything else. Pointing with pride to the Clinton economic program which received exactly zero GOP votes in either House, Kristol in January 2009 advised: "That it made, that it made it so much easier to then defeat his health care initiative. So, it's very important for Republicans who think they're going to have to fight later on on health care, fight later on maybe on some of the bank bailout legislation, fight later on on all kinds of issues.." And so, as the table above reveals, it came to pass. On issue after issue, even when President Obama extended his hand, Republicans showed him the back of theirs. Despite dedicating 40% of the $787 billion stimulus package to tax cuts (making it, as Steve Benen noted, the "biggest tax cut ever"), Obama got no GOP votes in the House and only three in the Senate. Months of painful concessions to supposedly moderate Senate Republicans only served to produce a watered-down health care bill - and no GOP support.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355261379165</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 16:29:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355261473901-134</Id><Topic><Title>Who is not compromising?</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355261067619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 16:24:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>harry will blame GOP now hahahahahahaah it is pretty obvious who is to blame here guys. john even kicked the tea party members out in hopes to compromise but harry says NO. someone needs to get him out of the way like we did the tea party.

Very few decent candidates wanted to run in either 2008, or 2012. Nobody wanted to inherit Clinton's subprime fiasco after it finally manifested in 2007. Nobody wanted to battle an obstructionist donkeydewsh congress. Fortunately, Obama won, and the dems lost the house after a two year donkeydewsh cir clejerk that did nothing to save the rest of the banks or the economy, but only instituted an additional national health care entitlement program. Can you imagine what donkeydewshes could have accomplished if they actually worked for two years? It's almost like Obama saved the osama attack until he needed some political capital.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355266462768</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 17:54:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355266643222-153</Id><Topic><Title>The O'bamas went to the zoo for one of their countless multi million dollar vacations</Title><Username>ivanhoeofoloxly</Username><Timestamp>1355265508337</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 17:38:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I meant to give that a thumbs up, but accidentally hit the RED THUMB!!

Powell looked at 13,950 articles. Out of all those reams of scientific results, how many disputed the reality of climate change? Twenty-four. Yup. Two dozen. Out of nearly 14,000. Now I know some people will just say that this is due to mainstream scientists suppressing controversy and all that, but let me be succinct: That’s bull. Science thrives on dissenting ideas, it grows and learns from them. If there is actual evidence to support an idea, it gets published. I can point out copious examples in my own field of astronomy where papers get published about all manners of against-the-mainstream thinking, some of which come to conclusions that, in my opinion, are clearly wrong. So let this be clear: There is no scientific controversy over this. Climate change denial is purely, 100 percent made-up political and corporate-sponsored crap. When the loudest voices are fossil-fuel funded think tanks, when they don’t publish in journals but instead write error-laden op-eds in partisan venues, when they have to manipulate the data to support their point, then what they’re doing isn’t science. It’s nonsense. And worse, it’s dangerous nonsense. Because they’re fiddling with the data while the world burns.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355275029969</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 20:17:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355275251509-177</Id><Topic><Title>Is The Kenyan Party Popular In America?</Title><Username>kaptnkirk53</Username><Timestamp>1355273317140</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 19:48:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Methie, All you need to know is "4 more years" .

They don't seem to have a grasp on the issue. It's not about preemptive blaming of the other side. It's about negotiation, eh? You will get your revenues by allowing the tax cuts on the middle class to continue, without raising the rates on the rich. Why not just let the tax cuts on the rich expire? Why do democrats need to raise revenues higher than the obvious raises that come with the cut expiration? Increases on Capital Gains rates are a key to economic regulation. They are like the discount rate. You change them a little, not a lot. You get a little more money for your programs. You don't get to spend the country into bankrupcy while the economy grows.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355275754171</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 20:29:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355275912482-180</Id><Topic><Title>baggers are so stupid</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355275029969</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 20:17:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Douches are dumber.

Then you can study economics for a few years and figure out how to create jobs, and what the republicans are really saying about it. It would require reading skills that you obviously don't possess. If you study politics for a while, you might learn that party platforms don't always mirror the exact theories of a dogmatic demagogue, and that several opinions on the issue might exist within a unified political party. If you study the issue enough, you might actually quote "who said what," by his name, and when by reviewing the calendar.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355276993344</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 20:49:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355277089542-186</Id><Topic><Title>HOW ABOUT THEM PATRIOTS !!!</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1355252066479</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 13:54:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To each his own,Surf.I like the Vegas shows and a little gambling.

Besides, if you spend too much time on the things you like, they lose their special meaning. It happened with traveling. I had to stop for a while because it was losing the novelty. I sailed for a long time, I stopped because it became routine. I do a lot of my personal work now online, so beating on repukes is just a little break in between. Living a life of leisure on a constant basis does not work that well.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1355285596289</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 23:13:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
