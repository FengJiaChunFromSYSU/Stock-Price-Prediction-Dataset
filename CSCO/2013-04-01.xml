This joy will not be a momentary display, but will go deep into their hearts and they'll forever speak of this day and rejoice!" Obama replied, "I seriously doubt that!

Extremely undervalued with 9.2mm o/s $24.6mm in cash no debt, current enterprise value of only $48.17mm or just 0.77X its trailing revenue of $62.59mm. Huge gross margins of 58.81%. EPS last quarter was up 100% from previous quarter and up 300% from two quarters ago! CCUR's MediaHawk video on demand (VOD) has recently rated as #1 in the industry by Current Analysis ahead of Cisco (CSCO)'s VOD solution. Virgin Media (VMED) the largest UK cable TV company with 3.8mm subscribers just selected CCUR's MediaHawk multi-screen video delivery platform over CSCO's multi-screen solution. CSCO received huge buzz in January after it announced their new cloud DVR product, but CCUR has superior cloud-based network DVR technology that it has been developing for many years and CCUR recently won a U.S. patent for technology that is foundational for network DVR services! Only CCUR's patented cloud-based network DVR technology solves the challenges of resource-allocation and management for the storage and distribution of content from a centralized, network-based system. Using factors such as demand, consumption level and timeliness of content, CCUR's technology enables automatic prioritization of resources for the ingest and delivery of content. This allows videos to record and playback at the same HD high quality of the original TV broadcast. Cablevision/Optimum recently became the first cable TV company to launch a network DVR service over the cloud, using their own technology developed internally, and initial reviews have been extremely negative due to them compressing videos and playing them back in much lower quality than the original HD broadcast. CCUR is set to lead the new cloud-based network DVR space that will make traditional DVR boxes obsolete like VCRs!</Msg><Username>asj48493</Username><Timestamp>1364817015974</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 07:50:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364818001194-26</Id><Title>winkipuss- Do you remember you promised us that you were leaving this board after Obama Won</Title><Msg>winkipuss- Do you remember you promised us that you were leaving this board after Obama Won and wouldn't return until 2016.

A joint paper by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of England dated Dec. 10, 2012, shows that these plans have been long in the making; that they originated with the G20 Financial Stability Board in Basel, Switzerland and that the result will be to deliver clear title to the banks of depositor funds. Can They Do That? Although few depositors realize it, legally the bank owns your funds as soon as you put your money in the bank. Our money becomes the bank's, and we become unsecured creditors holding IOUs or promises to pay. But until now the bank has been obligated to pay the money back on demand in the form of cash. Under the FDIC-BOE plan, our IOUs will be converted into "bank equity." The bank will get the money and we will get stock in the bank. With any luck we may be able to sell the stock to someone else, but when and at what price? Most people keep a deposit account so they can have ready cash to pay the bills. The 15-page FDIC-BOE document is called "Resolving Globally Active, Systemically Important, Financial Institutions." It begins by explaining that the 2008 banking crisis has made it clear that some other way besides taxpayer bailouts is needed to maintain "financial stability." Evidently anticipating that the next financial collapse will be on a grander scale than either the taxpayers or Congress is willing to underwrite, the authors state: An efficient path for returning the sound operations of the G-SIFI to the private sector would be provided by exchanging or converting a sufficient amount of the unsecured debt from the original creditors of the failed company [meaning the depositors] into equity [or stock]. In the U.S., the new equity would become capital in one or more newly formed bank operating entities.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1364830452969</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 11:34:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364830576230-99</Id><Topic><Title>Cyprus deal changed the rules.

(AP) — Authorities say they've broken up a major dogfighting ring in Mississippi as part of a monthslong investigation that started in California and could involve participants from around the country. David Murphy is an investigator with the Benton County Sheriff's Office in north Mississippi. He says at least 200 people were at the dogfight Saturday night when state and federal officers raided a barn in rural Benton County. Murphy said Monday that nearly 50 people were arrested and authorities are looking for others who fled, many leaving behind their vehicles. At least 70 vehicles were seized. He says shots were fired when officers arrived but nobody was hurt and authorities didn't return fire. About 20 dogs were rescued. Admission to the fight was $100.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364837509300</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:31:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364837578146-135</Id><Title>Evidently Ospearchucker Supporting BB player's legs Snap like twigs</Title><Msg>Shet!</Msg><Username>donkeydouchebags</Username><Timestamp>1364837578146</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:32:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364837676521-136</Id><Topic><Title>2 kommunist dictators</Title><Username>ivanhoeoflioxly</Username><Timestamp>1364834284707</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 12:38:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Desperation setting in,Dumb?LOL That the best you can come up with.

"This is a very sad and tragic event," Kanawha County Commissioner Kent Carper said. "We live in a very small community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Gandee family. The full details will be released later by the Kanawha County Sheriff Department." Gandee was one of the nine cast members of "Buckwild." The show follows a group of young adults trying to have fun in Sissonville, West Virginia, pulling stunts like turning a dump truck into a swimming pool or just riding around the woods on their all-terrain vehicles. Gandee was billed as a former high school prom king who had done "every job from coal mining to being a garbage man." The identities of the other two dead were not immediately known. Kanawha County sheriff's deputies had said earlier that they were searching for Gandee and his uncle, David Gandee.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364839136339</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:58:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364839295833-146</Id><Topic><Title>dumb magoo spend all day following my every word</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1364836846431</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:20:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dunno.........

In comparison, only 27 percent of independents and less than 15 percent of Democrats believed in the misinformation. Additionally, 64 percent of Republican respondents believe that President Obama was born in another country.

Law enforcement officers were seen patrolling one side of the courthouse, one holding a semi-automatic weapon, while others walked around inside. Authorities have said little about the investigation into the deaths of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, whose bodies were found Saturday. The couple's slayings came less than two weeks after Colorado's prison chief was shot to death at his front door, apparently by an ex-convict, and a couple of months after Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse was killed in a parking lot near his courthouse office. No arrests have been made in Hasse's Jan. 31 killing. "I don't want to walk around in fear every day ... but on the other hand, two months ago, we wouldn't be having this conversation," County Judge Bruce Wood, the county's top administrator, said Monday at a news conference. Law enforcement agencies throughout Texas were on high alert, and steps were being taken to better protect other DAs and their staffs. In Harris County, which includes Houston, District Attorney Mike Anderson said he accepted the sheriff's offer of 24-hour security for him and his family. Anderson said he also would take precautions at his office, the largest of its kind in Texas, with more than 270 prosecutors. "I think district attorneys across Texas are still in a state of shock," Anderson said Sunday.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1364847555780</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 16:19:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364848843203-191</Id><Topic><Title>First wave of municipal bankruptcy starts in Stockton Calif.</Title><Username>ka1524</Username><Timestamp>1364847356596</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 16:15:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>see what happens in blue states, spend spend spend. until you cant then blame blame blame.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1364848843203</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 16:40:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364849072997-192</Id><Topic><Title>States with the lowest number of college educated adults</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364846045741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 15:54:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who cares dope. college student are dopes like you. most of the greatest minds in history dropped out or skipped college all together. college is for dim wits who cant think on their own. only dumb would put so much value on college.

It includes, and modifies, previous gun regulation laws. It regulates the handling of knives, firearms and ammunition as well as acquisition, storage, commerce and maintenance of weapons. It also defines certain forbidden items such as nunchakus, switchblades and brass knuckles and bans their possession, bringing into circulation etc. It is considered as one of the strictest gun laws in the world. Compulsory insurance applies to those below a set income level and is provided through private non-profit "sickness funds" at common rates for all members, and is paid for with joint employer-employee contributions. Provider compensation rates are negotiated in complex corporatist social bargaining among specified autonomously organized interest groups (e.g. physicians' associations) at the level of federal states (Länder). The sickness funds are mandated to provide a wide range of coverages and cannot refuse membership or otherwise discriminate on an actuarial basis. Small numbers of persons are covered by tax-funded government employee insurance or social welfare insurance. Persons with incomes above the prescribed compulsory insurance level may opt into the sickness fund system, which a majority do, or purchase private insurance. Private supplementary insurance to the sickness funds of various sorts is available.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364853180790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:53:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364853242044-199</Id><Topic><Title>Turns out Ivan is a big fan of Germany, who knew</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364853180790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:53:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like those 70% tax rates Ivan, are you a socialist? Germany Tax Rates 2013 Last partial update, March 2013 Taxation of an individual's income is progressive. In other words, the higher the income, the higher the rate of tax payable. In 2013 the Germany tax rates for an individual are 14% - 45%. Singles pay on income above EUR 250,731 (couples, on income above EUR 501,462) income tax of 45% before 5.5% solidarity tax and 8%-9% church tax. In addition to regular tax, there is a municipal trade tax of 14%-17% that is imposed by the municipality. The standard rate of Germany corporate tax in 2013 is 15%. There is a reduced rate for part of a corporation's income. An additional tax has been imposed to help the merger of the two Germanys. This is "solidarity tax" which is 5.5% of the normal rate payable. The tax is levied on corporations and individuals, subject to the conditions specified in the law. In 2013 the effective corporate tax rate, including trade tax and solidarity tax is about 30%-33%.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364853242044</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:54:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364853268599-200</Id><Topic><Title>liberals thing when you graduate from college</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1364849310626</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 16:48:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was totally thinging that same think myself, old dude.</Msg><Username>quyinwoods</Username><Timestamp>1364853268599</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:54:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364853343432-201</Id><Topic><Title>deadpainting 'liberals thing when you graduate from college '</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1364852362140</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:39:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Half of a ninth grade education at best.</Msg><Username>quyinwoods</Username><Timestamp>1364853343432</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:55:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364854330638-202</Id><Title>GUNS are fun and protect your children</Title><Msg>Alabama boy, 4, fatally shoots self in chest after attending Easter services Published April 01, 2013 Associated Press PRICHARD, Ala. – A 4-year-old boy is dead after a shooting in Prichard.

Some have claimed that President Obama removed the bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office and sent it back to the British Embassy. Now, normally we wouldn’t address a rumor that’s so patently false, but just this morning the Washington Post’s Charles Krauthammer repeated this ridiculous claim in his column. He said President Obama “started his Presidency by returning to the British Embassy the bust of Winston Churchill that had graced the Oval Office.” This is 100% false. The bust still in the White House. In the Residence. Outside the Treaty Room. News outlets have debunked this claim time and again. First, back in 2010 the National Journal reported that “the Churchill bust was relocated to a prominent spot in the residence to make room for Abraham Lincoln, a figure from whom the first African-American occupant of the Oval Office might well draw inspiration in difficult times.” And just in case anyone forgot, just last year the AP reported that President Obama “replaced the Oval Office fixture with a bust of one of his American heroes, President Abraham Lincoln, and moved the Churchill bust to the White House residence.” Of course we can all understand why the tea billies would be upset that Obama put in a bust of Abraham Lincoln in the White House, Lincoln was black after all.

The driver on the bus says move on back. To the back of the bus.

Under the order, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) must cut its current budget by more than $30 million, 5 percent of the current 2013 appropriation, by September 30, 2013. In order to help achieve these savings and protect core programs, the BLS will eliminate two programs, including Mass Layoff Statistics, and all "measuring green jobs" products. The final release of Mass Layoffs Statistics data will occur on June 21st, with publication of the May 2013 data. Employers took 1,422 mass layoff actions in February involving 135,468 workers as measured by new filings for unemployment insurance benefits during the month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. (Data are seasonally adjusted.) Each mass layoff involved at least 50 workers from a single employer. Mass layoff events increased by 94 from January, and the number of associated initial claims increased by 1,442. In February, 295 mass layoff events were reported in the manufacturing sector resulting in 39,407 initial claims. Monthly mass layoff data are identified using administrative data sources without regard to layoff duration.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1364871331883</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 22:55:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364874023272-262</Id><Title>Cisco upgraded to POS</Title><Msg>from complete destroyer of funds to POS.
