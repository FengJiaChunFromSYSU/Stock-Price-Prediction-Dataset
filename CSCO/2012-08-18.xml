But Ryan’s cuts to Medicaid and to other programs for the poor are, on the whole, much more severe than his cuts to Medicare. For one thing, they start now, rather than 10 years from now. And for another, they’re just larger. The cut to Medicaid is about a third of the program’s projected spending. CVH: I do believe it’s been missed. But I do want to emphasize that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan would have immediate cost increases for seniors. I know they like to talk about the fact that their plan doesn’t really begin till 10 years from now, but for seniors with high prescription drug costs, the Ryan-Romney plan would increase their costs immediately. And if you decide not to take the savings in Obamacare, you pass that onto seniors in the form of higher co-pays. So it’s not true their plan doesn’t have an impact for 10 years. That said, I certainly agree that the Romney-Ryan budget has a dramatic, negative effect on Medicaid. According to the Congressional Budget Office it will cut Medicaid by one-third over 10 years. That’s a huge hit, and a lot of people don’t realize that two-thirds of Medicaid spending goes to support seniors in nursing homes and individuals with disabilities. That would dramatically hurt seniors who rely on Medicaid and low-income families and kids.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345293363611</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 08:36:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345293595940-11</Id><Title>not going away Mitt</Title><Msg>If Mitt Romney wants to put an end to speculation over his personal finances, he needs to release multiple years of tax returns. His assurance last week that he paid at least 13 percent of his income in federal income tax annually for the last decade won't do it, and he should not be so offended by the requests for more openness. Nothing more is being demanded of Romney than has been routinely asked of and received from most other recent candidates for president, and there is no reason to treat him differently just because of his wealth. Romney's response to a reporter's question in South Carolina was an attempt to quell the unsubstantiated claim by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid earlier this month that Romney paid no taxes some years. But in fact, Romney's answer just reinforced that wealth sets him apart — he paid a lower percentage of his income in taxes than many other upper-income Americans — and he won't give voters a chance to verify his claim for themselves. Republican presidential nominee John McCain was an outlier in releasing only two years of tax returns in 2008. Every major party presidential nominee in recent history has released multiple years of tax returns to enable voters to evaluate their financial interests and potential conflicts. That includes Romney's father, then-Michigan Gov. George Romney, who released 12 years of tax returns in his 1968 bid for the Republican presidential nomination. Much has been made of why Mitt Romney isn't willing to do the same. Economists who have examined his tax returns for 2010 and a summary of 2011 say they raise more questions than answers. How, for example, did Romney come to have an individual retirement account worth $100 million? What was the purpose of offshore accounts? And some have even wondered if Romney is refusing to release returns because he may have taken advantage of an IRS amnesty program in 2009 that allowed Americans to return funds to domestic accounts with minimal penalty.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345293595940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 08:39:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345294651910-12</Id><Title>McCarthy's advice to Mitt go to Staples</Title><Msg>yeah good advice, perhaps Mitt should check out how staples stock is in free fall and looks like it may go bankrupt before the election, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345294651910</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 08:57:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345295412561-13</Id><Title>How Romney-Ryan could weaken traditional Medicare</Title><Msg>the truth will out</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345295412561</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:10:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345297150398-14</Id><Topic><Title>GOP = No global warming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,idiots</Title><Username>dfallis32</Username><Timestamp>1345295414786</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:10:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is amazing that a major political party believes higher education is a threat</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345297150398</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:39:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345298276155-15</Id><Topic><Title>Obama admits doing Cocaine</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1344047013639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 22:23:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well Reid set the standard for that, guilty until proven innocent.

Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) home state have launched PrayforPaulsChangeofHeart.org, a website asking people to pray for the vice presidential candidate to change his position on his plan for the federal budget. This group, which includes Franciscan friars, joins in the growing protests from Catholic clergy concerned about the impact Ryan’s deep cuts in social programs will have on vulnerable members of society. The group cites the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which in April sent a public letter to the House saying the Ryan budget would hurt poor families, seniors, and the unemployed. The website explains that the Ryan budget flies in the face of Catholic social teachings: Paul Ryan is a sincere Catholic and a brother in Christ, and we ask him to reconnect with the compassion for the poor and vulnerable that is rooted in our consciences and articulated by the Catholic Church. The US Catholic bishops wrote a series of letters about the House budget proposed by Rep. Ryan, saying that his cuts “will hurt hungry children, poor families, vulnerable seniors and workers who cannot find employment. These cuts are unjustified and wrong.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345299938432</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 10:25:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345300734667-20</Id><Title>where are your tax returns showing voter fraud Mitt?</Title><Msg>None of them is really satisfactory, because none of them posits Romney concealing any facts more harmful than the blowback he is getting for not producing more returns. The problem may be that all of the prominent theories (with a couple of under-noticed exceptions) assume Romney is trying to conceal facts about his finances. Like the purloined letter pinned prominently in plain sight, what Romney’s really hiding might be something more mundane: the home address written on the top of the tax form. That address that might reveal a connection between the “tax returns” brouhaha and the “voter fraud” fizzle – which may be the strongest explanation of all. [...] But the Romneys, arbitrarily, refuse to disclose a copy of the returns they filed in 2010 or 2009 (for tax years 2009 and 2008) – which, perhaps not coincidentally, bracket the time period when Romney allegedly committed fraud by voting in Massachusetts when he actually resided in California. So here’s the question: did Romney put his son’s basement’s address on the returns he filed in 2009 and 2010? Or did he truthfully use his real (non-Massachusetts) address, thus implicating himself in voter fraud? [...] A felony voter fraud charge could expose Romney to fines and/or imprisonment, jeopardize Romney’s standing with the Michigan State Bar, and – worst of all, in the political sense – would be a mortal embarrassment on the campaign trail, both to himself and to down-ticket Republicans (especially Republican Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, who won the special election in question but is locked in a tight, highly-publicized race against the popular Elizabeth Warren to retain his seat).

No new tax returns!” With no more than a stern horse-trainer's tone and jabbing finger, Ann proved more effective than her husband Mitt at silencing calls for more family tax disclosures. Political observers now believe this ends all questions about whether the Romneys pay less taxes than the stable boy who cares for their Olympic horse Rafalca. “I appreciate all Americans who accept our word that we’re being transparent,” Ann said. “Look, all my wealth is in a blind trust. Even I don’t know what’s in there. So we’re not hiding anything from the voters that isn’t being hidden from me. How much more transparent can we be than that?” With the tax return issue now behind them, Ann opened up about an issue very dear to her heart: removing the stigma under which elite stay-at-home wives have long suffered. “People misunderstand wealthy stay-at-home moms and think we like being stuck at home,” she said. “Heck no. We’d much rather be ladies who lunch or trophy wives entrusted with credit cards to go on shopping sprees. Believe me: it doesn’t take long for even the most luxurious 8-bedroom, 12½-bath lake home to feel like a prison.” Ann emphasized she’s not bitter and doesn’t regret never using her BYU French degree to pursue a lucrative career of her own. In fact, the opposite is true. She was so proud of her stay-at-home work that she opted to remain at home another 12 years after the last of her children left for college. The stay-at-home achievement she’s most proud is ensuring her children developed unique identities outside their prominent father’s shadow. This began at birth by not allowing Mitt to name the children after himself or any of the great polygamists in Mormon history. “I insisted our five boys be named as differently as possible from Mitt. That’s why they’re named Matt, Tagg, Taxx, Dodge and Gordon Gekko,” Ann said. “This helped them become true individuals and avoid becoming stay-at-home sons as adults – as befalls far too many children from great wealth.” When Ann becomes First Lady, her dream is to host the first-ever White House Stay-at-Home Summit. But if this is too ambitious an undertaking, she’ll settle for hosting weekly live Tweet sessions during midday episodes of Giada at Home on the Food Network.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345316518467</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 15:01:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345316944716-43</Id><Topic><Title>Next time Camp O'bama asks......</Title><Username>teapartysaveus</Username><Timestamp>1345316339912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 14:58:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama has released his tax records, why hasn't Mitt?

Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to the people. Where do you think it goes? Whose pockets? Whose pockets? People's pockets. Human beings, my friend." - Mitt Romney (August 2011) Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, and the Republican Party still strongly assert that money from tax cuts and credits given to corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent will "trickle down" to the rest of us. They believe this despite 30 years of empirical economic data that shows supply-side economics just doesn’t work. Know any doubters? This video illustrates the failure of "Trickle Down" economic policies in a way that even a child could understand. Will you share it? This long held GOP belief in the idea of "Trickle Down" economics has dominated the economic debate, resulting in two sustained eras of tax cuts aimed at the wealthy. But what do we have to show for it? A broken economy, the largest wealth gap in more than 50 years, a diminishing middle class, and corporations that act like the U.S. economy is their own private playground. It is pretty clear that "Trickle Down" doesn't work, but policies that build and strengthen our middle class can. We need your help to get the word out! Please share our "Once Upon a Trickle Down" video on Twitter and Facebook to inform the public that these policies have only made the 1 percent wealthier and brought on this recession. Together we can fight for economic policies that will strengthen our economy and revitalize our middle class.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345318061262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 15:27:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345318382360-46</Id><Title>Tax fraud and voter fraud</Title><Msg>saved you a lot of money in CA taxes by claiming to live in your sons basement didn't it Mitt? If Mitt Romney wants to put an end to speculation over his personal finances, he needs to release multiple years of tax returns. His assurance last week that he paid at least 13 percent of his income in federal income tax annually for the last decade won't do it, and he should not be so offended by the requests for more openness. Nothing more is being demanded of Romney than has been routinely asked of and received from most other recent candidates for president, and there is no reason to treat him differently just because of his wealth. Romney's response to a reporter's question in South Carolina was an attempt to quell the unsubstantiated claim by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid earlier this month that Romney paid no taxes some years. But in fact, Romney's answer just reinforced that wealth sets him apart — he paid a lower percentage of his income in taxes than many other upper-income Americans — and he won't give voters a chance to verify his claim for themselves. Republican presidential nominee John McCain was an outlier in releasing only two years of tax returns in 2008. Every major party presidential nominee in recent history has released multiple years of tax returns to enable voters to evaluate their financial interests and potential conflicts. That includes Romney's father, then-Michigan Gov. George Romney, who released 12 years of tax returns in his 1968 bid for the Republican presidential nomination. Much has been made of why Mitt Romney isn't willing to do the same. Economists who have examined his tax returns for 2010 and a summary of 2011 say they raise more questions than answers. How, for example, did Romney come to have an individual retirement account worth $100 million? What was the purpose of offshore accounts? And some have even wondered if Romney is refusing to release returns because he may have taken advantage of an IRS amnesty program in 2009 that allowed Americans to return funds to domestic accounts with minimal penalty.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345318382360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 15:33:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345320575590-47</Id><Title>Where is the ignor button??

Where are Jim, Tim and Franklin now? Here's a quick look into the three former Fannie Mae executives who brought down Wall Street. Franklin Raines - was a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Fannie Mae. Raines was forced to retire from his position with Fannie Mae when auditing discovered severe irregularities in Fannie Mae's accounting activities. Raines left with a "golden parachute valued at $240 Million in benefits. The Government filed suit against Raines when the depth of the accounting scandal became clear. Tim Howard - was the Chief Financial Officer of Fannie Mae. Howard "was a strong internal proponent of using accounting strategies that would ensure a "stable pattern of earnings" at Fannie. Investigations by federal regulators and the company's board of directors since concluded that management did manipulate 1998 earnings to trigger bonuses. Raines and Howard resigned under pressure in late 2004. Howard's Golden Parachute was estimated at $20 Million! Jim Johnson - A former executive at Lehman Brothers and who was later forced from his position as Fannie Mae CEO. Investigators found that Fannie Mae had hidden a substantial amount of Johnson's 1998 compensation from the public, reporting that it was between $6 million and $7 million when it fact it was $21 million." Johnson is currently under investigation for taking illegal loans from Countrywide while serving as CEO of Fannie Mae. Johnson's Golden Parachute was estimated at $28 Million. **************************************************************************** WHERE ARE THEY NOW? FRANKLIN RAINES? Raines works for the Obama Campaign as his Chief Economic Advisor. TIM HOWARD? Howard is a Chief Economic Advisor to Obama under Franklin Raines. JIM JOHNSON? Johnson was hired as a Senior Obama Finance Advisor and was selected to run Obama's Vice Presidential Search Committee. Kinda makes you sick to your stomach. Our government is rotten to the core !

Graham, the elder nor the son, have authority to label anyone as christian on not christian. I think both will agree that is beyond their purview. Maybe when they are awarded halos. If you are trying to recognize activities as christian then the Catholic church has deemed the GOP budget not to be such. Then again maybe what the catholic church says is "not Christian " depending on what your church teaches.

Here what Franklin 'Graham said. "If he says he’s a Christian, I’m not going to say he’s not,” Mr. Graham said of the president. “For me, the definition of a Christian is whether we have given our life to Christ and are following him in faith and we have trusted him as our lord and savior.” " No one said Romney closed that plant so his wife would die but that they intentionally closed the plant. The death was just one outcome of that shut down. You are just reading in to it what you want to make of it. By the way that ad was never run or put out by Obama or any PAC. It was only aired by press who saw it and decided to run with it.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345343601027</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 22:33:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345343765415-69</Id><Topic><Title>How come Dumb Dumb Ivan LIES all day , EVERYDAY</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1345335303099</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 20:15:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ad Hominem again?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345343765415</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 22:36:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345344333565-70</Id><Topic><Title>according to Obama, Romney is a felon and murderer, so my question how much lower can a President go</Title><Username>gergray1968</Username><Timestamp>1345327236394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 18:00:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Have you read the bible? Do you know what Jesus was doing? Do you understand the fight going on between his house and the Maccabees? Do you know how outrageous his attacks were considered. They were even called miracles. Raising the excommunicated from the dead, allowing the common man to have wine and bread at the wedding feast., allowing women as disciples, He was punished for his slanderous outrageous remarks.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345344333565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 22:45:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
