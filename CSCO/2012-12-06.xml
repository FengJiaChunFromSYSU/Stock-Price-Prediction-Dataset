"I'm not a scientist, man," he replied when asked about the Earth's age. This morning, Rubio -- perhaps having completing the world's speediest Ph.D program -- revised his position. "Science says (the Earth) is about 4.5 billion years old. My faith teaches that's not inconsistent," he said at a Playbook breakfast.

In other words, your tax proposal will not change the marginal rate, and due to the sunset, the rich will pay as much as you lower the rate to. If you lower the rate,more republicans will probably sign. It's just that simple. Lower the cap gains on people earning over $200,000K to 20%, and they will probably jump over each other to sign it after the cliff, which raises rates to about 39%. It's not a raise in rates, its a sunset provision on a tax cut. Semantics. It's win-win.

It appears to win for Oblamer, because marginal rates are returned to Clinton levels, but the cliff is just the expiration of a temporary tax cut. It doesn't "raise" tax rates. Democrats need to replace a temporary tax cut, with a new temporary tax cut. The text of Pelosi's bill appears to raise a marginal rate, and cannot be signed as it currently reads. It should read "cut" rates, instead of "substituting `25%' for `28%' each place it appears (before the application of subparagraph (B)), and" She is selling a change from 25% to 28% as a tax cut to the middle class?

At a brief news conference following a closed-door meeting with rank-and-file Republicans, Mr. Boehner said House Republicans had produced a "balanced approach" in their own offer released Monday. The White House and House Republicans have been trading proposals aimed at avoiding the fiscal cliff as part of talks that have played out extensively on a public stage. Mr. Boehner's comments came as there was little sign of progress between the White House and congressional Republicans on efforts to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. The White House has insisted that tax rates must rise for upper-income Americans as part of any deal, while Republican leaders have said that approach would hurt the economy.

By setting up in Luxembourg, and channeling sales through its units there, the world's biggest online retailer could minimize corporate taxes. It was a move with big financial consequences. Amazon's Luxembourg arrangements have deprived European governments of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax that it might otherwise have owed, as reported in European newspapers. But a Reuters examination of accounts filed by 25 Amazon units in six countries shows how they also allowed the company to avoid paying more tax in the United States, where the company is based. In effect, Amazon used inter-company payments to form a tax shield for the group, behind which it has accumulated $2 billion to help finance its expansion. Amazon revealed last year that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wants $1.5 billion in back taxes. The claim, which Amazon said it would "vigorously contest", is linked to its foreign subsidiaries and payments made between them. The issue highlights the way multinationals reduce their taxes by parking intellectual property in tax havens and charging affiliates big fees for using it. Politicians in rich countries are beginning to target such practices, which have been used by other multinationals including Google and Microsoft.

For government tax purposes, the term "small business" can be misleading. What is included generally are all who report "business income" on a pass-through basis. These can be very wealthy individuals who have set up investments as partnerships or S corporations to reduce their taxes, including many hedge funds. According to a 2008 study by the Joint Committee on Taxation — a nonprofit arm of Congress — 61% of all net income from partnerships and S corporations are earned by those with gross receipts of more than $10 million, and almost half — 43% — have receipts exceeding $50 million! Hardly small — and often not a business that hires anyone. So a huge bulk of the tax benefits would go to those who have no impact on job creation. Will a tax cut for the wealthy have a trickle down benefit for small business? Nope. According to the independent, highly-regarded Congressional Budget Office, the Bush era tax cuts have the lowest stimulative effect of 11 stimulus policies examined. For every $1 in tax cuts, only 10 cents to 40 cents are returned to the economy.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354826238323</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 15:37:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354826303290-130</Id><Topic><Title>REPUKES HAVE MISSED THE ENTIRE RECOVERY...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1354825626944</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 15:27:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What did you expect when you sent crack addicts and single moms to college?

For specific Islamic dynasties, see List of Muslim empires and dynasties. This article is part of a series on: Islam A caliphate (from the Arabic خلافة or khilāfa, Turkish: Hilafet) is a Muslim spiritual community led by a supreme religious (and even political) leader known as a caliph (meaning literally a successor, i.e. a successor to the prophet Mohammad). The term caliphate is often applied to successions of Muslim empires that have existed in the Middle East and Southwest Asia. Conceptually the caliphate represents the political unity of the entire community of Muslim faithful (the ummah) ruled by a single caliph. In theory, the organization of a caliphate should be a constitutional republic[1] (the Constitution being the Constitution of Medina), which means that the head of state, the Caliph, and other officials are representatives of the people and of Islam and must govern according to constitutional and religious law, or Sharia. In its early days, the first caliphate resembled elements of direct democracy (see shura) and an elective monarchy.[2] It was initially led by Muhammad's disciples as a continuation of the leaders and religious system the prophet established, known as the 'Rashidun caliphates'. A "caliphate" is also a state which implements such a governmental system. Sunni Islam stipulates that the head of state, the caliph, should be elected by Shura – elected by Muslims or their representatives.[3] Followers of Shia Islam believe the caliph should be an imam chosen by God from the Ahl al-Bayt (Muhammad's purified progeny). From the end of the Rashidun period until 1924, caliphates, sometimes two at a single time, real and illusory, were ruled by dynasties. The first dynasty was the Umayyad. This was followed by the Abbasid, the Fatimid (not recognized by Muslims outside the Fatimid domain), and finally the Ottoman Dynasty. The caliphate was "the core leader concept of Sunni Islam, by the consensus of the Muslim majority in the early centuries</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1354844209535</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 20:36:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354844349934-210</Id><Topic><Title>MONKEY GEORGE, KARZAI THE MONKEY BLAMES US FOR AFGHAN VIOLENCE...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1354837311039</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 18:41:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What MONKEY ? our bonobo POTUS ???</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1354844349934</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 20:39:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354844454790-211</Id><Topic><Title>ONLY 41% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE COUNTRY HEADED IN RIGHT DIRECTION</Title><Username>gregu456</Username><Timestamp>1354843369987</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 20:22:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bet 95% of that 41% were bought off with free cell phones or other gimmick offers.</Msg><Username>jbhdullass2000</Username><Timestamp>1354844454790</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 20:40:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354844466749-212</Id><Topic><Title>The Kenyan kills 4 Americans in Benghazi and the anti-American kommie media is</Title><Username>ivanhoeofoloxly</Username><Timestamp>1354829236847</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:27:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shouldn't the Mahdi be here already?

TSA baggage screener Sean Henry, 32, was arrested on Tuesday after a sting operation conducted jointly by the TSA and the Port Authority Police Department caught Henry leaving the airport with two iPads that had been planted as part of the sting, as well as numerous other electronics devices he had allegedly stolen from passengers. Just as in a recent ABC News investigation of thefts by TSA agents, the sting used the iPads' own tracking capabilities to follow the stolen tablets' movements. " Read full story at ABC News.
