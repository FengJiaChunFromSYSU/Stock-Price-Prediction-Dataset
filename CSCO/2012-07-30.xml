This may be a small thing to Romney, but to Christians and Mus lims this is huge. It shows Romney as incapable of understanding the problems of the MiddleEast and as a result, has given the terrorists more ammunition to bolster their recruiting and attacks on the U.S and its service people. How many more lives will be lost as a result of this inept candidate?</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo4</Username><Timestamp>1343665014365</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 12:16:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343665450971-39</Id><Topic><Title>ALLnewMAGOO27 LIKE his Savior Obama, Never Served in the MILITARY</Title><Username>deepscrotum</Username><Timestamp>1343660297611</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:58:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Magoo may enlist now that they've done away with DADT.

We don't need tax increases, we need tax reform. Tax increases at this stage will only serve to put more people in unemployment lines. Tax reform will automatically make rich pay more. I don't know why anyone would vote for a jerk who basically lied to young people about having an open administration, cut the budget deficit in half, promised stimulus for infrastructure projects then turn around and give it to his union cronies, green intiative fiascos- then say "oh well", took more vacations and golf outings as President in the history of the US, hired more than 30 czars to run goverment agencies bypassing Congress, a first lady who has 22 assistants ( God knows what for) when every previous first lady had one; turn the White House into a party affair in the first two years while majority of Americans are struggling. Let me see, he didn't really get interested in solving the employment issue until his 4th year because there is an election. Ok let's use rich vs poor angle, rich pay their fair share angle, race card angle: makes me wanna puke cause he's taking you young voters down the same path. We are at a critical junction in US history. If you think Obama with no clue how the economy works (like all politicians who live off the backs of hard working Americans) will take us to the promise land of prosperity- then vote for him. He will take you and your minions for another ride of living like a King off the backs of hard working Americans. This guy will double our national debt in 8 years if re-elected with taxes the likes you have never seen. You're living in a fairy tale if you think the rich are the only ones who will have to pay taxes. Let this sink in- 20% of the top Americans pay around 92% of all federal income taxes. Dude- we're already a welfare state. You better hope Romney wins if we have a snow balls chance of turning the US around by implementing sound policies like tax reform, reduce regulations which choke small/medium business from growing, entitlement reform ( dude ask the government where they put all the social security savings); and last which is what I like - cut out none essential government. We have no money. GET IT! This nation will endure another crisis soon because Obama and his cronies is taking away our one advantage -cheap energy - which is critical for growth. In less than 4 years he is killing the oil drilling industry, putting ridiculous regulation on utilities which will cost you 40-50% more in the next 5 years, growing a bigger government when we have fewer working people which we haven't seen since 1982; more regulations on cars, health insurance, financial industry, epa, chemicals; food, pharmaceuticals. If you vote for this guy again, I can promise more pain and suffering the likes we've never seen as a nation and the sad thing- it will be irreversable.</Msg><Username>mec2invest</Username><Timestamp>1343677496855</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 15:44:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343678155008-60</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's FAIR, upper 10% pay 97%</Title><Username>obbie_bs</Username><Timestamp>1343676758721</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 15:32:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The top 10% pay approximately 70% of the federal income taxes.The bottom 50% pay about 3%.

(CSCO) chief executive John Chambers, when asked on Monday about the possibility of more layoffs, told Fox Business Network that it is "actually a little bit the reverse." The networking equipment company last week announced it was shedding 1,300 jobs, or 2% of its work force, in what Mr. Chambers said today was "about moving resources around, about positioning ourselves where the industry needs to go." Mr. Chambers, speaking from the Olympic Games in London, said the company doesn't worry about competitors in China or the U.S. Cisco's customers have said there is now more balance and consistency in the U.S. economy, Chambers told Fox Business Network. When asked how the U.S. can encourage growth, Mr. Chambers mentioned Canada's education, immigration and entrepreneurial systems and said the U.K. has a pro-jobs and pro-business environment. "We are going to bet big on the U.K.," Mr. Chambers said.</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1343693305825</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 20:08:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343693590427-92</Id><Topic><Title>MITT TRYING TO PUMP UP GAS PRICES</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1343663472228</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 11:51:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Strange.Romney said same thing Obama has been saying.... hoping sanctions work but all options are on the table.

There is no justification for that kind of behavior and, again, we need to jail these criminals not tax them, especially the ones outsourcing our jobs overseas. I agree with you 100% on the government spending subject. The previous regime and the current one are totally out of control. Bush added 7 trillion to the national debt and Obama added 5 trillion already. That is totally unacceptable. We need a NEW party that works for the working American people. The reason I'm voting for Obama again is because he didn't kill anyone that didn't deserve to be killed and at least wasted the money in this country.
