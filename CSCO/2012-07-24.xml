Well meaning Prohibitionists outlawed the sell of alcohol in the US for similar reasons. Alcohol is by far the most dangerous drug in our culture, and responsible for far more deaths than guns!!! 50,000 Americans die in MVA....many to most involve 'drunk drivers'..... Illicit drugs drive all sorts of crimes, deadly and other wise. Porno causes unknown amount of suffering. Wasn't Holmes involved in all of these? Including guns? A change of the human heart is required for all of us. Jesus said, "You must be born again." A do-over, a death of the old self and a rising of the new, a mystical change involving powerful internal, spiritual, changes to the deepest human psyche. That is the essence of Christianity, that has changed the world. Laws are important for civilization, but do nothing to change the heart of man. "no man is an island"....we are all in this together. Life will be a struggle, but without the indwelling power of God, it is overwhelmingly difficult.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1343131838639</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 08:10:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343132251713-13</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo won't allow urls anymore</Title><Username>pn1409</Username><Timestamp>1343129600715</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 07:33:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so is ebay! capitalists fight back to control to make $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ profits!</Msg><Username>bvioml123</Username><Timestamp>1343132251713</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 08:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343132361141-14</Id><Topic><Title>sandusky and paterno voted for bush twice</Title><Username>marie_the_liar</Username><Timestamp>1343128641172</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 07:17:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Penn State To Sell The Joe Paterno Statue Written by Abel Rodriguez Thank you for your rating,Your vote has been counted and is reflected above. You have already rated this item,Thank you for your support. Topics: University, Statue, Penn State, Joe Paterno Sunday, 22 July 2012 Penn State has been ordered to change their Nittany Lions nickname. (Photo by Ndamukong Suh). UNIVERSITY PARK, Pennsylvania - A spokesperson for the highly scandalized Penn State University has just confirmed reports that the school board of directors has voted unanimously to remove the 7-foot tall, 901 pound statue of former head coach Joe Paterno located just outside of Beaver Stadium. The statue which was unveiled in 2009, has become a negative focal point of angry, bitter discussions some of which have escalated to the point of childish ranting, bullying tactics, and in three isolated instances fisticuffs. University spokesperson Calhoun "Lips" Lippalino stated that the school has received tens of thousands of angry letters, emails, text messages, and phone calls demanding that the statue be taken down. One individual even went as far as to say that if the statue is not removed by July 28, he will personally burn it down. The individual, who has been identified as Tobias "Bitter Mouth" Snickerwick, 29, has been forced by Pennsylvania law enforcement officials to enter into The Henry and Betty Ford Rehab Clinic in Los Angeles for a 12-week stay. Lippalino informed the throng of media reporters that at first the statue was going to be hauled off and dumped in the Atlantic Ocean. But he explained that the cost would have been much too high. He then said that it was suggested that the statue be given to a local day care center, but of course that was without a doubt one of the stupidest ideas imaginable. Lippalino pointed out that the Penn State home economics professor who suggested that lame-brained idea has been terminated and told to clear out her personal belongings from her office immediately. School officials refused to mention the professor's name and explained that it was really nobody's business. [EDITOR'S NOTE: Well wrong again Penn State folks. It is everybody's business and I made a couple of phone calls and learned that the home ec professor is 61-year-old Estella P. Quackingbush, who allegedly had a one-sided, unrequited love affair with Coach Paterno.] And amazingly enough at the suggestion of one of Penn State's campus janitors, Kydell "The Mop" Crackenbock, the statue will be sold to the North Korean Government for $615. North Korean authorities were contacted and stated that they will be melting down the statue just as soon as they receive it and fashioning it into a usable missile. SIDENOTE: The NCAA has issued a statement that they have instructed Penn State University to legally change the mascot nickname from the Nittany Lions to the much more politically correct and highly appropriate Nittany Lying Lions.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1343132361141</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 08:19:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343134246872-15</Id><Topic><Title>Death penalty "considered" for Colorado shooter?</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1343103620967</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 00:20:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Naturally, you ASSumed I was suggesting there be no trial.

By Dan Gallagher SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Shares of Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO -4.85% fell by 4.6% to $15.33 on Tuesday morning after several analysts warned that VMware's VMW -1.27% $1.26 billion acquisition of Nicira the night before could pose a threat to the networking giant. Arch-rival Juniper JNPR -3.55% also saw its shares fall more than 2% to $14.89 in early trades. In a note to clients, Isreal Hernandez of MKM Partners said the VMware deal posed "significant negative implications" for both companies. Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer wrote that "we believe the concept of network virtualization is still in its infancy but in the long run can threaten Cisco as some of the network features are executed by the virtual layer vs. the physical switch, thus reducing its perceived value."</Msg><Username>lshookkent</Username><Timestamp>1343139623734</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 10:20:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343139704817-31</Id><Title>BARONS SAYS Competition to HURT CSCO</Title><Msg>The Street this morning is mulling the implications of VMWare‘s (VMW) announcement last night it will buy startup Nicira for $1.05 billion in cash, a move that could have implications for Cisco Systems.

Jon Kyl (R-AZ) defended Republicans’ willingness to shut down the government over funding for Planned Parenthood by falsely claiming that abortion is “well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.” In reality, just three percent of its work is related to abortion. This afternoon, CNN brought on Planned Parenthood’s Judy Tabar to discuss his comment. During the interview, CNN anchor TJ Holmes relayed a statement from Kyl’s office walking back the comment, claiming the statement was not meant to be “factual”: HOLMES: We did call his office trying to ask what he was talking about there. And I just want to give it you verbatim here. It says, ‘his remark was not intended to be a factual statement, but rather to illustrate that Planned Parenthood, a organization that receives millions of dollars in taxpayer funding, does subsidize abortions.’</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343145674009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 12:01:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343145931457-49</Id><Topic><Title>12 PE 2% Yield</Title><Username>topline1</Username><Timestamp>1343137242163</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 09:40:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes on todays earns....what happens if the earns go down what happens to PE then? hint economy is bad just ask UPS.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1343145931457</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 12:05:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343146101484-50</Id><Title>down 30% in 3 months</Title><Msg>worthless overpaid so called executives. outsource their jobs now!</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1343146101484</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 12:08:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343146659526-51</Id><Title>BAN PICK UP TRUCKS!!! 14 DEAD IN TRUCK-TREE ENCOUNTER IN TEXAS!!!</Title><Msg>Oh yes, one other fact....all illegals!!!

Even if Nicera was worthless (which I doubt), a $2B cash purchase price for a $10B market cap reversion sounds like a good deal to me, versus letting that cash sit in a savings account that cannot even keep up with inflation.

He walked past desks littered with laptops and headed straight toward the cubicle of one of the company’s top engineers. The assailant appeared to know exactly what he wanted, which was a bulky computer that stored Nicira’s source code. He grabbed the one machine and fled. The whole operation lasted five minutes, according to video captured on an employee’s webcam. Palo Alto Police Sergeant Dave Flohr describes the burglary as a run-of-the-mill Silicon Valley computer grab.

April 2012-Cisco has invested $100 million in a networking startup called Insieme that was started by three Cisco employees. Interestingly enough, the company also has the option to pony up $750 million more to buy the company, according to a memo obtained by the New York Times. Insieme was founded by Cisco employees Mario Mazzola, Luca Cafiero, and Prem Jain in January to address issues in advanced networking. Specifically, it focuses on software-defined networking (SDN), an somewhat easier and less expensive way to deploy cloud computing systems. The Cisco memo describes it this way: Insieme’s product development efforts are complementary to that of Cisco’s current and planned internal investments. Insieme and other internal programs will be components of Cisco’s broader programmability framework. These types of investments have strongly benefitted Cisco in the past, and we will continue to look for similar ways to complement our internal development capabilities. If Cisco did acquire Insieme, that would make it a “spin-in,” because it was created with Cisco’s backing. Spin-ins can help create innovative products faster than complex organizations can. However, as the Times points out, spin-ins can “risk hurting company morale by making some star employees multimillionaires with little risk.”</Msg><Username>lshookkent</Username><Timestamp>1343160951550</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 16:15:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343160993189-134</Id><Topic><Title>00PM EDT|After Hours: 15.35 0.21 (1.39%) 4:12PM EDT - Nasdaq Real Time Price</Title><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1343160855245</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 16:14:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is NOT a current price.

"Sadly, this president has diminished American leadership, and we are reaping the consequences," Romney said. The Republican presidential candidate spoke to the VFW convention in Reno, Nev., one day after Obama addressed the same gathering. Romney spoke ahead of an overseas tour that will take him to Britain, Israel and Poland. In his speech, Romney suggested that Obama has shunned America's friends while being too lenient with its foes. He said the country's economic woes are further endangering its position of strength in the world. But he also accused the president of failing to keep a tight ship when it comes to sensitive security information -- claiming the administration leaked such details for "political advantage" and calling for a "full and prompt" investigation. Romney seized on a comment Monday from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee: "I think the White House has to understand that some of this is coming from their ranks," the senator told a World Affairs Council forum..."

VMware has a strong foothold in server virtualization tech, but their desktop virtualization is by far out of scope in terms of revenue. This should tell us that virtual network technologies are even further away, but they live in the backbone of the IT infrastructure. Nobody sees their presence except the grumpy network manager busting balls in his or her cave. It's a technology that can unfold overnight. It remains clear, though, that Cisco is the pioneer of the network world. They've developed not only the hardware, but the software as well that makes those network packets go where they need to go. They've not only designed the technology, but created a standard in terms of network tech education. From curriculums that teach students specifically to operate their gear to professionals who are in high demand in the field already. It's no doubt that Cisco is here to stay. We just have a market with such high demands.</Msg><Username>gsx1272</Username><Timestamp>1343188590940</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 23:56:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message></Date>
