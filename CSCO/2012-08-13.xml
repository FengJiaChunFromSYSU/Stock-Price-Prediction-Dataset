It is a well known fact that like his predecessor candidate for President, John McCain, Romney will never be trusted by hard-right populists energizing the looney base of the Republican Party. So, like McCain, Romney has picked a superficially attractive hard-right nutcase as a running mate in a forlorn attempt to energize his party’s crazy base. Once again the mainstream media is going gah gah over the brilliance of the choice. If you doubt this, google the choice of Palin and compare that gushing to today’s gushing. In so doing, Romney, like McCain, is setting himself up for a slaughter by Mr. Obama, whose historical role is rapidly becoming one of being the Great Enabler of the oligarchy that is taking over the United States. Obama, if nothing else, has proven himself to be a brilliant exploiter of his opponent’s political weaknesses. Barring some unforeseen exogenous disaster, like a terrorist attack or another Wall Street collapse, Mr. Obama’s looming slaughter of Romney is now a CERTAINTY. It's ALL OVER little Pukies...LMAO!</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1344862528855</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 08:55:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344862952648-11</Id><Title>Romney is not liked by voters</Title><Msg>and now he picks someone not liked by voters to be V.P. but he is slightly more qualified then Palin, LOL No wonder Ryan is crying, the wimp ticket USA TODAY/Gallup Polls of registered voters after the announcements of running mates since Dick Cheney in 2000 all showed more positive reactions. Only Dan Quayle in a 1988 Harris Poll of likely voters was viewed less positively than Ryan, with 52% rating Quayle as a "fair" or "poor" vice presidential choice. The Ryan poll includes all adults, not just registered voters. Since Romney introduced Ryan as his running mate on Saturday, Democrats have set out to portray the House Budget Committee chairman as an extremist for his plans to revamp Medicare. President Obama called Ryan an "articulate spokesman" for "a vision I fundamentally disagree with." What's the impact for the Romney-Ryan ticket at the ballot box? The poll finds 17% of adults say they're more likely to vote for Romney in November because Ryan is his running mate -- about the same impact Palin had for John McCain four years ago among registered voters. The USA TODAY/Gallup survey also finds 48% of Americans view Ryan as qualified to be president if something should happen to Romney, while 29% do not and 23% were undecided. Only Palin, then the governor of Alaska, and Quayle, a two-term senator from Indiana, were rated lower than Ryan.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344862952648</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 09:02:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344863408042-12</Id><Title>Sarah dissed</Title><Msg>GOP throws her under the bus, LOL Sarah Palin won’t speak at Republican National Convention Palin, 2008’s fiery Republican vice presidential nominee and Tea Party favorite, may not even attend the Tampa event, party boss Reince Priebus says.

She had previously told Van Susteren that she had been approached about a possible role at convention, but was waiting for more details before making a decision. Tea Party leaders and some high-profile conservatives like Newt Gingrich had pushed for Palin to fire up the convention-goers on the main stage. Palin also didn’t say if she planned to skip the event altogther, but Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus suggested she wouldn’t be there in a statement to Buzzfeed. "Gov.

His support for cutting top income and capital gains tax rates further than Mr. Romney, however popular among affluent Americans and investors, offer fresh fodder for Democrats' charges that the GOP ticket would benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. In addition, Democrats describe Mr. Ryan's plan for Medicare-to convert it from an essentially open-ended health insurance program for the elderly to one offering a fixed benefit for the purchase of private insurance -- as "ending Medicare as we know it." They plan to invoke that message with special zeal in battleground states with higher than average elderly populations such as Florida, Iowa and Pennsylvania. Polls over the last two years, as the House GOP embraced Mr. Ryan's agenda, have shown such attacks to be promising for Democrats. Strategists in both parties over the weekend saw danger for Republican House and Senate candidates, in addition to Mr. Romney, in heightened attention to Mr. Ryan's proposals. Aides to Mr. Romney over the weekend noted that the nominee, not Mr. Ryan, will set policy for the GOP ticket.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1344869998515</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 10:59:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344870120582-29</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO gets to 20 this week?</Title><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1344830608614</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 00:03:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it's 16 or 18, depending on the guidance.

The Romney plan achieves tax cuts and revenue neutrality by undoing most tax credits and deductions enjoyed by the middle class, including: mortgage interest deductions, the child tax credit and the employer-based health care exclusion. President Barack Obama nicknamed Romney's tax plan "Romney Hood" in a speech earlier this month, saying that the plan would steal from the poor and give to the rich. It's like "Robin Hood in reverse," Obama said, according to the Associated Press. CTJ's study comes on the heels of a similar investigation of Romney's tax plan conducted by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center earlier this month. TPC's report states that the revenue neutrality resulting from Romney's tax cut for the rich can be achieved only by increasing the taxes on those making $200,000 or less per year.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344874918143</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:21:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344874976755-37</Id><Topic><Title>Poor Joe Biden</Title><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1344873877082</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:04:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your posts are ridiculous.</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1344874976755</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:22:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344875486190-38</Id><Topic><Title>Poor Joe Biden</Title><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1344873877082</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:04:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How did the conversation in America get so screwed up?

Earlier this year, the Tax Policy Center found that Romney's tax plan would reduce effective tax rates for the the richest Americans, and raise them for the poorest. The Romney-Ryan plan will also likely cut Medicare benefits, which disproportionately help lower- and middle-class Americans. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis of Ryan's proposal, the Medicare reform could lead to higher out-of-pocket healthcare costs for seniors, reduced access to care, reduced quality of care, increased efficiency, and less investment in higher-cost procedures.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344875673709</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:34:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344875821825-42</Id><Topic><Title>Poor Joe Biden</Title><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1344873877082</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:04:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ryan is extreme on solutions for medicare, the elderly and women's issues. This is a Palin (desperation) type choice. Yet Democrats consider Mr. Ryan an exceptionally promising target for attack. His support for cutting top income and capital gains tax rates further than Mr. Romney, however popular among affluent Americans and investors, offer fresh fodder for Democrats' charges that the GOP ticket would benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. In addition, Democrats describe Mr. Ryan's plan for Medicare-to convert it from an essentially open-ended health insurance program for the elderly to one offering a fixed benefit for the purchase of private insurance -- as "ending Medicare as we know it." They plan to invoke that message with special zeal in battleground states with higher than average elderly populations such as Florida, Iowa and Pennsylvania. Polls over the last two years, as the House GOP embraced Mr. Ryan's agenda, have shown such attacks to be promising for Democrats. Strategists in both parties over the weekend saw danger for Republican House and Senate candidates, in addition to Mr. Romney, in heightened attention to Mr. Ryan's proposals. Aides to Mr. Romney over the weekend noted that the nominee, not Mr. Ryan, will set policy for the GOP ticket.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1344875821825</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:37:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344877144128-43</Id><Title>Myth Robme (aka Mitt Romney) and TAXES</Title><Msg>Only the little people pay taxes, right Myth?

On the downside, cutting Medicare could terrify seniors (as could Ryan’s past proposals to partially privatize Social Security). And as the Herald piece explains, there’s very good reason to think that it might. Voters—especially seniors—don’t like Ryan’s plan for Medicare (see chart above). In March, a United Technologies/National Journal poll found that respondents prefer Medicare as currently constituted over Ryan’s plan by a 64 percent to 26 percent margin. Ryan seeks to mitigate this disadvantage by preserving the current Medicare system for anyone 55 or older. But any threat at all to Medicare—particularly one that is hyped by hundreds of millions of dollars in ads from an opposing presidential campaign—stands to be a major political liability. In a state like Florida, filled with seniors, it could be a decisive one. The biggest risk embedded in the Ryan pick is that it casts Florida’s 29 electoral votes into doubt. For Romney, there are very few plausible paths to the necessary 270 electoral votes that don’t include Florida. Right now, the 23 states certain or very likely to go to Romney constitute 191 electoral votes (Obama looks to have 19 states plus Washington D.C. and 243 electoral votes). Romney could win seven of the eight remaining battleground states—Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Virginia—and still have only 266 electoral votes if he lost Florida. That is probably one reason why many of Romney’s top advisers were reportedly cool to the idea of Ryan as running mate. And it’s undoubtedly why Romney was in Florida Monday.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344881675369</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 14:14:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344883332278-51</Id><Title>ryan as a kid collected soc security,what a hypocrite eddie munster is</Title><Msg>it was ok then</Msg><Username>cdmovado</Username><Timestamp>1344883332278</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 14:42:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344883429539-52</Id><Title>dont let them push u off the cliff in a wheelchair,reelect obama</Title><Msg>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>cdmovado</Username><Timestamp>1344883429539</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 14:43:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344883515825-53</Id><Title>FACT,Romney KILLED a guys wife to make money!!!!!!!!!!!!! and</Title><Msg>that money is in the caymans</Msg><Username>cdmovado</Username><Timestamp>1344883515825</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 14:45:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344883700484-54</Id><Title>are u teabaggers really ok with willards off shore accts? i dont</Title><Msg>think u really r</Msg><Username>cdmovado</Username><Timestamp>1344883700484</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 14:48:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344883846690-55</Id><Title>another bloody shooting in texas,nra yawns</Title><Msg>stop the madness</Msg><Username>cdmovado</Username><Timestamp>1344883846690</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 14:50:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344884034876-56</Id><Topic><Title>NO MORE DROOLING DEMAGOGUES!!!

"We have multiple people who have been shot," police spokeswoman Rhonda Seaton told CNN, adding that law enforcement officers were among those. Police had the shooting suspect in custody, according to the university's website. The extent of victims' injuries was not immediately clear. The university issued a "code maroon" shortly after noon, warning students and employees that an "active shooter" was in the area west of campus and asking them to stay away. The gunman fired shots from inside a home about two blocks from the campus, according to the university's alert.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344886344625</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 15:32:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344886448346-80</Id><Topic><Title>another bloody shooting in texas,nra yawns</Title><Username>cdmovado</Username><Timestamp>1344883846690</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 14:50:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Texas A&amp;M LOL how stupid do you have to be to go to school there,</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344886448346</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 15:34:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344887213363-81</Id><Title>CSCO could raise dividend and give 2013 yearly guidance</Title><Msg>If they can give 5 year guidance like IBM that would be even better</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1344887213363</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 15:46:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344887264767-82</Id><Title>How much will this turd be down on Wed</Title><Msg>Nice upgrade last week so some people could dump some shares.

Earlier this year, the Tax Policy Center found that Romney's tax plan would reduce effective tax rates for the the richest Americans, and raise them for the poorest. The Romney-Ryan plan will also likely cut Medicare benefits, which disproportionately help lower- and middle-class Americans. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis of Ryan's proposal, the Medicare reform could lead to higher out-of-pocket healthcare costs for seniors, reduced access to care, reduced quality of care, increased efficiency, and less investment in higher-cost procedures.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344887898031</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 15:58:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344888303104-90</Id><Title>Obumbles bankrupting the country</Title><Msg>There will be NO money for anyone.

Speaking to supporters at the House of Blues, the president praised the Senate for moving forward with his plan to extend the Bush-era tax rate for families earning less than $250,000 a year and to let the rate expire for higher earners. “This is something I deeply believe in, because the middle class is still struggling, recovering from this recession. You don’t need your taxes to go up and we could give you certainty right now,” he said. When it comes to House Republicans, however, the president said their desire to preserve the tax rate for all earners “makes no sense.” “If Congress doesn’t act, the typical middle-class family is going to see their tax bill go up about $2,200. Small businesses will also see their taxes go up,” he said. “But so far, they don’t see it that way. Gov. Romney doesn’t see it that way.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1344890303959</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 16:38:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344890603183-111</Id><Title>Obama: YOU didn't build that!</Title><Msg>Obama shows his true colors when he goes off teleprompter.

"Mitt Romney has finally thrown us a bone," Beck said on Monday. "Mitt Romney has picked a solid, smart conservative for his vice-presidential running mate."

A top aide said today that it was Ryan who would be following Romney’s lead -- not the other way around. “The thing you have to remember about these campaigns is that Governor Romney is at the top of the ticket, and that the governor’s vision for the country is something that Congressman Ryan supports,” Romney adviser Kevin Madden said. Romney has endorsed Ryan’s budget and talked generally about a fiscal plan that shares much in common with it, including slashing federal spending by $500 billion by 2016 and Medicare changes that would allow seniors a choice of staying in the traditional program or using subsidies to buy private insurance. Romney, though, hasn’t provided specifics about what government spending he would cut or how he would finance individual and corporate tax cuts amounting to $5 trillion over a decade</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1344898090083</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 18:48:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344899067923-148</Id><Title>RYAN PRESEVES AND SAVES THE MIDDLE CLASS!!!

Even if you aren't self-employed, the economic effect is exactly the same: an effective real (as opposed to nominal) 15.3% comes off the top of the pre-tax market-clearing salary/wage rate that the employee would otherwise command in the labor market. The 15.3% applies to about the first $110k of income of each employed household member, with the overwhelming majority of households having two (or more) working members. It is therefore TRUE that VIRTUALLY EVERY PERSON in the United States pays a higher effective rate of FEDERAL TAXES than Myth Robme (aka Mitt Romney). This is true EVEN for those workers who earn so little that their gross income doesn't exceed their applicable federal exclusions/deductions.
