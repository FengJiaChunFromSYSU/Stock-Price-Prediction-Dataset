Obama is making the real economy worse. Obama's mandates on employers are discouraging hiring, resulting in a change in the capital labor ratio — fewer people and more machines in the production process. The most visible example is from the Affordable Care Act, set to take full effect next January. “Obamacare,” as it is known to its detractors, will cost employers $2,000 per worker per year if they don’t have the right kind of health insurance. Moving from 49 to 50 workers will cost an employer $40,000 per year (because the first 30 are exempt). The law also encourages employers to hire part-time rather than full-time workers, because if an employee works for fewer than 30 hours a week, the employer does not owe the $2,000 penalty. Some employers are either not hiring, or adding part-time employees. Firms that are reportedly cutting hours due to health-care mandates include Pillar Hotels &amp; Resorts (Hyatt, Sheraton, and Hampton Inn), Anna’s Linens, Carl’s Jr., Hardee’s, and Papa John’s. In his State of the Union Address President Obama called for raising the hourly minimum wage to $9 from its current rate of $7.25. This would continue the trend of making labor more expensive, encouraging firms to use fewer employees and more machines. You're going the wrong way bozo! Since Clinton, multinationals are hiring, but not in the United States. Commerce Department data show that between 2000 and 2010, offshore employment by majority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. multinationals grew from 8.2 million to 10.9 million, a 33% increase. At the same time, U.S. employees of U.S multinationals declined by 9%, from 23.9 million to 21.7 million. Put the right incentives in place to hire America.

Like Victor, the doctor in the novel, central bankers took it upon themselves to resuscitate the economy with an unnatural injection of monetary easing. The effects were similar: the global economy came back from the dead but without a soul. So weak that it vagabonds, barely escaping recession year after year. Monetary Base has increased drastically since 2009, moving from $800 billion to $2.9 trillion, an increase of more than 350%. During the same period we also saw the monetary supply (M2) increase by 55%. Any economic books written over the last 100 years would tell you that such an increase in liquidity should produce massive inflation. However, over the last four years, inflation was nowhere to be seen. The lack of inflation since 2009 can be attributed to many factors, the most important being the refusal from the banking system to lend to corporations and individuals, refusing to increase the velocity of capital. Coming out of the financial crisis of 2008, the banks had to fix their balance sheets and accumulated as much capital as they could to do so. When banks start lending, the economy will recover. Obama and Holder keep bashing an fining the banks $60 Billion so far and are running Jamie Dimon out of town. Freaking socialist clowns. That's what Fidel did in Cuba. The old national bank building headquarters is now the Cuban Supreme Court!

You can look up the history of the word in old dictionaries, and compare them to present day websites. I have a dictionary which defines an athiest as one who believes there is no God. Modern Athiests understand that a belief is as a positive, unprovable assertion. One who believes there is a God is in the same unprovable quandary. Modern Atheists only assert that they have a non-belief, and will argue that is somehow different. I have a non-belief in the Big Bang, and nobody can prove it happened. It doesn't make me unscientific. I have an opposing scientific belief called the "Big Bag" theory. The universe is like a big bag full of molecules and atoms. All are pulled toward local and final centers of gravity. A particle at the distant edge will accelerate towards a center until it achieves the speed of light. At this threshold, it will collide with another particle, and create a "little bang."

You had to love Cheney and Rummey handing out our tax dollars, LOL</Title><Msg>The US flew nearly $12bn in shrink-wrapped $100 bills into Iraq, then distributed the cash with no proper control over who was receiving it and how it was being spent. The staggering scale of the biggest transfer of cash in the history of the Federal Reserve has been graphically laid bare by a US congressional committee. In the year after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 nearly 281 million notes, weighing 363 tonnes, were sent from New York to Baghdad for disbursement to Iraqi ministries and US contractors. Using C-130 planes, the deliveries took place once or twice a month with the biggest of $2,401,600,000 on June 22 2004, six days before the handover. Details of the shipments have emerged in a memorandum prepared for the meeting of the House committee on oversight and government reform which is examining Iraqi reconstruction. Its chairman, Henry Waxman, a fierce critic of the war, said the way the cash had been handled was mind-boggling. "The numbers are so large that it doesn't seem possible that they're true. Who in their right mind would send 363 tonnes of cash into a war zone?" "One CPA official described an environment awash in $100 bills," the memorandum says. "One contractor received a $2m payment in a duffel bag stuffed with shrink-wrapped bundles of currency. Auditors discovered that the key to a vault was kept in an unsecured backpack. "They also found that $774,300 in cash had been stolen from one division's vault. Cash payments were made from the back of a pickup truck, and cash was stored in unguarded sacks in Iraqi ministry offices. One official was given $6.75m in cash, and was ordered to spend it in one week before the interim Iraqi government took control of Iraqi funds."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1362955191868</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 18:39:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362955368392-80</Id><Title>How many more</Title><Msg>will the DNC let die, like they did for Obama?

He said then that the government could easily reverse a deflation, just by printing money and dropping it from helicopters. “The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or, today, its electronic equivalent),” he said, “that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost.” Later in the speech he discussed “a money-financed tax cut,” which he said was “essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman’s famous ‘helicopter drop’ of money.” Deflation could be cured, said Professor Friedman, simply by dropping money from helicopters. But if debt deflation is so easy to fix, then why have the Fed’s massive attempts to pull this maneuver off failed to revive the economy? As QE is practiced today, the money created on a computer screen never makes it into the real, producing economy. It goes directly into bank reserve accounts, and it stays there. Banks can’t “do” anything with all the extra reserve balances. Loans create deposits - reserve balances don’t finance lending or add any “fuel” to the economy. Banks don’t lend reserve balances except in the federal funds market, and in that case the Fed always provides sufficient quantities to keep the federal funds rate at its... interest rate target. Reserves are used simply to clear checks between banks. They move from one reserve account to another, but the total money in bank reserve accounts remains unchanged. Banks can lend their reserves to each other, but they cannot lend them to us.
