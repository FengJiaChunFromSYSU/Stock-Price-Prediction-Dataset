CBS News can also report that Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, the chairmen of a key bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, are also expected to attend." [CBS News] SCHUMER MANAGES TO POKE ROMNEY, DURBIN, GANG OF 8 IN ALL 18 EYES WITH SAME STICK - People who would rather that corporate America not broker the further impoverishment of the country took a rare moment to celebrate Chuck Schumer today. David Dayen: "Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate and basically the avatar of the Democratic messaging operation, just gave a speech to the National Press Club about the expectations for tax policy in the lame duck session. And he basically rejected the emerging bipartisan approach to lower tax rates and "broaden the base" by closing loopholes...This is a big deal. Prior to this point, the expectation was for Democrats to accommodate the Republican desire to cut tax rates by using the closure of loopholes to raise overall revenue or at least keep the reform revenue-neutral. This would have worked for about the first five minutes after the deal, and then Congress would go back to its usual practice of carving out tax breaks for selected interest groups, defeating the purpose of base-broadening...This is a major blow against Bowles-Simpson, which cut tax rates as low as 23% for the top earners, dependent on the elimination of certain tax expenditures. It also lobs a volley in the direction of Dick Dubrin, part of the "Gang of Eight" of Democrats and Republicans which has been working on a grand bargain that included rate-lowering, base-broadening tax reform. Schumer typically speaks for the Senate Democratic leadership, and he's basically calling that kind of tax reform a dead letter.

"There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda," Romney told The Des Moines Register's editorial board, according to a story posted on the newspaper's website. Iowa is a critical battleground state, but the issue of abortion has national reach. Romney was criticized by Democrats and women's health groups when he selected Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate because of Ryan's sponsorship of more than a dozen bills that would either restrict a woman's access to contraception or the ability to get an abortion. Romney is Mormon and Ryan is Catholic.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1349873733927</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 08:55:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349875825347-17</Id><Topic><Title>Must read this!

The new nonprofit group, God Said, announced the campaign on Tuesday, saying it was upset with Obama’s support of same-sex marriage, The Daily Caller reports. The president won 95 percent of the black vote in 2008. “The black community is among the most religious in America, and we are offended that President Obama has announced his support of same-sex marriage, that the NAACP has blindly supported the secular views of the Democratic Party, and that their national platform plainly supports same-sex marriage,” Apostle Claver Kamau-Imani, a God Said founder, said in a statement published by The Daily Caller. “I am confident that this message will be well received and acted upon on Election Day.” The group, with 22 advisory board members, plans radio and television ads in Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Florida. It also has a grass-roots component. “During the 2008 elections, 70 percent of African-Americans voted to ban same-sex marriage in California while they also voted for Barack Obama for president,” Dr. Alveda King, niece of the Rev.

Related Video Editorial board member Steve Moore on the good and bad of the jobs report and whether it will help President Obama's campaign. Soviet Russia perhaps? Communist China? Nope, that would be the United States right now, when a person (like me, for instance) suggests that a certain government datum (like the September unemployment rate of 7.8%) doesn't make sense. Unfortunately for those who would like me to pipe down, the 7.8% unemployment figure released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) last week is downright implausible. And that's why I made a stink about it. Before I explain why the number is questionable, though, a few words about where I'm coming from. Contrary to some of the sound-and-fury last week, I do not work for the Mitt Romney campaign. I am definitely not a surrogate. My wife, Suzy, is not associated with the campaign, either. She worked at Bain Consulting (not Bain Capital) right after business school, in 1988 and 1989, and had no contact with Mr. Romney. The Obama campaign and its supporters, including bigwigs like David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, along with several cable TV anchors, would like you to believe that BLS data are handled like the gold in Fort Knox, with gun-carrying guards watching their every move, and highly trained, white-gloved super-agents counting and recounting hourly. Let's get real. The unemployment data reported each month are gathered over a one-week period by census workers, by phone in 70% of the cases, and the rest through home visits. In sum, they try to contact 60,000 households, asking a list of questions and recording the responses. Some questions allow for unambiguous answers, but others less so. For instance, the range for part-time work falls between one hour and 34 hours a week. So, if an out-of-work accountant tells a census worker, "I got one baby-sitting job this week just to cover my kid's bus fare, but I haven't been able to find anything else," that could be recorded as being employed part-time. The possibility of subjectivity creeping into the process is so pervasive that the BLS's own "Handbook of Methods" has a full page explaining the limitations of its data, including how non-sampling errors get made, from "misinterpretation of the questions" to "errors made in the estimations of missing data." Bottom line: To suggest that the input to the BLS data-collection system is precise and bias-free is—well, let's just say, overstated. Even if the BLS had a perfect process, the context surrounding the 7.8% figure still bears serious skepticism. Consider the following: In August, the labor-force participation rate in the U.S. dropped to 63.5%, the lowest since September 1981. By definition, fewer people in the workforce leads to better unemployment numbers. That's why the unemployment rate dropped to 8.1% in August from 8.3% in July. Meanwhile, we're told in the BLS report that in the months of August and September, federal, state and local governments added 602,000 workers to their payrolls, the largest two-month increase in more than 20 years. And the BLS tells us that, overall, 873,000 workers were added in September, the largest one-month increase since 1983, during the booming Reagan recovery. These three statistics—the labor-force participation rate, the growth in government workers, and overall job growth, all multidecade records achieved over the past two months—have to raise some eyebrows. There were no economists, liberal or conservative, predicting that unemployment in September would drop below 8%. I know I'm not the only person hearing these numbers and saying, "Really? If all that's true, why are so many people I know still having such a hard time finding work? Why do I keep hearing about local, state and federal cutbacks? I sat through business reviews of a dozen companies last week as part of my work in the private sector, and not one reported better results in the third quarter compared with the second quarter. Several stayed about the same, the rest were down slightly. The economy is not in a free-fall. Oil and gas are strong, automotive is doing well and we seem to be seeing the beginning of a housing comeback. But I doubt many of us know any businessperson who believes the economy is growing at breakneck speed, as it would have to be for unemployment to drop to 7.8% from 8.3% over the course of two months. The reality is the economy is experiencing a weak recovery. Everything points to that, particularly the overall employment level, which is 143 million people today, compared with 146 million people in 2007. Now, I realize my tweets about this matter have been somewhat incendiary. In my first tweet, sent the night before the unemployment figure was released, I wrote: "Tomorrow unemployment numbers for Sept. with all the assumptions Labor Department can make..wonder about participation assumption??" The response was a big yawn. My next tweet, on Oct. 5, the one that got the attention of the Obama campaign and its supporters, read: "Unbelievable jobs numbers..these Chicago guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers." As I said that same evening in an interview on CNN, if I could write that tweet again, I would have added a few question marks at the end, as with my earlier tweet, to make it clear I was raising a question. But I'm not sorry for the heated debate that ensued. I'm not the first person to question government numbers, and hopefully I won't be the last. Take, for example, one of my chief critics in this go-round, Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of the Obama administration's Council of Economic Advisers. Back in 2003, Mr. Goolsbee himself, commenting on a Bush-era unemployment figure, wrote in a New York Times op-ed: "the government has cooked the books." The good news is that the current debate has resulted in people giving the whole issue of unemployment data more thought. Moreover, it led to some of the campaign's biggest supporters admitting that the number merited a closer look—and even expressing skepticism. The New York Times in a Sunday editorial, for instance, acknowledged the 7.8% figure is "partly due to a statistical fluke." The coming election is too important to be decided on a number. Especially when that number seems so wrong.

This glee for raising taxes will sink Biden. Ryan hasn't been hiding for a week preparing for the debate like Biden. I hope Ryan doesn't underestimate Biden. Biden is good with zingers and sound bites. I think if they have questions that can be bent to discuss the Obama record then Ryan will win. But remember the moderator went to Obama's wedding. Ryan will have 2 opponents Biden and the Moderator. Ryan with fair questions would win big, I just don't think the playing field will be fair. I expect Ryan to be much more factual.

We are now living in the late 1800s, hopefully one of the fired workers will shine a laser light on this creep. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Surprise. David Siegel, the resort CEO who is building the biggest private home in the country, really, really doesn't like President Obama. And while Siegel hasn't sent any money to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, he has gone a step farther to support him. On Monday he sent an e-mail to all 7,000 employees of privately-held Westgate Resorts, many of them in the battleground state of Florida, warning them their jobs are at risk if the president is re-elected. "The economy doesn't currently pose a threat to your job. What does threaten your job however, is another 4 years of the same Presidential administration," he said in the e-mail. (Track economy under Obama) "If any new taxes are levied on me, or my company, as our current President plans, I will have no choice but to reduce the size of this company," he says in the nearly 1,400-word e-mail. "Rather than grow this company I will be forced to cut back. This means fewer jobs, less benefits and certainly less opportunity for everyone."</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1349885773142</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 12:16:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349885905470-77</Id><Title>OBAMA ATTENDED WEDDING OF DEBATE MODERATOR SO MUCH FOR IMPARTIAL MODERATOR</Title><Msg>OBAMA ATTENDED WEDDING OF DEBATE MODERATOR SO MUCH FOR IMPARTIAL MODERATOR.

Obama and groom Julius Genachowski, whom Obama would later tap to head the Federal Communications Commission, were Harvard Law School classmates at the time and members of the Harvard Law Review. After TheDC made preliminary inquiries Monday to confirm Obama’s attendance at the wedding, ABC leaked a pre-emptive statement to news outlets including Politico and The Daily Beast Tuesday, revealing what may have been internal network pressure felt just days before Raddatz was scheduled to moderate the one and only vice-presidential debate Thursday night."

Lamb defended her decision not to extend the missions of the MSD and SST teams, arguing that the mission of those teams had changed and that in any case they were replaced by local Libyan security personnel. The post had agreed that having only three diplomatic security agents in Benghazi was sufficient, she claimed. ""We had the correct number of assets in Benghazi on the night of 9/11," Lamb testified. "That doesn't ring true to the American people," Issa responded. Nordstrom said that Lamb never responded to the Tripoli embassy's request for continued security resources in what he considered a rejection, even if Lamb never issued a written objection. Lamb said that the U.S. mission in Libya had not been specific enough in its requests for forces, but Nordstrom pointed to the cables as evidence that was simply not true. Lamb said that the specialized skills contained in the forces were being acquired by Libyan forces. "We had been training local Libyans and arming them for almost a year," Lamb said. She also said that the extension of the SST in Tripoli "would not have made any difference in Benghazi."</Msg><Username>obama_a_foreign_policy_failure</Username><Timestamp>1349900927209</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 16:28:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349900991546-155</Id><Topic><Title>Something's Up</Title><Username>porkypiggins</Username><Timestamp>1349900106528</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 16:15:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You bought at the end of the day.

His foreign policy is to war with the middle east. He's flip flopped on every issue. His arithmetic does not work. Every legite economist says you cannot bring down the debt by removing tax loopholes. And Romney won't specify "one" loophole. He wants only to make the rich more wealthy by extending the Bush policies that created the mess we are in. Obama certainly did not create the crisis we're in and had he had any co-operation from republicans, we would have way more Americans working now. The healthcare bill was created by the Heritage Foundation (Repubs) and implemented by Romney (Repubs) in the state of Mass. But because a democrat fought to implement it nationally, the Repubs demonized the plan. Romney took federal funds to help implement it in Mass. He's for womens rights as governor but during the campaign trail he said he'd overturn Roe/Wade. Now he's back to lying about he's all for the rights of women again. Romney is full of sheet and you teanuts buy his sheet. He does not pay his fair share of taxes. What's he hiding on his tax returns? A panel of retired Republican congressman said to get America out of debt we need to cut military spending but Romney wants to spend more and tax less. IT will not work. And its all lies to be elected. Remember Bush senior "Read my lips. No new taxes."

But Washington's stance could pose challenges for U.S. firms targeting the lucrative Chinese market. The 52-page report advocated blocking acquisitions, takeovers or mergers involving Huawei and ZTE, citing the "threat to U.S. national security interests." The committee also said U.S. government systems and contractors should exclude Huawei and ZTE equipment. "China has the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes," it added. A Cisco spokesman declined to comment on the report when contacted by TheStreet, although he confirmed that the tech bellwether no longer has an equipment-sales relationship with ZTE. The two companies had a longstanding partnership, although this was reportedly ended by Cisco after allegations that ZTE violated U.S. sanctions by selling its network gear to Iran. Analysts say the report bodes well for Cisco and Juniper, at least on this side of the Pacific. "The report is certainly damaging to Huawei and ZTE's aspirations in the U.S.," noted Scott Dennehy, senior analyst at Technology Business Research, in an email. "Cisco and Juniper will benefit -- in addition to making it that much more challenging for Huawei to land U.S. telecom-provider customers, this will extend to the enterprise market as well." Dennehy added that Huawei has been "very aggressive" in targeting the U.S. enterprise market, focusing on channel partners as its main entry point. "The report will make U.S.-based channel partners much more hesitant to resell Huawei equipment," he wrote. Perceived as a cheaper alternative to the likes of Cisco, the Chinese equipment makers have been pushing into the U.S. Huawei, for example, opened a 200,000-square-foot R&amp;D facility in Silicon Valley last year. Paul Mansky, managing director of equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald, says Huawei is still relatively "under-represented" in the U.S. market. "Structurally, we don't see this as necessarily changing that pre-existing condition ... rather reinforcing it," he wrote. "However, it does clearly remove the risk (for the foreseeable future) of share gain via consolidation (acquisition) and quite possibly reduces the negative pricing pressure Huawei has exerted on domestic markets, as customers play them off their incumbent suppliers." Clearly, the Chinese firms' stateside plans received a massive setback this week. "Anything that keeps competitors out of the U.S. market is positive for the incumbents," noted Brian White, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, in an email. "So far as the Congressional report goes, it certainly could provide benefits to U.S.-based competitors unless ZTE and Huawei are able to forcefully answer and contradict the findings," added Charles King, principal analyst at technology-research firm Pund-IT. King also raised the possibility of other countries and jurisdictions following the U.S. example. "If so, and those findings support the claims of the House Intelligence Committee, the results could be disastrous for ZTE and Huawei, and perhaps other China-based IT firms," he wrote. "Whatever those companies lose, reliable players like Cisco and Juniper will be standing by to pick up." Reuters reported on Wednesday that the European Commission has put a trade case against Huawei and ZTE on hold, noting that the firms' pricing is a more controversial topic in Europe. Huawei and ZTE, for their part, have slammed the House Intelligence Committee's findings. In a statement, Huawei complained that the report "failed to provide clear information or evidence to substantiate the legitimacy of the Committee's concerns." ZTE protested that its equipment is safe and "poses no threat to U.S. telecommunications infrastructure." While the report is widely acknowledged as a win for American networkers, there are concerns about the potential impact on U.S. companies selling their wares in the booming Chinese market. "China could retaliate," noted one analyst, who asked not to be named. "I am worried about the collateral damage -- this may do more harm than good." Chinese consumers have already proved adept at punishing foreign companies. The ongoing territorial dispute between Japan and China, for example, has severely hampered Japanese car manufacturers selling their cars in China. The ripple effect may extend beyond network gear. China overtook the U.S. to become the world's largest PC market in 2011 and is set to become the biggest smartphone market this year, according to tech-research firm IDC. Given that the world's most populous nation is also a major luxury market, a host of companies, from HP(HPQ) and Apple(AAPL) to Coach(COH), could suffer if China opts to play hardball with imported American goods. Cisco shares slipped 2.2% to $18.40 on Wednesday, while Juniper was off 1.1% at $16.40.</Msg><Username>peter_bacanovicc</Username><Timestamp>1349902270205</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 16:51:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349902383230-163</Id><Title>Obama's ring inscribed "There is no God but Allah" he's Christian? Right!</Title><Msg>NEW YORK – As a student at Harvard Law School, then-bachelor Barack Obama’s practice of wearing a gold band on his wedding-ring finger puzzled his colleagues. Now, newly published photographs of Obama from the 1980s show that the ring Obama wore on his wedding-ring finger as an unmarried student is the same ring Michelle Robinson put on his finger at the couple’s wedding ceremony in 1992. Moreover, according to Arabic-language and Islamic experts, the ring Obama has been wearing for more than 30 years is adorned with the first part of the Islamic declaration of faith, the Shahada: “There is no God except Allah.” The Shahada is the first of the Five Pillars of Islam, expressing the two fundamental beliefs that make a person a Muslim: There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah’s prophet. Sincere recitation of the Shahada is the sole requirement for becoming a Muslim, as it expresses a person’s rejection of all other gods Egyptian-born Islamic scholar Mark A. Gabriel, Ph.D., examined photographs of Obama’s ring at WND’s request and concluded that the first half of the Shahada is inscribed on it. “There can be no doubt that someone wearing the inscription ‘There is no god except Allah’ has a very close connection to Islamic beliefs, the Islamic religion and Islamic society to which this statement is so strongly attached,” Gabriel told WND. “Dreams from My Real Father” producer Joel Gilbert, an Arabic speaker and an expert on the Middle East, was the first to conclude that Obama’s ring, reportedly from Indonesia, bore an Islamic inscription. on Obama’s ring, the declaration “There is no god except Allah” (La Ilaha Illallah) is inscribed in two sections, one above the other. On the upper section, “There is no god” is written in Arabic letters, from right to left: Lam, Alif, Alif, Lam, Ha. On the lower section is “except god,” written in Arabic letters from right to left: Alif, Lam, Alif, Alif, Lam, Lam, Ha. In the lower section, the word “Allah” is written partially on top of the word “except,”</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349902383230</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 16:53:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349902492928-164</Id><Topic><Title>Mitts 1st day Pardon Warren Jeffs</Title><Username>pierre_narusse</Username><Timestamp>1349900144204</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 16:15:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior wants him to pardon Coach Sandusky.Says he misses French kissing the coach....and other things they did.</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1349902492928</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 16:54:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349902557415-165</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's ring inscribed "There is no God but Allah" he's Christian?

So if Beijing responds solidly (e.g., by declaring that if the witch-hunting does not stop, Cisco will be locked out of the $105 Billion a year enterprise market in China), expect to see CSCO retest the bottom - or would there be a bottom? Actually, as Nicholas Kristof, who won a Pulitzer Prize for China reporting, noted, the U.S. used telecom equipment sales to China in 1980s and 1990s to spy on the Chinese. So if Beijing uses Washington's standard (and paranoia), ALL American equipment companies would be locked out of the lucrative and fast growing market. Note that only 500,000,000 of the 1.4 Billion are on the Web, so the growth is still fast and furious. There's lots of equipment needs in building out that 8-vertical 8-transverse national fiber network. Washington is truly stupid in writing American firms out of the potential deals.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Barack Obama, despite having placed the country’s future in greater jeopardy than he found it in 2008 and having no second-term plans for dealing with the deficit or entitlements, was supposed to coast to a second term against a hapless, floundering Mitt Romney. Then along came that wretched debate and Romney lied and now he’s ahead in the polls by a full percentage point. Today’s Real Clear Politics average has Romney at 48.2%, the president at 47.2%. Romney now has a lead of between 1 and 5 points in three polls, Obama a lead of between 1 and 3 in two others, and the two tied according to Gallup. These are not fun times for the likes of Andrew Sullivan, who supplants one day’s desperate keenings with the next’s even louder wails of grief for what might (should?) have been. But The Washington Post’s Ezra Klein is still back at the first stage of the grieving process, denial. His column today is titled “In excitable pundits vs. political scientists, I’ll take political scientists every time.” (Presumably he himself is not an excitable pundit, so he’s on safe ground casting stones.) Here’s his lede into an article that is optimistic about the state of the election: Political scientists will tell you that debates don’t usually decide presidential elections, or even lead to noticeable changes in the polls. In their huge survey of every publicly available poll in the last 15 presidential campaigns, Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien concluded, “there is no case where we can trace a substantial shift to the debates.” A study by James Stimson came to much the same conclusion. It’s possible that Klein penned the piece before today’s polling, but the current shift has been several days in the making. If you go back to Oct. 4, the day after the debate, Obama was still ahead 49.1% to 46%. By the end of the day yesterday, Obama had lost 1.8 percentage points and Romney had gained 2. The difference—3.8 percentage points—might strike even Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien as “noticeable.” So what is Klein babbling on about? Besides if he is going to put all his faith in political science, shouldn’t he be worried that poli sci types are also responsible for the stat that no incumbent since Franklin Roosevelt has won re-election with the unemployment rate over 8%? Yes, I am aware of the happy, albeit inexplicable, tidings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of September, but one more jobs report is due out prior to Election Day. After 43 straight months of joblessness north of 8%, neither Obama nor Klein should be hanging their hopes on the recent jobs numbers. Another truism of political science that Klein choose to ignore is that presidents who seek re-election in the midst of a sagging economy usually lose. The best example of this tendency is Herbert Hoover, who lost his bid for a second term in 1932, but more recent cases include Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H. W. Bush in 1992. Klein ventures off on his own when he notes that promises to cut the deficit are a loser with the electorate. He cites the fate of deficit-cutter Walter Mondale in 1984 and George H.W. Bush’s losing supply-side campaign. Ignoring the fact that a third-party candidate siphoned off votes from Bush the Elder, the fact remains that the deficit now is a thing apart from any previous deficit. And the primary reason for that is Obama, who increased the deficit he found on his first day of office by 50%. Finally, Klein seems to be ignoring Team Obama’s antics of the past several days, particularly their effort to save Big Bird. The loony ad the campaign is running certainly has a number of Klein’s brethren gnashing their teeth. Then again, they don’t teach about Big Bird in political science courses, so maybe Klein is right to ignore the ad. I got the cure for them, turn on oven , insert head.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349913058825</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:50:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349913405421-205</Id><Topic><Title>AMA says cutting funding to planned parenthood</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1349911568240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:26:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>did you pass out already flute?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1349913405421</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:56:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349913711226-206</Id><Topic><Title>SMOKIN' JOE BIDEN</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1349913437909</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:57:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I remember Palin beat his badly.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349913711226</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 20:01:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349913917120-207</Id><Topic><Title>SMOKIN' JOE BIDEN</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1349913437909</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:57:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior was fatmouthing about what Obama was going to do to Romney.
