A new Gallup poll released just hours before the second presidential debate shows Mitt Romney widening his national lead over President Obama -- underscoring what's at stake for Obama as he tries to regain lost ground in the wake of a lackluster debate debut. The poll of likely voters showed Romney leading 50-46 percent. It echoed the conclusion from a host of both national and battleground surveys conducted after the first Obama-Romney faceoff -- Romney is gaining ground and in some cases surpassing Obama in the polls.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350447085219</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 00:11:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350447214946-4</Id><Title>Frank Luntz group of Obama voters switching en mass to vote Romney</Title><Msg>Said Obama has no future plan, they are tired of Obama #$%$..</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350447214946</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 00:13:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350447467136-5</Id><Title>Has Anyone Seen a Binder as I Seem to Have Misplaced 1 of My Binders of Women?</Title><Msg>If you find my missing binder of women, please do me a favor and don't tell Ann about it.

The government ain't your mama. Also, Romney never said he is against abortions, just not for Govt. paying for them. Again, Romney has a better record on hiring and paying them than Obama who pays them 40% less. Obama has a Mommy problem, she didn't raise him, Granny was a TYPICAL WHITE WOMAN, I am a White Woman, I think that is a racist put down. Obama married a Wookie, she kicks his heinie and he has woman issues at home. I like how Anne and Mitt show real affection for eachother, the way they touch, look at eachother, its no act, its a loving relationship. Mitt has helped Anne thru Cancer and MS, and they are still in love, you don't see that with Manchelle and Obama. She says in public he smell. I don't see them really being interested in eachother, in love. All women want a man who cares for them and takes care of them when illness puts them in mortal danger. Mitt is such a man and Anne is a greatful wife because she knows she has a good and gentle loving man. If Romney doesn't win over the womans vote its because they are dumb.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350447999075</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 00:26:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350448141007-9</Id><Topic><Title>Frank Luntz group of Obama voters switching en mass to vote Romney</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350447214946</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 00:13:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Luntz has been doing this for years, and he says that the switching to Romney is real and persistant.

The agenda, written in a letter to voters asking his campaign where he stands on pro-life issues, would have Romney reinstated the Mexico City Policy to prevent taxpayer funding of groups like Planned Parenthood that promote and perform abortions overseas. It includes supporting the reversal of Roe v. Wade, supporting pro-life legislation pending in Congress, and appointing the kind of judges who would be most likely to reverse Roe. The letter, provided to LifeNews by pro-life advocate Pam Badger, follows: Dear Pam, Thank you for contacting me about the important issue of abortion. I appreciate your interest in my campaign for president and would like to thank you for taking the time to share your views with me. I am firmly pro-life. I believe that if abortion were limited to cases of rape, incest, and circumstances in which the mother’s life is in peril, we will have gone a long way to ending abortion in this country. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine.

Unable to Etch-a-Sketch away that often-repeated claim—one that he has hired several conservative economists to endorse—the Republican candidate had little choice. It’s up on his campaign website, it’s there in his own well-advertised words, and it is the central appeal of his candidacy for the non-billionaire voting bloc. But there is a serious problem with that promise. It now stands exposed as a complete fraud by Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post fact-checker, who pinned upon it his highest (lowest?) prize of four “Pinocchios.” Here is how Kessler reached that troubling conclusion. After requesting the specific numbers behind Romney’s jobs claim, he soon discovered that the citations offered by the campaign made no sense— and in fact the attempted deceptions were transparently obvious. Romney’s economic program has three basic elements that he says will produce those 12 million jobs, as outlined in a TV ad quoted by Kessler: First, my energy independence policy means more than 3 million new jobs, many of them in manufacturing. My tax reform plan to lower rates for the middle class and for small business creates 7 million more. And expanding trade, cracking down on China and improving job training takes us to over 12 million new jobs.” In the studies cited by the Romney campaign, however, those figures practically debunked themselves. The study that supposedly justifies the 7 million jobs produced by tax reform, written by a Rice University professor, covers a 10-year period—not four years. The study supposedly proving that his energy program will produce 3 million jobs is a Citigroup report that doesn’t even examine Romney’s plan; it includes fuel-economy requirements he has criticized and projects an 8-year timeline. And the International Trade Commission report that supposedly shows how an intellectual-property crackdown on China will produce those final 2 million jobs is similarly distorted, using outdated employment figures and ridiculous speculation to reach a conclusion that even its authors warn is “unclear.” For the coup de grace, Kessler quoted an email from Romney economic advisor R. Glenn Hubbard confessing that “the 3+7+2 does not make up the 12 million jobs in the first four years (different source of growth and different time period).” Kessler didn’t attempt to estimate what, if anything, those studies might indicate about the results of Romney’s plan. There may well be no substance to them at all. But it is possible to estimate a best-case based on a revised timeline—taking 40 percent of the expected tax-reform-relaed jobs plus 50 percent of the energy-independence-related jobs—which comes to a measly 4.3 million jobs (the China-crackdown jobs are too phony to include at all). Describing the deficiencies of the Republican program, a famous man once said “it’s arithmetic”—and as usual, the Romney campaign can’t seem to add or subtract without cheating. So much for the “Jobs Plan.” What understandably puzzled Kessler —who has never hesitated to pillory Barack Obama—is why the Romney campaign would send out supporting material that can be so easily and simply dismissed as bogus. The answer may be that—with due respect to the Post—they can reasonably expect to get away with such fakery in a media environment where lies usually go unchallenged.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350479619809</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:13:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350479621400-46</Id><Topic><Title>Mittt was angry last night he was losing the debate, you could see the anger on is face</Title><Username>daleelama</Username><Timestamp>1350479329170</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:08:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah, Mitt looked like he was blowing a gasket, stumbling around, stuttering and unable to express his conflicted policy positions.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350479621400</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:13:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350479641167-47</Id><Title>Mitt lost the women vote again last night</Title><Msg>With strong support among women essential to his hopes of winning re-election, Obama devoted much of the second debate toward shoring up their support. He mentioned the women's health organization Planned Parenthood five times. He stressed that Romney had promised to defund the organization, which provides contraception and abortions, but also basic services like cancer screenings. Romney hit back by saying that he would help women, and all Americans, by improving the sputtering economy. But the Republican offered fewer specifics on women's issues than Obama and at times seemed to stumble. "Any ground that Mitt Romney gained over the last week or week and a half, he lost tonight," said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University. "Barack Obama was incredibly strong on appealing to women and casting doubt on Mitt Romney's statements." One of the night's most memorable moments came when Romney was asked how he would ensure pay equity for women. He answered by recalling how, as governor of Massachusetts, he had been concerned when all of the applicants for his cabinet were men. "I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women," Romney said. Romney's somewhat awkward response lit up social media. The user name @RomneyBinders got its own Twitter account, and attracted more than 31,000 followers less than an hour after the debate ended. The hashtag #bindersfullofwomen was one of the 10 most common on the social media service. Democrats said Romney's answer seemed to show he had few women in his inner circle, and the candidate did not directly address the pay equality issue. "I don't think he substantively engaged on this matter that would make a real difference and that is an important issue in the conversation," said Tara McGuinness, executive director of the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund. Romney also talked about how he had offered flexible hours so his chief of staff could be with her children when they came home from school. Romney's comments sounded like "they were from 50 years ago," said Christine Williams, a nurse practitioner from Shaker Heights, Ohio, who watched the debate at a viewing party in the crucial swing state.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350479641167</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:14:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350479661378-48</Id><Topic><Title>Romney easily wins the 2nd debate</Title><Username>golfinjoe1</Username><Timestamp>1350478411038</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:53:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought the debate was POOR all the way around.

But at his second encounter with Obama in New York, the GOP presidential candidate — who has run a post-truth campaign from day one — outdid himself and crammed 31 myths in 41 minutes: 1) “I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. We’re also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school.” Paul Ryan’s budget could cut Pell Grants for nearly 1 million college students and even Romney’s white paper on education, “A Chance for Every Child,” suggests that he “would reverse the growth in Pell Grant funding.” It says: “A Romney Administration will refocus Pell Grant dollars on the students that need them most and place the program on a responsible long-term path that avoids future funding cliffs and last-minute funding patches.” 2) “I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay.” The Washington Post’s in-house fact checker tore Romney’s claim that he will create 12 million jobs to shreds. The Post wrote that the “‘new math’” in Romney’s plan “doesn’t add up.” In awarding the claim four Pinocchios — the most untrue possible rating, the Post expressed incredulity at the fact Romney would personally stand behind such a flawed, baseless claim. 3) “And the president’s right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.” 14 percent is a one-year number. “Overall, oil production on federal land under Obama is up from 566 million barrels in 2008 to 626 million barrels in 2011, a 10.6 percent increase.” Compared to the last three years of President Bush, there have been 241 million more barrels of oil produced from public lands in the first three years of Obama. 4) “Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.” There are slightly fewer permits in 2009 and 2010, from between 8,000-9,000 permits to over 5,000, and they have not been cut by half. The oil and gas industry is sitting on 7,000 approved permits to drill, where it hasn’t begun exploring or developing. Two-thirds of “acreage leased by [oil] industry lies idle” on public lands, according to the Department of the Interior. 5) “I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.” Romney is actually against a one-year renewal of the wind production tax credit. The wind production tax credit has led to $14 billion of investment in 2011 and tens of thousands of American jobs. 6) “And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.” 1,500 coal jobs have been created under Obama. 7) “And if we do that, if we do what I’m planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years.” Romney would actually eliminate the fuel efficiency standards that are moving the United States towards energy independence, even though his campaign plan relies on these rules to meet his goals. 8) “I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure. And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada.” Even with generous assumptions, the impact of the pipeline on oil prices is unclear and may raise prices in midwest states. After all, a lot of that refined tar sands crude will be sold on the international market. 9) “The proof of whether a [energy] strategy is working or not is what the price is that you’re paying at the pump. If you’re paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working. But you’re paying more.” Gas prices are certainly high, but oil is a global commodity, and the president has virtually no control over them. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, Romney’s proposal to increase domestic oil production would not have much impact on volatility. 10) “And I will not — I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that’s being paid by the highest income taxpayers. And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class.” As the Tax Policy Center concluded, Romney’s plan can’t both exempt middle class families from tax cuts and remain revenue neutral. “He’s promised all these things and he can’t do them all. In order for him to cover the cost of his tax cut without adding to the deficit, he’d have to find a way to raise taxes on middle income people or people making less than $200,000 a year,” the Center found. 11) “But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. No tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier.” This would actually help very few Americans. Nearly three-fourths of households that make $200,000 or less annually would get literally nothing from Romney’s tax cut, due to the simple fact that most of those households have no capital gains income. To be exact, 73.9 percent of the households upon which Romney “focused” his tax cut will see zero benefit from it. 12) “A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.” Romney is pointing to this study from the American Enterprise Institute. It actually found that rather than raise taxes to pay down the debt, the Obama administration’s policies — those contained directly in his budget — would reduce the share of taxes that go toward servicing the debt by $1,289.89 per taxpayer in the $100,000 to $200,000 range. 13) “Fifty-four percent of America’s workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals. So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.” Far less than half of the people affected by the expiration of the upper income tax cuts get any of their income at all from a small businesses. And those people could very well be receiving speaking fees or book royalties, which qualify as “small business income” but don’t have a direct impact on job creation. It’s actually hard to find a small business who think that they will be hurt if the marginal tax rate on income earned above $250,000 per year is increased. 14) “I went to a number of women’s groups and said, ‘Can you help us find folks,’ and they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.” Romney did not ask women groups for candidates. Instead, prior to his election, a “bipartisan group of women in Massachusetts formed MassGAP to address the problem of few women in senior leadership positions in state government.” They “put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions” and presented it to Romney after he was elected. A UMass-Boston study found that “the percentage of senior-level appointed positions held by women actually declined throughout the Romney administration, from 30.0% prior to his taking office, to 29.7% in July 2004, to 27.6% near the end of his term in November 2006.” 15) “I’m going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.” Romney has been uncomfortably silent on the issue of pay equity. He has refused to say whether he’d support the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that would allow women to sue for equal pay, and named four of the justices who voted to roll back equal pay in that Supreme Court decision as his models for any of his appointments to the federal bench. 16) “I’d just note that I don’t believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not. And I don’t believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.” But back in March, Romney expressed strong support for the so-called Blunt amendment, which that would allow employers to deny contraception coverage to women. Romney also wants to defund Planned Parenthood, where 76 percent of the patients seek low-cost birth control options. Defunding the organization would make it much harder for those women to obtain contraceptives. 17) “So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did. And — and I think it’s important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people. That was precisely what I recommend and ultimately what happened.” This is false. As Buisnessweek explains: Romney “opposed any use of taxpayer dollars to bail out the automakers, advice that President George W. Bush and Obama ignored. GM and Chrysler went through managed bankruptcies after Bush, at the end of his presidency, and later Obama provided federal funds.” “Without federal funds, GM and Chyrsler would not have survived. As former Bush aide Tony Fratto explained, “It wasn’t just that there wasn’t credit available; a lot of private equity had cash, they just weren’t giving it away.” 18) “He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It’s gone up by $2,500 a year.” Premiums have increased, though at a lower rate than before. And while the Affordable Care Act’s most important cost contentment strategies have yet to be implemented, the law is already lowering costs. 16 million seniors have received preventive benefits without deductibles or co-pays and are saving at least $3.9 billion on prescription drugs. Millions of young adults now have insurance coverage and are staying on their parent’s health care plan, insurers that spend too many premium dollars on administrative spending have refunded consumers, and states have successfully rejected dramatic premium increases. 19) “He keeps saying, ‘Look, I’ve created 5 million jobs.’ That’s after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.” Job creation is net positive since Obama took office in the middle of the worst recession since the great depression. Economists estimate that up to 3 million jobs were created by the stimulus alone. 20) “The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.” But Romney has promised to end President Obama’s deferred action directive, which saves some young undocumented immigrants from deportation, though he would not take away visas from people who had already received them. He has also promised to veto the DREAM Act. 21) “Now, when the president ran for office, he said that he’d put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation — he’d file a bill in his first year that would reform our — our immigration system… He didn’t do it. He had a Democrat House and Democrat Senate, supermajority in both houses.” Senate Republicans repeatedly prevented Obama’s immigration reform efforts. The GOP actually blocked the DREAM Act from securing 60 votes to pass cloture, denying hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants a path to legal status if they enrolled in college or joined the military. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) even said on the Senate floor that young people lobbying his office had wasted their time. 22) “Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust. And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in — in Chinese companies.” Romney’s blind trust is not very blind, and includes investments in a company owned by Romney’s son. 23) “It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.” Obama called the Libya incident an act of “terror” the very next day. “No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for,” he said. “Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.” 24) “Consider the distance between ourselves and — and Israel, the president said that — that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.” The Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister, Ehud Barak, told CNN, “President Obama is doing … more than anything that I can remember in the past [in regard to our security].” 25) “The president’s policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and — and — and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.” Obama never embarked on an “apology tour.” 26) “We, of course, don’t want to have automatic weapons, and that’s already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.” Automatic weapons are legal in this country. 27) “The — the greatest failure we’ve had with regards to — to gun violence in some respects is what — what is known as Fast and Furious. Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don’t know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were — were given to people that ultimately gave them to — to drug lords.” The Justice Department’s inspector general “issued a scathing critique of federal officials for their handling of the botched gun-trafficking case,” but “exonerated Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., whom many Republicans have blamed for the scandal.” 28) “What I will do as president is make sure it’s more attractive to come to America again.” Romney’s plan to move the country to a territorial tax system would let corporations do business and make profits overseas without ever being taxed on it in the U.S. This would encourage American companies to invest abroad, potentially costing the country up to 800,000 jobs. 29) “Canada’s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if you’re starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if we’re going to create more jobs here.” The U.S. is raising historically low amounts of revenue from the corporate income tax, and it already has the second lowest effective corporate tax rate in the world. U.S. corporations are taxed less than their foreign rivals, and the U.S. effective corporate tax rate is low compared to other developed economies. 30) “And there’s no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.” Under the law, only companies with more than 50 employees must provide health insurance or pay a fine — that’s just 2.6 percent of businesses. If anything, expanding health care coverage to more Americans will actually create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. 31) “He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they’re on the road to bankruptcy.” The possibility of Medicare going bankrupt is — and historically has been — greatly exaggerated. In fact, if no changes are made, Medicare would still be able to meet 88 percent of its obligations in 2085. Social Security is fully funded for another two decades and could pay 75 percent of its benefits thereafter. There is also an easy way to ensure the program’s long-term solvency without large changes or cuts to benefits.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1350487642120</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:27:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350488649210-103</Id><Title>Cisco tops Enterprise WLAN Equipment with 36% market share</Title><Msg>News just out.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1350488649210</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:44:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350488662421-104</Id><Title>ROmney to sell Women Binders at Staples</Title><Msg>once he loses the election.</Msg><Username>ursofulofkrap</Username><Timestamp>1350488662421</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:44:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350489977945-105</Id><Topic><Title>On the move (CSCO)</Title><Username>wanitaymvb04148</Username><Timestamp>1350482696528</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 10:04:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love this article.

Tom Chivers, The Telegraph|Oct. 17, 2012, 6:15 AM|2,599| Richard Milnes The bookies loved Obama's second debate. Mitt Romney Once Received 'Binders Full Of Women' INSTANT POLL: Obama Shreds Mitt Romney Among Colorado Independents In The Debate Obama Delivers Zinger Making Fun Of Mitt Romney's Wealth Reading around this morning, everyone's got a theory about who won last night's Big American Chat between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. "Obama regains the initiative to win second presidential debate", claims The Guardian, pointing to "gaffes" over Benghazi and something about "binders full of women", which sounds positively Silence of the Lambsian. Our own Tim Stanley thinks that Obama "won on points" but that he may suffer under fact-checking. "It wasn't enough," fretted Liberal Conspiracy's Sunny Hundal. The Washington Post's Greg Sargent thinks Obama "turned it around". Who's right? Well, we could look at the instant reaction polls. FiveThirtyEight found an unusual level of agreement in them, that Obama did slightly better,in state and national polls, though not as well as Romney in the first. But, and here's the key, "The relationship between the quick-reaction polls and their eventual effect on the horse-race polls has historically been very modest, and has sometimes even run in the opposite direction of what the initial polls suggested." So Obama's slight apparent victory in the debate tells us nothing whatsoever about who's actually going to win the thing. I'd like to return to Nicholas Nassim Taleb, the author of Fooled by Randomness whom I mentioned in yesterday's post on this subject. He suggests that, rather than listening to the views of people like me, who have to say something entertaining every day but won't lose our jobs or money if we're wrong, we should listen to people who have to be right more often than they're wrong or they will go broke. The obvious people would be bookmakers. Bookmakers who regularly get the odds wrong would have to find new jobs fairly quickly. Luckily, I wrote down a few of the odds on offer yesterday: Betfair: Obama 40/85, Romney 80/45 Ladbrokes: Obama 4/9, Romney 7/4 William Hill: Obama 4/9, Romney 7/4 Intrade (not technically a bookmaker but): Obama 62 per cent, Romney 38 per cent And today: Betfair : Obama 40/85, Romney 11/5 Ladbrokes: Obama 4/11, Romney 2/1 William Hill: Obama 2/5, Romney 2/1 Intrade: Obama 63.5 per cent, Romney 36.5 per cent (FiveThirtyEight puts the probabilities about the same, by the way: Obama 64.8 per cent, Romney 35.2 per cent.) So who won the debate? Well, you could look at the very slight shift in the odds towards Obama, and say "Obama". Or you could say "wait, didn't you tell us yesterday not to look frantically at every tiny change in the data? And given that Romney got such a big bump off the last one, shouldn't we expect a reversion to the mean anyway, so it would be frankly implausible for Romney not to lose a few points this time?" And you'd be right. Did Romney win? Did Obama win? Who knows? Jonathan Bernstein, who writes "A Plain Blog About Politics", points out that if you use the "less smoothing" tool on Pollster's poll-tracker ("call it the Andrew Sullivan option"), the polls sometimes move as much as five points overnight: implausible. Moderate smoothing shows that Romney got a big bump after the first debate. And "more smoothing" shows Obama with "the same 2.5 point lead he's had all year". Maybe a significant number of people changed their minds after last night, maybe they didn't. We don't know. The only piece of even vaguely reliable information we have is that the bookies, the poll-tracking odds-of-victory and the trading-exchange website all think Obama has about a two-thirds chance of winning. That's pretty much the same post-debate as it was pre-debate. I think XKCD's point about sports commentary applies almost perfectly here:</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350498018459</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 14:20:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350498215409-154</Id><Topic><Title>How's that war in Afghanistan going?</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1350496180710</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:49:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Welllllllll??????

Just like all his 5 point plan for fixing or his changing the way our country is run. All I hear is he knows how to create 12M jobs but nothing on any facts about how it can be done that can mathmatically be believably possible to any one who looks at the budget and pro and con or the consiquences of what will happen when added or cut. It it a lot more complicated than the vast majority can even begin to get their head around. For example are defence cost is 10x than any other country and has to be paid for by some where, an old saying " if you have a big horse you have to feed it" so our corporate taxes are higher than other countries. You can not get blood out of a turnup so it has to come from where there is money, but as I said it is far more complicated than that seeing so many of our jobs come from defence related industries and all their suppliers for all the components and technologies that keep it up and growing. Another example is getting tough on China, we went into two unfunded wars and had to borrow the money from China to fund them. That is like you borrowing money from a bank to buy your house and you think you can get tough with the bank you owe. get real. This all has to be handled with a lot of care and thought as in all things there are pro and con to any action and weighing out the results are not easy or certain. I know I do not know what is the answer to our problems because my knowledge is so limited with view points from which to look at or what the real truth is that we can not see and I do not have an IQ of 200. I do believe we are in better shape now than the way we were going before President Obama and can not say no one could have done any better but I do believe he has very good for the circumstances he came into and believe more in his vision for our future and how to get there is better than the other. Every one should look at our budget and spending with our revenue and think about what and who has gain or pain from what ever action any one takes.</Msg><Username>opps1954</Username><Timestamp>1350500361286</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 14:59:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350500711607-164</Id><Topic><Title>On the move (CSCO)</Title><Username>wanitaymvb04148</Username><Timestamp>1350482696528</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 10:04:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have entered my email address.

Last month, the New York Times described Senor as an “advocate of neoconservative thinking that has sought to push presidents to the right for years on Middle East policy.” Senor led a foreign policy briefing for Ryan on the plane yesterday from Seattle along with Jamie Fly, executive director, Foreign Policy Initiative and Reuel Marc Gerecht from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Romney keeps a large group of foreign-policy advisers, eight of whom participated in the early neoconservative group Project for a New American Century think tank, founded in 1997 and headed by William Kristol, the Nation’s Ari Berman reported in May. In the same month, The New York Times’ Magazine’s David Sanger reported on discontent within that big team, with some complaining that Romney only listens to John Bolton, the former U.N. ambassador under president Bush.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350503312364</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:48:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350503390147-187</Id><Topic><Title>TEABILLYS AND ROMENY DESTROYED OVER BENGHAZI NONSENSE</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350502673616</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:37:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Need to check the facts again, he wasn't talking about Benghazi when he said acts of terror, Candy agreed he wasn't this am.</Msg><Username>tomuch2491</Username><Timestamp>1350503390147</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:49:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350503391247-188</Id><Topic><Title>The lie that wont go away</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1350501848508</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:24:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama failed to protect American citizens on 9/11.

In Wednesday's Opinion pages, former U.N. Ambassador John R. Bolton weighs in on the war in Afghanistanand President Obama's pledge to begin withdrawing U.S. troops in July. Not surprisingly, Bolton is critical. For the nation, the president's best course would be to protect and capitalize on the progress we have made by maintaining troop levels and offensive operations in Afghanistan until the job is done, whenever that is. There should be no mistake that a politically driven withdrawal of substantial U.S. forces will squander the victories won in Afghanistan since the 2009 surge. It will signal to the Taliban and Al Qaeda that their long travail is nearing an end. And it will signal to radicals in Pakistan and elsewhere that they too can act against the U.S. ultimately with impunity. All of these results will endanger not just the United States but peace and security worldwide. I have four words for Bolton: "Vietnam War" and "shut up." Bolton was at Yale during Vietnam. Unlike almost everyone there, he supported the war. As did fellow Yalie George W. Bush. And like Bush, when it came time to back up his tough talk, he walked -– joining the National Guard.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350503483075</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:51:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350503497745-190</Id><Title>The Black Swan</Title><Msg>Obama was the black swan.

The lib media in America is worse than the North Korean media.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350506430556</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 16:40:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350506476909-224</Id><Topic><Title>Terror suspect in custody for alleged plot to attack the Federal Reserve in NYC</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350506355455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 16:39:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The suspect is Obama relative George Obama.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350506476909</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 16:41:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350506701739-225</Id><Topic><Title>mitt is in a binder, the gop is skewed</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350505936662</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 16:32:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I laugh in your face like Joe Biden.

Mormonism is one of the exceptions. The Mormon position on women has changed little since the early 1800's, when the official view was that "woman's primary place is in the home, where she is to rear children and abide by the righteous counsel of her husband" (McConkie 844). This attitude, coupled with the doctrine of polygamy and the absolute power claimed by the men of the church, created a legacy of profound sexism which modern Mormonism has been unable to escape. Mormonism has created an ingenious system of oppression, in which opposition towards men is tantamount to arguing with God. The Mormon religion makes no distinction between clergy and laity, at least with regard to men (Laake 9). All Mormon men are ordained as members of the "priesthood," with the absolute authority to preach the gospel, bestow blessings, prophecy, perform healings and baptisms, and generally speak for God. "Their priesthood gives them the right to advise and instruct the Saints (i.e., Mormons), and their jurisdiction extends over all things spiritual and temporal" (Snowden 134). At age twelve, boys become members of the Aaronic, or lesser priesthood, and at nineteen become eligible for the Melchezedek, or higher priesthood. Members of either priesthood are higher authorities on everything than are non-members. Women are, of course, excluded from the priesthood. This practice in effect says that a woman's prepubescent son is more qualified to advise her than she is to advise him. The official explanation is that women are kept from having the priesthood because women are more spiritual than men, therefore, men need to have the priesthood to teach them how to be better people (Johnson 86). Women are also told that, because they have the all- important ability to bear children, men need the power of the priesthood merely to remain equal with them. The most notorious example of Mormon treatment of women is, of course, the practice of polygamy. In early 1843, Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon church, announced to the press that, despite rumors to the contrary, the Latter-Day Saints did not practice polygamy and believed it was an abomination (Wallace 53). He spoke the truth as far as the vast majority of Mormons was concerned, for polygamy is expressly forbidden in the Book of Mormon. However, Joseph himself had been married to at least eleven women besides his legal wife by 1843. (Wallace 52). The first of these, in 1835, was a seventeen year old orphan who had been taken in by his wife, Emma Smith. Joseph apparently married all of these women without the knowledge of either his wife or his fellow Mormons (Wallace 52). On July 12, 1843, Joseph Smith declared that God had given him a new revelation concerning marriage and he revealed it to his brother and other high-ranking male church members. This revelation from God, at one point, specifically instructed "mine handmaid Emma Smith, Joseph's wife" to accept this doctrine and allow Joseph to have as many wives as he liked, as long as they were all "virtuous and pure" (Snowden 191). Emma Smith was a very strong-willed woman, and Joseph was so frightened of her wrath that he sent his brother Hyrum to inform her of God's plan. Emma was understandably scornful, and threw Hyrum out of her house (Wallace 55). Later, she managed to obtain a written copy of the revelation, and while in Joseph's presence, tossed it directly into the fireplace. However, the damage had already been done. Joseph is said to have been married to twenty-seven wives at the time of his death (Snowden 282). Emma left the church after his death and later denied that her husband had ever practiced polygamy (Wallace 65). There were many reasons given for the practice of polygamy. The one most popular during the time was, of course, that God had commanded it, through Joseph Smith. The Mormon belief is that polygamy is holy and was practiced commonly in ancient times until people began spreading false religions. Adam, in his previous, spiritual existence, had many wives, of whom Eve was just one (Wallace 291). Jesus was also a polygamist "who was married whereby He could see His seed before He was crucified" (Hoekema 56), and his wives were Mary, Martha, and Mary Magdalene. Mormon Doctrine states that the president of the church had to suspend the practice of polygamy in 1890 because of the conditions at the time, but "obviously the holy practice will commence again after the Second Coming..." (578). There were other justifications for polygamy. Mormons were often fond of stating that they were better than "Gentiles," as non-Mormons are called, because their system of polygamy kept them from committing the sin of adultery. Polygamous marriage was supposed to "make possible the procreation of enough bodies for thousands of spirits which have long awaited incarnation" (Snowden 141). Some Mormons today explain that many men died from war and disease, and all of the extra women needed husbands to support them. A less sympathetic view of polygamy was voiced by Sir Richard Burton on a visit to Utah. He said, "The..motive for polygamy in Utah is economy. Servants are rare and costly; it is cheaper and more comfortable to marry them" (Wallace 94). Polygamous marriage is basically essential to Mormon theology. Mormon Doctrine states that God was once a human man, and "He is now a glorified, resurrected Personage having a tangible body of flesh and bones" (250). As a matter of fact, "all gods first existed as spirits, came to an earth to receive bodies, and then, after having passed through a period of probation on the aforesaid earth, were advanced to the exalted position they now enjoy" (Hoekema 38). After death, a good Mormon man who has followed a few certain rules is catapulted to this same status and receives his own planet to populate and rule over (Fife 103). To receive this honor, a man must be "married for eternity" in the Mormon temple. This special marriage is binding after death as well as until it. "Celestial" marriage, as this eternal marriage is often called, is essential for Mormon women. Without being celestially married to a holder of the priesthood, a woman cannot be "saved" (Green 154). Mary Ettie Smith, a Mormon woman who left the church and Utah in 1856, said that "women do not amount to much in themselves," and that women in those times were often celestially married to men they had no intention of ever living with, so that they could have a man who would be able to get them into heaven (Green 154). In the temple marriage ceremony, women are given secret names known only to their husbands, for identification purposes, so their husbands can pull them through to "the other side" after death (Laake 118). During the marriage ceremony, until 1990, men made their temple covenants directly to God, while the women had to make their temple covenants to their husbands (Laake 328). This means that while male temple workers representing God lead the men through the cloth representing the veil between worlds, husbands, symbolically, lead their wives through. Women also promise to obey their husbands in everything as long as their husbands obey God (Laake 108). As part of the ceremony, women also receive their endowments. These are sacred ordinances and promises which make a person eligible to enter the highest level of heaven, and Mormons receive them on their first visit to the temple (Laake 93). Men usually receive their endowments when they enter the temple to become a priesthood holder or go on a mission, but women enter the temple for the first time to be married. After death, while their husbands are creating and ruling over planets, the women have the questionable honor of bearing his "spirit children" for eternity. These spirit children descend to their Father's planet to inhabit bodies as mortals, who are then ruled over by him. Mormon Doctrine states that these celestially married men and women "will live eternally in the family unit and have spirit children, thus becoming Eternal Fathers and Eternal Mothers" (516). A man who has multiple wives can beget many more spirit children, making him much more powerful. Birth control is, of course, very strongly discouraged. Ambitious Mormon men must beget many children with as many wives as possible, for "their glory (in heaven) is in proportion to the number of their wives and children" (Snowden 141). Mormons believe that all humans are literally the spirit children of God who are momentarily inhabiting fleshly bodies. This creates a philosophical problem for them, for how could their spirits have been begotten by a Father without a wife? Therefore, in addition to the Father in Heaven, there is "a Woman of like glory, perfection, and holiness" who is "associated with him as a Mother" (McConkie 516). This seems quite unusual for such a patriarchal religion, and indeed, there is almost nothing written about Her. There is also no explanation for God's disregard for his own commandments on polygamy. It is hard to deny the effect of polygamy on the thousands of women who lived with it. Anne Eliza Webb, one of Brigham Young's wives, wrote of her mother, "Polygamy...was the most hateful thing in the world to her, and she dreaded and abhorred it, but she was afraid to oppose it, lest she be found fighting against the Lord" (Wallace 62). This was the main reason so many women grudgingly accepted polygamy. The elders of the church assured these women that those who refused to practice polygamy would be damned, and since the men spoke for God, the believers had to comply (Wallace 74). Polygamy effectively reduced women to mere commodities. Heber C. Kimball said, "I think no more of taking another wife than I do of buying a cow" (Wallace 101). Missionaries, who were almost always men, made a special effort to convert women, and these newly converted women were encouraged to come to Utah. After leaving their families and homes, and depleting their savings to come to "paradise," they discovered the doctrine of polygamy. If a man felt his wife was not behaving properly, he could always find a more compliant one. Because all women must be married to go to heaven, the pressure to conform to the expectations of men was incredible. If a man was not content with his wife, Brigham Young "recommended...that he take a plural wife or two -- since this was a sure cure for a shrewish and recalcitrant female" (Fife 101). The system did not even provide the camaraderie one might expect from a household full of women, for wives were often in competition for attention. Technically, the first wife had to approve subsequent wives (Wallace 82), but few women chose to risk the wrath of their husbands and the church elders by refusing someone. Polygamy was officially suspended by the President of the church in 1890, twenty-eight years after polygamy was declared illegal by the U.S. government, and thirteen years after a U.S. court had ruled that polygamous marriages were not valid (Wallace 368). Ann Eliza Webb had filed for divorce from Brigham Young in 1873, forcing the government to take a stand on the continuing practice of polygamy. The court ruled that she could not receive a divorce, since she was never legally married (Snowden 287). The church has since become militant about preventing polygamy; anyone found practicing it is immediately excommunicated, and those who preach it are ostracized (Johnson 76). However, polygamy is still in practice in the church, just in a less obvious form. If a woman's husband dies, she may, after a suitable mourning period, marry another man as long as she marries him "for time", or only until death. After death, she will be brought into heaven to be with her first and true husband for eternity. However, if a man's wife dies, he may marry again celestially, thus providing for himself a polygamous family in heaven. The government may be able to thwart the holy practice of polygamy on earth, but they can do nothing about it in heaven. Because of the doctrine of celestial marriage, it is very difficult for Mormon women to obtain divorces in the church. Women are told that "divorce is usually the result of one or both not living the gospel", and that a woman who wants a divorce is "untrue to the covenants she has made in the house of the Lord" (Laake 176). Legal divorces are no problem to obtain, but they create many problems in the religious life of a Mormon; a church divorce is almost impossible. After a civil divorce, a woman's temple recommend is rescinded (Laake 193). In other words, she is considered unworthy to enter the temple, until she can prove to the heads of the church that the divorce was not caused by adultery. This is done by describing one's sexual activities very exactly in a series of letters to the male church authorities (Laake 194). Believers must submit to this humiliating rule in order to avoid spending eternity with their ex- husbands, because they must be able to enter the temple to obtain a "cancellation of sealing" (Laake 210). This cancellation is required if a woman wishes to remarry in the temple, for women can be celestially married to only one man at a time. Men are not required to undergo any of this to get their temple recommends back, and they, of course, have no need to cancel the celestial marriage to one woman in order to marry a second (Laake 223). Many Mormon men in their late teens choose to go on a mission for the church, to preach the gospel in a foreign land. This practice, in addition to increasing the church's membership, serves an additional purpose by increasing the devotion of these men to Mormonism. Once a man has spent two years of his life in a foreign country for his faith, deprived of any contact with television, music, and women (for this is required), he will almost certainly never leave the church. He has sacrificed too much, and he cannot afford to disbelieve in the religion that caused it. This system also works in the same way with regard to women, for they are the ones left behind. While a woman's boyfriend or fianc� is off preaching for two years, she spends those years waiting for him. Not only will she believe more strongly in the religion which he left her for, but she will feel more devotion for the man. He must be the right man for her, because she has waited so long for him. Mormon women today are still brought up to believe that the most important thing they can do is "to marry the right person, in the right place, by the right authority" (McConkie 118). Deborah Laake, who was excommunicated in 1993 for writing Secret Ceremonies, states that "it had been repeatedly impressed on me that if I failed to marry a faithful Mormon man...in a Mormon temple, I would be denied access to the highest level of Mormon heaven" (Laake 4). The temple marriage is so important "that a longing for romance on earth should not be allowed to interfere with it" (Laake 77). Twenty-one year old Mormon men returning from missions are told they should be married within six months (Laake 51). Girls and boys are also told that a good and proper Mormon home is a patriarchal one. A handbook written for fourteen year old boys states that, "The patriarchal order is of divine origin and will continue throughout time and eternity" (Laake 39). Husbands conduct family prayers, bless their wives and children, and generally control the household. They also are in charge of "family home evening", one night per week set aside for family prayer and togetherness. The Mormon belief is that Eve's roles in life, those of help-meet and child-bearer, set the pattern for all of her daughters (McConkie 844). Girls are told that God wants them at home (Laake 153), and boys are never taught to clean up after themselves, since when their mothers stop doing it for them, their wives will take over the job. These ideas, at least, have not changed at all since the nineteenth century.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350516915155</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:35:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350517035099-279</Id><Topic><Title>Romney 'Binders Full Of Women' Female Hiring Boast Falls Apart</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350516425969</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:27:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fortunately for Mitt his religion says it's ok to lie to non-mormons as long as it's for a higher calling like being elected President</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350517035099</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:37:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350517179694-280</Id><Topic><Title>Dumb.ivan I'm one of those guys you said deserved what they got in Vietnam.

Because she has outlived her savings, the monthly checks are her only source of income. "I always cross my fingers that the money can last the whole month," Mason said. To keep pace with the rising cost of living, the Social Security Administration announced a 1.7% benefits increase for 2013. This will give a $19 boost to the average benefit of $1,130 a month. For some of the 56.3 million people who get Social Security -- either because they are retired or disabled -- the increase may not be enough to keep up with rising expenses. "We're grateful for any small increase [in Social Security benefits], but believe me, any small increase doesn't begin to cover the major increases we're seeing in things like vegetables, fruits, bread and milk," said Mason.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350519239733</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 20:13:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350519246825-302</Id><Topic><Title>Hey President HYPOCRITE......I mean Obama.............</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1350518283412</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:58:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So you think its wrong only if you are a republican running for president???

The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that has weighed in on other Romney proposals, said his deductions cap could raise up to $1.7 trillion over 10 years. The center said earlier this year Romney's 20-percent tax rate cut would cost $4.8 trillion.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350520026998</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 20:27:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350520128429-314</Id><Title>The Blind Trust is an Age Old Ruse</Title><Msg>I sure hope none of my gullible supporters grow a brain before election day and look up my video on that YouTube thing.</Msg><Username>roboromney_version_2012</Username><Timestamp>1350520128429</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 20:28:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350520246974-315</Id><Title>Romney beats a stacked deck!</Title><Msg>Crowley could be more aptly described as President Obama's tag team partner. She frequently prevented Romney from responding to Obama throughout the night and challenged him in a way she simply never did with the President (i.e. questioning whether Romney's budget numbers would add up or on the "self-deportation" aspect of his immigration policy). Crowley and her staff also selected the people who asked the questions and a vast majority of the questions were asked from a liberal-left point of view (e.g., would Romney represent a return to the Bush Administration deporting illegal aliens instead of allowing them to form sleeper cells inside our borders). Notwithstanding these conditions, Romney acquitted himself well for the most part and was certainly far more presidential than the incumbent.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350520246974</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 20:30:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350520290051-316</Id><Topic><Title>I knew baggers didn't believe in science</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350520026998</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 20:27:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can't know what the cost of anything is unless you know what the economy is doing.

He used the word terrorism only one time, listen to the entire speech. He spent most of that speech saying that no matter what the religion, no one has the right to carryout acts of violence, referring to the video that incited the general rioting in the mid east. His UN Ambassador then went on national TV explaining it was a random act, caused by a video. His press secretary repeated the same lie, caused by a video. Obama when asked several times later said "we don't know what happened". Obama speech to UN mentioned video 6 times, not a terrorist act. US intelligence then states that they knew it was a terrorist act within hours of the attack.. Gee, do you randomly show up with RPGs, automatic weapons and mortars, in a spontaneous riot and hunt down and kill a US Ambassador in his "unknown secure" safe house? The acting President of Libya also immediately said it was an organized, well planned attack, not a random act. This was the same day UN Ambassador Rice claimed it was a random act, caused by a video. Crowley admitted after the debate she screwed up about the Obama speech on 09/01/2012. Last night he claimed it was a terrorist attack the day after, then told the world he didn't know after that. You can't have it both ways Mr. President. The bottom line is this President Obama. You knew it was an act of terrorism, but did not want that to get out on the anniversary of the real 9/11. You did this because you have been running around the country declaring you have defeated terrorism, when in truth, you have not. Then you sent your minions to spin lies to cover up what you already knew. After all, just months before the election, it would look bad for your reelection bid. Maybe many of you did not follow this story because the national media did not cover the story, just followed the Obama minions he sent out. I did, and now the truth is coming out. The next debate is foreign policy. Let's see Obama lie his way out of the truth about Libya next time.</Msg><Username>jomaxum</Username><Timestamp>1350529273749</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:01:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
