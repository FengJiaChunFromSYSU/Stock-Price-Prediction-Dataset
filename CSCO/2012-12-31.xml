In unison, his pals in the news media repeated this White House talking point. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Obama cutting short his vacation in Hawaii, heading back now to Washington. That will happen tonight to work on the fiscal cliff deal. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The looming fiscal cliff is forcing President Obama to cut short his Christmas vacation. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Obama is cutting short his Christmas vacation. He is leaving Hawaii tonight so that he can be back in Washington when Congress reconvenes tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: So we should believe that by leaving his island enclave that the President was making some big sacrifice for the country? I'm thinking Washington, crossing the Delaware on a bitter Christmas night 1776 before going on to defeat the British in two major battles, that's sacrifice. I, for one, never understood how in good conscience any of these politicians would think about leaving town with so much riding on this cliff hanger? Shouldn't they get their work done before they leave town for a break? That's what's expected for most working Americans but then again Washington politicians have rules of their own. People whose salaries that we pay are called public servants. Meaning they serve us. Not the other way around. We don't work to make their lives better. They are supposed to work to make ours better. The operative word here being "work." So much doesn't seem to be working though at all inside the Beltway. Posturing and puffery replace policy and principle. How often did the fiscal cliff even come up during the presidential debate? Presumably we could have worked on this problem before now with just a few days left in the year. No wonder so many people are tuning out of politics all together these days because it always seems to be a zero sum gain with the taxpayers left holding the bag. They're the ones forced to turn over more of their hard earned money to a system that seems utterly incapable of proper management. So thanks, Mr. President, for coming back to Washington. Let's hope it's for real work not just for the show of it. The perpetual razzle-dazzle as I like to call it. And by the way First Lady and the Obama daughters, lucky them, they are staying on the island, and that's estimated to cost the taxpayers as much as $200,000. Apparently President Obama's statement that we're all needing to sacrifice for the greater good only goes so far. His 4 million dollar vacation while 23 million Americans are out of work. 4 American died in Benghazi while he watched it all on a HDTV screen for 7 hrs, and sent no help.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1356934738330</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 01:18:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356934827541-9</Id><Title>No shocker,GOP doesn't want us reminded he's why they're in this mess</Title><Msg>Dubya ranks as most unpopular ex-prez alive 6/7/2012 George W.

Kuala Lumpur â€” Itâ€™s official; George W Bush is a war criminal. In what is the first ever conviction of its kind anywhere in the world, the former US President and seven key members of his administration were yesterday (Fri) found guilty of war crimes. Bush, #$%$ Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and their legal advisers Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Jay Bybee and John Yoo were tried in absentia in Malaysia. The trial held in Kuala Lumpur heard harrowing witness accounts from victims of torture who suffered at the hands of US soldiers and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. They included testimony from British man Moazzam Begg, an ex-Guantanamo detainee and Iraqi woman Jameelah Abbas Hameedi who was tortured in the notorious Abu Ghraib prison. At the end of the week-long hearing, the five-panel tribunal unanimously delivered guilty verdicts against Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their key legal advisors who were all convicted as war criminals for torture and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. Full transcripts of the charges, witness statements and other relevant material will now be sent to the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, as well as the United Nations and the Security Council.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356977101040</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 13:05:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356977403245-105</Id><Topic><Title>anyone notice W can't leave the country?</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356977101040</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 13:05:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you to the GREAT GW Bush for giving us an 8 year vibrant economy.

This succinct spin-free clip should be required viewing for each and every asset-manager, talking-head, propagandist, and mom-and-pop who are viewing the last-minute idiocy of the 'fiscal cliff' debacle with some hope that things will be different this time. "We have passed the point of no return where we can actually get our house back in order," Paul begins, adding that "they pretend they are fighting up there, but they really aren't. They are arguing over power, spin, who looks good, who looks bad; all trying to preserve the system where they can spend what they want, take care of their friends and print money when they need it." With social safety nets available to rich and poor, there is no impetus for change and "the country loses," but Paul concludes, the markets are starting to say "there is a limit to this." Paul went on to say the country is bankrupt and neither side wants to really tackle the debt or entitlements even though they all know the government spending problem is out of control.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1356979661577</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 13:47:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356979685235-123</Id><Topic><Title>Our great President is speaking!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356979560465</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 13:46:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And he looks pretty happy!!!!

She had never been out of her home state before she travelled to Louisiana to be initiated into the Klan. She was met off the bus by two members of a group that calls itself the Sons of Dixie and taken to a campsite in the woods 60 miles north of New Orleans. There, Lynch’s head was shaven and after 24 hours of Klan boot camp, including chanting and running with torches, she had had enough and asked to be taken to town. After an argument, the group’s “Grand Lordship”, Chuck Foster, is alleged to have shot her to death. He was charged with second-degree murder and is awaiting trial. Just as shocking is that the event happened in Bogalusa, a backwoods Louisiana town that was once known as the Klan capital of the US.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356980470236</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 14:01:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356980515456-139</Id><Title>Obama made it clear MORE tax increases are coming</Title><Msg>I told you people, he is going after the top and working his way down.
