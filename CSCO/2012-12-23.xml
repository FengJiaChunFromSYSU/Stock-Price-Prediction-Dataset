In the short 1,600 word speech, Obama used the word "my" 21 times, "me" 12 times, and "I" 30 times. Obama's speech discussed how Inouye had gotten him interested in politics. "Danny was elected to the U.S. Senate when I was two years old," he said. Speaking to the audience at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., Obama talked about his family and their vacations. "Now, even though my mother and grandparents took great pride that they had voted for him, I confess that I wasn't paying much attention to the United States Senate at the age of four or five or six. It wasn't until I was 11 years old that I recall even learning what a U.S. senator was, or it registering, at least. It was during my summer vacation with my family -- my first trip to what those of us in Hawaii call the Mainland," said Obama. So we flew over the ocean, and with my mother and my grandmother and my sister, who at the time was two, we traveled around the country. It was a big trip. We went to Seattle, and we went to Disneyland -- which was most important. We traveled to Kansas where my grandmother's family was from, and went to Chicago, and went to Yellowstone.

They shouldn't be. The uncompromising conservatives who blocked Speaker John Boehner's tax bill were merely sticking to policies that Boehner and nearly all other GOP leaders have pushed, without reservation, for years: It's always wrong to raise tax rates on anyone, no matter how rich. The nation's big deficit is entirely "a spending problem, not a revenue problem." And in any deficit-reduction plan, spending cuts must overwhelm new revenues, by 10-to-1 if not more. To be surprised by Boehner's failure is to assume one of two things. Either House conservatives didn't really believe their party's bedrock principles; or they would compromise after seeing President Barack Obama win re-election on a deficit-reduction plan that called for higher taxes on the wealthy. Neither was true. And now the Republican Party is reeling from unbending fealty to its core principles.</Msg><Username>teabilly_bob</Username><Timestamp>1356276316214</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:25:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356276827465-13</Id><Title>Now there's something to cry about!

One only has to look to the NRA’s leadership to discover that the organization is operated by a group of individuals who promote racism, misogyny, homophobia, anti-immigrant animus, religious bigotry, anti-environmentalism, and insurrectionism. Some active NRA board members have even had close relationships with brutal dictators in outside nations. Put simply, members of the NRA leadership no longer make for polite company. Moreover, while superficially bipartisan, the NRA is closely aligned with the most extreme elements in the Republican Party and has brought a number of the GOP’s most influential operatives into positions of power within the organization.

Within the few weeks since his victory on Election Day, however, Barack Obama has begun to enact many of the policies that Democrats said made Mitt Romney an intolerable choice for the White House. Robert Reich, a Democrat who urged Americans to re-elect Obama, is now waking up to this reality, noting that, although Obama promised to protect Social Security from budget cuts if he was re-elected, Obama is now offering to help Republicans with their plans to cut Social Security. Robert Reich’s method of dealing with this betrayal from Obama is to feign surprise. Reich is pretending that he had no way of knowing that Barack Obama would break his campaign promises and embrace the Republican agenda, even though that’s what Obama did soon after he was elected President the first time back in 2008. Reich asks, “Why is the President back to making premature and unnecessary concessions to Republicans?” Reich knows the answer, of course: Barack Obama makes promises to liberals while campaigning, even though he has no intention of keeping those promises.

And many Republicans remember well when the tables were turned. After Mr. Bush’s re-election in 2004, Democrats eagerly thwarted his push for privatization of Social Security, hobbling Mr. Bush’s domestic agenda in the first year of his second term. -- Events Recall a More Bipartisan Era, and Highlight Gridlock of Today, Michael D. Shear, New York Times, today. Whoa. Funny, but I too remember the weeks following the 2004 presidential election. Which immediately followed the 2004 presidential campaign. Which I also remember; it wasn’t all that long ago. And I remember that during that campaign, Bush never mentioned his plan to privatize Social Security. Yes, that’s right. Bush waited until immediately after the election to announce his intention to privatize Social Security--outraging not just Democrats but millions of Independents, some of whom had voted for him, and even some Republicans. The main focus of the 2004 presidential campaign was national security. Privatization of Social Security was not an issue at all in 2004. Not until after the campaign, that is, when Bush not only announced his plan but also then campaigned intensely for public support for it, to no avail. The proposal quickly proved deeply unpopular. And congressional Republicans began to run from it. The Republicans, who controlled both houses of Congress, did not even put it up for a vote, in either house, if I recall correctly. So if Republicans think they remember that the tables were turned--a metaphor that refers to actual similarity, or at least some semblance of it--they might consider seeing a neurologist. Or maybe just reading news accounts from the period between Bush’s announcement of his proposal and the death of that proposal early in 2005. They also can search for reports of any mention--any suggestion at all--by Bush during the campaign that he was planning to propose the privatization of Social Security. I wish them luck. As for their claim to a mandate because they retained control of the House, the speciousness of this assertion has already been documented and discussed in the mainstream media, largely because a Washington Post reporter (I wish I could recall his name, but I can’t) meticulously researched the campaign results, congressional district by congressional district, and then did something that modern Republicans don’t: math. Republicans lost, albeit narrowly, the aggregate popular vote in House elections nationwide. They retained control of the House only because of extreme gerrymandering last year in some states, most notably in Pennsylvania and Texas, but in other states as well. The word “mandate” in this context leaves room for debate about what percentage of victory in the popular vote constitutes one. But a victory in the popular is a prerequisite to that debate. The Republicans don’t have the prerequisite, nor do they claim to have it; they simply misuse the word “mandate”. Like so many other words. But at least it’s not false for them to note that they did retain control of the House. What is baldly false, though, is their characterization of late 2004 and early 2005 as tables turned. Unless, of course, there’s such a thing as a retroactive mandate for a policy that wasn’t disclosed during a campaign and is announced as a surprise only afterward. Immediately afterward. Which, now that I think about it, probably is what happened in 2004. no, the public isn’t clairvoyant. But we did know during the campaign that a Republican president and a Republican-controlled Congress in the current era will always want to privatize Social Security, and will waste no time (literally, in that case) in trying to do that when they hold the White House and majorities in both congressional houses. We just forgot that, to our near-detriment--a mistake that, I trust, we the public won’t make again, however much Republican candidates insist otherwise during the campaign. Because the Dem candidates will remind the public, during the campaign, of what happened after the election of 2004. And of the current congressional Republicans’ claim in that New York Times article that a clear election victory is not a mandate on issues that were at the express and constant heart of a national campaign, because, after all, the opposition party doesn’t recognize as a mandate a vital policy proposal made only after the election that retroactively turned out to be all about that vital policy issue after all. I mean, who knew? Well, the Republicans did. And now we do too, and it will be a prominent factor in campaigns to come. The sheer trickery; the attempt, in 2004 and now, to utterly undermine the very concept of democracy. The current congressional Republicans’ express equating, as Shear reports, of a policy issue clearly at the heart of a campaign with a policy not even mentioned during the campaign. It’s of a piece with the Romney campaign’s modus operandi of incessant, outright misrepresentations of fact. And also of a piece with state and federal Republican legislative and executive-branch officeholders’ policy of delegating to lobbying groups the actual writing of legislation, including during lame-duck periods, enacting policies never proposed and, in some instances, expressly rejected by the officeholders, pre-election. (Think: Michigan, Dec. 2012.) But there’s also a separate issue of the messenger’s’--Shear’s--curious acceptance of the false equivalence of Bush’s and Congress’s handling of the Social Security privatization issue in late 2004 and early 2005 and resolution of the tax and spending issues of the fiscal cliff. Shear mentions that Obama’s current approval rating in this week’s polls is his highest since shortly after bin Laden was killed. He doesn’t mention that Obama’s approval rating has been above 50% throughout the post-election period, including the period before the Newtown shooting rampage, when the cliff talks were the news story, daily. And that Bush’s approval rating plummeted once he announced his Social Security privatization plan. And that the juxtaposition of the drop in Bush’s approval rating and that announce was not coincidence; the polling on that issue was awful for him. We all are, by now, used to the news media’s acquiescence in the Republicans’ false-equivalency game. But, really, until I read this Times article, by a reporter whose reporting is normally of high quality, makes me wonder whether there’s just is no limit to even the reporter-as-mindless-stenographer-for-fear-of-appearing-to-be-anti-Republican mindset at even the very highest level of the mainstream media.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1356282877451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 12:14:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356283714646-23</Id><Title>Oooooh, Mikey is being a grouch again</Title><Msg>Michael Steele on NRA Presser: 'Very Haunting, Disturbing' Posted: 22 Dec 2012 04:30 PM PST You know just how bad the NRA nuts are when Michael Steele is at a loss for words to excuse them: Former Republican National Committee chairman and MSNBC commentator Michael Steele on Friday said he found the press conference led by National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne LaPierre "very haunting and very disturbing."

The boy had just gotten into his father's car. “He was innocent and he was just lifeless,” said the first bystander to reach Aydan. “All my life I’ve never seen nothing so devastating. I’m unable to eat, I’m unable to sleep because I see this baby in my head." It was not the pre-schooler's first brush with gun violence. A year earlier, a gunman fired a shotgun at the house where Aydan had been staying. No one was injured, but bullets shattered a front window and riddled a parked car. This week, days after the drive-by shooting, doctors declared the boy brain dead. Aydan's mother said her world has "stopped." In the week following the Sandy Hook massacre, a body was found inside a vacant house, at a car wash, in a bodega. They were discovered on a bike trail, in a backyard, inside the front office of a motel, in an idling Chevy pickup. They were the 67th murder in their city and the 88th and the 124th.

US researchers say they found the first evidence of warming during the southern hemisphere's summer months. They are worried that the increased melting of ice as a result of warmer temperatures could contribute to sea-level rise. The study has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience. The scientists compiled data from records kept at Byrd station, established by the US in the mid-1950s and located towards the centre of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). Previously scientists were unable to draw any conclusions from the Byrd data as the records were incomplete. The new work used a computer model of the atmosphere and a numerical analysis method to fill in the missing observations. The results indicate an increase of 2.4C in average annual temperature between 1958 and 2010. "What we're seeing is one of the strongest warming signals on Earth," says Andrew Monaghan, a co-author and scientist at the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research. "This is the first time we've been able to determine that there's warming going on during the summer season." he added. Top to bottom It might be natural to expect that summers even in Antarctica would be warmer than other times of the year. But the region is so cold, it is extremely rare for temperatures to get above freezing. This place has very variable weather, some of it is influenced by human acts and some of it isn't ” Prof David Bromwich Ohio State University According to co-author Prof David Bromwich from Ohio State University, this is a critical threshold. "The fact that temperatures are rising in the summer means there's a prospect of WAIS not only being melted from the bottom as we know it is today, but in future it looks probable that it will be melting from the top as well," he said. Previous research published in Nature indicated that the WAIS is being warmed by the ocean, but this new work suggests that the atmosphere is playing a role as well.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356293315351</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 15:08:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356293509721-30</Id><Title>more truth for flat earthers</Title><Msg>Continue reading the main story “ Start Quote</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356293509721</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 15:11:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356295109767-31</Id><Title>woopsie it's down to the poor, uneducated, racist, old ,white evangelicals now</Title><Msg>House Republicans are opposing tax increases on anyone - whether it's Americans making $250,000 or $1 million or more a year.

Do conservatives tend to be less intelligent than liberals? A provocative new study from Brock University in Ontario suggests the answer to both questions may be a qualified yes. The study, published in Psychological Science, showed that people who score low on I.Q. tests in childhood are more likely to develop prejudiced beliefs and socially conservative politics in adulthood. I.Q., or intelligence quotient, is a score determined by standardized tests, but whether the tests truly reveal intelligence remains a topic of hot debate among psychologists. Dr. Gordon Hodson, a professor of psychology at the university and the study's lead author, said the finding represented evidence of a vicious cycle: People of low intelligence gravitate toward socially conservative ideologies, which stress resistance to change and, in turn, prejudice, he told LiveScience. Why might less intelligent people be drawn to conservative ideologies? Because such ideologies feature "structure and order" that make it easier to comprehend a complicated world, Dodson said. "Unfortunately, many of these features can also contribute to prejudice," he added. Dr. Brian Nosek, a University of Virginia psychologist, echoed those sentiments. "Reality is complicated and messy," he told The Huffington Post in an email. "Ideologies get rid of the messiness and impose a simpler solution. So, it may not be surprising that people with less cognitive capacity will be attracted to simplifying ideologies."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356304956180</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 18:22:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356307057319-46</Id><Title>I am against making the country a bigger police state</Title><Msg>so I support the NRA solution to gun violence, hiring 250,000 more police and making the country more of a police state, LOL and in teabaggastan this passes for cutting edge logic, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356307057319</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 18:57:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356308089126-47</Id><Topic><Title>I am against making the country a bigger police state</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356307057319</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 18:57:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's your point?
