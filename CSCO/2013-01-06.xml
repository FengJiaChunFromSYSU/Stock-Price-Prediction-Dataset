Yes, we would question it. How do you define run rate? How do you pay for growth? Do you wager the whole company, or a piddly 1% of the valuation of the entire company? Chambers has a record of being very conservative in his purchases. We'll see how this works out. He made several purchases last year. He himself suggests that 9 out of ten new businesses will fail. It's called "diversification," and sometimes you have to exploit your niche. Sometimes you can purchase horizontally.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1357492257514</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 12:10:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357492308307-20</Id><Topic><Title>2 miles from my house</Title><Username>eagle1776321</Username><Timestamp>1357439869090</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 21:37:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't have to make this kind of incident up dumb dumb.

Just three years ago, one quetzal — about 15 cents — bought eight tortillas; today it buys only four. And eggs have tripled in price because chickens eat corn feed. Richard Perry/The New York Times Félix Pérez used to grow corn, beans and fruit behind his home. He now rents a hillside plot. More Photos » Meanwhile, in rural areas, subsistence farmers struggle to find a place to sow their seeds. On a recent morning, José Antonio Alvarado was harvesting his corn crop on the narrow median of Highway 2 as trucks zoomed by. “We’re farming here because there is no other land, and I have to feed my family,” said Mr. Alvarado, pointing to his sons Alejandro and José, who are 4 and 6 but appear to be much younger, a sign of chronic malnutrition. Recent laws in the United States and Europe that mandate the increasing use of biofuel in cars have had far-flung ripple effects, economists say, as land once devoted to growing food for humans is now sometimes more profitably used for churning out vehicle fuel. In a globalized world, the expansion of the biofuels industry has contributed to spikes in food prices and a shortage of land for food-based agriculture in poor corners of Asia, Africa and Latin America because the raw material is grown wherever it is cheapest. Nowhere, perhaps, is that squeeze more obvious than in Guatemala, which is “getting hit from both sides of the Atlantic,” in its fields and at its markets, said Timothy Wise, a Tufts University development expert who is studying the problem globally with Actionaid, a policy group based in Washington that focuses on poverty. With its corn-based diet and proximity to the United States, Central America has long been vulnerable to economic riptides related to the United States’ corn policy. Now that the United States is using 40 percent of its crop to make biofuel, it is not surprising that tortilla prices have doubled in Guatemala, which imports nearly half of its corn. At the same time, Guatemala’s lush land, owned by a handful of families, has proved ideal for producing raw materials for biofuels. Suchitepéquez Province, a major corn-producing region five years ago, is now carpeted with sugar cane and African palm. The field Mr. Alvarado used to rent for his personal corn crop now grows sugar cane for a company that exports bioethanol to Europe.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357500478774</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 14:27:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357501118996-44</Id><Topic><Title>THE BOARD LIB(S) WILL WATCH OBAMA/DEMS SINK INTO</Title><Username>dumbivanlovesweeners</Username><Timestamp>1357434360051</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 20:06:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't know what you're smoking dihkweed or what planet you are from, but sober people who live on earth know it's your feckless fuhker ococainesniffer that has been prez for 4 years now and has blown it.

I looked it up: "Spitzer basically states that homosexuality is a normal variant of human sexuality. He writes that “for a mental or psychiatric condition to be considered a psychiatric disorder, it must either regularly cause subjective distress, or regularly be associated with some generalized impairment in social effectiveness or functioning,” and because many homosexuals do not meet these criteria, homosexuality should not be considered an illness. Spitzer clearly understood that this change was in part a political action, stating that “we will be removing one of the justifications for the denial of civil rights to individuals whose only crime is that their sexual orientation is to members of the same sex.” However, he writes that the removal of the homosexuality diagnosis does not amount to “saying that it is ‘normal’ or as valuable as heterosexuality,” and maintains that “this change should in no way interfere with or embarrass those dedicated psychiatrists and psychoanalysts who have devoted themselves to understanding and treating those homosexuals who have been unhappy with their lot.”</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1357513286810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 18:01:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357513302468-78</Id><Title>Why are 98% of College Professors Liberal?</Title><Msg>Cause conservatives rarely get out of college, let alone an advanced degree.

Had his book of plans not been carelessly left where a teacher could find it, the sheriff says no one may have discovered the plot until it was too late. "The journal contained several plans that looked like potential terrorist attacks, and attacks of violence and danger on the school. And in particular, there were six students specifically named, and one teacher," said Russell County sheriff, Heath Taylor. After the teacher who found his journal notified authorities, police searched his home and found dozens of tobacco containers filled with shrapnel and holes drilled for fuses.
