Since July 26, when ECB President Mario Draghi said he would do “whatever it takes” to save the euro, the 17-nation currency rose versus 15 of its 16 most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. Amid the Fed’s expansion of monetary stimulus, the Dollar Index lost 2.1 percent in the third quarter. The Bank of Japan, which followed the Fed and the ECB in expanding its balance sheet by 10 trillion yen ($130 billion), is scheduled to announce its next policy decision on Oct. 5. “The ECB announcement to buy one- to three-year bonds in the periphery” shaped currency markets last quarter, George Davis, chief technical analyst for fixed income and currency strategy in Toronto at Royal Bank of Canada, said in an interview. “It was the opening of a new chapter.” The dollar fell 1.5 percent during the past three months to $1.2866 in New York and touched $1.3172 on Sept. 17, the least since May. The common currency weakened 0.8 percent to 100.21 yen. The dollar lost 2.3 percent to 77.96 yen. This will hurt gas prices, which in turn will make everything we buy cost more, and lower disposable income.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348979764707</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 00:36:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348981430932-2</Id><Topic><Title>Recession 100% certain when Durable Goods indicator goes this negative</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348970125534</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 21:55:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is certainly a bigger problem because of the US Dollar losing value too.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348981430932</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 01:03:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348982635251-3</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals don't care about Debt, Unemployment surging in 47 states, 45% of our population on Welfare</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1348978293122</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 00:11:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>(its like cattle running off a cliff. Obama lied to America and Liberals do not care.) I used to think of them as lemmings, now I realize they are just really stupid people, that would give away freedom for the promises of a few bread crumbs from one that lies even about his golf score. Most liberals are very insecure people afraid to compete in the real world. In their case Obama was right, "Someone Else Built It For Them!" Because they are unable or to lazy. Look at Junior, dumb, surf or donna (cut-an-paste) they are so insecure they steal someone's name to slander others, just like the common little thief's they are. Sad, but the world if full of sick people. We are living in lawless times, when our government can supply guns, then cover it up -- we have no law -- the news people have all sold out and have moved below a used car salesman in reliability, they are hoping for the riots they are trying to fuel so they get more viewers.

They are simply not true. The great majority of bad loans were done by non-bank lenders like Ameriquest, Countrywide and New Century. No one was forced to lend on these subprime loans by any governmental agency. They were done purely for greed because you could charge 5.0%+ in points and fees upfront and then bundle and sell the paper through a company like Goldman Sachs for up to another 7%. That 12% is before any of the high interest rates being charged was collected. That was on loans with little to no income documentation and questionable appraisals. Goldman, et al would then turn around and sell the "AAA-rated"*** paper to unsuspecting pension funds, etc. This worked until the bubble burst and many investors would left holding the worthless paper that was known to be worthless when it was sold to them and the millions of homeowners that were sold a bill of goods to do these loans and the tens of millions of homeowners that bought or refinanced property at the market peak. All so people like Roland Arnall (owner of Ameriquest) could become billionaires and contribute so much to political campaigns that they would be named Ambassador to The Netherlands by GWB. All of this because there was NO regulation.

When the banks' research discovered this was not true they simply did less research so that their culpability was reduced. Congress did not require the bankers to lie about the quality of their investments. If they had merely told the truth the folks who lost money would have themselves to blame, and AIG would never have underwritten them for the rates they charged. Public relations operatives at the banks have basically said that Fannie and Freddie are sophisticated investors and should have known the banks were lying. Misrepresentation of the worthiness of a mortgageholder is a criminal offense when the mortgageholder does it, and is at the very least perjury when the bank official does it. Yet the only criminal prosecutions to date do not include the vice-presidents who are all named in the FHFA suits. Instead of spinning perjury that it is somehow Congress' fault, perhaps his administration should seek to prosecute the perjurers and let them make their own argument that they were somehow induced by congress to lie. reply</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1349025042611</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 13:10:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349025131415-17</Id><Topic><Title>Now the 2000 th US soldier died in Obama's war in Afganistan</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349021662024</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 12:14:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well only in the alternate reality of the baggers, guess you haven't been keeping up on the news NATO accepts Obama timetable to end war in Afghanistan by 2014 INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE May 21, 2012|From Elise Labott and Mike Mount, CNN NATO leaders signed off Monday on President Barack Obama's exit strategy from Afghanistan that calls for an end to combat operations next year and the withdrawal of the U.S.-led international military force by the end of 2014.

It means that unless one candidate soars mightily or stumbles just as mightily, it’s hard to see either man taking a huge victory from Wednesday’s debate. Most people who tune in will have made their mind up about who won (and who they are going to vote for) before a word is uttered by either candidate and, in the post-debate analysis, will tune in to whatever commentary best fits that view .

A US official, who asked not to be identified, said on Sunday that an American soldier and a civilian contractor had been killed in the incident in eastern Afghanistan, the circumstances of which remain unclear. The coalition initially said the incident may have been the result of an "insider attack" and another example of a member of the Afghan national security force turning on coalition troops in a war that began in 2001. But it later said that nearby insurgent gunfire may have led to a misunderstanding.</Msg><Username>cages_are_the_enemy</Username><Timestamp>1349042072788</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 17:54:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349042418007-48</Id><Topic><Title>Its for sure Obamas's war now</Title><Username>cages_are_the_enemy</Username><Timestamp>1349042072788</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 17:54:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the American public is smart enough to understand that Bush started the wars and Obama is ending them.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1349042418007</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 18:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349042440932-49</Id><Topic><Title>Its for sure Obamas's war now</Title><Username>cages_are_the_enemy</Username><Timestamp>1349042072788</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 17:54:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>is that simple enough for you tea baggers to understand?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1349042440932</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 18:00:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349042534049-50</Id><Title>wow remember the baggers posting</Title><Msg>anyone could beat Obama, LOL now Romney needs to do something just "to have a chance to live."

Nowhere was this more evident than during the tragic death of a U.S. ambassador in Libya that was covered up for nine days because the press and the administration did not want to admit it was a terrorist attack. “We’ve had nine day of lies over what happened because they can’t dare say it’s a terrorist attack, and the press won’t push this,” said Caddell. “Yesterday there was not a single piece in The New York Times over the question of Libya. Twenty American embassies, yesterday, are under attack. None of that is on the national news. None of it is being pressed in the papers.” Caddell added that it is one thing for the news to have a biased view, but “It is another thing to specifically decide that you will not tell the American people information they have a right to know.” He closed his talk with these words: “The press’s job is to stand in the ramparts and protect the liberty and freedom of all of us from a government and from organized governmental power. When they desert those ramparts and go to serve—to decide that they will now become an active participants—when they decide that their job is not simply to tell you who you may vote for, and who you may not, but, worse—and this is the danger of the last two weeks—what truth that you may know, as an American, and what truth you are not allowed to know, they have, then, made themselves a fundamental threat to the democracy, and, in my opinion, made themselves the enemy of the American people. And it is a threat to the very future of this country if…we allow this stuff to go on, and…we’ve crossed a whole new and frightening slide on the slippery slope this last two weeks, and it needs to be talked about.”</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349060247188</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 22:57:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349060673831-93</Id><Topic><Title>MITT WILL ASSUME THE FETAL POSITION ON HIS FIRST CRISIS</Title><Username>fluteman_qreg</Username><Timestamp>1349031481045</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 14:58:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes the Mitt would strap his bulged pilot pants like Georgie, drop himself into enemy territory, engage the enemy into French to French kissing combat and declare the war won.
