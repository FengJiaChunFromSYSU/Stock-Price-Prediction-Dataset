Even worse, Romney can’t raise additional revenue by lowering the cap below $25,000 - because the average deduction for an upper middle class family is $20,000, lowering the cap would raise taxes on middle class families, something Romney promised he absolutely will not do.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1350559824357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 07:30:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350559924859-15</Id><Topic><Title>mitt has binders full of lies</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350555498426</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 06:18:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney wants to RAISE TAXES on the UPPER MIDDLE CLASS! with his cap on itemized deductions</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1350559924859</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 07:32:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350559935742-16</Id><Title>Headline CPI will run 7%-10% next year</Title><Msg>Massive hyper-stagflation.</Msg><Username>pn1409</Username><Timestamp>1350559935742</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 07:32:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350560306411-17</Id><Topic><Title>EVEN FOX NEWS SAYS OBAMA WHIPPED MITTENS</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350514033680</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:47:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rhonda &amp; Wetbrain deny this!</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1350560306411</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 07:38:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350560363374-18</Id><Topic><Title>When you’re whining about the moderator, you know you’ve lost the debate!</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1350504202861</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 16:03:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She never said that - RHONDA LIES 24/7 !</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1350560363374</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 07:39:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350562664833-19</Id><Title>CSCO - Good Data for CSCO Traders</Title><Msg>Cisco Systems, In (NasdaqNM: CSCO ) is definitely getting some attention lately..

Bush suffered in October 1992 when unemployment was 7.7 percent. Bill Clinton called it the worst economic record of any president in 50 years. Reuters described the 1992 report as “the final nail in the coffin” for George H.W. Bush. The same news service hailed Mr. Obama’s 7.8 percent number as “providing a boost to his re-election bid.” The liberal press seems to have mislaid its coffin nails." Amazing...back in 1992 Bush #1's 7.7% unemployment rate is blasted by Clinton. A phony 7.8% rate is hailed as a "boost to Obama's re-election bid".

I laugh in your face like Joe Biden: BWHHAHHAHHAHHHAHHAAAA!!! LOL!!! BWHHAHHAHHAAA!! The downward spiral has started. More specifically, here are the key changes in Obama's support by group since 2008: Degreed voters backing off Obama: Obama trails Romney among college graduates (those with four-year degrees only) by 22 points. His support from high school graduates and those with some college is also down, providing no counterbalance to his major losses among the college educated. Southern losses: The South gave Obama the least support of any region in 2008. Today, Southerners favor Romney by a 22-point margin, the largest shift of any region. Voters in the East are also less supportive. White support dwindles: Obama lost the white vote in 2008 by 12 percentage points, but that was more than offset by a 72-point lead among nonwhites. Today, Obama has a more daunting 22-point deficit among whites, while his margin over Romney among nonwhites is essentially unchanged. Women flee Obama: Women's support for Obama has shrank six percentage points. Bottom Line With three weeks to go in the campaign, Obama appears to be losing momentum, and now trails Romney by four percentage points among likely voters. That contrasts with his seven-point win over McCain in 2008. Given this shift in overall voter preferences, it follows that Obama will lose big. He shed the most support among Southerners, college graduates, postgraduates, 30- to 49-year-olds, men, and Protestants. He also lost support among whites, Easterners, women, and Catholics -- while not building new support elsewhere. His main support is black racists who only for Obama because he says he's black. Gallup's registered voter trends indicate that Obama has lost ground with voters since the start of the month, most likely reflecting his poorly reviewed performance in the first presidential debate.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350571956178</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:52:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350572196308-59</Id><Topic><Title>Obama today -14 lowest in a month</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350571547581</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:45:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama support evaporating.

They are, after all, trying to win our votes. But when Mitt Romney talks about women, when he says he believes that we can do any job a man can do, I know from experience that he's speaking from the heart. I served as Lt. Governor with Mitt Romney when he was Governor of Massachusetts. In fact, of the twenty top positions in the Romney administration, ten of them were filled by women, more than any other state in the nation. Romney's Chief of Staff was a woman - Beth Myers. As we took office, our administration actively sought to recruit the best and brightest women the Commonwealth had to offer. And Governor Romney wasn't just checking a box. He sought out our counsel, and he listened to our advice. We didn't always agree, but we were always respected. Mitt Romney didn't judge the people who were in his administration by their gender. He wanted the best, male or female. There's no greater evidence that Mitt Romney will represent all Americans than his record of treating all people fairly and impartially. His was a brand of leadership that got things done by bringing people together, not dividing them. We need that kind of leadership today. People are hurting in this country, and women especially have been suffering. The numbers are stark. Five-and-a-half million women are unemployed. Under President Obama, the number of women living in poverty has climbed to a record high of nearly twenty-six million. Despite President Obama's best efforts -- and despite his soaring rhetoric -- his policies simply haven't worked. In the two debates we have seen so far, we've heard the President give excuses for his disappointments, but we haven't heard him offer a specific plan or concrete proposals detailing how the next four years will be any different than the last four years. We can't afford four more years of the status quo. What we need is change, and that is precisely what Governor Romney is offering. He has a plan that will create twelve million new jobs, one that will get our economy moving again and lift Americans back out of poverty. He'll do it by offering strong leadership and by working across the aisle with Republicans and Democrats. I know that he can accomplish these goals because I have seen him do it before. And when he does succeed, millions of women will have good jobs with rising pay and new opportunities to fulfill their dreams. That is the kind of empowerment and equality that we need now more than ever. Watch this video and show your support for Mitt Romney -- contribute today.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, released the figures Thursday, compiled based on a committee analysis and a new Congressional Research Service study. The stats show that the combination of federal and state "welfare" spending is more than the country spends on Medicare, Social Security or non-war defense." Liberals talk about Obama gaining 3% on Intrade...when the country's spending on "welfare" goes up 30% since he became President. Keep in mind, this $1 trillion isn't Medicare, Social Security or non-war defense. And the guy has the audacity to say "Forward"????

The average family in the top 10 percent of Americans will spend more than $1,600 on gifts this season. Fully 39 percent of women in the top one percent plan to splurge on gifts for their significant others. The spending plans of One Percenters contrast with spending declines expected for the rest of America, which plans to spend 3.4 percent less this season, according to the study.

The steady rise in welfare spending, which covers more than 80 programs primarily designed to help low-income Americans, got a big boost from the 2009 stimulus and has grown, albeit somewhat more slowly, in 2010 and 2011. One reason is that more people are qualifying in the weak economy, but the federal government also has broadened eligibility so that more people qualify for programs. Sen. Jeff Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, who requested the Congressional Research Service report, said it underscores a fundamental shift in welfare, moving away from a Band-Aid and toward a more permanent crutch. “No longer should we measure compassion by how much money the government spends but by how many people we help to rise out of poverty,” the Alabama conservative said. “Welfare assistance should be seen as temporary whenever possible and the goal must be to help more of our fellow citizens attain gainful employment and financial independence.” Overall, welfare spending as measured by obligations has grown from $563 billion in fiscal 2008 to $746 billion in fiscal 2011, or a jump of 32 percent.

It’s still impossible to spend more and take in less without increasing the deficit. It’s also impossible to cut domestic spending drastically without increasing unemployment, and most people realize that claiming four years is the same as 10 years just doesn’t work when it comes to job creation. For me, the most interesting Romneyism was the use of percentages to change the meaning of the word “same.” He said the top earners would pay the same – 60%. The problem for our national deficit is that when you lower the total taxes collected, it increases the deficit. It would be great for the richest among us, since they’ll enjoy 60% of that total tax cut as extra money to put into their Cayman Islands accounts. Unfortunately, it will hasten the day when America goes broke, and can’t borrow the money to pay for Social Security and Medicare benefits. Maybe that’s the plan, after all. In the meantime, Romney thinks that America is stupid enough to believe that 60% of less money is somehow the same amount of revenue, as long as the percentage is still 60%. He may claim that the loss in revenue will be offset by spending cuts, but certainly not by cutting out PBS and Planned Parenthood. Let’s not forget the plan to increase military spending by $2 trillion above the Joint Chiefs’ requested budgets and the promise to reinstate $716 billion of Medicare corporate welfare. And there was the promise not to cut the education budget. That only leaves the Veterans’ Administration, Medicaid, agriculture and some odds and ends like the CDC, the National Weather Service or the Air Traffic Control system. But who among us believes he will keep his GOP supporters in line if he proposes to cut every dime out of agriculture? The VA? The federal prison system? Who thinks even the smaller federal programs like drug safety, air traffic, etc. will actually be cut out? The bottom line: Last night Romney proposed that we double the deficit, and make sure the richest get yet another round of lower absolute taxes. Such a deal. And now we can enjoy using a new definition for the word “same.” Howard Hill is a former investment banker who created a number of groundbreaking deal structures and analytic techniques on Wall Street, and later helped manage a $100 billion portfolio.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350587137477</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:05:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350587141636-203</Id><Topic><Title>see were tricking down on you all, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350585920822</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:45:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Christmas won't be so rosy for the middle class as under O'Loser, income is DOWN $4,400.

Yes, conservatives opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Act when it was passed under the belief that it was a gift to trial lawyers. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Romney's running mate, is one of the lawmakers who voted against it. But Romney has moved away from conservative doctrine on a number of fronts in the past few weeks. And whereas on several occasions he had to contradict his previous positions to do so, the fact that he hadn't taken a stance on the Lilly Ledbetter Act gave him an opportunity to say he supported it from the get-go without being accused of flip-flopping. Instead, he's opened himself to criticism that he's too timid to weigh in on women's issues. "I don’t know why this is so complicated. Gov. Romney still won't say whether or not he supported a law to protect that right no matter how many times he is asked. This is not that hard," President Barack Obama said at a rally in Manchester, N.H., on Thursday. "Would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter equal pay law? No answer," former President Bill Clinton said at a Thursday rally in Ohio. "He can't even say whether he would sign a law that is already on the books ... what he wants to do is convince the moderate voters that he is a new man without explicitly disavowing a single solitary commitment he made in the two years he said he was severely conservative Mitt Romney."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350592745236</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:39:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350592888307-283</Id><Topic><Title>what is a GOOGJR? is that a wetbrain thing?</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350590229317</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:57:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jr is just one of the 50+ GOO screen names.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350592888307</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:41:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350593160271-284</Id><Title>we need to pay down the debt!!</Title><Msg>buy spending 2 trillion more on defense!!! One area where President Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney clearly disagree is defense spending. The president wants less, Romney wants more. But the difference in their approaches is about more than money. When Romney looks at the future, he sees a series of threats: from unrest in the Middle East to a nuclear North Korea to what he sees as a defiant Russia. Speaking to veterans in Virginia's Fairfax County last month, Romney blamed the Obama administration for cuts that will go into effect unless Congress and the president act. "And the idea of cutting our military commitment by a trillion dollars over this decade is unthinkable, and devastating," Romney said. "And when I become president of the United States, we will stop it, I will not cut our commitment to our military." For example, Romney sees the Pentagon's plans to reduce the size of the Army and Marines as threats to national security. While the Obama budget calls for shrinking the size of the Army and Marines by 100,000 troops, Romney proposes adding 100,000. Romney wants to set a floor for defense spending: 4 percent of the gross domestic product should go to the military, he says. That's about where it is now, but in coming years, the president's budget would take it below 3 percent. For Obama, Changing Priorities In his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention, Obama said that money going to the military is now needed elsewhere. Paying For The Romney Plan The Romney campaign says ramping up to spending 4 percent of GDP on defense would cost about $1 trillion more than Obama's current budget. But Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments says it would cost more. Even if the government spent eight years getting to 4 percent of GDP, it would amount to an additional $1.8 trillion in spending. If the U.S. reached that level sooner, it would cost something to the tune of $2 trillion. "I will use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt, put more people back to work, rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways," the president said. Polls show there's a lot of support for cutting back on defense spending. Carl Conetta, with the non-partisan Project on Defense Alternatives, says you don't need a Cold War-style buildup to counter threats such as terrorism and nuclear proliferation. "The types of threats we face are of a different order," Conetta says. "They are not based fundamentally in advanced economies, using very expensive equipment and expensive troops."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350593160271</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:46:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350593308641-285</Id><Topic><Title>Can anyone tell what Mitt's position is?</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350592745236</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 16:39:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We'll tell you if you tell us what Obama's position is.

They were told it was mandatory but they were never held at gunpoint. LOL That’s according to accounts from multiple coal miners, who sent anonymous letters to a local radio station criticizing Murray Energy for allegedly requiring all workers to take the day off, forgo pay, and attend a Romney campaign event. “Just for the record, if we did not go, we knew what would happen,” wrote one miner. In an interview with a talk radio show host, Murray Energy CFO Rob Moore denied allegations that workers were “forced,” choosing instead to use the word “mandatory.” “Our managers communicated to our workforce that the attendance at the Romney event was mandatory, but no one was forced to attend,” Moore said. He confirmed that pay was docked for all the workers. In another email read on air, a miner expressed frustration with being “forced” to attend the event, characterizing a culture of “intimidation” within Murray: “No one likes to be forced to do anything, let alone without pay. I recall hearing a caller claiming that his $100,000 plus Murray salary was grounds for #$%$ if Murray says crap, or eating broccoli if Murray says to eat it. I say to that man: Many of us, though well educated or hard workers ourselves, do not make half, a third, or sometimes even a quarter of that pay. Had the event not been mandated, most of us probably would have still attended. We are grateful to have the chance to listen to our leaders or potential leaders first hand and to be a part of political history in the making. We do not appreciate being intimidated into exchanging our time for nothing.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350595294822</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 17:21:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350595337503-296</Id><Topic><Title>Another Obama lie</Title><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1350594285681</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 17:04:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is saying that if he is not elected he will veto any bill to handle the fiscal cliff problem, sounds like the late 1960 and 1970's rioters, where they burn their own government housing.

So there was no way this crowd wouldn’t love anything he did, even “Forward.” The president’s campaign aides were ecstatic to have the Boss back on the road for their boss. Mr. Springsteen joined former President Bill Clinton on stage for the event, as part of the Obama campaign’s full-throated effort to scrounge up every single vote it can in Ohio. If Mr. Obama can win the state, campaign aides figure, the path to victory for the Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, will look like one of those single-track dusty roads that Mr. Springsteen is always singing about. Both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Springsteen, at some point in their careers, have been compared to preachers, and on Thursday, Mr. Clinton was definitely channeling his inner pulpit-pounder. “This is the first time in my life I ever got to be the warm-up act for Bruce Springsteen,” Mr. Clinton said. His voice started rising. “I am qualified ’cause I was born in the U.S.A., and unlike one of the candidates for president, I keep all my money here!” Mr. Clinton delivered a fire-and-brimstone condemnation of Mr. Romney in particular and Republicans in Congress in general, accusing them of doing everything they could to stand in the way of Mr. Obama’s jobs agenda.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350598161479</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:09:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350598172654-316</Id><Topic><Title>Real Clear Politics : Romney ahead up 5 in Electoral College Over Obama</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350587115271</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:05:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bbuummpp</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350598172654</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:09:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350598208074-317</Id><Topic><Title>Obama welfare spending up 34% during his Presidency</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350586725506</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:58:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bbuummpp</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350598208074</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:10:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350598251471-318</Id><Topic><Title>Gallup says women now for Romney</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350588287763</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:24:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bbuummpp</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350598251471</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:10:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350598323593-319</Id><Topic><Title>Wow the Boss says vote Obama!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350598161479</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:09:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And have you seen the new add for Obama narrated by Morgan Freeman?

QStarNews predicts the turnout nationally will includes 34.8 percent Republicans, 35.2 percent Democrats, and 30.0 percent independents. QStarNews predicts turnout will rise by about four percent, or a total of about 129,170,000 voters including about 600,000 for third party candidates and the rest going to Romney and Obama. Methodology: For EACH state, all of the following information was considered: results from the last four elections averaged together, recent political trends in that state (such as Republicans winning control of both houses of the state legislature in 2010 in Maine and New Hampshire), recent trends in demographic makeup that affect the politics of the state (such as the growth of hispanics in Colorado causing the Democratic Party to become more competitive), and the degree to which one or both of the major campaigns are targetting that state, such as both campaigns making Ohio the most important state and campaigning there more than any other state, and any other relevant political factors and data such as public polls from a variety of pollling firms, as well as data from the QStarNews polls of the presidential race. From all of this information a percentage breakdown of each state is calculated between Romney and Obama. This projection is expected to be spot-on accurate for predicting the outcome in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and close to the actual popular vote.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350599931100</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:38:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350599963857-335</Id><Topic><Title>New unskewed polls good for Romney</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350599931100</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:38:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>buuuummmppp</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350599963857</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:39:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350600048361-336</Id><Title>Crowley gave Obama questions ahead of time</Title><Msg>“If the United States or Israel goes to war with Iran, it’s the beginning of World War III.
