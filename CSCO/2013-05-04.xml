They both are examples of white supremacy at its worse. The NRA is dangerous and needs to be watched closely, since it is "militia-gun-ready" to move on minorites and Washington DC. They are controlling Congress with gerrymandering and the filibuster, which prevents any common sense, saftey gun laws and background checks.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1367667315325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 07:35:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367673396207-2</Id><Title>How'd that "nation building" work out for ya?</Title><Msg>Published on Friday, May 3, 2013 by Common Dreams 'Worse Than Syria'? Civil War in Iraq 'Has Already Started' Though receiving little international attention, the situation is putting Iraq on verge of "total collapse" - Jon Queally, staff writer “It is wrong to say [Iraq is] getting close to a civil war... The civil war has already started.” Masked Sunni protesters wave Islamist flags while others chant slogans at an anti-government rally in Fallujah, Iraq, Friday, April 26, 2013. Iraqi soldiers backed by tanks retook control of a Sunni town north of Baghdad on Friday after gunmen withdrew without a fight, although violence continued in other parts of the country. The Sunni gunmen had seized Suleiman Beg on Thursday after a firefight with security forces, one in a string of similar incidents that have killed more than 150 people in clashes in Sunni Muslim towns in western and northern Iraq over the past four days.(AP Photo/Bilal Fawzi) That's what one Iraqi politician tells the Independent's Patrick Cockburn as the British foreign correspondent explores the undercurrents of growing violence and political conflict in the country still reeling and destabilized from more than a decade of war and an entire generation beset by Western sanctions, military intervention, and occupation. If things in Iraq continue to deteriorate, the politician predicts the results "will be worse than Syria." April in Iraq was the most deadly month in more than five years and many Iraqi politicians inside the country and outside experts are now saying that its not a question of when a civil war will break out, but that the violence now being witnessed proves a civil war—in many ways—is already underway.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367673396207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 09:16:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367675269201-3</Id><Topic><Title>POOR, STUPID, STUPID juniorsassmate_4....Defending Obama for the 200th</Title><Username>dumb.lvan</Username><Timestamp>1367637201454</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 23:13:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>defending obama from what? your lies?</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1367675269201</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 09:47:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367675300359-4</Id><Topic><Title>obama legacy: halting the bush destruction</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_4</Username><Timestamp>1367612149731</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 16:15:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why so many toe tappers?</Msg><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1367675300359</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 09:48:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367675871473-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obama legacy: Make himself laughing stock of world...</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1367616225144</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 17:23:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Neither the US nor Europe adjusted well to a global economy, both experiencing a loss of industries and jobs. BOTH engaged in borrowing , enabled by the housing bubble, to offset for losses in inflation adjusted disposable income. We saw how that ended and it just exacerbated already deep, but ignored, core problems of our industrialized world. Atop our DEBT problems (across all sectors) we also face demographic shifts, ie older populations have a propensity to SAVE vs SPEND. These demographic shifts are apparent in Japan, US, Europe and even China. OUR economies are propelled by ever increasing consumption. SO HOW, when burdened by DEBT and DEMOGRAPHICS can we overcome the NEED to increase consumption? Bottom line, ALL are reliant on EXPORTS for domestic production, growth. Government, as is readily apparent, based on results, is MORE engaged in EFFORT, giving the illusion of doing something. Spending is NOT the same as investment. EFFORT is not the same as SUCCESS. The Fed is TRYING to resurrect housing, the BOJ is trying to overcome deflation, China is trying to dodge bullets (loans, corruption, social, overbuilding infrastructure), and the EU is merely going thru the motions, buying time, but accomplishing NOTHING!! One can easily conclude that our Fed's mission is to 1) increase disposable income by reducing mortgage expense and 2) inflate assets, thereby giving an illusion of wealth, that can be SPENT. AND when our economy can BARELY create jobs to offset population growth, HOW come markets get excited. Are we that hard up for positive news? We are living the liberal dream. These are the best of times.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1367675871473</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 09:57:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367676041597-6</Id><Topic><Title>Obama legacy: Make himself laughing stock of world...</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1367616225144</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 17:23:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buckwheat, you make me laugh.
