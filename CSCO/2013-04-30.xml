With Mike McAuliff: "Republicans on the House science committee are making an unprecedented move to require oversight of the scientific research process, pushing a bill that would in effect politicize decisions made by the National Science Foundation, according to a draft of the legislation acquired by The Huffington Post. As part of the same effort, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, sent a letter to the NSF Thursday demanding that it provide supporting materials to justify research that its panels of independent scientists have approved. The bill, titled the High Quality Research Act and authored by Smith, would require the director of the NSF to certify in writing that every grant handed out by the federal agency is for work that is 'the finest quality, is ground breaking, and answers questions or solves problems that are of utmost importance to society at large; and ... is not duplicative of other research project being funded by the Foundation or other Federal science agencies.'... The measure would also require federal officials to report back to Congress on how the NSF was implementing the new regulations. Additionally, the bill solicits recommendations for how to place similar restrictions on other federal science agencies."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367314252672</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 05:30:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367319282164-3</Id><Topic><Title>He was just "a simple minded man".....</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367260777527</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 14:39:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>April Fools all year for fools like you ?</Msg><Username>lookwag007</Username><Timestamp>1367319282164</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 06:54:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367319451374-4</Id><Topic><Title>Not a bright idea, cause science is scary</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367314252672</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 05:30:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is Medication available for people like you.</Msg><Username>lookwag007</Username><Timestamp>1367319451374</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 06:57:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367320272116-5</Id><Topic><Title>I love big black men</Title><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1367275734970</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:48:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Save some for me!!</Msg><Username>walterbrydman11</Username><Timestamp>1367320272116</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 07:11:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367320306622-6</Id><Topic><Title>I'm such a loser, all I can post about right now is Benghazi!</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1367275339303</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:42:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What else do you expect us Log Cabin Republicans to do?</Msg><Username>walterbrydman11</Username><Timestamp>1367320306622</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 07:11:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367320323723-7</Id><Topic><Title>I can't stop posting about BENGHAZI- It's all I can do to get to sleep at night!</Title><Username>walterbrydman11</Username><Timestamp>1367275182096</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:39:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Truly I do.</Msg><Username>walterbrydman11</Username><Timestamp>1367320323723</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 07:12:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367320349360-8</Id><Topic><Title>wow - carey dreamed up some ghey stuff over the weekend</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1367272930978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:02:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So I came out of the closet.

I won't lie, I voted for the other guy not so much because I believed, but because I truly feared an Obama unchained. Too bad the republicans has such a weak candidate. That said, I stood with the vast majority of Americans back during the first inauguration and was quietly please that such an historic moment should occur...in my time! Sadly, that euphoria lasted maybe a week for me as reality started to bite. Remember all the unqualified Czars? Remember how the cabinet choices had that pesky habit of not paying taxes? Remember all the "Green" companies that went bankrupt with our tax dollars? Remember how all of those companies just happened to be democrat donors? Remember how ObamaCare was jammed through Congress...because after all, we had to pass it to see what was inside? Remember the gift of GM stock to the UAW? Remember how the Rule of Law was usurped to force through the GM and Chrysler reorgs? If that last one doesn't scare the hell out of you, we really are wasting our time talking. Sorry dude, the instincts of this administration is just not something I'm comfortable with. And the whole slavering coverage provided by what passes for media today rather turns me off as well. You see, I did build what I have and I'm rather resistance to spreading my wealth around to chosen parasites via government dicktat. Thank you very much, I'll spread my wealth around on my own to those businesses that need and want my dollars.

Bush clearly had his failings, from my perspective, none worse than allowing himself to be pulled from his core values on spending. Shoot, in retrospect, even Donna Brazile, no Republican fan is ever there was one, clearly stated that Bush was true to his word on the Katrina cleanup. Now that "They" don't have to hate Bush and crew, the media is actually rather fond of them. He was a gentleman in the truest sense of the word. His family have proven themselves to be upstanding as well. Face it, Obama pales by comparison.

There's nothing the man says you can count on his meaning unless he's saying something nice about himself. 5) He's made racist comments about white people. Just to name one example, "That’s just how white folks will do you. It wasn’t merely the cruelty involved; I was learning that black people could be mean and then some. It was a particular brand of arrogance, an obtuseness in otherwise sane people that brought forth our bitter laughter. It was as if whites didn’t know that they were being cruel in the first place. Or at least thought you deserving of their scorn." 6) His whole campaign in 2012 revolved around telling people Mitt Romney was an awful human being because he had money. Meanwhile, Barack Obama is worth 10 million dollars. What a hypocrite! 7) He once picked his nose on camera. 8) "The same guy who lectured the country on the importance of civility after Gabrielle Giffords was shot also refers to people he disagrees with politically as 'teabaggers.'" 9) He ate a dog once which is just gross. 10) He actually said, "Thank you, Planned Parenthood. God bless you. " We’re talking about people who murder babies for a living and he’s asking God to bless that? What a despicable man. 11) He went to Jeremiah Wright's church for twenty years and considered the man his spiritual mentor even though his utterly vile former pastor is anti-white racist!

He's like a third string high school basketball player who thinks he should be playing in the NBA all-star game. 16) He's made an #$%$ of himself by publicly inserting himself into both the Henry Louis Gates arrest and the Trayvon Martin case when he should have just shut his big yap and let justice take its course. 17) He habitually demonizes successful people and businesses. 18) He actually told Hispanic Americans that Republicans WERE THEIR ENEMIES, "If Latinos sit out the election instead of saying, ‘We’re gonna punish our enemies and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us,’ if they don’t see that kind of upsurge in voting in this election, then I think it’s gonna be harder and that’s why I think it’s so important that people focus on voting on November 2." 19) America lost its AAA credit rating for the first time since 1917 on Obama’s watch and he blamed it on the Tea Party. Yes, seriously. 20) One out of every five Americans is on food stamps thanks to Barack Obama and in his mind, that's a good thing because it makes those people more dependent on the government and therefore likely to vote for the Democrats. 21) He decimated the American health care system with Obamacare, even though the American people didn't want it and the bill was universally opposed by every Republican in the House and Senate except Olympia Snowe, who later voted in favor of repealing it. 22) He once threw his own GRANDMOTHER.</Msg><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1367331332660</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 10:15:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367331406994-24</Id><Title>OBAMA ADMIN GAVE BOSTON TERORISTS OVER $1000000 IN WELFARE BENEFITS WHILE THESE TERORISTS WERE ON OBAMA'S WATCHLIST</Title><Msg>Obama admin gave boston terorists over $1000000 in welfare benefits while these terorists were on obama's watchlist</Msg><Username>who_eats_collard_greens</Username><Timestamp>1367331406994</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 10:16:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367331444599-25</Id><Topic><Title>London mayor blames Bush for Boston bombing attack</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1367330028225</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 09:53:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We real Americans.....those that are native born citizens.....feel the same way about obumble!!</Msg><Username>floodkid2003</Username><Timestamp>1367331444599</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 10:17:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367331456379-26</Id><Topic><Title>THIRTY REASONS TO DISLIKE OBAMA!</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1367331201607</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 10:13:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>23) Time and time again he has said and done things that indicate that he doesn't like America, is ashamed of the country and finds the whole nation to be slightly embarrassing. 24) Obama passed the DREAM ACT by fiat and illegally, unconstitutionally started the process of giving work permits to illegals. 25) There are Americans and Mexicans dead because of Fast and Furious and Obama is covering it up Nixon-style by asserting executive privilege. 26) He spends more time golfing and going on vacations than he does in meetings on economic policy. 27) He's spending so much money that it's almost singlehandedly destroying the economic future of America. One day, kids will be pointing to his picture when they're asked about the moment when the American dream began to die. 28) This is a man who demands credit for his "bipartisanship" while he says things like, "But I don’t want the folks who created the mess to do a lot of talking. I want them to get out of the way so we can clean up the mess. I don’t mind cleaning up after them, but don’t do a lot of talking.” What a jerk. 29) After it came out that the Korean rapper Psy had wished death not just on American soldiers, but their wives and children, Obama made a point of shaking his hand publicly even though the fact he was in the same room with him had been controversial. 30) Barack Obama may be the most crooked President ever to sit in the Oval Office. His campaign contributors at Solyndra got 535 million dollars they couldn't pay back and he broke the law to help his union cronies at GE and Chrysler while taxpayers lost 25 billion dollars on the deal. In a better, more honest world Obama would deserve to face possible JAIL TIME for what he did there.

Plans to release illegal immigrants in anticipation of looming budget cuts were announced earlier this week, but the report by The Associated Press detailed the policy had already taken effect and on a much larger scale. Citing federal documents, the agency said more than 2,000 illegal immigrants facing deportation had been released from immigration jails and plans exist to release 3,000 more people by the end of the month.

The GOP had better brace itself! The activists providing a huge amount of the labor and enthusiasm for Republican candidates are, at best, lukewarm on the party they’re voting for. Few are concerned about what their impact on the future of the GOP will be. The Tea Party cares more about what nominees believe than whether they can win—and compromising on politics means compromising on principle ..... AKA FRANK LUNTZ TALKING POINTS Two-thirds of Tea Partiers put themselves in the two most conservative categories on economic policy, social policy, and overall policy. Only 23 percent of non-Tea Partiers place themselves in the most conservative categories on all three issues; nearly 40 percent don’t locate themselves in the most conservative categories for any of the three policy areas. Most jarring: On some issues, like abolishing the Department of Education and environmental regulation, the establishment Republicans are actually closer to Democrats than they are to the Tea Party respondents. That’s a gap too large to be overcome by a few political action committees and gestures of goodwill. Tea Party activists dominate the Republican Party, and they’re no less willing to compromise with the GOP than they are with Democrats. FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe summed it up nicely in his book title: Hostile Takeover. Simply put, the GOP is too reliant on the Tea Party—and based on these survey results, the Tea Party doesn’t care about the GOP’s fate. It cares about moving the political conversation increasingly rightward.</Msg><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1367342595249</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 13:23:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367342708648-91</Id><Title>We cant afford egg hunts but...</Title><Msg>(Reuters) - Tens of millions of U.S. dollars in cash were delivered by the CIA in suitcases, backpacks and plastic shopping bags to the office of Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai for more than a decade, the New York Times says, citing current and former advisers to the Afghan leader.

Ayotte has stated that she voted against the measure because she believed it would place unnecessary burdens on citizens and gun owners who aren’t criminals. “It seems clear that Senator Ayotte needs a reminder that New Hampshire isn’t just a pro-gun state, it’s a pro-gun safety state,” said Judy Stadtman, the co-founder of NH Project for Safer Communities, of Portsmouth. “We will not forget that Senator Ayotte passed up a critical opportunity to do the right thing and make our communities safer.” Rabbi Robin Nafshi of Temple Beth Jacob pointed to tens of thousands of deaths by guns, including many children and at least 60 mass murders in recent years as a need for more background checks. She said most people, including NRA members, were supporters of expanded background checks. She pointed to the Torah that reminded followers to ensure that there were fences around a home’s roof so no one would fall off. Nafshi called for background checks and a national registry for all guns would provide such safety. “We know that the overwhelming majority of Americans and Granite Staters support these efforts as well,” she said. Bill Kingston, a veteran and gun owner, and a co-founder of New Castle Promise, a new organization that was started after the Sandy Hook shootings, called Ayotte a political hack who marched the party line even though she campaigned on going to Washington to clean things up. He said he was disgusted with her vote against the background checks. “We are horrified that the Constitution of the country that we fought for, myself in Vietnam, has been so twisted and tortured by the likes of Wayne LaPierre and the gun manufacturers he represents,” he said. “Responsible gun owners understand that all of our constitutional rights have limitations.”</Msg><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1367342709017</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 13:25:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367343212881-93</Id><Title>How many years did we listen to obama</Title><Msg>talk about rich not paying fair share and the middle class suffered because of it? opsie enjoy the two % tax middle class. how many times did he beat his fist on the pulpit before elections saying banks and wall street must pay? why no more of this talk after he was elected? idiots</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1367343212881</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 13:33:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367343357856-94</Id><Title>guant bay</Title><Msg>still open as we speak with a new million dollar soccer field and rec center.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1367343357856</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 13:35:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367343410659-95</Id><Title>I signed up to go to MARS !

The new television ad from the House Majority PAC featured a woman who says that she is a lifelong Republican but that she could not vote for Sanford because his betrayal of South Carolinians “is more than a mile long.” During the campaign, Colbert Busch had refused to bring up Sanford’s personal past. But that changed Monday during their debate in the race for state’s vacant 1st Congressional District seat. As Sanford stressed his efforts to rein in spending as a three-term holder of the congressional seat and a two-term governor, Colbert Busch reminded him that he once used taxpayer funds to “leave the country for a personal purpose” — referring to the extramarital affair with the Argentine woman, to whom he is now engaged.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1367347797220</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 14:49:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367347845221-124</Id><Topic><Title>Bammy always thinks he's the smartest in the room...</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1367345010053</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 14:03:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Best press report I've heard since Clinton, he's a marvelous president, PBS this morning reported that the Treasury paid $35 Billion on the national debt, first time in 6 years.
