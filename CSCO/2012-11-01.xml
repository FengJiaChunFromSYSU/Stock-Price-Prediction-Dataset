Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, Sen. Joe Manchin, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, and Rep. Nick Rahall expressed “outrage” at the EPA’s delay of a surface mining permit for Consol Energy. If the permit had been approved, the state would have seen thousands of new jobs created. This is all part of the Obama administration’s war on coal, declared during the 2008 campaign. I am incensed and infuriated that the EPA would intentionally delay the needed permit for a public-private project that would bring so many good jobs and valuable infrastructure to communities that so desperately need them," stated Machin. "The EPA has lost court case after court case for its overreach, and it should be using better judgment by now.” Consol will now be forced to fire some 145 people beginning December 30. "Instead of stalling and creating unnecessary impediments, we should be working together to put people to work, develop our infrastructure, and provide the low-priced energy that our country needs.

A New York tabloid newspaper, the Star, had obtained and published a set of photographs allegedly of Morris and the woman on a Washington, D.C., hotel balcony. News of the impending publication broke during the third day of the 1996 Democratic Convention. The Electronic Telegraph reported unverified claims that in order to impress the woman, S. Rowlands, Morris invited her to listen in on his conversations with President Clinton.[11][12][13] It was also alleged he had an illegitimate child from an affair with a Texas woman.[14] Morris resigned on the same day that Bill Clinton spoke and accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention. In his resignation statement, he said that "while I served I sought to avoid the limelight because I did not want to become the message. Now, I resign so I will not become the issue."[15] In his response, President Clinton praised Morris as a "friend", and thanked him for his years of service. Privately, several of Clinton's aides were furious that in his resignation statement Morris credited himself with helping the President "come back from being buried in a landslide" and that Morris ended by comparing himself to Robert Kennedy.[16]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351774345786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 08:52:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351774499192-20</Id><Title>Mitt Hate FEMA.....now Mitt Love FEMA....Mitt hate 47 % then Mitt Love 47%</Title><Msg>Mitt go away</Msg><Username>daleelama</Username><Timestamp>1351774499192</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 08:54:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351774655383-21</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Hate FEMA.....now Mitt Love FEMA....Mitt hate 47 % then Mitt Love 47%</Title><Username>daleelama</Username><Timestamp>1351774499192</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 08:54:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mitt let Detroit go bankrupt then, now Mitt I was for the bailout</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351774655383</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 08:57:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351774957984-22</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Hate FEMA.....now Mitt Love FEMA....Mitt hate 47 % then Mitt Love 47%</Title><Username>daleelama</Username><Timestamp>1351774499192</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 08:54:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YOU are a LIAR again.

Scarborough, you may recall, criticized Silver's math earlier this week, saying that "Anybody that thinks that this race is anything but a tossup right now is such an ideologue ... they're jokes." He was specifically talking about Silver's FiveThirtyEight website, which shows Mitt Romney with just a 1-in-4 chance of becoming president. RELATED: FiveThirtyEight Says Obama Is in Command ... For Now Silver has spent the week firing back, criticizing political pundits for not understanding how odds and probability work and aggressively defending his method against critics. As the week has progressed, his model has only shown Obama's chances of winning increasing, which has not coincidentally increased Silver's confidence in the outcome. (As of this morning, Five Thirty Eight gives Obama a 79 percent chance of winning, with a final Electoral College total over 300.) RELATED: People Who Can't Do Math Are So Mad At Nate Silver The back-and-forth swipes all came to head today with this tweet, with Silver offering a friendly $1,000 wager on Tuesday's result, with the winnings going to charity. .@joenbc: If you think it's a toss-up, let's bet. If Obama wins, you donate $1,000 to the American Red Cross. If Romney wins, I do.

And he's also clearly fed up with pundits who aren't willing to put anything on the line to back up their numerous predictions. RELATED: Chart: Foreign Policy Matters More to Presidential Approval Ratings Scarborough was not on the set of his MSNBC show this morning and has yet to respond, but he already has one wager riding on Tuesday's vote. Just yesterday, he agreed to a bet with Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod over their facial hair. (Axelrod will shave his mustache if Obama loses Michigan, Minnesota, or Pennsylvania.

Romney went on to say "we should overturn Roe v. Wade and return these issues to the states." He also said he would be "delighted" to sign a bill as president that would outlaw abortion, if there "was such a consensus in this country that we said we don't want to have abortion in this country at all, period." 2011: 'I Will Support Efforts to Prohibit Federal Funding for Any Organization Like Planned Parenthood' Since 2005, Romney has consistently said that he is "pro-life" and believes abortion should be legal only in the case "of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother." 2012: 'There's No Legislation With Regards to Abortion That I'm Familiar With That Would Become Part of My Agenda'</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351775950963</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 09:19:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351776041792-28</Id><Title>Interesting take on Cisco's earnings date</Title><Msg>Most of the big cap tech companies have already reported and many have given weak forecasts.

Let's just invent</Title><Msg>Editorial Romney Versus the Automakers Published: October 31, 2012 85 Comments When General Motors tells a presidential campaign that it is engaging in “cynical campaign politics at its worst,” that’s a pretty good signal that the campaign has crossed a red line and ought to pull back. Not Mitt Romney’s campaign. Having broadcast an outrageously deceitful ad attacking the auto bailout, the campaign ignored the howls from carmakers and came back with more. 2 American Automakers Rebut Claims by Romney (October 31, 2012) Aided by Growing Sales, Chrysler Profit Increases 80% (October 30, 2012) Times Topic: Auto Bailout Related in Opinion Let Detroit Go Bankrupt (November 19, 2008) Times Topic: United States Elections For Op-Ed, follow @nytopinion and to hear from the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, follow @andyrNYT. Mr. Romney apparently plans to end his race as he began it: playing lowest-common-denominator politics, saying anything necessary to achieve power and blithely deceiving voters desperate for clarity and truth. This started months ago when he realized that his very public 2008 stance against the successful and wildly popular government bailout of G.M. and Chrysler was hurting him in the valuable states of Ohio and Michigan. In February, he wrote an essay for The Detroit News calling the bailout “crony capitalism on a grand scale” because unions benefited and insisting that Detroit would have been better off to refuse federal money. (This ignores the well-documented reality that there was no other cash available to the carmakers.) When that tactic didn’t work, he began insisting at the debates that his plan for Detroit wasn’t really that different from President Obama’s. (Except for the niggling detail of the $80 billion federal investment.) That was quickly discredited, so Mr. Romney began telling rallies last week that Chrysler was considering moving its production to China. Chrysler loudly denounced it as “fantasies,” saying it was only considering increasing production in China for sale in China, without moving a single American job. “I feel obliged to unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China,” Chrysler’s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said in a statement. “Jeep assembly lines will remain in operation in the United States and will constitute the backbone of the brand. It is inaccurate to suggest anything different.” In fact, 1,100 new jobs will be added in Toledo to produce a new generation of Jeep. The Romney campaign ignored the company, following up with an instantly notorious ad saying President Obama “sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China.” If the false implication wasn’t clear enough, the campaign put out a radio ad on Tuesday saying “Barack Obama says he saved the auto industry. But for who? Ohio or China?” What happened, the ad asks, “to the promises made to autoworkers in Toledo and throughout Ohio?” What happened was that those promises were kept. Nearly 1.5 million people are working as a direct result of the bailout. Ohio’s unemployment rate is well below the national average. G.M.’s American sales continue to increase, and Chrysler said this week that its third-quarter net income rose 80 percent. These companies haven’t just bounced back from the bottom; they are accelerating. What Mr. Romney cannot admit is that all this is a direct result of the government investment he would have rejected. It’s bad enough to be wrong on the policy. It takes an especially dishonest candidate to simply turn up the volume on a lie and keep repeating it. By doing that in a flailing, last-minute grab for Ohio, Mr. Romney is providing a grim preview of what kind of president he would be</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351778438800</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:00:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351778506245-44</Id><Topic><Title>A look at Cisco's 2012</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1351767734786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 07:02:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are missing the POINT.

Romney keeps twisting but he can't get out of his new lie Neither campaign disputes the need for bankruptcy in the Chapter 11 sense. The crucial issue is whether Mr. Romney’s article was actually advocating something like bankruptcy in the Chapter 7 sense: appoint a trustee and liquidate. Rebecca Cook/Reuters The Chrysler Jefferson North plant in Detroit. In their final debate, President Obama and Mitt Romney offered different views of the 2009 automakers bailout. Mr. Romney may not have actually advocated Chapter 7 for G.M. or Chrysler, but his ideas about a “managed bankruptcy” might have lead to the same place. He has generally argued for a more traditional Chapter 11 case, without any direct government involvement. In his opinion article, he did suggest that the government might guarantee debtor-in-possession loans for the automakers. That would have been a perfectly viable plan in 2006 or early 2007, when syndicated debtor-in-possession loans were still widely available. These would have been very large loans, but it’s not impossible that they could have been arranged. The question is whether this would have been viable in late 2008 or early 2009, and there I think we have to say that the answer is plainly “no.” Traditionally, the top providers of debtor-in-possession loans have been financial institutions like Bank of America, GE Capital, Citigroup and Wachovia. Lehman Brothers also participated in a fair number of such loans. After Sept. 15, 2008, when Lehman filed for bankruptcy, none of these institutions were in a place to provide what would have been the largest debtor-in-possession loan ever in the case of General Motors. The only way the government guarantee would have changed this is if it were nothing more than a fig leaf, disguising what would have been for all intents a government-financed debtor-in-possession loan.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351779856280</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:24:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351780011021-56</Id><Title>poor Mitt</Title><Msg>sold out all of his integrity and if you believe his religion sold his soul to take second place, ouch!!</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351780011021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:26:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351780030973-57</Id><Topic><Title>Auto Bailout?

Share buyback MEANS NOTHING to shareholders if the shareprice goes NOWHERE for years. You should do a little research into Cisco's history, since by reading your comments you have had very little experience in this stock. BILLIONS have been spent on buybacks with only a DENT in reducing share count since a lot of it gets eatin up in OPTIONS granted to insiders. If you are a long term shareholder in Cisco you have seen NO RETURN for MANY years while Chambers and insiders have taken hundreds of MILLIONS in compensation over the same period. I'm ALL FOR compensation, but it should be based on company growth in conjunction with shareholder growth. You simply can';t continue to REWARD the insiders while the OWNERS get NOTHING or a paultry 1% dividend which just got raised to 3%.

They're wrong. Here's a taste of why: (Just a couple of) the Obama Administration's accomplishments: 1. The first bill President Obama signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to help women fight back when they don't get equal pay for equal work. 2. His Recovery Act supported millions of jobs and helped to stave off a second Great Depression. 3. He pushed for and won middle-class tax cuts that benefitted every American worker, and saved the typical family $3,600 in taxes over the last four years. 4. President Obama rescued the auto industry, and now GM and Chrysler are healthier than they've ever been. The American auto industry has added nearly a quarter of a million jobs since June 2009 -- and they most likely wouldn't exist right now without President Obama's leadership. 5. He doubled funding for Pell Grants, helping to make college more affordable for nearly 10 million families. 6. His student loan reform ended billions in subsidies to banks serving as middlemen and reinvested those savings directly into students. 7. The President established the American Opportunity Tax Credit, worth up to $10,000 over four years of college. 8. His Race to the Top Initiative helped spur nearly every state to raise academic standards. 9. His tax cuts, social-welfare programs, and economic policies lifted nearly 7 million Americans above the federal poverty line in 2010. 10. President Obama has signed 18 tax cuts for small businesses since taking office. 11. We've seen 5.2 million new private-sector jobs over the last 31 months. 12. The unemployment rate is at the lowest level since President Obama took office. 13. Health care reform -- passed after decades of failed attempts by every previous President -- provides affordable health coverage to every American and will lower premiums by an average of $2,000 per family by 2019. 14. Obamacare expanded access to lifesaving preventive care such as cancer screenings and immunizations with no out-of-pocket costs for 54 million Americans. 15. Obamacare ends insurance discrimination against the 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. 16. Because of Obamacare, over 3 million more young adults have health insurance today than would if the new law hadn't passed. 17. The parents of over 17 million children with pre-existing conditions no longer have to worry that their children will be denied coverage. 18. President Obama has ordered the overhaul of federal government regulations to make them smarter, practical, and more efficient. Just a fraction of these commonsense initiatives will help save businesses $10 billion in the next five years alone. 19. His historic investments in clean energy have helped more than double the amount of electricity we obtain from wind and solar sources and helped increase biofuel production to its highest level in history. 20. President Obama is doubling fuel efficiency standards, which will save drivers more than $8,000 at the gas pump, not to mention lessen the impact of automobiles on our environment. 21. President Obama has taken unprecedented action to address climate change, reaching historic international agreements to curb carbon emissions, and taking action here at home to reduce carbon pollution from our vehicles and promote clean energy production. 22. He has taken historic action to protect our environment -- signing one of the largest expansions of protected wilderness in a generation and putting in place standards to reduce toxic air pollution that will save thousands of lives. 23. President Obama fought for and won landmark Wall Street reform that reins in the abuses that led to the financial crisis and ends the era of taxpayer bailouts and "too big to fail." 24. Wall Street reform created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the nation's first federal agency focused solely on consumer financial protection -- and the Bureau is already protecting families from unfair and abusive financial practices from Wall Street banks and shadowy corners of the financial industry. 25. As part of President Obama's commitment to transparency, the White House has posted its visitor records online for the first time ever. 26. President Obama's all-of-the-above approach to energy has helped cut the United States' dependence on foreign oil to its lowest level in 20 years. 27. President Obama responsibly ended the war in Iraq. 28. He announced a plan to end the war in Afghanistan and transition security responsibility to the Afghan people. 29. President Obama sent the largest security assistance package to Israel in history and funded the Iron Dome system, which is protecting Israeli homes and schools from rocket attacks. 30. President Obama rallied the international community to implement the toughest sanctions on Iran in history. 31. Through the President's historic increases in Veterans Affairs funding, he has expanded and improved healthcare and job training access for our returning veterans. 32. President Obama negotiated the New START Treaty with Russia to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in both countries. At the same time, he also secured commitments from dozens of other countries to lock down nuclear materials. 33. His administration naturalized 11,146 military service members as U.S. citizens in 2010; more than in any year since 1955. 34. President Obama set a bold new plan for the future of NASA space exploration, using the skill and ability of the private sector for short trips to the International Space Station, while building a new vehicle for exploration of distant space, and doing everything in his power to support the economy on Florida's Space Coast. 35. President Obama recognizes that tourism is one of America's largest economic engines; he's worked to encourage international visitors to come here, maintaining our security while keeping millions of Americans in good, paying jobs. 36. He has affirmed his personal support of marriage equality, directed the Justice Department to stop defending DOMA in federal courts, and took the practical and compassionate step of extending hospital visitation rights to same-sex partners. 37. He fought for and won the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, allowing gay and lesbian members of the military to serve openly for the first time in history. 38. When Congress failed to fix our broken immigration system, his administration did everything in its power to improve it, streamlining the legal immigration process and announcing a policy that lifts the shadow of deportation from hard working young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. 39. Oh, and he gave the order to send troops in after Osama Bin Laden -- and has decimated al-Qaeda's senior leadership.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351782851377</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 11:14:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351783127733-74</Id><Title>WSJ: President Romney wins with at least 279 electoral votes</Title><Msg>In his column in The Wall Street Journal, Rove said the Republican presidential candidate is winning at every level of the numbers game, “from polling data to early voting.” Republican strategist Karl Rove predicts Mitt Romney will win the election with at least 279 electoral votes and probably more.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351783127733</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 11:18:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351783146355-75</Id><Topic><Title>Auto Bailout?

This beat expectations of 131,000 but is lower than the previous reading of 158,000 (which has been revised downwards to 114,000 which was actually 88,000). This is the most jobs added in eight months. This is especially welcome news after the ADP revision showed that since February 2012, 402,000 fewer jobs were created than previously thought. ADP wanted to be more consistent with BLS for employment numbers, so the downward revision that makes this week’s increase look even higher is indeed consistent with BLS. Meanwhile, Challenger US Job Cuts Announcements rose to 11.6% YoY in October after a prior reading of 70.8% in September. Initial jobless claims came in at 363,000, lower than the expectation of 370,000. This is down 9,000 from the previous week. It is down from the prior week’s reading of 369,000 which was revised upwards to 372,000. Jobless claims are back to February 2012 levels, not much progress. Flash PMI was just released and it has dropped to 51.0. Bad trend. So, ADP shows a large increase after a major downward revision, and initial jobless claims show a decline after a revision upwards.

In the closing days of the 2012 election, “Mittmentum” is waning as swing state numbers and bungled campaign events combine to hurt Romney in must-win states in advance of Tuesday. First up, Wednesday's swing-state polls should be making folks in Romneyland very nervous. Obama has gained in seven of nine crucial states, including massive gains in the three most important swing states: Virginia, Florida, and Ohio. Romney is at his lowest since before the first debate, barely breaking the mid-40s in many states he must win for a shot at the White House.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351784641564</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 11:44:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351784736676-89</Id><Title>Meanwhile in the real world</Title><Msg>Romney’s re-named Ohio campaign event fooled nobody. By “canceling” his campaign stop in Ohio, only to hold a “Sandy Charity Relief” event in the same place, with the same agenda, and the same speakers, looks like the kind of underhanded “win-at-all costs” politics that hurts Romney in the polls. No voter is buying the story that the best place to hold a Hurricane Sandy relief event was a political rally in Ohio. Moreover, the fact that the “charity event” consisted of the Romney campaign buying $5,000 worth of goods to set up as props, despite the fact that the Red Cross explicitly asked for cash and not canned goods, only highlighted the political focus of the event. The hits for Romney didn’t stop there. In press conferences following Sandy’s making landfall, Romney was forced to doggedly dodge questions about his statements during the Republican primary in which he promised to gut FEMA and eliminate federal disaster relief. Meanwhile, former Bush FEMA head Michael Brown’s critique of Obama’s response to Sandy as “too quick” only served to remind voters what happened the last time a Republican President ran disaster relief. By contrast, GOP Governor Chris Christie’s praise for Obama’s leadership and support in the aftermath of Sandy only served to underscore the point, painting Obama as a competent leader while throwing Romney no bones at all. Finally, as if all of this news weren't bad enough, Romney stepped on his own toes again by running a shockingly misleading ad about the auto bailout in Ohio that generated an immediate backlash. The ad was slammed by the media for its dishonesty and even elicited a statement from Chrysler Group CEO Sergio Marchionne, in which he called the ad’s claims “a leap that would be difficult even for professional circus acrobats” to make.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351784736676</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 11:45:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351784749987-90</Id><Topic><Title>How come GM pays no taxes?</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1351781223342</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:47:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what is good for GM is good for china.

John Edwards: "Serving on the Intelligence Committee and seeing day after day, week after week, briefings on Saddam's weapons of mass destruction and his plans on using those weapons, he cannot be allowed to have nuclear weapons, it's just that simple.

Earlier in the week, one of the oldest and most respected polling firms in America -- Gallup -- produced results based on thousands of voter contacts indicating that Mitt Romney is leading in national early voting by roughly six percentage points. Last night, another venerable polling outfit confirmed Gallup's findings with a survey of its own. From Pew Research: The Pew Research Center survey found that the race is even among all likely voters nationwide (47% Obama, 47% Romney). Unlike the last campaign, the race also is close among voters who say they have already voted. In the poll, conducted Oct. 24-28, 19% of likely voters say they have already voted; that is unchanged from the same week in the 2008 campaign (Oct. 23-26, 2008). Currently, Romney holds a seven-point edge among early voters (50% to 43%); because of the small sample, this lead is not statistically significant. At this point four years ago, Obama led John McCain by 19 points (53% to 34%) among early voters. The overall sample was roughly 1700 voters, only about half the size of Gallup's pool, but resulting in nearly the exact same early voting outcome. In this case, Romney by seven. Gallup found that Obama led McCain by 15 points in early tallies at this stage in 2008; Pew puts the gap at 19 points, so their 2012 numbers represent a 26-point swing to the GOP ticket. That's...not insignificant. But what about in the swing states? The Washington Post reports that Obama has the lead in most (but not all) of the contested battlegrounds, but that Romney is hugely outpacing McCain's 2008 numbers. In brief, Republicans are narrowing the gap in Nevada, North Carolina and Iowa (where one new state poll gives Romney a slight overall lead, while another shows Obama winning). Romney is doing quite well in Colorado, where the GOP is actually leading Democrats, very much unlike last cycle. In Florida, Democrats have a small edge in the early totals, but nowhere near their 2008 levels: Democrats hold a narrow lead (43 percent to 41 percent) and are not on pace to match their 46-37 advantage from 2008. We are through four days of the eight-day period for in-person early voting, and while Democrats gained big on the first two days (Saturday and Sunday), they were unable to keep that pace on Monday and Tuesday. Democrat netted 73,000 vote from the first two days, but gained 28,000 votes on Monday and just 16,000 votes on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Republicans keep building their absentee lead, which stands at 70,000 votes. While Democrats won the combined early vote (absentee plus in-person) by more than 360,000 votes in 2008, they currently lead by about 49,000. That edge will grow over the next four days as Democrats build their in-person early voting lead (many more people vote in-person than absentee), but it’s unlikely to approach anywhere near 360,000. The Romney campaign said today that they expect to win Florida's election day voters by double digits. In Virginia, counties that Obama won last time have seen a dramatic drop-off in absentee balloting; absentee "turnout" in Republican areas has slowed a bit, but not as much as Democrat territory. Finally, there's Ohio. Public polling shows Obama with a large lead, but there's no way to verify that. Republicans say the raw numbers don't bear out that big Obama advantage: “The Gallup numbers nationally confirm what we think is happening here in Ohio,” says one Romney official. “It’s two things. One, their margin of victory in early voting is greatly diminished — drastically diminished. And two, they are having a very difficult time generating enthusiasm among young people.” Asked for evidence to support those claims, the official cited a Romney tally showing absentee and early voting is ten percent higher in counties McCain won in 2008 than in counties Obama won. He also pointed to sluggish early voting in the Toledo area, which Obama won in ’08, and particularly energetic early voting in the Cincinnati area, which McCain won. In addition, the official argues that Republicans are “outperforming our share of voter registration in absentee requests and early votes” and that the GOP has “closed the gap on Democrats’ historical absentee and early vote advantage for 20 of the past 21 days.” Has that gap closed enough to stem Obama's pre-election day tide and tee up a Romney win at the ballot box day-of? The answer to that question, ladies and gents, may very well determine the 2012 presidential election. One alternate route to 270 for Romney involves Wisconsin, which was tied as of late last week. Then came Marquette's latest poll, which shows Obama ahead by eight -- a seven-point jump in approximately one week. Wisconsin insiders smell a sampling rat. Even so, just when you think Wisconsin may be slipping away (I've heard the opposite from folks on the ground there, by the way), an elected Democrat says this: Hancock even broke news on that Wisconsin trip, telling voters if the election were to be held right now the president would lose Wisconsin and its coveted 10 electoral votes. ... “We have not turned out the vote early,” Hancock told the newspaper. “The suburbs and rural parts of Wisconsin – the Republican base – are voting. President Obama’s base has yet to go vote. We’ve got to get our people to go vote.” No, no! False, protests Team Obama. I guess we'll wait and see won't we?

With Obama leading in Wisconsin by 5-8 points, it looks like Paul Ryan has failed to do the running mate's main job: bring in your home state. In Ohio, four new polls show Obama leading by an average of 3.8%. Obama is also leading in Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. Two of the three polls put him ahead in Virginia and he is essentially tied in Florida and Colorado. It appears that Romney's post-debate momentum has now stopped, If the current numbers continue to hold over the weekend, the popular vote could be close but Obama is likely to win the electoral college because he needs to win only a few of the big swing states whereas Romney needs to win them all.

Even 2/3 of those voters who support Mitt Romney give Obama credit for doing a fine job. These results are from the latest WaPo/ABC poll.

President Obama’s team takes refuge in public state polling and declares it can pull out a close electoral vote win. Mitt Romney’s team looks at voter intensity, early voting and Romney’s lead among independents and concludes he will win. If you believe Obama and state polling, the electorate will look like 2008; if you take the other view, 2012 won’t resemble 2008. Romney’s team is getting some confirmation from early voting reports, which suggest we are a far distance from 2008. Pew reports: “The Pew Research Center survey found that the race is even among all likely voters nationwide (47% Obama, 47% Romney). Unlike the last campaign, the race also is close among voters who say they have already voted. In the poll, conducted Oct. 24-28, 19% of likely voters say they have already voted; that is unchanged from the same week in the 2008 campaign (Oct. 23-26, 2008). Currently, Romney holds a seven-point edge among early voters (50% to 43%); because of the small sample, this lead is not statistically significant. At this point four years ago, Obama led John McCain by 19 points (53% to 34%) among early voters.” Gallup finds Romney up among early voters by a similar margin (52 to 46 percent). In 2008 Obama had an advantage of 55 to 40 percent. What about actual early voting? In Virginia, Obama is also running well behind 2008. Dave Wasserman of Cook Political Reports tells us that early voting is down 13.6 percent in Obama strongholds and down only 1.7 percent in GOP strongholds. In Colorado Republicans are ahead in early voting. In Nevada Democrats retain an early voting advantage, but again the margin is substantially down from 2008. In yesterday’s Romney campaign conference call, the campaign’s pollster and political director put out a raft of information: In Florida, [Richard] Beeson noted that of 2 million early votes cast, Democrats held an edge by fewer than 40,000 ballots — a 70 percent drop from 2008. In Ohio, comparing county results in early voting from 2008 with those of today, turnout was significantly better for Republicans, he said. In Iowa, he said that Republicans prefer to vote on Election Day, and that Democrats need to bring an early voting lead of 130,000 to the polls on Election Day in order to win. Republicans are over-performing in early voting in 71 of 99 counties from 2008, making it less likely that Obama would reach the margin needed. Other swing states showed similar patterns, and Republicans seemed to be leading in early and absentee voting in Colorado. Beeson predicted “we will win on Election Day big” in North Carolina, which Obama has continued to avoid in recent weeks. In sum, there is considerable evidence from both polling of and actual early voting that the political landscape portrayed in a number of state polls showing an Obama lead in swing states doesn’t exist. If that improvement in early voting holds up, Democrats should wonder if those state polls in which they have been investing so much hope are even in the 2012 election ballpark. We’ll find out next week. Posted at 11:21 AM ET, 11/01/2012 Nov 01, 2012 03:21 PM EDT TheWashingtonPost Early voting buoys Romney By Jennifer Rubin There are two starkly different views of the race. President Obama’s team takes refuge in public state polling and declares it can pull out a close electoral vote win. Mitt Romney’s team looks at voter intensity, early voting and Romney’s lead among independents and concludes he will win. If you believe Obama and state polling, the electorate will look like 2008; if you take the other view, 2012 won’t resemble 2008. Romney’s team is getting some confirmation from early voting reports, which suggest we are a far distance from 2008. Pew reports: “The Pew Research Center survey found that the race is even among all likely voters nationwide (47% Obama, 47% Romney). Unlike the last campaign, the race also is close among voters who say they have already voted. In the poll, conducted Oct. 24-28, 19% of likely voters say they have already voted; that is unchanged from the same week in the 2008 campaign (Oct. 23-26, 2008). Currently, Romney holds a seven-point edge among early voters (50% to 43%); because of the small sample, this lead is not statistically significant. At this point four years ago, Obama led John McCain by 19 points (53% to 34%) among early voters.” Gallup finds Romney up among early voters by a similar margin (52 to 46 percent). In 2008 Obama had an advantage of 55 to 40 percent. What about actual early voting? In Virginia, Obama is also running well behind 2008. Dave Wasserman of Cook Political Reports tells us that early voting is down 13.6 percent in Obama strongholds and down only 1.7 percent in GOP strongholds. In Colorado Republicans are ahead in early voting. In Nevada Democrats retain an early voting advantage, but again the margin is substantially down from 2008. In yesterday’s Romney campaign conference call, the campaign’s pollster and political director put out a raft of information: In Florida, [Richard] Beeson noted that of 2 million early votes cast, Democrats held an edge by fewer than 40,000 ballots — a 70 percent drop from 2008. In Ohio, comparing county results in early voting from 2008 with those of today, turnout was significantly better for Republicans, he said. In Iowa, he said that Republicans prefer to vote on Election Day, and that Democrats need to bring an early voting lead of 130,000 to the polls on Election Day in order to win. Republicans are over-performing in early voting in 71 of 99 counties from 2008, making it less likely that Obama would reach the margin needed. Other swing states showed similar patterns, and Republicans seemed to be leading in early and absentee voting in Colorado. Beeson predicted “we will win on Election Day big” in North Carolina, which Obama has continued to avoid in recent weeks. In sum, there is considerable evidence from both polling of and actual early voting that the political landscape portrayed in a number of state polls showing an Obama lead in swing states doesn’t exist. If that improvement in early voting holds up, Democrats should wonder if those state polls in which they have been investing so much hope are even in the 2012 election ballpark.

We knew before with Condeleeza Rice’s memo in August 6th when it stated right in the memo: “Bin Laden to steal planes and run them into buildings.” And more stuff is coming out now also, how much the Bush administration ignored the intelligence.

New Hampshire's latest polls show Romney slamming Obama in that state and in Iowa. Colorado has become Romney's to lose and even Nevada is showing signs of 'Romney is Best'.... Ohio remains tied, Wisconsin has a slight edge for Obama but these are now irrelevant. The switch of Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Hampshire close the door on Obama's Ohio strategy, although Romney leads by such large numbers in rural Ohio, it seems inevitable there will be a landslide for Romney and he wins with 330 electoral votes.

LOL are there two Mayor Bloombergs Rhonda? Or perhaps it's just the lame stream media that reported it wrong, LOL just to funny. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed President Obama over Mitt Romney on Thursday, saying he believes Obama is a leader on climate change, which Bloomberg suggested was a contributor to the damage wrought on his city by Hurricane Sandy this week. “Over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks,” Bloomberg wrote on his website. “His administration also has adopted tighter controls on mercury emissions, which will help to close the dirtiest coal power plants (an effort I have supported through my philanthropy), which are estimated to kill 13,000 Americans a year.” Bloomberg is an independent who has been registered as both a Democrat and a Republican. He ran for mayor in 2001 as a Republican but has been unenrolled since 2007.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351803414316</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 16:56:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351803470125-187</Id><Topic><Title>NO DOUBT, OBAMA IS A FRAUD !</Title><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1351802211794</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 16:36:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But Romney is an etch-a-sketch twit.

According to the newest poll by Public Policy Polling, President Obama is leading Mitt Romney by five points in Ohio, crossing the important 50 percent threshold, holding a 50 to 45 percent lead over the former CEO of Bain Capital. The PPP also reports that President Obama is leading Romney in Wisconsin, 51 to 46 percent. Wisconsin was a state that Republicans hoped would flip to Romney after Paul Ryan was brought on board as the Vice Presidential nominee. In the important swing state of Iowa, the PPP also has the president with a 50 to 45 percent advantage. A new poll by the Detroit News/WDIV-TV has President Obama leading in Michigan, 48 to 42 percent, up three points from last month. Mitt Romney has tried to change the narrative regarding the auto industry bailout, but the majority of voters in Michigan seem to approve of how the president handled the situation. In the new Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist poll, President Obama is ahead by six points in Iowa, 50 to 44 percent and is holding on to a small lead in New Hampshire, 49 to 47 percent.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351803765945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 17:02:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351803906694-192</Id><Topic><Title>Meanwhile in the real world Obama is surging in the swing states</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351803765945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 17:02:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Forget it junior and you alter-ID, dumb.ivan.

Bidens comment about the Catholic church: " With regard to the assault on the Catholic Church, let me make it absolutely clear. No religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy--any hospital--none has to either refer contraception. None has to pay for contraception. None has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact. That is a fact." AND the church's response from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops: " This is not a fact. The HHS mandate contains a narrow, four-part exemption for certain "religious employers." That exemption was made final in February and does not extend to "Catholic social services, Georgetown hospital, Mercy hospital, any hospital," or any other religious charity that offers its services to all, regardless of the faith of those served."

Rasmussen has us up by two. So do some internal polls. But with the variation in turnout motivation and the undecided going against the incumbent, we should win by more than that. • Iowa (6) Ditto. Latest polls have us one ahead. • NH (4) Rasmussen has us up by two but probably more than that given turnout and undecided voters. • Pennsylvania (20) Our ace in the hole! We are outspending Obama 6:1 here. Partly because of your donations to Super PAC for America (Michael Reagan’s outfit). Give some more! Last night’s poll had us ahead by two in Pennsylvania. If we lose Ohio, Pennsylvania will put us over the top. • Wisconsin (10) Rasmussen has it tied at 49-49. We have a great organization here that won the recall contest against Gov Walker. I bet we win here. Now the focus of a major Romney effort. • Minnesota (10) Believe it or not, coming within range. Just a few points behind and a lot of money going in there this weekend. • Michigan (15) We should be closer here than we are. Lots of new money going in over the weekend, but we have faded a bit here. Overall: Likely a 5-10 pt Romney win and above 300 electoral votes.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351819808275</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:30:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351820547723-266</Id><Title>Clint Eadstwood on FOX News (now)</Title><Msg>Clint blows away libtards.

Officials in Washington monitored events through message traffic and a hovering U.S. military drone but did not interfere with or reject requests for help from officials in the line of fire, the official said. The information emerged as officials made available on Thursday a timeline chronicling the U.S. response to the Benghazi attacks in which Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and three other American officials died. The material appears to refute claims by critics that officials in Washington delayed sending help to the besieged personnel.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351821010140</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:50:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351821469743-269</Id><Topic><Title>Clint Eadstwood on FOX News (now)</Title><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1351820547723</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:42:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>couldn't find a link to a video.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351821469743</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:57:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351821815867-270</Id><Title>Hope Georgie Bush Remembers to Check on My Tax Dodging Cayman Investments</Title><Msg>While Georgie Bush is at the Cayman Ritz-Carlton giving a speech on US tax dodging.</Msg><Username>roboromney_version_2012</Username><Timestamp>1351821815867</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:03:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351821859205-271</Id><Title>I'M LIFETIME UNEMPLOYED PARTIER PARENTS PAY MY BILLS, IM VOTING OBAMA</Title><Msg>I'm lifetime unemployed democrat partier. my parents pay all my bills, i never ever want to work for money so i'm voting obama. all my brothers and sisters are above age 60 and have never wanted a job and living with my parents too and are voting obama for the welfare checks that my parents get.</Msg><Username>im_60_parents_pay_my_bills</Username><Timestamp>1351821859205</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:04:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351822070169-272</Id><Topic><Title>I'M LIFETIME UNEMPLOYED PARTIER PARENTS PAY MY BILLS, IM VOTING OBAMA</Title><Username>im_60_parents_pay_my_bills</Username><Timestamp>1351821859205</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:04:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My five sons each have $5 million trust funds that I gave them to spend on a lifetime of partying.</Msg><Username>roboromney_version_2012</Username><Timestamp>1351822070169</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:07:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351822511219-273</Id><Title>WITHOUT OBAMA MANAGING EVERY DETAIL SEAL TEAM 6 DOOMED TO FAIL</Title><Msg>Without obama managing every detail seal team 6 doomed to fail obama is the only president who has the ability to tell 20 seals what to do in real time at the same time during a raid.</Msg><Username>im_60_parents_pay_my_bills</Username><Timestamp>1351822511219</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:15:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351822812206-274</Id><Title>My BAIN Pays Me $20 Million Each Year for Shipping 10,000 JOBS to CHINA</Title><Msg>So please VOTE for ME because I KNOW how to RUiN companies while raking in $250 MILLION to my CAYMAN and SWISS banks.</Msg><Username>roboromney_version_2012</Username><Timestamp>1351822812206</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:20:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351822943844-275</Id><Title>Did I Mention FIAT Is Investing $6 BILLION in OHIO to Ship Jobs to CHINA</Title><Msg>That's what I read on my rightwing BLOG.</Msg><Username>roboromney_version_2012</Username><Timestamp>1351822943844</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:22:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351823031275-276</Id><Title>OBAMA CAMPAIGN WORKER ARRESTED FOR SEXUALLY ASSAULTING YOUNG GIRL</Title><Msg>OBAMA CAMPAIGN WORKER ARRESTED FOR SEXUALLY ASSAULTING YOUNG GIRL From the Denver Post news website: "An Obama re-election organizer is facing charges that he "grabbed" a Loveland woman's breasts while giving her a campaign sticker on Tuesday, police said.
